Having flown two previous missions to Minmus, I was looking for a new challenge. I spent some time on the weekend planning and I flew the mission this evening. Here are the results:\n\nI flew a \u0027grand tour\u0027 of Kerbin\\\u0027s system of moons. I didn\\\u0027t enter orbit around any of them. I just did fly-bys. I planned my trajectory such that I\\\u0027d reach Minmus near the descending node. That way I would minimise the out-of-plane manoeuvres required and use less fuel. \n\nPer the requirements of this challenge, my initial TMI burn resulted in a 200.3 km x 11893 km orbit about Kerbin. This resulted in the boys entering the Mun\\\u0027s SOI just shy of 5 hours after the TMI burn. The resulting Munar periapsis was within 200 km of the surface. \n\nFrom there, they were ejected into an inter-moonar trajectory that intercepted Minmus about 17.5 hours later. An orbital trim manoeuvre was required enroute between the Mun and Minmus to lower the Minmus periapsis, but otherwise the original TMI burn was sufficient to reach Minmus. Another burn was required as I neared Minmus periapsis to prevent the mission from escaping Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI, and to return it instead to Kerbin.\n\nInterestingly, reaching Minmus this way actually used more fuel than I used during my previous two missions to Minmus. In those missions, I bypassed the Mun and went there directly from LKO. In this case, the gravitational assist from the Mun was sufficient to put the spacecraft on a Kerbin escape trajectory. That energy had to be dissipated with an ~200 m/s burn at Minmus periapsis if the mission was to return to Kerbin. Had I entered Minmus orbit from my inter-lunar trajectory, I would have required even more Delta-V (on the order of 300 m/s). That\\\u0027s substantially more than when I\\\u0027d previously entered Minmus\\\u0027 SOI from a highly elliptical orbit about Kerbin. \n\nScreen shots are attached:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Starting with a fresh Persistence file...

Having thought about it a bit, I think it should be possible with some minor tweaks to this trajectory.\n\nPH.\n\nEdit: Added paragraph explaining what my next project will be."},{"CreatedByName":"HOC","CreatedById":4374,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-05T08:38:27Z","Content":"Nice log there PakledHostage, I might well try to recreate your mission just simply because it\\\u0027d be one of the most advanced mission I\\\u0027d have ever done.

In my Kerbal\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s parallel universe, the map view is displayed on the wall at mission control. The trajectory on it is computed from data acquired from ground radar stations and onboard IMUs. The data isn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t accurate enough to usefully predict an orbital trajectory beyond the next celestial body encounter. The trajectory display has to be updated as the mission progresses and orbital trim burns need to be accomplished to keep the mission on course. (This is the same reason I don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t use MechJeb; it provides more accurate orbital parameters than could be determined from the data that my Luddite Kerbal\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s instruments can provide.)\n\nMy Kerbal\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s civilisation is also rather cash strapped. While they value space exploration, they don\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t have the financial resources to fly large numbers of missions. And public support for the space program would dry up if their Kerbal astronaut heros were always being killed in mission failures. I\\\u0027m kinda chuffed that, while I have only flown four missions to Minmus (one to Minmus orbit, one to Minmus landing and two fly-by missions), I haven\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t aborted or lost a single Minmus mission. Careful planning has made this possible. \n\nThe objective for this fourth flight to Minmus was to fly a \u00E2\u20AC\u0153grand tour\u00E2\u20AC of Kerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s system of moons and return to Kerbin with minimal fuel burn. Starting with a fresh persistence file, the plan was:\n\n- Wait in a 200 km high circular parking orbit until 1:19:39:00 MET.\n\n- While waiting, adjust the orbit so that the centre of the Mun\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s disk crests the horizon as close as possible to 1:19:39:00 MET.\n\n- TMI burn at the instant that the Mun\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s disk crests the horizon. Burn at 100% throttle to 2871 m/s at 201.5 km. This results in a 200.3 km x 11180 km orbit about Kerbin that intercepts the Mun\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s SOI.\n\n- Trim the trajectory for a 295.6 km Munar periapsis.\n\n- Munar periapsis at 2:00:52:00, at 615.5 m/s.\n\n- Munar gravitational assist results in a 7753 km x 54964 km orbit about Kerbin\n\n- Minmus fly-by at 3:14:14:00\n\nThis trajectory relies upon the Mun and Minmus being separated by an angle of 77.7 degrees at the time of Munar periapsis. An error of \u00C2\u00B17.5 minutes here results in an error of \u00C2\u00B11 degree, which would have to be corrected with an orbital trim manoeuvre. Given that my Kerbal astronomy is probably only accurate to this tolerance, I figure this degree of error is inevitable. \n\nHere are the screen shots:\n\n\u003E ![NGngY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NGngY.jpg)\n\n\u003E ![uA7Os.png](http://i.imgur.com/uA7Os.png)\n\n\u003E ![ajOXN.png](http://i.imgur.com/ajOXN.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Arriving at the Mun 6 minutes 35 seconds earlier and about 7 m/s faster than planned.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bvUT5.png](http://i.imgur.com/bvUT5.png)\n\n\u003E ![KGjQl.png](http://i.imgur.com/KGjQl.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Arriving at Minmus 34 minutes earlier than planned.\n\u003E \n\u003E ![LOzxP.png](http://i.imgur.com/LOzxP.png)\n\n\u003E ![BfUzT.png](http://i.imgur.com/BfUzT.png)\n\n\u003E ![CWqXe.png](http://i.imgur.com/CWqXe.png)\n\n\u003E ![WfbQr.png](http://i.imgur.com/WfbQr.png)\n\nThe mission expended aprox 70 m/s Delta-V between the end of the TMI burn/trim and re-entry. The TMI burn was sufficient only to yield a 11180 km Kerbin apoapsis. About \u00C2\u00BD of the Delta-V used post-TMI was required to lower the Kerbin periapsis to a sub-atmospheric altitude after passing Minmus. Presumably this Delta-V is sufficiently small that it could be achieved with the EVApacks\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 that are being proposed for v0.16\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6 Maybe Jeb is has an interesting EVA trip in his future?
