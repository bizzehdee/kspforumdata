The F-106 Delta Dart there was designed in a wind tunnel and was the peak of technology in the 1960s, not to mention one of the hottest single engine fighters in the air for almost 20 years. \n\nNow that Ferrari, Ferrari have always taken a different approach to car design, they design their cars to be works of art AND functional, so they end up compromising somewhere in the middle and often coming up with works of fantastic art. If you want to see function over form, look at the Bugatti Veyron that thing is horrible looking, but it was designed in a wind tunnel, with no other job than to go fast, and stay on the ground. \n\n![YF-23_top_view.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/YF-23_top_view.jpg)\n\nThe YF-23, which to me was the REAL winner of that contest and the biggest mistake the Airforce made.

I\u0027d be happy to share this part with everyone - it makes for some really nice stockalike drop tanks!\n\u003E \n\u003E Dassault Rafale:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/KGvPL](http://imgur.com/a/KGvPL)\n\nDont forget to set the turbojets to 50%, and take pics to show this. But GREAT looking craft.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E sadly i have some problem with FAR. this is my first time using FAR and i\u0027m getting used to the additinal informations in the SPH (currently working on the body rule etc to smooth out the profil to get finaly supersonic)\n\u003E \n\u003E my two main problems are these: with SAS on, the jet keeps wiggling (sometimes a wobble to death). Is this normal? or a fault of poor design? my second question is: how to make the jet withstand high G-loads without braking apart? struting the hell out of it don\u0027t work ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E )\n\u003E \n\u003E here a picture of the current version, only modparts are the adjustable landinggears:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/d7VKzJM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/d7VKzJM.jpg)\n\nOk the problem of the SAS wobble is caused by over control of the craft, you will have to reduce the control surface angles to reduce this affect. The other option is to get the PID Tuner, that is what I use along with the reduction in control surface angles. I usually change the default angles from 20 to 12-15deg max depending on the surface, the position on the craft and the job. \n\nAnd my favorite shot of my new craft....\n\n![MDYQWt8.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MDYQWt8.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Darth Lazarus","CreatedById":60937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:22:50Z","Content":"can\u0027t upload the craft file right now, will do it later. but thank you very much for teh first ideas ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\ni will work on the plane body a bit more before posting it for your judgements and improvents ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"FourGreenFields","CreatedById":139309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:41:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E can\u0027t upload the craft file right now, will do it later. but thank you very much for teh first ideas ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E i will work on the plane body a bit more before posting it for your judgements and improvents ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIf you want to pull high Gs without falling apart, you\u0027ll want low wing loading (as this reduces the AoA required to pull Gs it will also reduce the ammounts of RUD), and high mass/strength for the wings.\n\nI\u0027m pretty damned sure it\u0027s area rule btw, not body rule"},{"CreatedByName":"CrisK","CreatedById":133945,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T17:57:39Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wqca1h8yx2d98c0/AADjiBn5F3dQgR4IoB-rJI8aa?dl=0) with the craft file(s) for my plane.\n\nThere\u0027s a sub-folder that contains parts for a stockalike drop tank and an ICBM body.
