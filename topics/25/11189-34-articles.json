But FINALLY after endless hours spent on refining it in to the New B sub version Aka, Falcon XIIIB Galaxy STOL its finally ready. It has a tad bit more fuel, two airospikes removed and a seventh NV-1 was added to reduce the need to fight gravity to save weight and fuel. New undercarriage, new and improved stabilizer, new cargo-bay floor and many many other changes that it took to balance the craft close to perfection and make it capable of taking 36\u002B tons to Duna.\n\nIt was trimmed down on redundant part but part count is probably as high or a bit higher still since that budget had to be spent else where to make it perfect.\n\nSo its a tad bit heavier but better balanced and overall a lot more capable and easier to fly then the first version. It pays of to not aim to high but rather perfect at a later stage then try to get it all right the first time.\n\nI went to Duna with a benchmark payload and landed not fare away from my Old Duna base that could not be resupply with jumbo tanks sens 0.21 but now with my 3:e Jumbo tank test delivery and with the final touches done to the B variant it seems perfectly capable of being a good Falcon X Jumbo replacement. The old Jumbo still has the tonnage advantage due to more engines and fewer parts but it cant land on Duna any more with almost twice the landing speed requirements.\n\nThe Falcon XIIIB Galaxy STOL had a takeoff tonnage of 204.95 tons and landed back at KSC just fine. I could have saved a lot more fuel if I had reentred earlier and didn\u0027t need to fly 1/4 around Kerbin but it only shows that its more then capable of the the task it was made for. Laythe is next. Only a test will prove if thats possible.\n\nI also think its one of my more beautiful crafts with its almost concord like style and long fuselage and narrow wing span. Requires proper balance but once I trimmed it in SPH it flies very stable and can even do 180 turns and loops fully loaded so its built to take abuse with in reason tough.\n\nShe is all stock like all my other crafts.\n\nCraft file is available here.\n\n[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27196441/SSTOs.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27196441/SSTOs.zip)\n\nIf you want to even try it out you MUST sett Delta Physics time to 0.03 at least, preferably edit settings.cfg and set it to 0.01 to have a chance of decent frame rates on a fast i5 or better cpu. But it is a CPU killer thats the down side. Lets hope we get bigger wings or something soon so part count can be at least halved.\n\nHere are all the pics of the flight.\n\n![j68o.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img13/1498/j68o.png)\n\n![10jq.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img5/8095/10jq.png)\n\n![owdt.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img845/4282/owdt.png)\n\n![a5bl.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img706/4613/a5bl.png)\n\n![qjt.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img202/935/qjt.png)\n\n![g9lh.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img43/6894/g9lh.png)\n\n![xdj.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img687/5219/xdj.png)\n\n![rfxa.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img17/463/rfxa.png)\n\n![wmgv.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img17/1806/wmgv.png)\n\n![qhqc.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img443/4384/qhqc.png)\n\n![66bg.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img826/99/66bg.png)\n\n![69t.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img513/599/69t.png)\n\n![tn0.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img197/463/tn0.png)\n\n![qa88.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img109/2425/qa88.png)\n\n![rvcn.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img32/8269/rvcn.png)\n\n![omcb.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img203/4201/omcb.png)\n\n![kwum.png](http://imageshack.us/a/img199/5566/kwum.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-26T15:15:41Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2013 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983**"},{"CreatedByName":"glacierre","CreatedById":63209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T14:55:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Been some time since I posted but It have taken some time to develop the Falcon XIII Galaxy STOL further since every new feature and capability adds to the complexity of altering and balancing it.
