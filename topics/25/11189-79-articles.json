My custom cockpit also looks rather snazzy, if I say so myself! On re-entry, I entered the atmosphere several times, gradually lowering me speed an apoapsis to prevent any major G-forces and heating effects. Once I entered for the final time, I used an extremely shallow trajectory to gradually bleed of speed very high up in the atmosphere (before heating kicks in) which was assisted by deploying large flaps at the rear of my craft, using a pair of air-brakes and making used of an extreme (45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) angle of attack.  \n  \nTO maximise my delta-v during the assent out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, I made use of what I like to call the \u0027**RAPIERspike**\u0027 engine.

The following is an account of the first publicised mission with their new craft, the Fletchinder.\n\nThe star-studded event had the original Kerbalnaut himself, Jebediah Kerman, on hand to ride aboard the craft. He was originally to relieve Valentina Kerman in her duties before the return, but was too busy taping GoPros to the external skin to care. \u0022The damn things nearly blew up in reentry, Jeb!\u0022 remarked rocket scientist and CEO Samniss Arandeen when he saw the charred cameras. However, the footage survived and was reportedly a KerbTube viral hit, prompting Arandeen to consider adding external cameras to the plane\u0027s future iterations.\n\nAAC lead engineer Bill Kerman aided up-and-coming pilot Valentina Kerman in guiding the spacecraft and making sure all systems functioned as intended. In addition, three of Kerbin\u0027s brightest scientific minds were dragged kicking and screaming cordially invited to participate in the flight, returning with only post-traumatic stress disorder fond memories and a little spacesickness. Says flight passenger Bob Kerman, \u0022I thought were going to hit [the Placeholder Station]!\u0022 Apprentice Scientist Molie Kerman agreed with the sentiment, \u0022Who the [EXPLETIVE] thought this mission was a good idea?\u0022, but says she\u0027s interested in helping to apply the lessons learned from the Fletchinder on future missions.\n\nThe mission did not go entirely to plan, however. Due to Valentina\u0027s inexperience and malfunctioning guidance software, the planned docking with a previously-launched Placeholder Station ran out of Reaction Control System fuel and was aborted. The mission would have seen Bill transfer two crates of stationbuilding supplies to the Placeholder. The scrubbed docking did not interfere with the landing, and the craft set down completely intact on Runway 09 of the Kerbal Space Center after nine hours in orbit.\n\nSpaceflight monitoring authority and anti-space-junk advocate Boolybooly has yet to comment on whether he approves of the craft or not. Samniss Arandeen already has one of Boolybooly\u0027s K-Prize awards for the now-obsolete \u0022[Mockingjay](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back?p=1736716\u0026viewfull=1#post1736716)\u0022 single-seater craft, but has said he wouldn\u0027t mind another one sitting in the lobby of the corporate office. \u0022Prospective clients of [AAC] will be reassured that we know what we\u0027re doing.\u0022\n\n**UPDATE: 3 AUG 2015** Boolybooly has considered the Fletchinder worthy of the K-Prize, and has shipped the trophy. In other news, the facade of Arandeen Aerospace Corporation has been completely dismantled to make way for the trophy\u0027s entrance.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Land on the Mun. Return to the piece of crap transport, dock and go back to the KSC with a sample. Only she\u0027s yet to survive the trip down... For this trip we kept the turbojets, still managed to get to the Mun with ease (didn\u0027t land) docked and survived.\n\nI need to tweak the reentry handling... Keep it at around 5 degrees nose up and it\u0027s okay. But as the atmosphere gets thicker she starts to wobble. Probably time to admit defeat and fit a rudder and some more vanes...\n\nThe quest continues...\n\nEdit: August 30- She\u0027s now completely capable of surviving reentry! \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
