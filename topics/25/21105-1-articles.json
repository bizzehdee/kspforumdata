I had several other maneuverable ships in orbit around the giant moon, and I tried to rendezvous and dock with with the doomed sub-orbital lander while it was at it\u0027s apoapsis, and boost it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WKPIj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WKPIj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt did not go well, because the craft I was using as a pusher didn\u0027t have enough power. (it was a three engine ion ship) but under different conditions, I imagine it could work. You have to dock really fast and be pointed prograde already, because your double-vessel won\u0027t be maneuverable enough while docked. You have to slow the pusher down to the speed of the sub-orbital craft and then turn it around really fast. It\u0027s not easy to do and your racing against the clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the only rules I\u0027m going to make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must do it on Tylo, Vall, or Mun, but Mun is less cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sub-orbital craft must weight at least 20 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sub-orbital craft may not exceed an orbital speed of half the body\u0027s escape velocity under it\u0027s own power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pusher craft must begin in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to use one of the docking mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry I\u0027m not posting my persistence file.
