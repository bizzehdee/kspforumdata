I looked at your craft myself. There are some hard and fast rules to supersonic aircraft in the real world. Number one of which is Bi-Planes don\u0027t work at supersonic speeds, this is why there are no supersonic biplanes anywhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it does increase the wing area it also doubles the amount of drag on the craft without actually providing that much more lift at those speeds. In comparison the F/A-106A vs your Manticore V2 in the pictures. At mach 4 and 10deg nose up, the 106 has a L/D of 5.23 while your V2 has a L/D of 1.55. The wing surface area of the 106 is only 99.9m2 while your V2 is over 172. There is a reason why the F/A-106A handles the way it does and it isn\u0027t even the best of my current SSTO Fighter craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest you check out some of the SSTOs in my thread linked in my sig, you will see how less is more in the way of SSTOs. And when I get around to uploading my current heavy lifter in testing you will see again how it isn\u0027t about the massive wing, but about the amount of drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JsgI84R.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JsgI84R.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E630tons and it can achieve orbit quite easily.

Try designs from others, see how they solved problems, learn from them, use best from each design and then create your own. But before you start to build craft, you should ask yourself for what purpose you are going to build it. Does it have to be light fighter/bomber plane or heavy lifter, or some kind jack of all trades ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHodo has explained one part of your question close enough. Thing that I wish to add is that is not more important wing lift or drag. Thing that matters is Lift/Drag ratio. There is two ways how to improve L/D ratio. One way to do it is to increase wing surface that provide more lift. Less obvious way is to reduce drag, that is what Hodo talk about. Small reduction to drag can have more influence on L/D ratio then higher lift, especially on high altitudes/supersonic speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is still cases when you will want large surface wings.On low altitudes large wing surface is great helper when you need to take off. You will need less thrust from engines to be able to takeoff and you can takeoff at lower speeds. You will notice most benefit from high wing spans on subsonic speeds and low altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach higher altitude you will have little benefit from lift because atmosphere is more rare and does not provide enough preasure difference to provide lift. From my test flights in this game it is somewhere between 8 to 12 km. It vary from plane to plane and carried payload. When you reach critical spot when you can\u0027t climb up on subsonic speeds, you need to accelerate to supersonic speed. When you do that and pass safely trough transition area, lift from wings in best cases is halved, more often it is 1/10 of lift on low altitude/subsonic speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt high altitudes/supersonic speeds, if you create craft with low drag, you will still have good L/D ratio that will help your plane to climb up. Because of supersonic/high altitude problems, there is two main ways to deal with it. One design aproach is to have little to non wing at all. Since they don\u0027t provide much lift, those are only unwanted weight and drag and most of time it was only used to help you with pointing nose in desired direction and nothing more. Wanderfound Kerbodyne fleet is good example of that kind of design, he mastered that aproach almost to perfection. However, there is limit to that design aproach - limit is engine TWR that still need to be above 1 or close to 1 to be able to reach orbit, also due to that limit planes like that can\u0027t carry much of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther design aproach is to use wing surface area to help you with climbing up your plane instead of raw power from engines. That is more demanding and not easy to understand design aproach. You need to experiment a lot until you find good wing shape and surface that will help you with lifting and don\u0027t add much drag and weight to craft. If you have larger wing surfaces on craft, you will want to use benefit from wing lift all times, not just to point craft nose to desired direction. One way to accomplish that is to make sure that your plane have positive L/D ratio at 0 degree of AoA, in case that your plane have neutral piching moment placed in center of FAR graph. Another, and I think more efficient way is to \u0022place\u0022 neutral piching moment in positive AoA, where wings produce most of L/D ratio. On most craft designs it is somwhere between 4 and 8 AoA degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Manticore plane it is in negative AoA area. Check FAR static analysis graph for -25 to \u002B25 AoA degree, not only 0 to \u002B25. Also check it for speeds 0.2 and 0.35 when you need to takeoff / land your plane and critical speeds like 0.7; 1.4; 2; 4; 6 mach.

His picture he shows in the above post is perfect for figuring out the FAR graphs. I often used to use trial and error to get my craft to work before, then I talked with NK and Ferram about those graphs and how to read them, now I get most of my craft to fly exactly the way I want them to before I even leave the SPH. Half of my early designs came from looking at other peoples designs and seeing how they worked, I even downloaded a few and tested them out. Once I figured out the basics I was able to start designing my own, the first ones were basic, then I started experimenting with new designs. I know one of my earliest designs I used for almost a year without changing the basics to it, it was the best SSTO cargo hauler I had made for a good while. I just kept streamlining the design, and cleaning it up. I think when I finally retired the Orca it was up to version J.

I don\u0027t know how you did it, but well done! It\u0027s hard to take off but when it gets into the air it\u0027s quite stable and easy to fly. TWR is a bit low but sufficient for the task. I like the fuel module functionality. It would be impossible to dock this thing without a detachable fuel tank. My biggest concern is part count. I\u0027m overclocking my CPU to 4.6 GHz and I had about a 2x slowdown in physics speed, so the amount of time it would take to actually use this ship makes it somewhat impractical, especially for someone without a nice gaming rig. I would suggest that the designer use B9 or P Wings and minimize strut use to significantly reduce part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my review for Wanderfound\u0027s Kerbodyne Wedgetail XXV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks great! The designer obviously put a lot of work into making this thing look good. I like that the designer exercised restraint by not making it so huge that it becomes impractical. However, there are two areas of improvement that I see. The craft is overpowered. It would be more efficient to use less engines and have a lower TWR without sacrificing very much on performance. Personally, I don\u0027t need my planes to climb at 45\u002B degrees. Stability is also an issue. There is an up-down wobble induced by SAS (which is hard to avoid because SAS is not optimized) but it could be improved. There was also a roll right-roll left wobble which can be eliminated entirely by redesigning the wing and tail. Check your stability derivatives. Some dihedral might help you here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not done reviewing yet, but so far my vote goes to the Wedgetail for best tanker because despite its issues its a lot more practical than the SSLSv3.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-30T20:51:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2014 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbimbibble\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T04:34:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA new review: \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Ekcs123, \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESporty Mk1. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93779-SSTO-Spaceplane-Airplane-Design-Contest-II-Akademy-Awards?p=1501186\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1501186\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...=1#post1501186\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cem\u003E, \u003C/em\u003Eunder consideration for both \u003Cem\u003EBest Sporty Pleasure Craft \u003C/em\u003Eand \u003Cem\u003EBest Non-space Aeroplane\u003C/em\u003E in the FAR categories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Challenges/Akademy%20Awards/Testing/Sporty/screenshot171_zpsf19370c6.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Challenges/Akademy%20Awards/Testing/Sporty/screenshot171_zpsf19370c6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot171_zpsf19370c6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s nothing offensive about the functional, broad-shouldered aesthetics, but they\u0027re not a selling point either.

Honestly, I think this organizing would give more aircraft and spaceplane designs a chance, and pit them only against other planes designed for similar purposes rather than comparing them to completely different aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
