A rocket that maintains a constant TWR of 1.7-2 during the entire flight is more efficient, but you have to constantly throttle down to keep that TWR the same during the entire flight. For someone relatively new to the game, it\u0027s much easier to just throttle to max and keep it there the entire flight (kinda what happens during real-world rockets too), which means rockets with lower TWR at launch are the right combination of efficient and noob-friendly. Plus the launch looks a lot more like a real rocket and it looks more.. epic. I think the Delta-IV lookalike is a very elegant design and I might actually start using it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T19:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations to the winner: sgt_fl\u003Cspan\u003Ea\u003C/span\u003Eyer! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Psycix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Psycix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think a higher TWR will allow for some more exotic (bad) gravity turns.

Gimbal \u0026amp; Capsule-torque should be more than enough. I ditched MJ months ago, just after a few tryouts (and i haven\u0027t considered MJ in design here) as i found out that MJ often chockes on too much control-authority. I personally therefore find it unusable. One needs about 3 times the struts when using MJ than when flying by hand (same goes for SAS,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeven not that bad).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI included RCS primarily to make things a little bit easier to control for a human, beginner pilot (I don\u0027t use it during ascent mostly, just a quick on - roll maneauver - off during launch). I think MJ does something very bad here to the craft. I usually had Booster ECO \u0026gt; 10k - even as I\u0027m starting to turn more-or-less immediately after clearing the pad. MJ must have messed up somehow all the dv of the craft - stage 6 (transfer) should have enough juice left for MOR-burn (\u0026gt;400 d/v after Transfer burn).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh - and BTW congratulations to the places 1-3.
