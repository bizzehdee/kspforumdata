Also do a low Kerbol dive, going below Moho\u0027s orbit in altitude. Bring your sunglasses!\n\n**Bonus Point**\n\nGet as low as you can on Jool\n\n**Rules**\n\nYou can build a mothership in LKO with as many launches as needed, but they must all leave as one ship\n\nThe ship must clearly be one mission\n\nYou can park the mothership in orbit of a planet and use the lander to visit the moons\n\nYou can do refueling missions if you run out of fuel\n\nTry to have fun, make a boat for Laythe, or fly around on Eve, or do something fun.\n\nYou will need to make a full mission report in the Mission Reports section of the forum, complete with pics, your science score, and humor.\n\nKerbals must land on all bodies in the solar system, and all must return safely\n\nQuicksaving and Quickloading are allowed\n\n**Mods:**\n\nI will be very lenient with mods, but before you start, you will need to post a list of the part mods you will be using. If a mod is too cheaty, then I will let you know. However, if you are using a mod with only *some* parts that are not allowed, you can tell me and I will ok it. \n\nAll informational and visual mods are allowed.\n\nDue to the nature of the scoring, mods that add science parts will not be allowed. You can place them on your ship, but they cannot be used for science.\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nEntries must be done in Science mode, and you are allowed to hack in science to fill the tech tree. Your score is total science gathered during the whole mission.\n\nIn order for your entry to be considered valid, you have to post a mission report in the Mission Reports section of the forum, and then PM me the link. I will post links to the mission reports here under the Pending Missions section, and another user must review them.\n\n**Pending missions:**\n\nNone so far\n\n**Completed Missions:**\n\nNone so far\n\n**Science Leaderboard**\n\n**1.**\n\n**2.**\n\n**3.**\n\n**4.**\n\n**5.**\n\n**6.**\n\n**7.**\n\n**8.**\n\n**9.**\n\n**10.**\n\n**One final word**\n\nIf you choose to do this challenge, don\u0027t do it *just* because it is a challenge on the forums. Do it for yourself. Do it to have fun. Otherwise, there\u0027s not really a point in playing KSP. You do this challenge because you choose to. If you *really* want to use a mod but it isn\u0027t allowed, go ahead and do it anyways.

This will be a lot more pronounced on Laythe and Eve, where you have to care about an atmosphere flipping your craft around, or just the problem of entering an atmopshere in the first place. There\u0027s plenty of vessels that should have worked but didn\u0027t.\n\u003E However: once a ship has proven itself capable of doing the trick on Tylo, we already know that it can also do it on Moho, Duna (1), Eeloo, and every other place except Eve and Laythe. I don\u0027t see the point in having to document this over and over again. That\u0027s a lot of busywork for... what gain, exactly?\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s why I suggested to limit this to Eve / Laythe / Tylo: once these three are taken care of, doing all the rest will be just more of always the same.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E * * *\n\u003E \n\u003E (1) yes, Duna as well.
