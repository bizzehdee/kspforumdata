Youve probbably seen his video on space elevators. And he came to the conclusion its a impossible concept in ksp. However ive got the twist to the challange.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo it on gilly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly has such low gravity kerbals can darn near jump into orbit. So my thought process was to take the gerder segments and weld them together end to end maby with a quad coupler for support. Cover it in ladders. Put a heavy object at the base of it. Ship it off to gilly and land it heavy end down. Now sense we all know the widest part of a circle has to traverse the quickest. It doesnt sound that farfetched to build this contraption so that kerbals can just climb the ladder and be at escape velocity from gilly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsefullness on gill ZERO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eim just curious to see if it can be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ttnarg","CreatedById":91776,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T08:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t gilly\u0027s Synchronous orbit is 42.14 km you would need to go higher than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T10:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESubmission Guide \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this challenge possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany challenges we see are nearly or literally impossible to achieve, and usually very little thought has gone into them, these challenges just annoy people, waste forum space and show that the submitter hasn\u0027t really tried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m not mistaken, visible range is only 2.5km.

Im working on designing a structure that wont tip over right now. Im thinking a massive wheight on the bottom and a long thin girder segment with sas rings and rcs to hold it in place. Ive om ly tested on kerbin and its not holding very well. But gilly has totally different rules altogether. Im going to have to build some mexhanism to get it there.

I got a decently sized tower to gilly and climbed it with the kerbal and then lept up in the air and sure enough I had a tiny tiny ballistic arc. so the concept does work. but im honestly not sure if I can do much better because it was all I could do to get the part there so I suppose cheating time just for a proof of concept!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T22:51:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI once hacked myself a tower thing above Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere by file editing.
