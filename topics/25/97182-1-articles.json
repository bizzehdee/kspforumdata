I did two runs, to make sure I used up all my jet fuel (otherwise it\u0027s wasted mass for the rocket stage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat got me to a 45 km x 252 km, and 20 m/s off rockets pulled periapsis out of the atmosphere (to 69,400m). I then split the trans-lunar injection into two burns, because that single 48-7S wasn\u0027t pushing much thrust. I made the TLI burn take me to an altitude of 10,000km where I got an encounter, and tweaked it so that the encounter would send my apoapsis to 11,400 km and periapsis up to about 3,000 km. I didn\u0027t land that time, I just took the gravity boost and waited for a second encounter. On the second encounter, I circularized to 10km. Unfortunately I somehow didn\u0027t get screenshots of all the steps, just the first and last. But that shows that I went from 6.624t to 4.939t, and I was burning a 48-7S, so that\u0027s 1009 m/s total from 45x252 at Kerbin to 10x10 at Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then scouted for a good high landing spot, and then went for it. It took a few tries before my landing spot was flat. Snapped some pictures. 4.939 at the 10x10km orbit, 4.133t on the surface, that\u0027s 612 m/s for the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff was wasteful, 624 m/s from surface to 10km. I should have flown it by hand; Mechjeb went from a heading of 180, pitch nearly 90 on the surface to a heading of 90 and pitch 0 via a heading of 270, because that\u0027s SmartASS for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn was 270 m/s. Unfortunately I hit Kerbin at 55 km, which meant it was *many* aerobraking passes before I finally could land. Landing was again tricky, this time due to silliness: on launch I\u0027d pulled my thrust limiter back to 5%, so I could squeeze every last bit of benefit from the turbojet -- but that\u0027s a bad place to limit thrust when you\u0027re landing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter landing I noticed I have the equivalent of an FL-T100 remaining. So you could break 7t with a minor change to my spacecraft. I\u0027d also recommend making the landing gear have a wider base, and lowering the center of gravity, to ease landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETricks I used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0. throttle back aggressively and do two passes to get every possible benefit from the jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. gravity assist to reduce deltaV to get to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. land at the highest altitude you can to reduce landing and liftoff deltaV requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. landing gear and cubes to allow landing hard (I did 10 m/s, but with a wider base you could land harder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. no parachutes, just use a jet to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could beat me by packing a bit less fuel.

Main savings were using a smaller tank and less fuel for the jet stage, and only using 4 intakes instead of 6. Totally different layout and fuel-tank choice, but the same engines, and the same amount of fuel for the rocket engine. I did a somewhat useless second pass with the jets (mostly to burn off extra jet fuel), that could likely be eliminated, and less fuel could be brought in a possible smaller tank for the jet, grabbing a small amount of additional savings. Obviously an unmanned mission could be done cheaper and smaller, but already lugging the weight of the Jet engine around is likely the most expensive part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/M4snG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

But that got me thinking: what if I use an LV-1. It has way less thrust, but combined with the ion it\u0027s about enough to land. That would shave off 70kg dry mass, but more importantly, it means the ion engine is a large part of the thrust on landing (a third of it), which means Isp on landing is much improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning the numbers: The LV-1 plus ion engine has Isp 420s. When I use that for the landing and liftoff burns, I can reduce the overall mass a lot, to 3.55t. The two engines together get just enough thrust to land: the 6 kN gives TWR 1.13 at the start of landing, TWR 1.3 on landing (and on liftoff), so maybe I\u0027m being aggressive when I claim to be able to use just 600 m/s on each of landing and takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait, the ion engine is 2 kN now?
