width=\u0022617\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnalysis:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is actually the first time I\u0027ve watched the Kabuto in action; I really knew not much about it at the start other than what I could see of it in the hangar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts main weakness is in its low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. It absolutely struggles to keep up with the PEGASys. This makes it fight more similarly to a plane from ASC-1.4, the HSC. A slow, maneuverable plane that leans more on guns than other armaments. The difference being, the Kabuto does not take hits very well either, which means even the PEGASys with its average-at-best gun fighting capabilities was able to down the Kabuto with its guns by incrementally damaging the Kabuto. That said, it turns out the GAU-8 is actually a pretty scary weapon now; all it did was skim the back of the one PEGASys and it managed to take out its entire engine section, a feat that takes a little more substantial contact with Vulcans. So I guess they buffed the accuracy some too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, that half-kill with the guns wasn\u0027t good enough... with the damaged PEGASys otherwise intact, it was still able to maneuver its gliding to throw a killing blow at one of the Kabutos. Oof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly the Kabuto has some potential to be even scarier, I think. I actually ran one more battle to learn about it, and it actually won with a lot of gun hits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the PEGASys, my final update to the D7 before its now-current competition iteration is something I call SCRAPPER-II; Synergized Close Range Assault Package and Programming for Engagement Ranges (SCRAPPER-I was first implemented on the Basilisk-C4, but that\u0027s being re-tuned as well). Its weapon ranges are tuned ridiculously close; a year ago, 2.5km was the gun range. Now, the D7\u0027s Sidewinder engage range doesn\u0027t even reach that far. This \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E ensure higher missile hit probabilities per fired missile, instead of firing at longer ranges where the target has time to deploy countermeasures and evade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny enough, you\u0027ll see the PEGASys\u0027s extreme aggression biting itself, with a friendly fire missile kill in the first round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor flight characteristics, sure, the D7 is also maneuverable. More importantly, it\u0027s fast, which allows it to escape the Kabuto\u0027s dangerous guns faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I have to mention something I\u0027ve noticed in ASC. There\u0027s two distinct styles of aircraft: slow and fast. Slow aircraft are actually quite scary against fast aircraft, because they tend to be able to hit their guns better, especially since they\u0027re never usually tangled up chasing the other aircraft, and instead have a lot of chances for a reversal once the fast aircraft overshoots a pass.

However, all of those tests were before SCRAPPER-II was implemented into the PEGASys-D7 (see previous battle analysis for explanation of what it is).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did not expect SCRAPPER-II to make that big of a difference.

It used missiles well and its gun power was likely to be lethal if it intersected with its target for even a split second, and its guns had a lot of ammo to burn through, which meant its threat level remained the same or increased as a sortie lasted longer. The SK-22 also had pretty decent damage mitigation, partly due to being covered in control surfaces that would help dissipate damage. It was maneuverable enough to generally keep up with targets.

The D7s\u0027 missiles were connecting more often, ending the battles early, or at least before the SK-22s could build up momentum.

Any chance the Saturn engine is worth it? This is what my previous fighter was designed around, and I think I will be ditching it on version 2, but I\u0027d like to sound out some reasoning first. Compared to the f5 engine (aka j-85 tiger) the Saturn has significantly better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and fuel efficiency. If we assume that drag scales with the square of the cross section, it should also have better drag to thrust ratio. The reason I would want to switch to the f5 are that it will be easier to be a smaller target\u00A0and add more damage mitigation with the smaller cross section. Also not really sure about drag scaling with the square of the cross section, this probably only applies at pure prograde. Lastly it\u00A0seems to have less\u00A0IR detectability despite identical listed heat production in the cfg files? I\u0027d like confirmation on this last part especially, but any thoughts are appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzerknoef","CreatedById":90599,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-10T08:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112527-box-of-stardust/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112527\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112527-box-of-stardust/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Box of Stardust\u003C/a\u003Ecasually foreshadowing the outcome of the next battle already, with the PEGASys already sitting on the #1 spot.

I too have figured out just how effective it is to use your weaponry at extremely close ranges, first of all guns tend to be way more lethal because there\u0027s less room for them to miss, and missiles have got so much fewer air time that the opponent hardly has time to evade at all.

There\u0027s certain\u00A0stats that I actually find helpful to display. The first is part count.

I also display the stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, which has a timer for fuel time.

I can\u0027t really identify anything I would consider a \u0027flaw\u0027. If there\u0027s anything to improve, I would say the first thing would be adding another Tiger engine to increase its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. For reference, I consider one Tiger engine per 1.1t of aircraft Combat Takeoff Weight to be a good baseline for a drone\u0027s initial \u0027production\u0027 version. (That said, the PEGASys-D7 is reaching the limits of its own airframe, at 7.5t for CTOW on its 6 Tiger engines, after various upgrades and additional Sidewinders starting from the original PEGASys-D3\u0027s 6.6t CTOW.) The next thing is to improve being able to take damage and still fly near max potential (though the UT-7 can already take some punishment decently enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, the UT-7 has many principles in the right place. It did not seem to lose any dogfights due to any deficiencies in maneuverability. It has a good armament, and it utilizes its weapons well, which helps it get some kills against the D7s. But that\u0027s the thing- it\u0027s not able to use its weapons much, or at least, use its weapons successfully enough. However, that doesn\u0027t seem to be any real fault of the UT-7; it\u0027s really quite a credible threat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe PEGASys-D7s are able to destroy the UT-7s fast enough before the UT-7s have enough time to build up any momentum. When the UT-7 is able to get momentum on its side, you\u0027ll see that it\u0027s able to put up a good fight. You\u0027ll see that in Sortie 2, where it gets early hits on the D7s, robbing them of their missiles and thus, their ability to quickly deal with the UT-7s. However, that\u0027s where the D7\u0027s second major advantage comes in; the defining feature of the PEGASys-D and other ASPEN platform aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just \u003Cem\u003Etakes hits\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E is what \u0022Damage Mitigation: 10\u0022 looks like. It\u0027s like facing off against an Ace Combat boss with plot armor \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eit\u0027s practically an ADF-11\u003C/span\u003E. Although a missile hit will send a cloud of parts flying, unless the missile hit manages to get a properly critical hit (a core hit on the drone core/control systems), the PEGASys will likely still be flying near full combat capacity in some form, and will take another solid hit to be brought down.

I can\u0027t really identify anything I would consider a \u0027flaw\u0027. If there\u0027s anything to improve, I would say the first thing would be adding another Tiger engine to increase its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. For reference, I consider one Tiger engine per 1.1t of aircraft Combat Takeoff Weight to be a good baseline for a drone\u0027s initial \u0027production\u0027 version. (That said, the PEGASys-D7 is reaching the limits of its own airframe, at 7.5t for CTOW on its 6 Tiger engines, after various upgrades and additional Sidewinders starting from the original PEGASys-D3\u0027s 6.6t CTOW.) The next thing is to improve being able to take damage and still fly near max potential (though the UT-7 can already take some punishment decently enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOtherwise, the UT-7 has many principles in the right place. It did not seem to lose any dogfights due to any deficiencies in maneuverability. It has a good armament, and it utilizes its weapons well, which helps it get some kills against the D7s. But that\u0027s the thing- it\u0027s not able to use its weapons much, or at least, use its weapons successfully enough. However, that doesn\u0027t seem to be any real fault of the UT-7; it\u0027s really quite a credible threat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe PEGASys-D7s are able to destroy the UT-7s fast enough before the UT-7s have enough time to build up any momentum. When the UT-7 is able to get momentum on its side, you\u0027ll see that it\u0027s able to put up a good fight. You\u0027ll see that in Sortie 2, where it gets early hits on the D7s, robbing them of their missiles and thus, their ability to quickly deal with the UT-7s. However, that\u0027s where the D7\u0027s second major advantage comes in; the defining feature of the PEGASys-D and other ASPEN platform aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just \u003Cem\u003Etakes hits\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EThis\u003C/em\u003E is what \u0022Damage Mitigation: 10\u0022 looks like. It\u0027s like facing off against an Ace Combat boss with plot armor \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Eit\u0027s practically an ADF-11\u003C/span\u003E. Although a missile hit will send a cloud of parts flying, unless the missile hit manages to get a properly critical hit (a core hit on the drone core/control systems), the PEGASys will likely still be flying near full combat capacity in some form, and will take another solid hit to be brought down. For reference, an undamaged PEGASys that has launched all of its missiles has 69 parts \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Enice\u003C/span\u003E. In the various sorties, you\u0027ll notice many of them still flying but being under that number, having lost parts ranging from some various nonessential parts to more important parts such as engines or aerodynamic surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSortie 1 shows the absolute extent of how much damage a D7 can take, but still remain in controlled flight, due to layered elements acting as armor and various redundant elements. It had lost 2 out of 6 engines and various aerodynamic surfaces (and I\u0027m pretty sure that was due to a friendly fire missile). The battle was probably won right here, with the UT-7s unable to get a single kill to their count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSortie 2 had the D7s beat down early on, with the UT-7s getting early missile hits in, denying the D7s the ability to easily disable the UT-7s quickly. With momentum on their side, the UT-7s are actually able to put up a good fight. However, the last remaining D7, also damaged, was still able to get good enough hits with its last two missiles to win this sortie. At the end, I was checking the extent of battle damage on it; it had lost one port side elevon, along with various less essential parts that helped to absorb damage. Despite putting up a good fight, the UT-7s had already lost too much, putting them behind for the last sortie.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSortie 3 sees the UT-7s give one last valiant effort, only able to field two aircraft. The first UT-7 to go down actually managed to fire off a missile just before destruction that got a kill on a D7, the one that was damaged by the early missile hit, which probably destroyed the protection around the core and allowed the missile to get a critical hit against the D7\u0027s drone core. If there\u0027s anything to be said about the D7\u0027s ability to take hits, it\u0027s that it\u0027ll take hits as long as it\u0027s not multiple top or bottom hits that expose the core and allow a second critical hit; though, most aircraft by the second missile will probably already be disabled in some form no matter where the hit, if they manage to survive a severe initial hit at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the tide was already against the UT-7s by this point, and they could not recover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bonus sortie was another battle recorded, but the AI bugged out for some reason, which I don\u0027t know why.

The main flaw it has really is very poor capabilities in gunfighting , it simply can\u0027t manage to properly get those guns on target. I\u0027ll try resolving that for the next drone, not gonna bother upgrading the UT-7-B4. Damage mitigation on the PEGASys really is damn impressive though, even with only like half the parts its still perfectly capable of putting up a fight! Managing all that survivability with in fact a fairly low part count is even more impressive actually!
