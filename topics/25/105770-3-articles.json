I\u0027m the one who came up with the way to get to Jool from LKO for about 1020 m/s, and it is interesting to see whether it is better to add 1km/s to your ship\u0027s dV or to take a convoluted route to Jool. The K-E-K-K-J route should be easier than it sounds here though. There might be a problem with the two time systems available in KSP- I used the 24/365 system for those flights and I think almost everyone uses the 6/426 system now. In 6/426 time you would leave LKO on Year 2 day 155 (with a normal V of -443m/s and a prograde v of 1039m/s from a 75x75km orbit) and flyby Eve on year 2 day 353.8. Then 2 Kerbin flybys on Y3 D330.2 and Y5 D330.4 and arriving at Jool around Y8 D217. You can leave Kerbin over a 48-hour window but you have to flyby Eve within about \u002B/-6 hours of Y2 D353.8 for the final Kerbin flyby to work.
