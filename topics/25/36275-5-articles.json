Have you tried it in the mountains? My gates are having glitch issues and tend to fly away sometimes, have you had that problem with that one piece ring yet?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to scale it down to check the COM and assume that the relative center is the same no matter the scale. The COM is dead center of the ring making it nice to approach as the name tag ends up in the center unlike the ramps which are tagged on a corner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t moved one to the mountains yet but will tonight (hopefully, work dependent). I plan on setting up the entire original course with them and testing it on the three PCs I have KSP on (all different graphic setups).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs the fly away due to mass or is it a mesh issue. I did have a similar issue when I renamed the base pieces in blender and forgot to apply the collision mesh to the new objects in Unity. The base ended up underground and the whole piece freaked and popped up in the air. Actually flew about 500m! It was pretty funny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the leveling becomes an issue, I was going to extrude the base out straight and put some landing legs at different heights around it. Side to side shouldn\u0027t be an issue, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s round, but it may lean front to back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is 144 meters wide to the outside and the ring wall is 18 meters wide so the opening diameter is 108 meters (roughly the same width as 2 of the ramps). This will give it and effective height which is much greater than the ramps so my hope is some front to back tilting won\u0027t be a huge issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried increasing the mass of your gate to prevent fly aways? I was thinking I could place them and then pump the mass up to 30-40 tons to make it more stable.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darren9","CreatedById":58062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T01:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^ I\u0027m not sure what causes the \u0022fly away\u0022, it wasn\u0027t a problem for me on the machine I created the course on - maybe related to graphics settings or a procedural element in the terrain formation? If you do a working course I\u0027ll be happy to add it to the OP, especially if your gates work better, I haven\u0027t made any parts yet - the gate part is borrowed from RollCage so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s that that\u0027s the problem.

It sits pretty well on the ground and twists for adjustment fairly easily. You can use the thrusters to \u0027hop\u0027 around for fine tuning placement and it twist side to side easily.
