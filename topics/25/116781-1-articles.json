[BD Armory required]","CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:35:11Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T00:35:11Z","Content":"![7TjxyvC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/7TjxyvC.jpg)\n\n**The challenge:**\n\nBuild 1 aircraft and use it to rescue Jeb, Bill, and Bob from the bloodthirsty pirates. Participants will be ranked based upon their speed and combat ability (details below). You must have a \u0022weapon manager\u0022 installed on you plane, and you must be set to \u0022team B\u0022 for your attempt.\n\nI have prepared a save file for this challenge: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5l2dqsildlmeic1/Assault%20on%20Pirate%20Island%21.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5l2dqsildlmeic1/Assault%20on%20Pirate%20Island%21.rar?dl=0)\n\nExtract the \u0022Assault on Pirate Island!\u0022 folder into your KSP Directory (Similar to installing a mod). It goes in the \u0022saves folder\u0022 -\u003E\\Kerbal Space Program\\saves.\n\n**Mods:**\n\nThis challenge requires the BD Armory mod available here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-2-BDArmory-v0-8-3-(critical-fixes-improved-AI)-Dev-Thread-May-30](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85209-1-0-2-BDArmory-v0-8-3-%28critical-fixes-improved-AI%29-Dev-Thread-May-30) .\n\nMake sure your physics distance is at least 15000 m (alt-b to open the settings)\n\n![2TGq1WZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/2TGq1WZ.png)\n\n**Allowed:**\n\nAll information and piloting mods. (KER, MechJeb, Pilot assistant, etc)\n\nFAR - I haven\u0027t tried this, but if you want to use it go ahead\n\nPart Pack mods (as long as they are balanced)\n\n**Banned:**\n\nAnything other weapons mods\n\nCheat Menu\n\nHyper Edit\n\n**If you have a mod you want to use and it\u0027s not mentioned here, ask and I\u0027ll add it to the list.**\n\n**Scoring:**\n\nParticipants will be scored using combination of time, and weapons load-out. Your base score is the mission time when you come to a complete stop at the KSC with Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Valentina aboard your plane (preferably on the runway, but close is fine). On top if this time, there will be a penalty for every weapon you are carrying at takeoff and for using guard mode / AI pilot to fight your battles. This is a challenge of your combat ability, so carry only what you need to get the job done. \n\n**Penalties:**\n\n15 seconds for every missile or bomb (all types)\n\n30 seconds for every gun (ammo cans are free)\n\n45 seconds for every countermeasures pod\n\n3 minutes if you engage guard mode at any point\n\n3 minutes if you engage AI auto pilot at any point\n\n**Make a video (preferred) or imgur album that shows your plane on take off, landed at pirate island, and returned to a stop at KSC. Try and include some fighting if you can (I knows its hard to remember screenshots when you\u0027re dodging missiles!)**\n\nHere is proof that this challenge is possible to complete:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/OrX5yaT_6Zg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nMission Time: 14:15 \n\nPenalties: 10:30 [22 missiles/bombs, 1 Gun, 6 countermeasures, No Guard mode, No AI Pilot]\n\n**Final Score: 24:45**\n\n**Leaderboard:**\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T22:25:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 10:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by t3hJimmer**"},{"CreatedByName":"zoopthehairypig","CreatedById":149099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T03:46:07Z","Content":"I would love to try this challenge, but I am new to bd armory.

As long as your set to \u0022team B\u0022 in the weapon manager they will attack you ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nDon\u0027t turn on guard mode unless you want the AI to fire weapons for you.\n\nI thought this challenge died on take off.
