Send a ship in orbit (reach a stable orbit at least 100km high). Once in stable orbit, retroburn to get into atmosphere, aim for the landing spot to be closest to KSC (keep in mind the aerobraking, so aim further then KSC since the atmosphere will further move your landing position).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in the atmosphere (below 60km), you can no longer use your engines to aim closer to the KSC, you let the spacecraft fall towards the KSC, the atmosphere will slow you down, and the only equipment you\u0027re allowed to use below 60km altitude are the parachutes so you don\u0027t destroy yourself at landing. Don\u0027t make your ship too big and heavy, or the atmosphere won\u0027t lower your speed enough and the parachutes won\u0027t do you good. But make sure you have enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and did I mention...
