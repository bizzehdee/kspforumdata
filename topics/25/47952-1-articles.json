He really seemed to like it, and now he\u0027s proposed that they make a sport of it: see who can launch the closest to the monolith!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Pretty basic: you have to use the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/monolith_cannon_save.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eprovided save\u003C/a\u003E and try to best Jeb\u0027s landing. The cannon he used is provided, or you can devise your own. If you do make your own, the capsule once fired off can\u0027t use any form of propulsion besides Sepratrons (or other SRB types if you\u0027re feeling crazy), and they have to land there in under 1 minute and still alive. Your score is how close you are to the monolith, so the lower the better. Jeb\u0027s planted a flag on the monument now, so your score is how far you land from the flag. Submit a screenshot showing your distance to the flag (target it to get it to show up) with the timer shown so I can see you made it in under 1 minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The provided cannon is a little tricky, so here\u0027s some tips. First off, you have to switch vessels after firing to control the capsule. Second, the Sepratrons are bound to 1, and the parachute to 2.
