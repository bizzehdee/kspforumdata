You CAN make adjustments to actually capture the planet. Slingshot from Moho to Jool you can skip planets but you must start with Moho and go to Jool. If you want to be a god then you can figure out when to start your \u0022race\u0022 when the planets are and will be in the perfect position to automatically go from one to the other without you even needing to be there. Post screenshots please and have fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
