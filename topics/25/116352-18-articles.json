He also explained why guns were so devastating in the old system - they cheated if they were nearly on target, which is why when bullets were on target, they tended to hit the centre of mass. It\u0027s akin to a turret with very restricted degrees of movement, just enough to score a hit occasionally.\n\nNow, the AI planes can blast away at each other all day without success, so fuel becomes an issue, and less rounds may be necessary due to increased battle length."},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T00:45:41Z","Content":"I\u0027ve just spent some time using the two different radar dishes and data receiver. They radically change the shape of scenarios to something a little more realistic - no insanely low minimum altitudes, and to kick things off, you need to trigger the guard mode by getting something of the enemy in the air (I was thinking two small SRBs, probe core and weapon manager of each team, haven\u0027t figured how to fire them simultaneously yet), where the radar can spot it. It also makes sense to pick your shots with a long firing delay, which avoids wasting missiles. The downside is planes can only scramble so far from the active craft - one blew up on take off 8kms away due to precision errors at range.\n\nThe format with radar would be slightly different:\n\n- Visual radius would be reduced to 270 degrees.\n\n- Visual range would be 2.5 to 3.5 km, depending on starting conditions.\n\n- Each team would get a ground radar; I\u0027d prefer the large, non-tracking radar so the planes still have to do the work. It might even be strategic to destroy the radar, and that could be worth something in the tie, a bit like Capture the Flag, or in this case, Detonate the Dish..."},{"CreatedByName":"colmo","CreatedById":25950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T20:45:14Z","Content":"My personal rules on wing spam and clipping are:\n\n- no sandwiching of wings\n\n- elevons can only be attached to a fixed wing\u0027s edges, either leading, trailing or tip.\n\n- control surfaces should not be significantly clipping though other parts in their normal range of movement.\n\n- fixed wings should not clip inside fuselage more than necessary for seamless fit and finish - over 50% of surface area concealed is a definite no-no.

What happens when the lead craft is taken out? I\u0027m guessing the wingman stops following and becomes independent (no sense plunging to the ground on the coat tails of a crashing plane)?\n\nI\u0027m wondering what happens if the wingman is vastly inferior to the lead plane and can\u0027t keep up? Is there a point where it gives up trying to follow? I\u0027m thinking of a reconnaissance, radome-encrusted plane which tags along after fighters, lighting up targets for them while lagging behind the action for their own benefit.\n\nI\u0027m also thinking about my interceptor challenge - what would make life interesting is if the antagonist bomber(s) has fighters guarding it - the behaviour for those would ideally be wingman-type following until engaged by enemy, at which point they break formation and engage the enemy, only returning to formation once no threat is detected anymore.\n\nI suppose that leads on to a patrol mode - the ability to circle or stay close to a craft or fixed point, at low, efficient thrust, until an enemy engages them, and return to that behaviour once safe. This would be nice for their default circling behaviour - turbofans really chug through the fuel at max thrust!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-29T11:22:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2015 11:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by colmo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars Rocks","CreatedById":67606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T16:16:48Z","Content":"Hey Scott,\n\nA few posts back you requested biplanes with BD armory guns.
