Here\u0027s a non-FAR 750m/s 0.6T pilot-less drone that appears to be within the rules as they\u0027re written (Sceppies minipack, firespitter, procedural fuel tank). Made a 1:04 with a horrendous flight path and landing. Should probably have separate stock/mod as well as Far/non FAR because any attempt at \u0022real world\u0022 balancing of different size parts is broken by the stock drag model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wP_WeA0CqU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
