The divide and conquer strategy was creative but led to a confusing imgur album, but I think I understand everything that happened.  There are no pictures of the various landers returning to the nuclear plane, but it\u0027s clear they have enough delta V to do it.\n\u003E \n\n@sdj64 You are right the album didn\u0027t turn out to be easy to read.\n\nSo for all those that want a little extra information about it I will give a mission description here (I will try to do it in the same order as the images).\n\n- First step was to launch a giant vehicle into space. The Faring around the Tylo lander and the return plane was wide enough to also shield the other 4 siedes of the ship (i.e. the other landers) on ascend.\n- The ship consists of the following:\n    - 3 landers for Val, Bop and Pol (3 times same lander design, one is sitting on a bit of extra fuel which balances the weight of the Laythe plane).\n    - A plane to land on Laythe\n    - A plane which will return the Crew home\n    - A \u0022big\u0022 Tylo lander\n- Ship flyes to Jool and does a giant extra orbit (because someone forgot to set up another maneuver node).\n- Then a highly excentric Tylo orbit is established.\n- After shuffeling the Kerbals and the leftover fuel around the ship splits apart. The bottom units of the Val, Bop and Pol Landers are discarded, the return plane stays in the current orbit.\n- Bop, Pol and Val landers go to the respective moons.\n- The Laythe plane still sitting on the engine of the main ship (and its return device) get send to Laythe. A little mixup made it neccesarry to change the Laythe orbit from a 180\u00B0 inclination to a 0\u00B0 before lowering the orbit. Then the return device was left in a low orbit and the plane was moved into the athmosphere as the last act of the engine and fuel tank from the starting ship. Flag is planted on Val and the plane manages to reach the return device. Some pilot errors later the return device is left in a Tylo orbit with a few dVs left and needs to wait for a close aproach of the return ship. So the rest of the mission comences.\n- Tylo lander is brought into a low orbit by another fuel tank and engine of the starting ship. The lander does its thing. At the end of the descent the 3 major fuel tanks have to be jettisoned, otherwise \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003Etwr\u003C/abbr\u003E would be to low to make a safe landing. Ascent is pretty uneventfull, so is meeting the return plane.\n- Landing on Val Bop and Pol are uneventfull and the return is easy. Sidenote:\n    - You can see the delta V stats for the last stage of every ascend vessel in the picture where the Laythe plane meets the return device.\n    - The landers have a little design flaw. The bottom tank is the root part, which makes the deltaVs for the last stage not show up correctly and also messes with maneuver nodes when staging..\n- After the Kerbals that have returned from Bop, Pol and Val have met the return plane, the poor soul that returned from Laythe still needs to get there. After expanding the last dVs of the return device and a little maneuvering of the return plane, the eva pack is used to travel the last few km to the return plane.\n- Return plane leaves Tylo orbit, does a gravity assist with Laythe and gets parked in a Jool orbit (closer to Jool than Laythe).\n- At the next transfer window the return plane starts its long voyage home.\n- Back at Kerbin 1500dV allow the ship to enter an highly excentric orbit.\n- A little retrograde thrust at apoapsis lowers the periapsis to about 60 km so breaking can be done over a couple of orbits instead of all at once.\n- finaly the plane descends and makes a water landing (propably could have made a landing at the spaceport, but it was to late in the evening ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) )"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T00:43:19Z","Content":"[@sdj64](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100819-sdj64/) - all done!

I will update this post when I complete it later today.\n\n- Which game versions did you use? I used KSP version 1.2  \n- What mods did you use, if any? I used the mods Texture Replacer (for the spacesuits), Trajectories (for aerobraking predictions), Kebral Engineer Redux (For delta-v information), Hangar Extender (big ship needs a big \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) and TimeControl (Timewarping 50-something years took way to long for my attention span)  \n- How many Kerbals are on the mission? I brought 5 Kerbals, Halman (who came in my level 1 submission back in 1.0.5), Valentina, Obbert and his best friend Archibald and the new recruit Sigcia Kerman.  \n- How many launches were needed to start your mission from Kerbin? The mission only needed 1 launch.  \n- How much did your mission cost? 1593157 Funds was the craft\u0027s cost.  \n- Did you needed a refueling mission? No refueling missions were needed, in fact I brought enough fuel to go to Eeloo and maybe a few other destinations but my attention span said no, besides I have a grand tour to get ready for.  \n- Did you bring additional stuff like satellites, rovers, etc?  Not really, no. Well I left 4 partially fueled fuel drop tanks in elliptical Laythe orbit but I don\u0027t think that counts.\n\nIn regards to the no strut thing, this mission was also done to show just how powerful autostrut is. I think there should be a small mass penalty, perhaps each connection to another part equals the mass of 1 strut and so on. I do not think it should be removed because, let\u0027s be honest, my frame-rate needs it, especially for the grand tour mission I am planning.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-07T13:36:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2016 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by JacobJHC**"},{"CreatedByName":"DustInTheWind","CreatedById":143708,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-07T16:36:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 11/5/2016 at 0:33 PM, -DDD- said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi!
