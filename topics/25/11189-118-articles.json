During a recent test flight we found that with a reduced fuel load *Queen Amidala*, which in normal operation acts as the booster of *Skywalker*, the newest in our Gemini class of space shuttles*,* is able to take off horizontally from a runway and attain orbit by herself. Since she functions as a flyback booster during a shuttle launch, she is also capable of re-entry and landing in one piece.\n\nIn the attached video I take her out for a single orbit test flight before landing on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway. Note the pumping of fuel to retain balance: that is a trick I learnt many years ago while playing the spaceflight sim Orbiter. I did make use of MechJeb, but I only used two of its information displays: to show the landing point and the Center of Mass. I flew the entire mission by hand.\n\nAs a spaceplane the *Queen* is not a particularly subtle machine. Her ordinary job is lifting a 90 ton space shuttle into orbit, so her 12 Vector engines could be seen as overkill by some. Reports that she ripped apart the runway surface during her takeoff run are greatly exaggerated, as is the reported number of broken windows at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, as a result of her breaking the sound barrier while still flying over the runway.\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/so0hxH9IzZE?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-04-27T08:20:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2020 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by QF9E**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-27T13:15:11Z","Content":"Congratulations to [@RoninFrog](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203049-roninfrog/) and [@QF9E](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/201203-qf9e/) on completing the K-Prize mission successfully. \n\nRoninFrog\u0027s Pandemonium I, through a benign convergence of serendipity, elegant design and capability landed on the M\u00FCn and also returned safely to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway to win the highly regarded Advanced Pilot Precision Award and the universally respected Astrokerbal Distinction.\n\nQF9E\u0027s Queen Amidala demonstrated considerable agility for its size and evident lift capacity in earning the highly regarded kudos of an Advanced Pilot Precision Award for returning from orbit to land safely on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway.\n\nThanks both for your mission reports and welcome to the K-Prize party guest list aka the roll of honour.
