I went through something like over a dozen different aircraft designs before I decided on this one.  Both my aircraft are the same model but one has two 20mm cannons and the other only has one. I took inspiration from the SU-37 and MiG-29 when making this, and I think it turned out pretty well. Please tell me if I need to change anything. Turning on the AI autopilot is done by pressing \u00220\u0022 then spacebar. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Aircraft 1: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xzmd8szuhvaayi/Zahida%20-%201%20-%20CF-63%20Empress.craft?dl=0\u0026preview=Zahida\u002B-\u002B1\u002B-\u002BCF-63\u002BEmpress.craft](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xzmd8szuhvaayi/Zahida%20-%201%20-%20CF-63%20Empress.craft?dl=0\u0026preview=Zahida\u002B-\u002B1\u002B-\u002BCF-63\u002BEmpress.craft)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Aircraft 2: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k29r9nobdt9xfg5/Zahida%20-%202%20-%20CF-63%20Empress.craft?dl=0\u0026preview=Zahida\u002B-\u002B2\u002B-\u002BCF-63\u002BEmpress.craft](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k29r9nobdt9xfg5/Zahida%20-%202%20-%20CF-63%20Empress.craft?dl=0\u0026preview=Zahida\u002B-\u002B2\u002B-\u002BCF-63\u002BEmpress.craft)\n\u003E \n\nSubmission inspected and accepted.

First, create the craft.  Then go to your KSP\\_Win folder, the same way you got to GameData when you were installing BDArmory, and go to Saves.  Then go to the save you created the ship in, open the \u0022Ships\u0022 folder, open the \u0022SPH\u0022 folder, select the craft file of the ship you created, copy it, publicize it through any of the file sharing methods described above.  Then post the link in the thread as per \u0022Tournament Submission Guidelines\u0022 on page 51.  Do make sure you\u0027ve included a picture with your post.  You can do that by pressing F1 while looking at the ship in the spaceplane hangar, then find that image by going to KSP\\_Win and going to \u0022Screenshots\u0022.  Upload it to Imgur and post the link to the Imgur upload along with your craft file in the thread.
