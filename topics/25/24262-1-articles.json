Once you sync orbits, you have to guide your retrieval ship to contact, the Kerbal has to hit a spot that he can grab on to, every little bump with no grab sends the Kerbal tumbling off in a random direction. Even more fun, before the Kerbal makes contact with your ship, you have to switch to him so you can hit the F key. Then after all is said and done, you have to bring him back home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a good long time to get it done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EConditions:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo cheats enabled.
