With some real nice Shuttle and mini shuttles being worked on what are your thoughts on a Dual stage to orbit, or a piggy back atop a mothership then the craft leaps off the back of the mothership and punches for space. Most of these craft have small fuel on-board and or meant to be used by means of a shuttle like vertical launch or a strapped in atop the rocket and rocketed into orbit. \n\nOthers words for a DSTO there is a aft section that will take the craft to the edge of space, drops away and the craft rockets into orbit. For the Mothership apporch it would be a 2nd craft that lifts the first on up to the edge of space, drops away from the orbital craft allowing it to fly up into orbit as the mothership makes for the runway.\n\n**Ignore All of the above!

You were quite correct about the fuel transfer but maybe didnt notice that since the Mk1 docked during its mission flight it earned the highly regarded Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1stClass for docking in orbit and landing safely at KSC runway.
