I have no idea when Kerbol gets too hot to handle, so in the process of doing this I was coming a little closer, taking a screenshot, coming a little closer, taking a screenshot, until the result pictured.\n\nYep. I didn\u0027t want to cook the S-1 until I got an entry ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif). I would have to say that it definitely seems part-dependent in some respects - the highest temperature on my ship is 1150K, and though that\u0027s scary given the part\u0027s tolerance is 1200K, the temperature of the rest of my ship is significantly lower than the temperature you\u0027ve recorded, to the point where my thermometer is giving incorrect readings.\n\nI honestly think you have the edge. My solar panels mean I can operate at maximum capacity until I run out of Xenon, but because I\u0027m using Gigantor XLs their maximum temperature is only 1200K. They\u0027re conducting heat away from the main body of my probeship (Which would be good if I had some radiotope generators on that body), but if they explode then that\u0027s it for the Sunskimmer. The Z-1K cannot maintain thrust on an ion engine long enough to do anything relevant this close to Kerbol.\n\nOn the one hand, your ship looks like it\u0027ll have a lot more problems shedding heat than mine, but on the other your power generation components can tolerate a lot more heat than mine. It\u0027d be interesting to see who can get closer.\n\nEDIT: Took the S-1 in. Made it to 535,335 x 533,347 Km. Both panels exploded, and had to make the final burn on batteries. With this experience, I revise my opinion of Foxster\u0027s ship: You don\u0027t have the advantage. Without a way to rapidly vent heat, you will overheat and explode. I now believe that your Ap will be above 535,335 Km when you do so.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
