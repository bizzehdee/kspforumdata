Ideally it should also be able to bring other people\u0027s computer to a crawl too. So don\u0027t just try to run KSP on a potato. Make a craft that will turn i9s, Ryzens and RTXs into potatoes too on it\u0027s way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be no score as such, but posting your rough computer specs, KSP settings, how long the flight actually took in real time, the partcount of your craft, and the ingame time to orbit should give a pretty good idea of how laggy it really is. It would also be nice of you to explain why you think your particular design has a high lag to partcount ratio and how you figured out it would.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and don\u0027t .cfg edit in a bunch of unnecessary extra modules or something. Make a craft you could actually build in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-16T06:27:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2021 06:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Pds314\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
