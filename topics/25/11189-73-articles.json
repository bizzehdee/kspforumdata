No cheats, as can be seen by comparing numbers in the \u0022Kerbal Engineer\u0022-window.\n\nI got 100% funds back when landed and it added up to 337652 funds and that means the total difference in funds was 44142. The payload of 4 LV-Ns, decouplers and docking ports costs 38640 funds and that means that the total cost for getting that payload up to orbit and assembled was 5502 funds.
