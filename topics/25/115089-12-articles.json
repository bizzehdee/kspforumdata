The last EH career I managed to land on Mun and Minmus and by using the docking port to break the weight/part count limits was looking further. All this was accomplished by just upgrading the AC that allows the gathering of EVA science. Now it seems the AC does not need to be upgraded so long as kerbals are sent into space in a cage.  \n\nCaveman breaking the rules is awesome:  \n\n1. not allowed to build large interplanetary vessels.  \n\n- Caveman builds Voltron vessel by using docking ports juniors  \n\n2. not allowed patched conics or maneuver nodes   \n\n- Caveman study the celestial movements and learns from simulation experience  \n\n3. no EVA in space until astronaut complex upgraded   \n\n- Caveman are sent into space in a kerbal corral  \n\n@5thHorseman That is too bad.

The upper stage is designed to achieve 1700 m/sec and 0.7 thrust to weight.\n\n The results:  \n\n-An LV-T30 booster stage can orbit up to 3.0 tonnes payload. It\u0027s right at the edge of both the pad limit and it\u0027s lifting capacity, making it ideal for caveman heavy lifting.  \n\n-An LV-T45 booster stage can orbit up to 2.3 tonnes. It runs out of lifting capacity before it overloads the pad.  \n\n-An RT-10 booster stage can orbit up to 1.3 tonnes. Any more than that exceeds the pad limit.  \n\n-A BACC booster stage can orbit up to 1.2 tonnes. It\u0027s weight approaches half the pad\u0027s mass limit all by itself.\n\n 3 tonnes orbital is quite a lot for caveman conditions. You can get manned landers or fully returnable science sweeps.   1.2 tonne is good to get a manned capsule in LKO or small surface probes to the Mun.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T19:26:51Z","Content":"I used the Thud on my launches."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T00:28:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Bev7787 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I used the Thud on my launches.\n\u003E \n\nBev,\n\nI didn\u0027t check the Thud.
