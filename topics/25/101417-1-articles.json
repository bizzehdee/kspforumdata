The military, of course, performed several raids against many of the involved museums, where they retrieved the lost equipment so that it - along with the planes - could be scrapped for good.\n\n*However, this left the air force without any form of strategic bombing capability*. An untenable situation indeed. As such, a procurement process has been initiated wherein various different aircraft manufacturers will be allowed to compete over a single strategic bomber contract. Runner-ups may be allowed to further study their concepts. As long as they look awesome. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nThe selection process works as follows: entrants have to comply with the basic requirements set forth by air force officials. However, entrants may score points on top of these depending on a multitude of different testable factors. These may range from top speed, to number of engines, to a specific challenge, etc.\n\nThe basic goal is to construct a reliable, functional bomber.\n\n**Basic Requirements**\n\n*Spirit of the challenge: build a modestly realistic design which could serve as a reliable and functional strategic bombing platform*\n\n*A bomb is herein defined as a single* ***FL-T400 fuel tank****, filled maximally with oxidizer and liquid fuel. This is the only form of \u0027bomb\u0027 allowed. Because kaboom. It may however be outfitted with drone cores, wings, nose cones etc.*\n\n*The full payload is the payload the entrant declares to be the maximum FLT400 bomb loadout (the base requirement included), and this is also used to calculate the \u0027more BOOM\u0027 score. The number of bombs may not be reduced from this maximum loadout in any of the sub-challenges where a \u0027full payload\u0027 is required.*\n\n***Stock parts only****, FAR may be allowed but such entrants will be listed as FAR users.*\n\n*Part clipping per se is allowed, so long as its usage does not constitute an obvious attempt to exploit physics. Think in terms of the spirit of the challenge.*\n\n*No other attempts to circumvent or exploit KSP physics are allowed. I may have missed some exact point but then refer to the spirit of the challenge.*\n\n- The Bomber must be able to take off and land, both with and without payload, on the conventional KSP runway without the assistance of rockets.\n\n- The Bomber must at least carry six (6) bombs per the definition provided above.\n\n- The Bomber must carry these six bombs internally, shielded from the airflow. A cargo bay is preferable. However, any bombs beyond the *required* six may be attached to outside hardpoints (see bonus objectives).\n\n- The Bomber must be able to drop this payload safely, without any damage being inflicted on the airframe. Collisions between bombs, such that parts of the payload are destroyed during drop, should be avoided.\n\n- The Bomber must be able to perform a simulated attack mission (takeoff, cruise, drop payload, return to KSP, land) against the peninsular landmass far to the east of KSP, see image:\n\n![CVY2Keo.png](http://i.imgur.com/CVY2Keo.png)\n\n***Clock the mission if you want to win the fastest bomber award.***\n\n- The Bomber must have a crew of at least two (2) Kerbals. This crew must be able to enter and exit the bomber.\n\n**Bonus Objectives**\n\n**More BOOM:** \u002B12pts per extra bomb stored internally, \u002B5pts per extra bomb stored externally.\n\n**One hundred convincing arguments:** \u002B20pts extra for carrying at least 100 bombs (this time, the x6 required bombs are included in the count)\n\n**Swift payback:** \u002B0.1pts per m/s top speed at an altitude of 3 km (for instance, if aforementioned KB-68 Vanquisher top speed at 3 km is 200 m/s, total points for this: 20pts). The speed test is to be performed with the full payload and fuel, so perform it as soon after takeoff as possible.\n\n**Engine maintenance:** -2pts per basic jet engine, -4pts per turbojet, -10pts per RAPIER engine. Rockets carry no penalty but, remember, they may not be used for takeoff.\n\n**Nuclear maintenance:** -20pts per LV-N (nuclear) rocket engine (relevant for some of the challenges listed below)\n\n**Part maintenance:** -0.02pts per part (bombs included) (calculate at end of construction for simplicity, example bomber has 400 parts which thus equals -8pts).\n\n**Fastest bomber award:** an entrant may be awarded \u002B10pts if it is the fastest bomber (as measured in time to complete the simulated attack mission, see above) amongst its competitors in the same category scoreboard. Note that the arrival of faster entrants or new time trials for previous entries may result in the award and its points being transferred to someone else. The currently fastest plane is denoted with a cool bolded **F**.\n\n**Airshow maneuverability:** \u002B10pts if the Bomber can execute a horizontal turn, with or without payload, with a peak force of 10Gs or more at an altitude between 100-300m.\n\n**Gentle giant:** \u002B20pts if the Bomber with full payload, at cruising speed and an altitude of 3 km, can maintain a prograde velocity vector within 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of its level indicator.\n\n**Flashy technology:** \u002B30pts if the Bomber has VTOL capability, with payload.\n\n**You feeling lucky, VAB?/Dynamic Demonstration of Force:** \u002B10pts if the Bomber can successfully destroy the VAB, using a part or the entirety of its payload (but not by crashing into it). For this subchallenge only, the bomber may use another loadout than FLT400 bombs.\n\n**Where Eagles Dare:** \u002B30pts if the Bomber can land on top of the VAB\n\n**Career switch:** \u002B20pts if the Bomber can be used to launch a simple one-Kerbal crewed SSTO from underneath one or both of its wings (akin to the use of the B-52 for the X-15), no payload except the SSTO(s) is necessary\n\n**Worldwide coverage** \u002B20pts if the Bomber can perform a full circumnavigation around Kerbin\u0027s equator, without refueling, full payload required (for the whole trip). The circumnavigation must be performed at an altitude of no more than 25km\n\n**SPACE bomber:** \u002B20pts if the Bomber itself functions as an SSTO, with payload.\n\n**That\u0027s no moon... Not anymore:** \u002B80pts if the Bomber can enter and survive the battlefield of the Space Age and deliver the minimum x6 FLT400s onto the surface of the Mun. Refueling in Kerbin orbit is allowed. The bombs must be dropped from an altitude no lower than 10km (so achieving orbit is not necessary)\n\n**Service ceiling:** \u002B15pts if the Bomber can sustain level flight at an altitude of 12 km.\n\n**Field refueling:** \u002B10pts if the Bomber can be refueled on the runway.\n\n**Field rearming:** \u002B20pts if the Bomber can be rearmed (only the *required* six bombs have to be successfully rearmable for this objective to be fulfilled) on the runway.\n\n**Operational ability:** \u002B5pts for completing both \u0027Field refueling\u0027 and \u0027Field rearming\u0027.\n\n**Battleduck:** \u002B20pts if the Bomber can safely land on and take off from water, with full payload\n\n**Such stealth, very sneak:** \u002B2pts if it can be argued that the shape of the aircraft resembles that of a flying wing.\n\n**Inspired shape:** \u002B2pts if the Bomber has a swept wing layout, similar to that of the B-52.\n\n*If you come up with any interesting side objectives on top of these, do let me know!*\n\nGood luck and let\u0027s build some awesome-looking aircraft!\n\nSCOREBOARDS\n\nThe scoreboard is divided into severall different categories. First, vanilla entries are separated from those using mods (for now, only FAR has its own scoreboard, with extra modifications listed with the entrant name). Secondly, different classes of bombers are recognized to encourage the construction of a wide range of different vehicles. The classes are heavy (40\u002B bombs), medium (20-40) and light (6-20). For now, the same scoring system and modifiers apply to all classes.\n\n**Vanilla KSP** - Heavy Class (40\u002B bombs)\n\n1.

I have to admit, this design used to be a massively overweight SSTO to be used to ferry refueling tanks to orbit. So I actually have to reduce the number of engines and make it slightly weaker... Otherwise... no efficiency. The design is also quite a bit different in looks from what is already submitted. think it\u0027s lifting payload capacity is somewhere near 180 Tons(more then it weighs) before I even change the engine setup... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nI\u0027ll post it\u0027s info and how it performed once I\u0027m satisfied with making it a bit weaker and have loaded it up with bombs."}]}
