Here\\\u0027s a modified version that\\\u0027s substantially easier to fly at the expense of a bit of authenticity. While I doubt you\\\u0027ll be doing many post-stall maneuvers, it handles better than you\\\u0027d expect from a strategic bomber larger than a B-52.\n\nThe most annoying bit is the jettisonable sled that keeps the nose in the air for takeoff. Without ground effect or flaps, it\\\u0027s really hard to get large planes in the air without propping them up at a ridiculous angle. Hopefully that will be improved in later versions of KSP.\n\n**Edit: updated version. I noticed the last one had some issues with restarting flights, so I went back an reworked it a bit more. It should be more balanced now.**\n\nThe rudders still suck, but that seems to be more of an game issue--air resistance doesn\\\u0027t seem to be factored properly when calculating rotation, so even a plane with a massive wing will roll or pitch extremely easily. Which means that any slightly offset force from a rudder will send most ships spinning wildly. With luck a future KSP will fix this."},{"CreatedByName":"CiaoTime","CreatedById":24935,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T21:10:20Z","Content":"![L9Xud.png](http://i.imgur.com/L9Xud.png)\n\nSomewhere in Oregon, a man with a crazy combover is rolling his eyes..."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T21:12:23Z","Content":"Easy; Proteus."},{"CreatedByName":"CiaoTime","CreatedById":24935,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-31T21:40:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Easy; Proteus.\n\nYep.
