That was written long before Kerbals could have specific roles so while it could now be read strictly to require five pilots, having five scientists specialised for each moon is an interesting twist that I would have thought everyone would be happy with. Especially as a probe core could be doing all the flying!\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure you can take more Kerbals than are required if you want to. It\u0027s more mass to drag around to give them each somewhere to sit, after all.

It \u0022glues\u0022 certain parts together and slows the physics on craft load, preventing Kraken attacks.\n\nStock fuel switch at first seems like a no-brainer, but it does improve the fuel tank ratios of stock parts (see part of my reasoning on dis-allowing Procedural Parts a few pages back). Until we actually get such a function in stock, I would say no.\n\nThe nuclear lightbulb in Atomic Age is too overpowered, so Atomic Age is not allowed.\n\nUse Kerbal Joint Reinforcement if your computer can\u0027t handle loading your ship. There was some discussion about it on the old Jool 5 challenge, and Ziv said that part of the challenge is building a ship that doesn\u0027t fall apart using the stock system. I won\u0027t ban it, but try to see if your ship works without it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I have one question about the 3ed level.

ElWanderer is right, the rule was invented before Kerbals had pilot, scientist, and engineer roles. I did a Jool 5 mission in 0.24.2 that included 10 Kerbals and two landing on each moon, so level 2 and 3 at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T17:01:27Z","Content":"Welp, then a complete transfer stage redesign for me.
