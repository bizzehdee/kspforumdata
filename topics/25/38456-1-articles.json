You can rotate your craft to waste fuel. For initial stages, you just watch your altitude and wait till the numbers stop going up, and then pop the next stage. Solid fuel rockets may be very useful for this challenge, since you aren\u0027t allowed to turn them off anyway. You may throttle back an engine slightly if you have to to prevent it from overheating. I won\u0027t say you have to use stock parts, but I\u0027d rather not see people using anything that makes this challenge too easy. No RCS thrusting allowed, RCS may only be used to turn the vessel. You can use QWEASD for RCS, but you may not use IJKLHN. Same goes for Kerbal EVA backpack, although the default controls are reversed. Finally, parachutes are not allowed at all, and wings are not allowed for landing. I\u0027d advise against using wings at all, but you may use ejectable wings if you like. Wings must be detatched above 5000m when landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the following point listings are additive, so every mark you complete, you get the points for it.

I think he means for every SOI change you may only burn at Ap? Otherwise none of the rest of the challenges make any sense? Like how could you even land on the Mun if you had to be at full thrust from Ap burn at Kerbin through to Landing? Presumably, you have to set up a stage carefully so that your dV exactly matches your requirement. Which is kinda brutal really, and doesn\u0027t reward landing on an atmospheric body as much as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027s courtesy to post your own attempt at a challenge when posting one...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T12:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eonly lighting your engines at apoapsis\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never said you have to stay at apoapsis during the burn. You just have to be at apoapsis when you ignite the engines. So when doing a landing, you want to make sure that your engine burn finishes with you in an orbit until you\u0027re ready to make an entry. In thick atmosphere, you can spend long portions of the descent at apoapsis, so this gives you a nice window to ignite engines. Other tricks may involve using slow-burning engines to land right as you finally slow down. Well now that I think about it, I realize it would be pretty difficult to time your burns for a landing on an atmosphere-free body if you can only ignite at apoapsis. It might be doable if you start with an extremely tight orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played around with this challenge for a while and came up with a craft that could leave Kerbin orbit and very nearly escape the Kerbol system, but I\u0027m too lazy to bother easing into orbit with another planet or even posting screenshots. I really just posted this to give you guys something to do if you\u0027re bored, but I like to set limits for scoring as high as possible, in case people achieve it.
