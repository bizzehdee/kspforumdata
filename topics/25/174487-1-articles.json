On the surface of Eve it could be refueled by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E facility which would again be used for multiple missions and purposes. Then I would sen the 900 units of ore to the LEO where next ship would bring more fuel or otherwise take the ore to Gilly. This ship would again be used for multiple missions. I should also try to include more missions like \u0022plant a flag\u0022, \u0022take measurements\u0022 etc during the flight.

So you can send a small drill probe down to Eves surface to get the contract update on \u0022acquire 900 units of fresh ore\u0022 and then land another vessel on gilly, having already 900 units of ore on board (brought vom Kerbin) or drill on Gilly for 900 units of ore. I guess that is \u0022semi-intendet\u0022 so you cannot stuck on these contracts by having a surface refuel station which may get the update for acquiring the ore but will never be able to deliver it anywhere (or it is not intendet at all since you can dump ore but this will not revert the contract update).
