The high take off speed of over 200knts was a bit of a surprise for a craft of this size. But the biggest shock to me was actually its agility, it is a quite agile craft. The wings could use with a bit of strutting to stiffen them up a bit more, but they weren\u0027t horrible. It did lack some yaw stability at lower speeds but I will get to that on part 3 of the review. The 2 SABRE-M engines provide a great deal of power while in air breathing mode and more then enough when in closed cycle. The action grouping is a bit confusing if it was changed up so the SABRE-Ms and LV-1N were not on the same action group. But overall it is a breeze to fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Orbital performance 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where this craft suffers unfortunately. The single LV-1N just does not provide enough thrust to keep the burn times at a reasonable level, the orbital burn to achieve a 100km x 100km orbit (my test orbit for all craft including my own) was over 3minutes. This was cut down to a 8 second burn with the SABRE-Ms in closed cycle, but this greatly reduces the delta/V available to the craft and is horribly inefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately I couldn\u0027t give it more than a 5 because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Re-entry and landing 6.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it were not for TAC fuel balancer I think I may have lost control of this craft on re-entry and landing. I ended up coming the atmosphere with less than 50% of the fuel on board. I did quite a bit of testing in space and dumped a fair amount of fuel just to see how it performs when low on fuel. The CoM shifts back quite a ways and actually puts the CoL infront of the the CoM. This makes the craft very nose light and nearly uncontrollable. The landing was quite scary at first then I shifted fuel to the forward tank and it flew fine. Its landing speed was actually quite good, and was able to land and stop in under half of the runway. The training wheels in the back actually came in handy there as they kept the engines from striking but an experienced pilot wouldn\u0027t have this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI gave it a 6 because of the lack of balance when the fuel drains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall it earns a solid 6 out of 10. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad craft, but could use some improvements.

The Center of Thrust is well below the Center of Mass causing the craft to pitch up when under full power. Take off is long for a craft this small, the lack of real lift is a problem and the landing gear position leads to a very narrow yet surprisingly stable base. You end up using most of the runway if not all of it to get off the ground. This is fine for normal atmospheric flight but it nearly makes the craft uncontrollable at altitude. Much like other craft that rely on the RAPIER or SABER engines for power, they lack a real way to keep the electrical system charged until the rocket engine kicks in. This is a major problem on this craft because it uses so much electricity just trying to counter the engine force to keep the nose pointed where you wanted and not pinwheeling through the sky. This is extremely bad when you switch over to closed cycle on the RAPIERs and the LV-1N engine to do your orbital climb and burn. The pitch up causes an nearly instant stall situation that no amount of fighting overcomes. You basically use brute force to get the craft to space.

This means the RCS thrusters are working overtime just to keep your craft mostly pointed the right way, and don\u0027t even think about using the RAPIER engines with the LV-1N while in space, it will just cartwheel out of control.
