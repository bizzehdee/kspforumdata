The clipped Turbojet/RAPIER engine is interesting, but makes it difficult to manage how they perform, especially given the use of only two ram intakes. Uses a standard docking port, but puts it in an odd location (which looks quite ugly if I may be brutally honest), with no illumination except from landing gears. Rear landing gear could probably be moved forward a bit too.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wanted strong cross range capability which required the very large vertical surfaces so that yawing would actually change heading instead of just side-slipping. The large vertical surfaces meant the inline docking port wasn\u0027t really practical anymore, and while it could have been a Clamp-o-tron Jr the normal size moved the CoM into a better position. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen building then engine assembly, I was thinking since the Aeris 4A was much more capable than the other stock aircraft it would be a good time to introduce a harder building technique. The craft needed more monoprop storage and stacking the engines on the centerline means there is no reason not to ride air-breathing mode all the way to flameout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting had shown that jet engines don\u0027t dump fuel when left activated so I just left it on and the intakes open at all times. I was originally hoping I could build it so it would just fly the entire mission without action groups on automatic mode switching but the RAPIER will not switch back to air-breathing mode no matter how much intake air is available. As I wrote in the craft description, you command the RAPIER to mode switch and the Turbojet starts back up. By the time the jet flames out a second time you\u0027re (or at least I was in my testing) basically in space so the intake drag doesn\u0027t matter at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for it being ugly, that\u0027s just my playstyle that values going to space today (and absolute minimum part count for my old computer) over looking pretty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cruzan","CreatedById":79256,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T04:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to make a video about my testing process.

The A4M Type 120 performed well compared to the original, but the engineers felt the vehicle was excessive in size for its capabilities. A complex wing system and high parts count makes it a costly vehicle to maintain, and an unweildy flier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T22:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Silverchain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Silverchain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree.

Well, I am \u003Cem\u003Emostly\u003C/em\u003E 100% with you. Unless you have actually built so many SSTO\u0027s you have tried pretty much \u003Cem\u003Eevery powerplant combo used in these entries\u003C/em\u003E already, and can actually eyeball airbreather cutoff speed and delta-v on the hangar (I admit kerbal engineer redux also helps). The last one I built and tested got the working name of SSTO Mk XXIX, and that doesn\u0027t count either the ones with mods or the family versions... I told you guys this challenge was my thing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, my White Dart at least is deceptive on that (delta-v): with good throttle control, you can get cutoff speeds over 1800m/s and save a good percentage of total delta-v to get to orbit. That is also why it has excess liquid fuel, not only to guarantee you can fly back to KSC after reentering (crossrange!), but also to experiment with how high and fast you can go before you run out of air. Then again, as long as you have a healthy margin, yeah, I also don\u0027t weight delta-v heavily on my grading system, which in fact I think is heavily influenced by aerodynamic handling when full and with the engines out. Mostly, because everyone can put a lot of intakes and a high airbreather T/W, and get awesome performance with nukes and low rocket T/W. No fun in that, and no learning experience, you might as well build a rocket-like VTOL (more than a fair share of verticlimbers out there!). The hard part is to balance everything in the craft, using as few engines as necessary to do the job, and still getting a good mass ratio out of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow do that in a simple and eye-pleasing way, throw in fidelity to what I think is the spirit of the Aeris 4A (single seater to fool around in low-to-medium kerbin orbits and learn how air can be your friend getting to space), and you definitely get my attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
