On landing approach, I have managed to go to 90 degrees angle of attack. And it didn\u0027t stall. So that plane will \u0027fly\u0027 down to about 10 m/s with its nose pointed vertical. Of course it still explodes instantly upon touching the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried firing rockets from it, but anything slung underneath makes it unflyable. A completely different design might work though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m a bit worried over the behavior of parts that have separated from the main craft. I\u0027ve been able to build planes that can glide by themselves (using fins and/or radial decouplers on the top to create positive pitching moment, to keep the nose up). This works as long as the active capsule is there. If you duplicate the entire thing, but now separate it so that it\u0027s on its own, it will just go into a sort of parabolic dive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, SAS modules that are jettisoned no longer function. I think if they are \u0027on\u0027 at the time of jettison, they should remain active *for the stage they are attached to*. I think these fixes are necessary for \u0027re-usable parts\u0027 for more traditional rockets as the game progresses.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spiz102","CreatedById":1720,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-15T13:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you modded an SRB to allow it to fire when already detached you could mount it on the nose of your craft and use a LES to pull it clear..... although you would have to mod the command pod to allow a 1m decoupler to be attached to the nose\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
