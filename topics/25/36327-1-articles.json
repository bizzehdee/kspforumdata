The lander cannot be powered in any way. Land your lander safely on another planet, one with an atmosphere. Duna or Eve are good targets. The difficulty: detach the lander from your rocket before it exits the Kerbin sphere of influence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did this with both Eve and Duna, so I know it is possible. Words of wisdom, make sure you are at 1x warp when you exit the Kerbin SOI and when you enter the target SOI. There seems to be precision loss if you are using warp as you cross those thresholds and will mess up your trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t thought of including added objectives or scoring, but since you asked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese scores are somewhat arbitrary based on the skill I imagine it would take to accomplish the tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Duna: 100 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: 10 additional points for each complete orbit before final landing, up to 50 additional points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: 70 points if you pass close enough to Ike to EVA and land a live Kerbal on Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Eve: 80 points (larger margin of error because of thick atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: 10 additional point for each complete orbit before final landing, up to 50 additional points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: 70 points to land your kerbal on Gilly with EVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool: 100 points for aerocapture (landing not necessary)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: 150 additional points for EVA landing on Pol or Bop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoptional: Laythe: 300 additional points to Land on Laythe (with lander, not EVA). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The 100 Jool aerocapture points are still awarded if you land on Laythe without a Jool aerobrake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 10 additional points per complete orbit of Laythe up to 50 points\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal must survive the landing, without debug or mods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeduct 100 points if a mod is used to plan the rendevous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse of EVA is permissible, so if you\u0027re skilled enough to get out and push to make small corrections, feel free.
