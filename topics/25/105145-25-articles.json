If you build the same stage from chemical engines you would add about 200% mass to your ship.\n\nI made stock ships with ~3% payload fraction in [RSS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50471-105-real-solar-system-v105-feb-27/), using jet engines.  Se [RSS Moon Landing using stock parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129946-rss-moon-landing-using-stock-parts/).   Stock chemical rockets only get about 1% payload fraction to LEO, due to the reduced isp of stock engines compared to IRL rocket engines.\n\nThis do not have a real world application as SRBs/chemical engines make a much cheaper first stage then jet engines. And IRL it is cost to orbit rather than payload fraction that is important."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T09:18:38Z","Content":"Oh neat, I hadn\u0027t even seen that challenge before.
