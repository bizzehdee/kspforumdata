To be fair, the fact that most Kerbals who went up there never came back was pretty bad for morale, and towards the end there we were practically locking those guys in there so the couldn\u0027t get out on the way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no matter! With an inflated budget and no dreams of stellar exploration to fritter it away on, the Kerbal government has decided to become a despotic military state (who elected these turds? Oh wait, that\u0027s right...) with a powerful fighting force that spans the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve survived the purges that took place at the Kerbal Space Center after this shift in attitudes, and are now the premier engineer for the newly formed \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal People\u0027s Militia\u003C/strong\u003E. The Kerbal State has been calling itself a \u0022military powerhouse\u0022 for about two months now and those jerks over at KSC-2 have been actually asking \u003Cem\u003Equestions\u003C/em\u003E, and nobody likes those. So before they decide to pop over here and actually check to see if we have a military, you need to build one for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat? That\u0027s not ridiculous. Why are you laughing? Seriously, we only have like a month to do this. It\u0027s your head if everyone is laughing at us in a month\u0027s time. Why are you crying now? Geez, are you bipolar or something?

The plan is broken down into a few \u0022stages\u0022 for you to achieve, I\u0027ll break them down for you below. But first, there are a few limitations imposed by those Kongressmen on what you can do. First, we realize that most of the parts you have to work with are made for peaceful exploration, which aren\u0027t so conducive to making imposing-looking war craft. So, in the interest of saving time and face, \u003Cstrong\u003Emods are allowed, even encouraged\u003C/strong\u003E. Now, obviously, as a newly despotic state, nobody really wants to sell us pre-made military craft. But no matter! Part packs like B9 (especially the D12 expansion!) and KW Rocketry have all the parts we could ever need to make a fighting force, but feel free to use any other mod that\u0027s NOT a military replica craft. Other than that, try to avoid crashing your things into the VAB- it\u0027s expensive and we don\u0027t have many spares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EStage One: We Shall Call it the \u0022Fair\u0022 Force\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESummary:\u003C/strong\u003E In the name of justice, equality, happiness, and the empowerment of all Kerbals everywhere, it\u0027s your job to make an oppressive air force for one Kerbal nation.

Replacing the role of the old Space Program\u0027s light lifter series, this craft can lift small payloads that are of a definitely-not-military-oriented-but-still-classified nature into low orbit for \u003C/em\u003Ereasons\u003Cem\u003E. It\u0027s also a very fast atmospheric plane, able to both reach and exit orbit and serve as a recon plane in one flight.
