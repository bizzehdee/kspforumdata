I\u0027ve done a couple to see how well they do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules? Replace nosecones with radomes but no other structural changes from stock. Oxidizer can be drained from tanks on spaceplanes to save weight or shift CG. Same for fuel. AI, weapon manager and control authority and pitch/yaw/roll settings of control surfaces and engine gimbals are free to change. Set default altitude to 3000 and minimum to 500.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeapons. Any of the ones that come with the base BDA mod that you can fit on a plane and still get off the ground. No turrets or other guns that can change their angle, unless their ability to turn is disabled. If you want to mount a 105mm Howitzer, its pitch and yaw have to be turned off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaximum number of missiles???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould have it where everyone has to use the same loadout of six AIM-20, two AIM-9 and two Vulcans with two 20mm ammo boxes (as maximum, use fewer if you want to run out of weapons first) but that could get boring. In 2 VS 2 team dogfights I\u0027ve done, the majority of the time the survivors still have missiles left and haven\u0027t used many bullets from that loadout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nECM pod highly recommended. It\u0027s heavy enough to be used as a center of mass adjuster. Should there be a limit on how many chaff and flare dispensers are allowed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve never used BDArmory it\u0027s a good idea to download some armed planes from KerbalX to examine their build and pit them against one another to see what works and what doesn\u0027t. When you\u0027ve found some good ones, arm up some of the stock planes and fight them VS each other and to other people\u0027s planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend the ADF-01 Falken Crewed as an opposition force plane to try to beat. If your plane can manage to shoot that one down you\u0027re doing well. I\u0027ve no idea how it flies so well. I\u0027ve tried to make my own designs with the centers of mass and lift so close together, with controls cranked up to 150 and the aggressive AI steering settings, but I can\u0027t match it *and* make them fly that good. I have built one design that\u0027s close (Cranky Delta), two of it can beat two of the Falkens pretty often but I\u0027ve not hit on a design that dominates the Falken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can arm one of the stock planes and shoot down the Falken with it, my hat is off to you. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I don\u0027t have tons of time to run plane fights, nor does my PC have enough extra power to do video capture of games. It\u0027s a six core AMD FX (was that ever a letdown, barely better than the Phenom II quad core it replaced) with 8 gigs DDR3 but the GPU is an old 9800 GT with 1 gig RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-18T12:17:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAww man, This I have to try!

Will the rotary bomb rack work with the AI to launch missiles? Stock planes from previous KSP releases, that aren\u0027t included with 1.3, can also be used. If an old one won\u0027t load, it\u0027s possible to do a find and replace of part names with a text editor on the craft file. To avoid complications it\u0027s best to replace parts with ones that are the same size. For example I fixed the low fuel problem on someone else\u0027s plane where he\u0027d used a single FL-T400 and used a couple more of them on pylons for drop tanks. Replacing the rocket tank with a MK1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage was a simple matter of find and replace on the part names from their cfg files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing to note when doing this is if the part name has underscores _ they must be replaced with dots . in the craft file.
