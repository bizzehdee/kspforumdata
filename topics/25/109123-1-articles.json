Too lazy to link, but google is always your friend.**\n\nThere hasn\u0027t been an [Apollo-Style](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45928-Beyond-Apollo-AAP-challenge) challenge in quite some time so I figured, especially with all the new players around, and with the release of a new version, it was time to make a new one.\n\n![Apollo_17_The_Last_Moon_Shot_Edit1.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Apollo_17_The_Last_Moon_Shot_Edit1.jpg)\n\nThe Apollo Program is arguably one of humankind\u0027s greatest feats. The Saturn V rocket took men to the surface of the Moon. But it wasn\u0027t supposed to end at Apollo 17. There was a plan for the Apollo Applications Project, a program that would use Apollo-Saturn hardware for more exploration.\n\nThis challenge has a few simple steps.\n\n**Step 1: Construct Hardware**\n\nYou must have three rockets for the AAP ARM.\n\n-[Saturn IB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_IB)\n\n-[Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V)\n\n-[Saturn INT-21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_INT-21) (Optional)\n\n-[Saturn MLV Series](http://i.space.com/images/i/14601/i02/interstellar-space-travel-concepts-adrian-mann-1.jpg). Build at least one of the latter four designs. (Optional)\n\n-[Nova Rocket](http://www.daviddarling.info/images/Nova_rocket.gif). (optional) Alternate Links: [1](http://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/extrapolation.jpg) [2](http://www.buildtheenterprise.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/nova-heavy-lifter-rockets-v3.png) [3](http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/graphics/n/novanasa.gif)\n\n*There\u0027s pretty much enough designs for the Nova that you can make your own, provided it uses some of you Saturn/Apollo hardware. A really good design that I couldn\u0027t find a picture of was using four S-IC Stretched boosters.*\n\n*The S-IVB (third stage) on the Saturn IB and the S-IVB on the Saturn V* *should*(but doesn\u0027t have to) be the same subassembly.\n\n![interstellar-space-travel-concepts-adrian-mann-1.jpg](http://i.space.com/images/i/14601/i02/interstellar-space-travel-concepts-adrian-mann-1.jpg)\n\n**Step 2: Apollo Lunar Program**\n\nProve that your spacecraft using Saturn V works as a Lunar Landing System using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous approach. (CSM and LM, \u0022Apollo Style\u0022)\n\n*-Apollo 4*: Unmanned flight of the Saturn V. Must carry an unmanned boilerplate Command/Service Module and Lunar Module, and it must be the same weight as the full payload. Only go to LEO. This can double as the Saturn V test mission for the first step.\n\n*-Apollo 7*: First manned flight of the CSM. Must stay in orbit for 3 Kerbin days (18 hours). Launched on Saturn IB\n\n*-Apollo 8*: First manned Saturn V launch. Fly to the Mun\u0027s orbit, orbit 9-10 times, and come home. Must Use Free-Return Trajectory until in the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n*-Apollo 9*: First Manned Flight of the LM. Take a Saturn V up with crew in the CM and have two crew transfer to the LM. Fly the LM, testing the Ascent and Descent Stage, and then dock back to the CSM, before flying home.\n\n*-Apollo 11-18*: Do I really need to explain? Just make sure you use LOR. (No, you DON\u0027T have to do ALL the missions. And yes, I know Apollo stopped at 17, but I need a viable reason for a LLES to be a goal.\n\n*-Apollo 13*: (Optional) Using the exact same rocket as Apollo 11 or 12, get back home safely with no Kerbals in the main Command Module (until re-entry), and the Service Engine must be turned off.\n\n![a12_ls3_lg.gif](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_12/images/a12_ls3_lg.gif)\n\n**Step 3: Apollo Applications Program**\n\nThere are several AAP Projects, you must do at least one. (Add 20 points for each additional mission)\n\n-*Munar Base*: Using only Apollo Hardware with minimal modification, create a base on the Munar Surface. The payload to the Munar Surface may be new, but the delivery method to the Lunar Surface must use Apollo/Saturn Hardware. It is here that either Earth-Orbit Rendezvous or the Saturn MLV concepts will become incredibly useful.\n\n-*MOLAB*: Using two Saturn V Launches, Bring a Giant Pressurized Rover to the Mun. Then bring the Apollo-Mission to the Mun, landing very near the MOLAB.\n\n-*Eve/Duna Flyby*: Using Apollo Hardware, go on a flyby and return mission to either Duna or Eve.\n\n-*Skylab*: Using a modified Saturn V, put a Workshop into orbit. The Apollo Telescope Mount must use a Lunar Module Ascent Stage-Based design.\n\n-*ASTP*: Rendezvous with a Soyuz spacecraft using a docking adaptor in place of the LM in the Saturn IB fairing.\n\n-Asteroid Redirect Mission: Redirect an asteroid using only hardware used previously in the Apollo Program. You may use hardware from ASTP, AAP, or ALM to pull this off.\n\n![zalssbas.jpg](http://www.astronautix.com/graphics/z/zalssbas.jpg)\n\n**Goals**\n\n- Saturn Five uses 5 engines on the first stage, 5 engines on the second stage, and one engine on the third stage. *\u002B20*\n\n- Asparagus-Staged Rocket. *-45*\n\n- Free-Return Trajectory until in Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. *\u002B10*\n\n- Lander stored behind a fairing. *\u002B10*\n\n- Use Real Solar System. *Multiply your final score by (2(sqrt[10]))*\n\n- Use 6.4:1 Scale Kerbin (Or some other large rescale). *\u002B50*\n\n- Redirect Asteroid in Solar orbit. *\u002B10*\n\n- Redirect Asteroid using crew. *\u002B10*\n\n- Leave Descent Stage on Mun. *\u002B5*\n\n- Include ALSEP Science Package on Apollo 11-18 *\u002B5*\n\n- Include Lunar Rover on Apollo 11-18 *\u002B10*\n\n- Include Lunar Landing Escape System (And test it in a quicksave-simulation) on Apollo 11-18 *\u002B7*\n\n- Include Lunar Subsatellite on Apollo 11-18.*\u002B5*\n\n- Career Mode Bonus: get as much science as you can in the mission without landing in more than one spot per mission.\n\n- Kerbal Dies *-50 per Kerbal*\n\n- Redirect Asteroid while in Solar Orbit. *\u002B10*\n\n- Redirect Asteroid with crew. *\u002B10*\n\n- Use Ion Engines *-50*.

Despite the rockets being totally unreliable and seeming to explode every other mission, it was decided it was time for the fledgling \u0022space program\u0022 to launch Kerbals into the heavens. Kerbals have plenty of experience now with falling in circles around Kerbin (something scientists insist is called \u0022orbiting\u0022) in tiny, cramped command pods. They\u0027ve even docked two spacecraft together in space, and left their pods for Extra-Vehicular Activities. But the Kerbal leaders were concerned that the new Space Program wasn\u0027t actually going anywhere other than in circles. The Ascension Program (Kerbals have never heard of Greek gods) was born from a simple dare: send Kerbals to walk on the Mun. For some reason, nobody had thought of it yet, and it seemed barely insane enough to pull off.\n\n![3c0f1NFl.png](http://i.imgur.com/3c0f1NFl.png)\n\n**The Hardware**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/k3TO2)\n\nThe Kerbals would have to do something they had never done before: design reliable, safe rockets to perform clearly stated goals. After years of careful revision and testing, under the direction of rocket scientist of Wernher von kerman, three main designs were created:\n\n**Sarnus IB**\n\nAs the (many) bugs were being ironed out of the huge rocket that would land Kerbals on the Mun, it was determined that a smaller, more sane rocket was needed to test the Command/Service Module and the upper stage of the rocket that would become known as the Sarnus V. Includes a launch escape system.\n\n**Sarnus V**\n\nThe Sarnus V was, at the time of its inception, the largest and most powerful rocket ever created. It carries the Command/Service Module and the Munar Excursion Module into Kerbin orbit, before the upper stage sends it on its way to the Mun. Includes launch escape system. Barf bags not included.\n\n**Sarnus Modified Launch Vehicle**\n\nAlthough they haven\u0027t actually built one yet (and have no idea how they would go about it if they wanted to), the eggheads at Kerbal Space Program think they can eventually strap four solid rocket boosters on the side of the bottom two stages of a Sarnus V and get a rocket that can haul 110 tons into orbit.\n\n**Command/Service Module**\n\nThis is the main home and means of propulsion for the three-Kerbal crew once the Sarnus V hauls them into orbit. It has a service engine for Munar orbit insertion and Munar ejection burn, RCS for reaction control and docking, and fuel cells in case the crew runs low on juice. The bottom part (the Service Module) is jettisoned before reentry so that the top part (the Command Module) can return the Kerbals home safely.\n\n**Munar Excursion Module**\n\nThis ungainly-looking lander will allow two of the Kerbals to engage in a \u0022controlled\u0022 descent and landing on the Munar surface. After surface operations are complete, the Ascent stage lofts the Kerbals back into Munar orbit where they rendezvous with the Command/Service Module.\n\n**The Munar Roving Vehicle** \n\nThe Munar Roving Vehicle (also called the \u0022Mun Buggy\u0022) is a light, high-tech rover designed to operate under battery power. It provides the Kerbals with increased mobility while performing scientific operations on the Munar surface. Comes with two external command chairs. Warranty void if seatbelts not used.\n\n**The Missions**\n\n**Ascension 4**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/hevfo)\n\nAn \u0022all-up\u0022 unmanned test of the Sarnus V rocket. The booster lifted a dummy payload Command/Service Module and Munar Excursion Module into Low Kerbin orbit. While orbit was successfully attained, there were oscillations on launch and problems with the upper stage engines. Fortunately there is time to iron them out, because the next launch will not use a Sarnus V. Overall, the mission provided excellent data on the performance of the new rocket.\n\n**Ascension 7**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/5g54N)\n\nA manned flight of the Sarnus IB rocket to test the capabilities of the CSM in Low Kerbin Orbit. Kermund, Patdock, and Hermy Kerman were lifted successfully by the realiable Saturn IB booster, and spent eleven days testing the systems of the CSM. After the de-orbit burn, the Service Module was discarded and the crew prepared to splash down east of the Kerbal Space Center.\n\nKermund: Ascension to KSC, how do you read?\n\nKSC: Loud and clear, Ascension.\n\nKermund: We will not be wearing the helmets on the way down, KSC.\n\nKSC: You are under orders to wear the helmets, Kermund. You\u0027d better have a good explanation for this one.\n\nKermund: We\u0027ve been in space for 11 days, and we\u0027ve all got colds. I don\u0027t want to sneeze on my visor.\n\nKSC: Well let\u0027s hope you don\u0027t all break your necks on splashdown.\n\nKermund: Thanks, babe.\n\nThe Kerbals were fine without their helmets, but the officials at the Kerbal Space Center were very unhappy. They banned Patdock and Hermy from any future flights for going along with Kermund\u0027s antics. It turned out that Kermund was planning on retiring anyways, so he got off scot-free. Patdock and Hermy are understandably still mad at him for the whole thing. Still, the boys in Engineering were satisfied with the performance of the CSM, so they recommended the next mission push the boundaries of exploration even farther...\n\n**Ascension 8**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/GT41I)\n\nJaysef, Keiger, and Milus Kerman were selected to be the first Kerbanauts to orbit the moon. The historic mission was launched on a Sarnus V booster, which pushed the CSM into Low Kerbin Orbit. The half-full third stage performed the Trans-Munar Injection burn, inserting the CSM on a free-return trajectory. The craft would return to Kerbin with no additional burns if there was a need to abort the mission.\n\nJaysef: Alright, boys. The third stage is detached and we\u0027ve started the \u0022barbecue roll\u0022. That should prevent any issues from uneven thermal radiation.\n\nKeiger: I hate it when you use big words. I feel terrible. I think I\u0027m going to be sick.\n\nMilus: Use the barf bag, I don\u0027t want to clean up your zero-g vomit!\n\nKeiger: They don\u0027t pack barf bags on the Sarnus V, remember? Cost-cutting measure ... uh-oh ... \\*barf\\*\n\nJaysef: Ascension to KSC, do we have procedures for cleaning zero-g barf?\n\nMilus: Um, it\u0027s not just barf. We have a full on bodily fluid assault here, KSC.\n\nJaysef: This is going to be a long flight.\n\nIt was indeed a long flight. The crew had trouble sleeping and made a few stupid mistakes because of it. Fortunately none of them caused any real issues. After performing the first up-close observations of the Munar surface, the Service Engine was ignited for the Trans-Kerbin Injection burn. Just before reentry, the Service Module was discarded, and the Command Module came down over the grasslands on parachutes. (Since Trajectories doesn\u0027t work in 1.02, it\u0027s pretty tough to ensure a splashdown when you\u0027re coming all the way back from the Mun.)\n\n**Ascension 9**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/OF1Ab)\n\nHermy, Neilken, and veteran commander Bob Kerman were selected for Ascension 9, a full \u0022dress rehearsal\u0022 in Low Kerbin Orbit of the procedures and equipment that would be used in the actual Mun landing. The CSM and MEM were lofted to orbit by a Sarnus V rocket, where the crew performed transposition and re-docking of the CSM to the MEM. This maneuver involved detaching the CSM from the MEM, flipping the CSM around, and mating the top of the CSM to the top of the MEM via the Ascension docking adapters. Then the third stage of the rocket was ditched and the crew entered the MEM to inspect it for damage. Bob and Neilken then undocked the MEM, leaving Hermy to mind the CSM.\n\nBob: Ascension to KSC, we\u0027re undocked and reorienting to burn the Descent Engine. Hermy, please try not to break anything while we\u0027re gone. We\u0027ll be back in a few hours!\n\nHermy : If anything, I\u0027m more concerned about Bob taking the MEM on a little joyride.\n\nNeilken: Can we just get this over with? I\u0027m space-sick enough as it is.\n\nBob: You\u0027re gonna love this jolt, then! Descent Engine ignition in three ... two ... one ...\n\nThe Descent Engine successfully boosted the MEM to a higher orbit, where the two kerbanauts circularized. The engine had worked perfectly, and the Descent Stage was ditched, leaving only the Ascent Stage to rendezvous with the CSM. That engine also performed nominally, allowing the crew to redock with the CSM and transfer over before dumping the tiny ascent stage. After several more orbits, the deorbit burn was performed, the Service Module was jettisoned, and the crew parachuted down to Kerbin\u0027s coasts. (I can\u0027t even hit the water from LKO ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) ) The boys at mission control were sure that they would soon be ready for the real thing.\n\n**Ascension 11**\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/j6AxG)\n\nAs usual the crew for Ascension 11 was chosen randomly from a pool of experienced candidates ... wait a minute, how the hell is Jebediah on the flight roster? He must have pulled some strings, or else he\u0027s one lucky punk. Aldry, Jebediah, and unfortunately-named Billy-Bobzon Kerman were boosted to orbit on the reliable Sarnus V, the third stage successfully inserted the CSM and MEM on a free-return trajectory, after which transposition and redocking was performed and the third stage was ditched. The orbital insertion was executed on the dark side of the Mun, and the time for landing was near. \n\nAfter wishing the Jeb and Aldry good luck, Billy-Bobzon closed the hatch to the CSM and two two crafts were separated. The landing sight, near the equator at the bottom ridge of the Northeast Crater, was packed with craters, requiring Jeb to manually maneuver to find a landing spot. With a jolt, the two became the first Kerbals to land on the surface of the Mun! Mission Control was going wild, along with everyone watching on their TVs at home. Jeb and Aldry flipped a coin in the Low Munar gravity to determine who would be the first to set foot on the surface. Jeb won (don\u0027t tell anyone, but it was his one-sided coin), and suited up for EVA.\n\nJeb: The hatch is open. I can see the Munar surface. I am descending down the ladder now.\n\nAldry: What the hell ...\n\nJeb: Uh, KSC. We have a problem.\n\nKSC: What is the issue, Jeb?\n\nJeb: Somebody forgot to install the ladder on the MEM, guys. I\u0027m just going to jump out, should be fine.\n\nKSC: Uh, negative Jeb. We need to review our procedures and get back to you in maybe an hour on a safe way to descend ...\n\nJeb: Screw that, I\u0027m already on the surface. This is awesome!\n\nAldry joined him soon after he deployed the Munar Roving Vehicle to the surface. The two grinned uncontrollably at the magnificent desolation of the surface. They planted a flag, and prepared to take the rover to the lip of a nearby crater. a kilometer or so away. Peering over the edge, Jeb thought he saw a strange rock formation on the other side.\n\nJeb: See that Aldry? Something\u0027s glimmering to the east...some kind of monument or monolith!\n\nAldry: We\u0027re low on batteries as it is. We can\u0027t go check it out.\n\nJeb: I gotta come back and figure out what that is.\n\nAldry: There\u0027s no way you\u0027re getting on another Ascension mission.\n\nJeb: That may be true, but the eggheads back at Mission Control are already talking about \u0022Ascension Application Missions\u0022 after these ones. Maybe even to Eve and Duna. Imagine...\n\nAldry: Let\u0027s just get back to the MEM before the battery runs out, Jeb.\n\nAfter wrapping up the planned science experiments, the boys grabbed the rock samples jumped gracefully to the Ascent Module door (the mechanic who forgot to install the ladder has already been fired ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ). The ascent engines pushed them up into Low Munar Orbit, where they were picked up by a lonely Billy Bobzon. After ditching the Ascent Module, the boys made the Trans-Kerbin Injection burn. Hours later, they reentered Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and parachuted to a hero\u0027s welcome ... once the Kerbal Army sends a chopper to pick them up from the desert, that is.\n\n**Points (and the Future)**\n\nHere\u0027s the tally for the Normal Apollo Program goals, as far as I can tell (please correct me if I missed something).\n\n- Saturn Five uses 5 engines on the first stage, 5 engines on the second stage, and one engine on the third stage. *\u002B20*\n\n- Free-Return Trajectory until in Mun\u0027s SOI. *\u002B10*\n\n- Lander stored behind a fairing. *\u002B10*\n\n- Leave Descent Stage on Mun. *\u002B5*\n\n- Include Lunar Rover on Apollo 11-18 *\u002B10*\n\n- Stock. *\u002B20*\n\n- Launch Escape System. *\u002B5*\n\n- Use fuel cells for power generation only *\u002B10*\n\nTotal Normal Apollo Program Score: *90*\n\nAs Jeb mentioned, the boys back at KSC are already developing applications for the Ascension Program hardware for use in further exploration of the Solar System. These missions could extend the Kerbal\u0027s reach to other planets and moons, greatly expanding their scientific knowledge and leading to a great Space Age. Provided the Kerbal Space Program remains fully funded, that is.
