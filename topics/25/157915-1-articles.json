So in game and in the tracking station, there is a green line connecting to all the online probes, landers, bases, rovers, space stations etc. The KSP team have also added in a bunch of new transmitters in the game as well. So\u00A0the green line gets darker when you lose more and more connection with kerbin. This means that it is important to have probes everywhere in the kerbol system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also map planets and Moons with the new update. So then that is another few probes on each and every moon to make it easier to find better landing spots and to see where lakes and oceans are if your looking at Laythe or Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my challenge is for someone to post a photo with all satellites and Probes connecting each and every other probe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo comeplete the challenge, you must show proof of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA minimum of 2 probes around each planet\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAt least 3 probes orbiting any of the planets moons\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2 probes orbiting around the sun between each planet\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n10 probes orbiting Kerbin and the M\u00FCn\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll the probes must be connected to each other and must connect to kerbin with a 100% status.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n3 screenshots of you mapping the following : Laythe, Kerbin, Jool.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease post a commentl if you think this is a reasonable challenge or you think this is way to overpowered and would take up any of your own ksp time.
