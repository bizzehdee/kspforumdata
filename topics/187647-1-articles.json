The pilot exits the (one-man) capsule and the scientist transfers to the capsule from the Mark I crew cabin. The scientist EVAs and sure enough has no parachute so he re-boards and decides to ride it in. Meanwhile the pilot has a long parachute glide ahead of him. The pilot has several thousand meters of altitude against about 500 left for the ship. The ship lands well enough to allow a quick ship recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 That sends you to the space center, where you discover the pilot is neither available, nor dead, nor assigned nor missing. He does not appear in the tracking station listing and he\u0027s not on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E crew list. He has completely vanished. He was last seen 5.3 km from his ship with about 3000m altitude in hand, on a course free of obstacles and moving at a nominal 30 m/s. After about 5 minutes, during which I was bringing down some debris from orbit, the pilot appeared on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E list. Maybe he will resurrect after 2 hours, the current game setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 We shall see... this time I\u0027m going to leave the persistent file alone and see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 ..... Ok I took a ship out and warped ahead about 80 days..... Jeb is still \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
