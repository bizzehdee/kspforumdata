I speculate that it\u0027s related to the localization changes, but I have not dug into the code to see if that is indeed the case.  Although MAS doesn\u0027t show that problem for some reason.  Hopefully I can get some time this weekend to look into it, since I had a very short deadline task tossed in my lap at work that\u0027s going to chew up some free time.\n\nAs for screen shots, add this to the monitors you want to suppress:\n\n    doScreenshots = false\n\nEDIT: It turns out that the JSIVariableLabel and JSISwitchableVariableLabel both use stock KSP\u0027s InternalText object to display text, and InternalText uses TMPro  I speculate that there\u0027s a toggle somewhere that tells TMPro to use vertical orientation or something weird like that, but I don\u0027t know what that toggle is.\n\nEverything else (JSILabel and the monitors) use my text renderer, instead.  MAS also uses my text renderer.  [@theonegalen](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/71012-theonegalen/) - are you sure you saw it with JSILabel, too?

JSISwitchableVariableLabel is slightly more flexible, since it can change what it displays, but it\u0027s still stuck using Arial.  JSILabel and a Select variable can do the same thing with minimal effort.  That, and JSILabel wasn\u0027t affected by the KSP update. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T01:59:42Z","Content":"\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECkan\u003C/abbr\u003E has all the iva mods... requires rpm of course.

I don\u0027t expect it to fix the issue, but fingers crossed.  What\u0027s annoying is that I had this exact same problem when KSP first moved to asset bundles, and I don\u0027t remember what combination of hoops I had to jump through to fix it, and that was on my previous computer.  And it seems to be a common problem, and has been for a while, in the broader Unity community."},{"CreatedByName":"martinmike2","CreatedById":113086,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-07T21:47:07Z","Content":"Not yet\n\n![Screenshot%20from%202017-06-07%2017-37-0](http://i453.photobucket.com/albums/qq258/martinmike2/Screenshot%20from%202017-06-07%2017-37-04_zpsbx6bc9ml.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/CroppedDisplayShader\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/CroppedDisplayShader\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Blur\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Blur\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/DisplayShader\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/DisplayShader\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/FontShader\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/FontShader\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Grayscale\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Grayscale\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Greenscale\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Greenscale\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027FORWARD\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027FORWARD\\_DELTA\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027SHADOWCASTER\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - All passes removed  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027FORWARD\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027FORWARD\\_DELTA\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027SHADOWCASTER\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - Pass \u0027DEFERRED\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027Standard\u0027 - All passes removed  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/JSILabel\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Noise\u0027 - Pass \u0027\u0027 has no vertex shader  \n\u003E \n\u003E WARNING: Shader Unsupported: \u0027RPM/Noise\u0027 - Setting to default shader.  \n\u003E \n\u003E [RPMShaderLoader]: Found 8 RPM shaders and 9 fonts.\n\u003E \n\nFor information:  I created a new clean install and only installed the ASET props, ModuleManager, and the RPM mod.
