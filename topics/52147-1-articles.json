However I\u0027ve got other things to pay so I can\u0027t get a whole one right off the bat. I\u0027ve got a GTX 460, Phenom II X4 @ 3Ghz and 4 GB ram. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a total noob at pc building so feel free to tell me if there\u0027s a better option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan is to get a new mobo: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130693\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130693\u003C/a\u003E [newegg.ca] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand new CPU first: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116899\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116899\u003C/a\u003E [newegg.ca] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... and put in my old parts (corsair 750 psu, the 460, my old HDD etc.). Now I know the GPU and RAM will be very outdated and will hold me back but there\u0027s not much I can do till I work again in the summer. When I have the money I will get new RAM and a new GPU. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m wondering is; Does this Mobo have \u0022good\u0022 expandability and is this going to be compatible with new hardware coming out in the next couple of years. I don\u0027t know much about PC building but from what I gather, Haswell (intel 4th gen) has a new chipset from the 2nd and 3rd gen (Sandy and Ivy bridge respectively) So I\u0027m assuming since this mobo is new, I should be good for a while but want to get advice from gamers. I know KSP is heavy on a CPU and you need good single core performance, so as far as I5\u0027s go, would this be the best one? (i7\u0027s are a bit much, and this one can be over clocked.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, will it be a simple \u0022transfer everything and go? I will be using the same HDD so will windows and all my stuff just be there when I plug it in? No need to install anything to make it work with a new mobo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know this goes in the space lounge Stealth2668, check where you are posting in future please \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwww but there\u0027s no traffic here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T22:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou never watch the Activity stream?

Depending on what phenom you have atm you can overclock it to get some extra speed from it (if its the 940 you can get 3.5ghz quite happily) My current i7 (bottom of the range) is retard slow but I run games fine all day long, including ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T18:38:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leonov","CreatedById":51498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T19:12:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25004-KSP-Unofficial-Official-Computer-Building-Megathread-%28All-Questions-Acceptable-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhy not join us here on the KSP Computer Building Megathread?\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
