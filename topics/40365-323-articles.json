Either way I can say for sure decouplers have nothing to do with it although root part may be a possibility. I was building a craft consisting of a stayputnic, the toroidal tank and the LV-1 with EL and crashing those on minmus. I prety much always ramed stayputnic first into the planet although I\u0027m prety sure it was the root part. Even then it was not consistant on the bounce. 2 of the dozen or so probes bounced. The first one bounced 2 times and I had to go to the space center and back to get it to crash, second bouncer probe blew up on the second impact, both landed on the stayputnic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JeffreyCor","CreatedById":93167,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T00:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, it seems that with the very minor addition to the tech in the new version, I\u0027m left with two options:\u003Cp\u003E1) I can shift the asteroid grabber into the old tech tree and continue with the existing Interstellar tech tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I can find a way of revising the tech tree should I need to make updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that SQUAD are obviously happy to stick nodes in here and there, I think option 2) makes more sense because it will allow me to future-proof Interstellar and make me more capable of adapting to future updates.
