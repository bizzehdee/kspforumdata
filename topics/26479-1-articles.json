It started out at over 450 rockets but it became tedious to load or make changes to it. Plus it blew up on the launch pad as it was much larger than the pad itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The limits I\u0027m encountering in the game have to do with the number of parts and not necessarily the number of rockets. Without struts to stiffen the chassis it won\u0027t lift off at all. However, in order to make it truly stable, I would have to strut every fuel tank, to every other fuel tank, which exponentially increases the part count. Im trying to get the most stable craft possible with the minimum number of struts in order to keep parts counts low. This was my first successful liftoff and it showed me that I need to at least re-strut the outside banks of rockets so they don\u0027t flap about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the extreme load times, and low frame rates of down to 0fps when experimenting, the work is understandably slow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate goal is to build a kind of flying parking lot which will act as a mobile launch center or landing pad, and land it somewhere else on the planet for use as an experimental test range. I want to construct buildings and use this beast to move them to their location.
