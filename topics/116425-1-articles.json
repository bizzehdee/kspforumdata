The only hope for SETI is hypothesis that other civilizations started to use radio waves in way we do millions of years ago. Otherwise that means if we assume that life is evolving at same rate on entire universe... all civilizations are at same level of development... SETI is waste of time and money, because they will get first signals in year 1502015\u002B ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut SETI is also getting signals of Earth satellites right now in real time, so they have very good understanding what is flying above our heads ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T07:03:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 07:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Darnok**"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T09:12:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ever heard of the [\u0022I Love Lucy\u0022 signal](http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=16765)? We never sent that intentionally, and any other intelligent civilization that could detect that would almost certainly figure out that it\u0027s not something you can do without something intelligent creating it.\n\u003E Fact is, as soon as we had radio communication, we\u0027ve been sending interstellar radio beacon signals. Even if they can\u0027t understand the specific information in the signals, they\u0027re clearly not something you can replicate with \u0022natural\u0022 phenomena like lightning or moon/planet/stellar magnetic fields.\n\u003E \n\u003E Additionally, I believe that when we do find such a signal, there will be a lot more people interested in finding out what sent it.\n\u003E \n\u003E In other words, it\u0027s not hard to imagine such a signal triggering another space race, or at least some kind of exploration mission.\n\nHowever we would not be able to pick it up at Alpha Centauri. TV signals are not directed so they are victim of the inverse square law. \n\nStrong directed signals like search radars can be picked up but they does not last long and don\u0027t carry much information. Perhaps the WOW signal was an search radar. \n\nWe was lucky it was directed against us.\n\nNote that we are moving away from large transmitters over to low power cell networks. In deep space laser is probably better to transmit data this leaves radar and probably emergency systems."}]}
