For example, if I want to land at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E having left Minmus, how do I ensure that I \u003Cem\u003Econsistently\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0land in the right place without needing to circularize at a low parking orbit beforehand? I am mostly referring to cases where, much like in the Apollo lunar missions, the re-entry vehicle is a simple pod with extremely limited control and which lands with a parachute. I am sure there must be a better method than trial-and-error with a lot of quicksaves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-14T03:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly think that \u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003Etrial-and-error with a lot of quicksaves\u0022 is a big part of how\u00A0\u0022some players accomplish the task with apparent ease\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI think you know the bottom of capsules, with or without heat-shields, give significant lift, so you can use the magic reaction wheels to hold an orientation to steer your path.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EA very shallow approach, periapsis above 35km altitude, maybe even a few skips before final re-entry, gives you more opportunity to change your path\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EJust one or two aero control surfaces can do a lot to let you control drag on the way down.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorTomtom","CreatedById":179540,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-14T12:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod called trajectories that shows an approximation of the point of impact when your trajectory goes through an atmosphere.
