Everything worked fine until I rearranged some modules. Now undocking or decouple doesn\u0027t work anymore and when I click the buttons, some exceptions are thrown ([Exception]: KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.).\n\nI rearranged it with a little helper craft with a docking port and a claw. I guess somehow it has something to do with the claw.\n\nI\u0027ve already spent some hours trying to fix the problem the way it\u0027s done in these threads, but nothing works:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug-How-To-Fix](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35777-Can-t-Undock-Bug-How-To-Fix)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52801-How-to-fix-the-docking-port-un-dockable-issues-%28Solution%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52801-How-to-fix-the-docking-port-un-dockable-issues-%28Solution%29)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124103-PartJoint-None-of-the-provided-nodes-was-valid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124103-PartJoint-None-of-the-provided-nodes-was-valid)!\n\n![XTV4MzK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XTV4MzK.jpg)\n\nSavegame where undocking still works:\n\n[**http://tinyurl.com/ooe8bjd**](https://tinyurl.com/ooe8bjd)\n\n![w5rFbGb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/w5rFbGb.jpg)\n\nSavegame where all ports stopped working, after I released the claw and docked to a different port:\n\n[**http://tinyurl.com/nfvhhqg**](https://tinyurl.com/nfvhhqg)\n\nThese two savefiles are almost identical and I\u0027ve deleted every other craft. I\u0027ve already compared the two savefiles line by line, but I had no luck fixing the ports.\n\nI\u0027ve tried to rearrange the modules in a different way and in this savegame some parts even explode after docking:\n\n[**http://tinyurl.com/qe3jjkc**](https://tinyurl.com/qe3jjkc)"}]}
