I need refine my encounter. But very often, when I have an orbit that has an encounter the slightly modifies the orbit, I can\u0027t seem to set a maneuver mode on the orbit before the encounter. I click on the orbit, and I always get the orbit after the ship has countered the destination and swung back around. Even if I zoom in so they aren\u0027t right on each other, I can seem to set modes on the modified orbit, but I can\u0027t seem to click on the orbit before the encounter?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
