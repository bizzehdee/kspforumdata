The refrigerators don\u0027t freeze-frame me anymore! Thanks!

I\u0027m still using Tory ramjet spaceplanes to hop around and do atmosphere test contracts, in fact. For that, I sometimes want to make suborbital hops to get those annoying around-the-world contracts done more quickly. Back when I was on my more cheaty game, I used to make spaceplanes that could make that hop, refill their tanks with liquid nitrogen from atmosphere scoops, and hop back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I can\u0027t do that--I didn\u0027t need to cheat to do it, even then; now I can\u0027t do it at all--because while refrigerators work and don\u0027t drive me insane, they\u0027re glacially slow. By the time they fill me up with liquid nitrogen, I\u0027ve flown back to base the long way. I \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Eget into the files again and put the atmosphere scoops back in the game. But I\u0027m trying to do this without hacking your mod this time. So... what are my alternatives? Water comes to mind. Not the best multipliers, but it\u0027s all over the place right? All I should need is a lake. Right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStandard drills won\u0027t pump liquid. I\u0027ve tried. Even when I gently slide my spaceplane into the ocean, they\u0027re still trying to dig up ore. Which I can\u0027t use, because while there are things available to me that could \u003Cem\u003Eprocess\u003C/em\u003E hydrates, the items that could \u003Cem\u003Estore\u003C/em\u003E hydrates are a headache-inducing distance along the tech tree from where I am. The green universal drill also won\u0027t pump liquid. Looking at it in the editor, I think it\u0027s designed to. But, when I\u0027m on land, it digs ore, and when I\u0027m on the water it says I\u0027m not landed properly. The regolith drill obviously won\u0027t do anything on Kerbin. Or Laythe, or probably Eve, which are the other planets I\u0027d like to have a refillable space-hop plane for. I have these huge water tanks in my cargo bays, but I just can\u0027t seem to \u003Cem\u003Eget\u003C/em\u003E water into them. There is no option to just \u003Cem\u003Eopen a tank. \u003C/em\u003EI\u0027ve checked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... I think right now, I\u0027ve just got nothing. I\u0027ll either have to hack something after all, or just use this as a one-hop plane and either recover it from across Kerbin or fly it back using the short-hops it can do without a closed-cycle propellant. Or rig it for compressed air again, although I get about four seconds of burn from that, since there\u0027s no way to store more than a couple of tons of it on the whole plane. In the future though, can I have a water intake? Kinda like a downward facing radial air intake that\u0027ll just pump water in whenever I slide the plane into the drink and turn it on? So I can use water as a refillable propellant? Or since the Tory has those nice, downward-facing intakes already built in, maybe it could have a water-suction mode in the control screen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ca data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181647-dave1234/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181647-dave1234/\u0022 title=\u0022Go to Dave1234\u0027s profile\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ss8913","CreatedById":94747,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-05T05:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022117389\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/117389-freethinker/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@FreeThinker\u003C/a\u003E in addition to my previous query about the gravity drag issue from a few pages back..\u00A0since the latest update, I\u0027ve observed the following changes:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Any thermal turbojet or thermal ramjet attached directly to an antimatter reactor will overheat in seconds, whereas heat management was fine prior to the patch (exact same craft).\u00A0 This is literally a 2 or 3 order-of-magnitude increase in wasteheat generation for thermal propulsion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Any such engine attached to a reactor indirectly (ie, Mk4 spaceplane, reactor inside a cargo bay, one tail structural piece separating reactor and engine) barely generates any wasteheat, but produces less thrust than before the patch.\u00A0 However the wasteheat generation is a tiny fraction of what I get when the engine is attached directly to the reactor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow much of this is intentional and how much of it is a bug?\u00A0 I can reproduce this on multiple different craft, as most of my designs are somewhat similar.\u00A0 The changes have, however, rendered most of them useless/unflyable due to the extreme wasteheat production, so I await your verdict on this before I go try and redesign everything... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: in the meantime, where are previous KSPIE builds archived?\u00A0 I may roll back to the previous version until this is addressed one way or the other.\u00A0 My entire space program is based around thermal antimatter propulsion, so I\u0027m kinda stuck at the moment \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-05T23:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2017 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ss8913\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmbomber","CreatedById":104086,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-06T01:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Everybody,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI *finally* figured out beamed power enough to get something that\u0027s at least usable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPics can be seen\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/UBb3z\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve included my tech tree to show what I had available at the time.

You could\u0027ve just added your parts as an extension to that, but with more heat and more cooling.

Then suddenly, out of the BLUE, not even a bloody temperature warning, AND not ten seconds after checking my waste heat and finding it to be fine, I got a reactor shutdown!

I suppose I\u0027ve already complained a lot, and I should\u0027ve thanked you more--overall this is a great mod, and I can hardly stand the game without it. But there are still a couple of corkers that may or may not be bugs but are maddening nonetheless. Like, as I said, waste heat. I mean what was wrong with the stock system anyway? You could\u0027ve just added your parts as an extension to that, but with more heat and more cooling. Instead we get this finicky, quirky, weird system that just seems to randomly overheat at the WORST possible moments even in a ship that is literally covered with radiators from stem to stern!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ship uses twin upgraded Tory ramjets, with attached and upgraded thermal energy converters, and radiators on almost literally every single surface I can possibly stick one on as well as no less than four inline titanium radiators for atmosphere work. It was marvelously stable for my entire flight out to catch an asteroid that was going to impact Kerbin... until I was on my landing run, having managed to de-orbit and make re-entry without losing a single part, even the exposed sample drill. Then suddenly, out of the BLUE, not even a bloody temperature warning, AND not ten seconds after checking my waste heat and finding it to be fine, I got a reactor shutdown! No engines, no chance of making a spacewalk to restart it since I\u0027d already re-entered, nothing to do but land right where I was, almost dead-stick from 23,000 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is ridiculous. I\u0027m totally messing with your radiators in my game; I hope you can manage to fit a re-work into a patch somewhere.
