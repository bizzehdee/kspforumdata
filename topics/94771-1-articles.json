This is to change the inclination of your orbit, best done at the ascending and descending nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadial In\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003ERadial Out\u003C/strong\u003E, the blue symbols, are directions perpendicular to your orbit, toward the inside of the orbit and toward the outside of the orbit. The effects of using these directions is harder to describe, it can be used while achieving orbit to prevent you from falling back down into the atmosphere and increase your apoapsis without adding to horizontal speed. In fulfilling contracts, you can use these to move your apoapsis and periapsis around your orbit to match up with the parameters of the contract. If you burn in radially at the 2 points right equidistant between your apoapsis and periapsis, radial in will twist your orbit around the planet to the left (assuming a prograde orbit), and out will twist it to the right. So if you have an elliptical orbit and want to circularize it, halfway to your periapsis, after passing your apoapsis (so you are essentially going \u0022down hill\u0022), you can burn radial out and it will take altitude from your apoapsis and add it to your periapsis, and circularize it. This is, however less efficient than circularization burns done at the apo- or periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T14:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESomeone correct me if I\u0027m wrong on any of these:\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow notepad symbol is a marker for a current contract.
