And you shouldn\u0027t be using RCS in atmosphere; it\u0027s not strong enough to overcome aerodynamic forces, so you\u0027re mostly just wasting RCS fuel. Also, any force on a spaceplane is effectively a lever on to the CoM; the closer the thruster is to CoM in regards to the relevant axis, the less rotation authority it has.
