It\u0027s been working fine, but suddenly I can\u0027t transmit anything back to Kerbin. My antenna got stuck on \u0022transmitting data\u0022 with nothing happening, and then stuck on \u0022aborting transmission\u0022.. again to no result. It\u0027s just deployed and not doing anything. Went back to the space center and returned, the antenna went back to its undeployed state. Tried to transmit again.. and now it\u0027s just counting up to 100% over and over again without end. The station has enough charge/solar power to transmit 500 science several times over but it\u0027s completely drained it and is still trying to transmit continuously. No idea what the problem is, no mods or anything that alter antennas in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to be clear.. the research lab science isn\u0027t being reset to 0 and I\u0027m not gaining any science.

It was built to carry two docked rovers to the moon with me, each of which were held attached by a junior docking ring, each of which carried the only antennae installed on the base. The first of the rovers was damaged during initial exploration, the second held the bugged antenna. I detached the rover, drove it a considerable distance from the base, and destroyed it to eliminate the bug. I then launched an autonomous rover equipped with a claw to land on the moon. After successfully landing only 3 km from the base, I drove over and attached to the base. Its antenna was able to successfully transmit the science data home, and since I loaded it with a few new science implements, I was able to increase the science production at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
