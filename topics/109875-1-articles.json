It\u0027s been working fine, but suddenly I can\u0027t transmit anything back to Kerbin. My antenna got stuck on \u0022transmitting data\u0022 with nothing happening, and then stuck on \u0022aborting transmission\u0022.. again to no result. It\u0027s just deployed and not doing anything. Went back to the space center and returned, the antenna went back to its undeployed state. Tried to transmit again.. and now it\u0027s just counting up to 100% over and over again without end. The station has enough charge/solar power to transmit 500 science several times over but it\u0027s completely drained it and is still trying to transmit continuously. No idea what the problem is, no mods or anything that alter antennas in any way.\n\nAlso, to be clear.. the research lab science isn\u0027t being reset to 0 and I\u0027m not gaining any science. The antenna is just shooting electric charge off into space without end.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T23:49:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Enorats**"},{"CreatedByName":"bunrotha","CreatedById":144456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:24:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E My antenna got stuck on \u0022transmitting data\u0022 with nothing happening, and then stuck on \u0022aborting transmission\u0022.. again to no result. It\u0027s just deployed and not doing anything. .\n\nI have had this happen to me as well. Check the logs (or Alt-F12 and the debug page.) Do you have an (orange in the live debug) line in there telling you it can\u0027t find an experiment called sciencelab@Minmus or similar? You may have to scroll for it. That\u0027s what I had. It seems to stop the antenna completing it\u0027s job.\n\nI\u0027m not an expert by any means (if one happens by, please step in. My first aid is no match for expert surgery!) but I think I may have something in a mod that\u0027s banjaxed the Science definitions (sciencedefs.cfg file) or the MPL research converter, either by superceding or stomping something vital. Are you running any mods?\n\nI have a metric shedload of mods on my system, so my next step is to take out mods and try this in a new vanilla game, then slowly add stuff back in until I find the culprit. If you have mods, I think that\u0027s the way to go to isolate the culprit.\n\nIf you\u0027re not running any mods at all and the problem still happens, please reply and let me know, as there\u0027s always a possibility, however remote, of a bug- and it saves me having to do the same.\n\nBy way of a quick fix, at the cost of research: if you do have the problem of an experiment not found, you can quicksave, **make a copy** of the quicksave file, and go hunting in the copy with a text editor for the offending experiment using the name it couldn\u0027t find- then carefully delete that stored experiment, taking care to respect the XML structure (i.e. don\u0027t mess up the brackets!) then load your amended quicksave. If the edit fails, just reload the original quicksave to be exactly where you were before, but wiser.\n\nApologies if I\u0027m giving egg-sucking lessons, don\u0027t know how much of a code geek you are.\n\nFailing that, Plan B- let\u0027s compare mods lists, that might narrow down the possible issues if we do have the same problem..\n\nEdit: Plan C, having read [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120469-Transmit-Science-bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120469-Transmit-Science-bug) , is to nuke my steam install of KSP and do over.

It was built to carry two docked rovers to the moon with me, each of which were held attached by a junior docking ring, each of which carried the only antennae installed on the base. The first of the rovers was damaged during initial exploration, the second held the bugged antenna. I detached the rover, drove it a considerable distance from the base, and destroyed it to eliminate the bug. I then launched an autonomous rover equipped with a claw to land on the moon. After successfully landing only 3 km from the base, I drove over and attached to the base. Its antenna was able to successfully transmit the science data home, and since I loaded it with a few new science implements, I was able to increase the science production at the same time."}]}
