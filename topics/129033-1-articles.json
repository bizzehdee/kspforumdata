Mainly the system ram vs Vram usage. on my unmodded ksp ksp\u0027s Vram usage is around 120-200mb in kerbin flight with a 50 part ship, while the system\u00A0ram is around 2000mb. With my normal complement of mods (around 50 including b9, opt space parts) the Vram increases to around 300mb with the same ship while the normal system ram increases to 3000-3500mb. How can this be correct? Does this mean that all the textures and graphics are saved and used from the system ram instead of the Vram which should be used for this???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn these examples i have not forced either dx11 or opengl\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm running a Asus G750 laptop with 8Gb ram and 770m with 3Gb Vram and i7 4700hq cpu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-01T12:31:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2016 12:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by EspenB89\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T14:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i remember correctly Dx11 and OpenGl store the textures in the VRAM, thats why they help with KSPs memory limitation.
