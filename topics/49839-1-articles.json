There\u0027s plenty of trial and error, which is half the fun of KSP for me, figuring out all the ways to create smoking holes beside the runway, prior to achieving a \u0022perfect\u0022 design which just works. Aside from some relatively minor irritations with it, it\u0027s not such a bad basic design, can be made to be a very easy runway to circular 100km orbit design with only some very minor tweaks (it can do 100km with ease as supplied, just needs some tweaks to make it completely easy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking of the supplied craft as a trainer is probably best, as it\u0027s pretty good for that, both in terms of training you to fly up to orbit and back, and how to fix or tweak a basically ok design from mildly irritating to good, and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T19:41:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlmost cheaty?!?

The reason I said \u0022almost\u0022 is that it\u0027s a result of a bug/design flaw in the game itself, you don\u0027t need to go breaking the game or using obscure hidden methods to do it, you just add parts onto a node. Clearly this isn\u0027t realistic, but then if we condemn that for being incredibly cheatey and bad, then half the ships we make should be deleted, right? If we had a fully modelled, realistic aerodynamic system most of the craft that we\u0027re so accustomed to using would be hideously inefficient or downright broken. We also ignore the fact that we occasionally hit G-forces that would smear Jeb all over the cockpit, and we pay no attention to things like re-entry heat. We don\u0027t design our ships to accommodate the food and water required for the years a kerbal may be in space, either. It\u0027s an exploit, sure, but the game allows it, from the unmodified SPH, without bringing a cheat console up, so if people want to use it, fine. It\u0027s certainly not on the same level as \u0022editing your stuff into orbit\u0022, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rulare","CreatedById":78060,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T20:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlmost cheaty?!?

If you\u0027re stacking intakes, why even bother? Just strap more engines and intakes to a wingless rocket, it\u0027ll still get to orbit; With intake spam it doesn\u0027t much matter how your aircraft is designed. It will go to space, because having (I\u0027ve seen up to) 56 TIMES the amount of intended intake air for the same intake surface area makes that almost impossible to mess up. With only a small amount of intake clipping I saw some guy make an aircraft that can SSTO... seven times. On one supply of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just such a crutch. With the right flight profile you can SSTO with one engine and one or two reasonably placed intakes and still bring a satellite with you into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s a sandbox game, and what other players do doesn\u0027t affect me, until they come on the forums or wherever and I get to see the fourth intake spam SSTO for the day from someone trying to score themselves some easy validation from the internets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T05:31:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ashflare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ashflare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethen half the ships we make should be deleted, right?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, not really, they should just honestly acknowledge when a ship uses a cheat and/or hack. That\u0027s my way of looking at it, that there\u0027s nothing fundamentally wrong with cheating/hacking in KSP, if you openly acknowledge that you\u0027re doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for other areas where the game is currently less than fully realistic when it comes to physics, etc, I feel there\u0027s a major difference between that and stacking intakes. The game doesn\u0027t really allow stacking them as an obviously intended mechanic, it requires a specific exploit of putting something very unrealistic onto the existing intake\u0027s front, and/or hiding them with clipping. In time, there\u0027s a good chance that the KSP physics model will gain more realism, and it\u0027s understandable that the devs have omitted certain things from it at this stage, preferring a simpler working system for now, then adding more realism to it as and when they can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one circumstance where I\u0027d feel that it\u0027s much less cheaty, and that\u0027s if you are using it to actually model something real. E.g. the supplied turbojet isn\u0027t actually that far away from the RR Olympus performance in terms of thrust, but requires 2 ram intakes to achieve that to roughly the same service altitude, where RR managed it in a single tube (RR Olympus 593 in Concorde was 169kN with a service ceiling of 60,000\u0027 / 18,300m). If there\u0027s some case-specific rationale for limited stacking along those lines, to simulate a real world component without the effort of creating a completely new part, I can get behind that thinking, considering it more of a justified hack rather than cheat. I could quite easily get behind the idea that KSP actually needs a ram intake which has significantly higher performance than the current one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpamming them with impunity, however, I\u0027ll always see that as cheating. As I said earlier, however, go right ahead, KSP rules are whatever you want them to be, more or less. For me, most of the time, I get much more satisfaction from KSP by trying to stay as close to realistic physics as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
