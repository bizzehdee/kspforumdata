Are you intake-spamming? I\u0027m guessing yes since normally you can\u0027t reach MACH speeds above about 4 before you run out of air. Also, that sort of behaviour is exactly how turbojets should behave when trying to fly them at such speeds. The failure to stop overheating is a bit odd, though. Are you using any mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barrenwaste","CreatedById":91899,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T05:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edunno, doesn\u0027t happen to me...maybe something got futzed while you updated...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T05:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Gameplay Questions and Tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pollodelfuego314","CreatedById":100696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T06:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the B9 Aerospace pack.
