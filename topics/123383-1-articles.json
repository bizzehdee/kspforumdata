First moon landing in Kerbal is such a cool experience. Had a big grin on my face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen my wife comes in and says \u0022You should go to sleep\u0022 and walks out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sitting there going... do you SEE me ON THE MOON? I mean... THE MOON. I\u0027m ON IT. Who wants sleep? Sigh. She\u0027ll never understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then I walk my kerbal back over to the lander and realize that with the lander legs out he isn\u0027t tall enough by any stretch to get to the ladder. Hrm. I didn\u0027t know about the whole jet pack thing at this point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI scratched my head, then tried a jump. Hey, some height there. So I jump him to the base ladder and start climbing up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut.... the lower ladder and the upper ladder don\u0027t quite connect so he can\u0027t get back up to the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHrm again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a rather tall skinny rocket. Not the easiest thing to land on this slight hill side, but it got the job done. I notice that if I jump from the side with the taller ground, the apex of the jump is right above the point where the ladder is disjointed... So if I can make that I should be able to crawl up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I start getting running jumps and shooting for that. Takes a couple tries, but then I nail it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI breath a sigh of relief....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I notice that a kerbal hitting a tall rocket on a hill on the mun at running speed is juuuust enough to knock it off balance. And it is now beginning to plummet to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI frantically crawl up the short ladder between my kerbal and the pod mashing B the whole way, then mashing z the moment my kerbal is in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 5 degrees from perpendicular with the mun the rocket, and salvation kicks in, though I do have some more panic trying to avoid the hill that I was then hurtling to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, in the end, I prevailed and all was well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI build very squat landers now and test the ladder on the launchpad before every mission. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-23T02:40:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2015 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SlithyTove\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
