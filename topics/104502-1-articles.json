It did an awesome job of simulating a high G rocket launch, as well as zero G in orbit. This one is way too complicated for an amateur builder.

The only real limit is how much time and money you\u0027re prepared to invest in it.\n\nAny respectable flight simulator exports all of the telemetry data you need.\n\nFor KSP, mods like [Telemachus](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24594-0-25-%282014-10-12%29-Telemachus-%E2%80%93-Telemetry-and-Flight-Control-in-the-Web-Browser) or [KSPSerialIO](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66393-Hardware-Plugin-Arduino-based-physical-display-serial-port-io-tutorial-%2809-Mar%29) (the one I use) export telemetry and accept commands. KSPSerialIO\u0027s data packet includes heading information in all three dimensions, but not acceleration vector info, so a full motion simpit might be pushing it. *For now*. But check out the [custom hardware / simpit repository thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66763-Custom-hardware-simpit-repository-For-people-who-take-KSP-a-little-too-far) for some of the impressive hardware people are building for it.\n\nX-Plane has [very detailed data packets](http://www.x-plane.com/manuals/desktop/#datainputandoutputfromx-plane) it will send via UDP. More than enough info to fling a pilot around, as well as light up a full display panel. The Orbiter forums have what looks like a rich simpit community. Flightgear, perhaps unsurprisingly, seems to have a completely customisable and extensible IO subsystem. And at that point I gave up googling.\n\nBuilding actual hardware is where it gets fun. I\u0027m not going to pretend I know much about the details.

Yes this is an major project. \n\nNow if you make an full motion one this will be harder. You need the hydraulically cylinders and the hydraulic pump and the control system, this itself looks hard as errors here and the sylinders will try to rip the frame apart. \n\nAn simpler solution might be two cylinders, one for sideway and one for tilt forward and back and then use an extra device for vibration and up down movement. \n\nNot so realistic but you can get sideway and tilt from the navbal and add an factor for g force. Accelration will then be translated to tilt up, \n\nYou obviously want to use an small cockpit here, You will not get an bubble canopy but segmented windows like on the A-10."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T13:25:24Z","Content":"...

Sure, can be done... for a couple grand.\n\nBest bet would be starting by rigging up a stationary cockpit though. I know I helped a friend build theirs. Even went so far as to building a couple instrument panels and using an arduino mega to make those operate/interface with the computer.\n\nIts a little over the top for me.
