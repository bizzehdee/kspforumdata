Regardless of what I try to do in order to reduce speed and protect them, they still somehow manage to burn up right before reentry ends. I have 2 parachutes on the side of the command module and a Mk16 on the nose. Both are rated for 2000 degrees but they never survive reentry, even when I have my pod positioned with the heat shield down and away from the chutes. I\u0027ve even tried a more gradual approach but they still burn up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a terrier with a small fuel tank in one of my stages in order to help reduce my speed, and no I am not going straight up and straight down. I am just trying do some tourist contracts right now but I\u0027ve been having this issue. I wasn\u0027t having this problem a couple days ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me? I\u0027m at my wit\u0027s end at the moment. Maybe I should try sticking a parachute in the little storage thing?
