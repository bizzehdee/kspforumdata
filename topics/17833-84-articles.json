I\u0027ve turned about 8 people on to the game and I\u0027ve always said \u0022Go screw around with rockets for a while. Then download Kerbal Engineer and we\u0027ll talk.\u0022 So I\u0027ve noticed the KER dV calculations are off in the in-flight HUD. By a factor of 2 as far as I can tell. I\u0027ve tested this three times in the same manner: 1st- rocket to achieve orbit around kerbal, running about 90/80 on the orbit. Then I\u0027ve tried to hit the mun using the in game system. Generally, with the rocket I built, it says about 30-40 seconds burn. KER says it will take 18-20 seconds(and yes, reading from the right heading, not the 1/2 time). Then I go to burn at half time and end up having to burn the whole 30-40 seconds(basically the stock calculations are correct). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else having this problem with KER? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket I\u0027m using is pretty much stock parts with a science jr. in the center and a three fold symmetric mk1 command pod/5 tanks and LV-T45 engines around it. The only non stock is the kerbal engineer part thrown on there. No other mods are installed at the moment. No fairings, none of the new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL:DR some problems with the in flight KER. Calculations from in game non-atmospheric trajectory do no agree with the in game calculations.
