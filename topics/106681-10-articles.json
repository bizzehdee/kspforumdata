Note: my only concern was that 1.0.2\u0027s atmo and/or part changes caused the old 45@10 gravity turn to be more efficient, or at best only slightly less efficient, than a proper gravity turn. My tests had been with moderately small, simple rockets that did little more than get into orbit. They were small enough and had low enough TWR that at 10km, a 45 degree turn was easy to do.\u003Cp\u003ENot so with rockets with any sort of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I finally got a chance to build and fly a plane. It was a perfect blend of .90 stock\u0027s actual ability to control planes and FAR\u0027s actual ability to glide. Flying felt both real and possible. I said in another thread that it was glorious, and I can\u0027t think of a better word for this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I\u0027m much happier with 1.0.2 now than I was last night. Though I still need to perfect my gravity turn (something I\u0027m happy to do) I can tell that this is going to be a fun, fun ride from here on out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECrossposted, it\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003EInteresting Factoid Time!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There was absolutely no change in the atmosphere from 1.0 to 1.0.2. There was a considerable increase in dragcube (i.e. not wing) drag, but a slight decrease in wing drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. 1.0\u0027s (and thus 1.0.2\u0027s) atmosphere is thicker than .90\u0027s, and so to compare drag at a given place between .90 (presumably with FAR) and 1.0.2, you need to compare density altitudes. 0.5kg/m^3 occurs around 14km in 1.0 (and thus 1.0.2). \u003Cstrong\u003ENote: In FAR, set density to ABS mode, it starts in REL mode.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. 1.0 had much, much less drag than FAR (on .90) did. Terminal velocity for the Mk1 pod was ~100m/s in FAR in .90 near sea level, and 170\u002Bm/s in 1.0. Up high, say at density-altitude 0.1kg/m^3, you could get an extra 500m/s off the same thrust on the same craft. Delta V to orbit in FAR was about 3400, minimum, 3600 average; in 1.0 it was 2800 and 3300 respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Even in 1.0.2, there\u0027s less drag up high. Top speed at 0.1kg/m^3 for the same craft with the same thrust is ~100m/s higher in 1.0.2 than in FAR-0.90. Down low, however, drag is much higher in 1.0.2 than in FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI encourage people to stop speculating and stop going off perception and to \u003Cem\u003Eactually test stuff.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKlingon Admiral: It\u0027s a good thing jets aren\u0027t rocket engines then, right? Because if they were rocket engines, that would be their thrust all the time, whereas as jets, what you\u0027re quoting is called \u003Cem\u003Estatic\u003C/em\u003E thrust for a reason.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the shuttle--it\u0027s the compromise KSP makes for not modeling wing sweep or aspect ratio. Either shuttles don\u0027t glide like that and gliders become impossible, or shuttles do have OP glide but at least perform like shuttles should at higher speeds, and gliders perform like gliders should at glider speeds. Certainly I play FAR, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut I think it\u0027s a decent compromise for not needing to model wing shape at all.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank the Maker! Seriously, are we done with this yet? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.0 wasn\u0027t perfect. 1.0.2 isn\u0027t perfect. 1.0.2 is the best compromise I see anyone making, ever, and Squad should actually be commended for pulling it off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s all remember this part here, people, because it is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIMPORTANT:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very best thing about KSP (aside from the awesome concept of the game) is the ability to be modified, and the developers support for these mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E No user is stuck playing the game they don\u0027t want. If it doesn\u0027t appeal to you (and guaranteed, pieces and parts will not), then CHANGE IT. There is a mod for that. nuFAR will do what most of you want it to. If you don\u0027t want all the headaches of nuFAR, then maybe convince Ferram to update NEAR too. If you ask really sweetly, he might just do it. I\u0027ve played a lot with both FAR and NEAR. I preferred FAR. I like the 1.0.2 compromise of the atmosphere. It isn\u0027t realistic. But it is a reasonable approximation. At some point, those of you that want more really just need to step up to FAR, and learn to play with it. It is challenging, and difficult. It will take a lot of reading and learning. But it is undeniably awesome when you get it right. nuFAR promises to be very, very cool with the vexel calculations of drag and lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP straddles an amazingly difficult line here. It teaches, it simulates, it illustrates, and it provides a very good framework that an amazingly large number of people a pretty gosh-darn good time. It gets people thinking \u0022out there,\u0022 beyond themselves and their iPhones and iWatches. People are dreaming big, thinking about space, looking at the moon with a new understanding and wonder, and IT IS GOOD. Being a stock game, it has to try to cater to the largest population of folks. It has done a very good job in this, all things considered. However, Squad knowing how obsessive and focused and detailed and knit-picky \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E am, as well as a significant portion of their fanbase, they made a decision to make modding the game a fully supported feature for those of us who want to do different things to be able to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake advantage of this. Squad isn\u0027t perfect. They may very well revisit the aero again, and again we\u0027ll have these arguments. But it is really, really pointless. If you don\u0027t like them, change them. We have an entire community built around the development, release, and support of software designed to do just that. I don\u0027t know if you really understand this, but the modders that are here and do this for free do better software development, and offer better support and customer service, than just about any organization in the world, and they do it in their spare time, for free. Take advantage of them. They are there for all your needs to tweak a little, or a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, thank you, Nathan, and also others for taking the time to really break things down and explain this for folks.
