Its easier to meet with your station and you dont loose that much of Delta-V due to your high orbit since it requieres only a few Delta-V to get you back down, also you have a higher timewarp wich often makes things so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got my mun station at 80km, minimus at 90km and vall at 50km (just to give some examples) While a lander only goes up to about 20km on mun for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust try around and you will find your own preference, just remember that a lower orbit means you normaly save Delta-V.

If you want to land on the Mun, then rendezvous with the station, then a high orbit is better, as you can make an intercept more easily with a slower moving target.
