Plane must be built with stock parts only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Plane must be capable of sustained flight on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Plane must be and SSTO for Duna atmospheric conditions (Doesn\u0027t have to work as an SSTO on Kerban).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Plane must be capable of landing on the Duna surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Plane must be capable of refueling both on the ground and in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Plane must seat 2 or more passengers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Plane must be transported to Duna with a transport vessel, no cheats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Plane must have cockpit, fuselage, wings, engines, and look like a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Give you plane a cool name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll primary objectives must be accomplished in order for your plane to be a valid submission. All submissions must include screenshots of: the launch, transfer burn, orbit of both Kerban and Duna, Landing, achieving orbit of Duna from a ground takeoff, and refueling both on the ground and in orbit. If you can show orbital refueling and ground refueling on Kerban, that is also acceptable instead of needing to launch the required craft for this task out to Duna. Otherwise submit a video of you accomplishing all of these objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus Objectives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build and transport a refueling pod out to Duna and show an \u0022On Duna\u0027s Surface\u0022 refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build a fuel transport rover of any size capable of transporting fuel to your landed plane and refuel it. Bonus points for most fuel capacity and fewest trips. Bonus points for build a craft that can refuel the surface refueling craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Build and transport a fuel station capable of landing on Duna and refuel your craft at it. Bonus points for the largest and most efficient station with the fewest parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus Points for fastest recorded airspeed, furthest distance traveled in atmosphere, fewest parts, and coolest looking with fewest parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EChallenge Ends On: 11/30/2013 If you submit anything on the 30th it will still be valid until 11:59 pm US Pacific Time\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-27T22:07:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2013 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by 700NitroXpress\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
