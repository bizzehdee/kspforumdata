Yeah, I know that\u0027s a huge stretch, but I\u0027ve seen \u0027EL paint\u0027 before that looks very similar to electroluminescent wire.

Compared to the solar layer, those would be a pretty simple thing to develop. I certainly still wouldn\u0027t recommend such a thing for road or walkways though.
