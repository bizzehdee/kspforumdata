There are four principal ways to gain more control authority:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Reaction wheels - the magic sauce that makes your basic command pod twist and turn and roll at the push of a button. Reaction wheels have a certain strength, and the heavier your rocket gets, the less affected it will be from the same reaction wheel. It might be that your rocket is so large that the built-in reaction wheel in your command pod is no longer sufficient until you drop a stage or two. There are dedicated reaction wheel parts you can add to your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Engine thrust vectoring - the ability of an engine to swivel its nozzle around to steer. How well each engine does this depends on how much thrust it creates, and on how big the angle is in which it can tilt. The latter one is the thing called \u0022gimbal\u0022 that you will find in some engines\u0027 stats. Some engines do not have any gimbal at all, and thus cannot steer using thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Atmospheric guidance - the way planes steer by means of moving control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, canards...). Stops being useful when you get above maybe 20km. At the same time, fixed wings or fins can make your rocket \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E stable, inhibiting your ability to steer it. In some cases this is useful, but in other cases, not so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Reaction control systems - or short: RCS. These are little multidirectional thrusters your attach to your ship, which run on monopropellant. You only unlock those a little later in the tech tree, I believe. They\u0027re not fully efficient inside an atmosphere and are more for in-space use, especially for rendezvous and docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmed with this knowledge, you should be able to find out why your rocket is having issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T08:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T08:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should watch this series of Tutorials.
