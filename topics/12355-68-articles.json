I feel this may help with some of it\u0027s odd corrective tendencies. I\u0027ve noticed that if the node isn\u0027t too far of where you\u0027re already facing, it doesn\u0027t roll much if at all, but when it has to make a significant adjustment it always wants to keep the roll angle of the craft at a certain angle, and it doesn\u0027t seem to be a constant either. This also means that rather than making a straight adjustment from your current angle to the needed angle is almost always a curved line instead of being straight, so tends to not be the most efficient, particularly if you\u0027re using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Picard","CreatedById":50258,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T13:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, can anyone confirm this or explain why when using MechJeb the frame rate seems to be capped at 30 whilst without it well... sky\u0027s the limit.

Thankfully, noble test Kerbal Bob (flying solo on the demonstration flight) turned out to be a good swimmer, and the Buran\u0027s command pod turned out to be more durable than I expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamics of the Buran are unusual (in KSP terms) because of some design considerations that BobCat had to incorporate to get it to fly at all. (There was a discussion of that in the BobCat Soviet pack thread that was lost in the Great Forum Apocalypse of 2013.) To make a long story short, MechJeb does not do (and has never done) a good job flying it.

I\u0027ve had multiple ships with 2M docking ports, and I get within docking range without an issue, however when I actually tell it to dock, the docking system invariably lets the ship spin up to 90 degrees before correcting. I\u0027ve even gotten the ship within five meters of the docking port, and told it to dock via mechjeb, and it invariably backs away to a distance of almost thirty meters before going into the same spinning pattern that it does before. I\u0027m not sure if this is a problem with the docking ports or what, but it\u0027s incredibly difficult to put together a space station using the docking system. I\u0027ve had to do it manually almost every time now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore interestingly, I notice that mechjeb is turning RCS on and off rapidly, in much the same way as it does SAS using any other module; this may be a coding error where instead of toggling SAS to keep the shuttle pointed forwards it\u0027s accidentally toggling RCS and getting zero results, so it keeps trying to toggle it until it detects SAS is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else able to verify this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ManFlu","CreatedById":59902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBit of an annoyance, everytime i set mechjeb the task of landing on the mun it gets to approx 1-2metres and decides it wants to flip upside down. quite annoying really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother than that it executes the maneuver perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like the above post, I believe the SAS and RCS are to blame... it is however beyond me why.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T18:34:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by ManFlu\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Innuce","CreatedById":42593,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T19:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor docking, I make sure to select the port I want to use is set to \u0022control from here\u0022, the receiving port set to \u0022target\u0022.
