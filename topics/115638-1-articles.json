Which is fine. But I have a few questions about folks\u0027 experiences/suggestions about particular mods and what they recommend for certain things. First, a non-comprehensive list of all the mods currently on the table:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Outer Planets\n\u003E - Active Texture Management\n\u003E - Chatterer\n\u003E - Community Resource Pack\n\u003E - Community Tech Tree\n\u003E - Contract Configurator, and various packs\n\u003E - Custom Barn Kit\n\u003E - DDS Loader\n\u003E - Distant Object\n\u003E - Planetshine\n\u003E - Precise Node\n\u003E - Firespitter\n\u003E - HeatControl\n\u003E - HGR\n\u003E - Interstellar Fuel Switch\n\u003E - JDiminishingRTG\n\u003E - KAS, KAX, KIS, KCT, KER, KJR\n\u003E - Kopernicus\n\u003E - KW Rocketry\n\u003E - Near Future Construction/Electrical/Props/Propulsion/Solar/Spacecraft\n\u003E - Final Frontier\n\u003E - TextureReplacer, with PimpMyKerbals\n\u003E - Critical Temperature Gauge\n\u003E - SCANsat\n\u003E - Science Alert\n\u003E - SETI (Tech Tree, Contracts, Greenhouse)\n\u003E - Station Parts Expansion\n\u003E - StationScience\n\u003E - DMagic Orbital Science\n\u003E - TakeCommand\n\u003E - Transfer Window Planner\n\u003E - USI (Not all of it, but just assume all of it)\n\u003E - Universal Storage\n\u003E - Ven Stock Revamp\n\u003E - Field Scientist Pack  \n\u003E Whew! Now, with that all in mind (and especially with things like Outer Planets, SETI, DMagic Orbital Science, and USI in mind), a few questions for the gallery:  \n\u003E \n\u003E     1. What are y\u0027all\u0027s thoughts on, or experiences with, using RemoteTech or AntennaRange with Outer Planets? Even if I use RemoteTech, I would turn off the signal delay. On the one hand, I would like there to be good reasons for me to put up satellite networks around Kerbin (and of course, would grab related contract packs in the same spirit). On the other hand, I don\u0027t want uncrewed missions to turn into a colossal pain in the butt trying to make sure relay satellites are pointed in the right direction and four different crafts are in the right places at the right times, etc. *Especially* for missions to the outer planets (Jool and beyond). Thoughts?\n\u003E     2. As you can probably imagine, my toolbar is... cluttered. Are there any recommendations for decluttering it? I tried downloading blizzy78\u0027s [Toolbar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863), but that didn\u0027t help me prune/manage my existing toolbar, it just **added a second, smaller toolbar** (and one that didn\u0027t accommodate everything I had going on in the first place, like ScienceAlert).\n\u003E     3. How much utility would I get out of something like Procedural Fairings?\n\u003E     4. I have no familiarity or experience with FAR, so I have no idea how much benefit I would get from including it. Any? Minimal? Truckloads? Any point?\n\u003E     5. Any glaring omissions you think I should be including, but am not?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     \n\u003E \n\u003E     Again, any feedback from the hive mind would always be appreciated, since I don\u0027t have any prior experience with the items above.\n\u003E \n\u003E     Cheers.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T15:18:56Z","Content":"I like Dangit!.

I could be wrong. Being further away, they might actually work better. I\u0027d have to do the math to check.)\n\nRemoteTech is a lot of fun, but its interactions with some other mods is a bit wonky. MechJeb, for example, will stop controlling the craft if it loses the comms signal, which makes no sense. The signal delay, while realistic, is, again, a bit wonky with other mods, and unless you\u0027re up to writing kOS scripts to control your probes there aren\u0027t enough mechanisms in place to deal with the signal delay in an in-game manner. There\u0027s also a huge gap between the smallest dish antennas designed for use within the Kerbin system (Kerbin/Mun/Minmus) and the next larger dishes which are designed for communicating with the inner planets. Neither is suitable for communicating between the Joolian moons. The Kerbin dishes don\u0027t have the range, and the inner planet antennae have beam widths that are too narrow to use \u0022cone\u0022 mode. You can still make it work, but it\u0027s harder than it should be. \n\nQuestion 2: (Toolbars)\n\nFor each mod that has a button in the stock toolbar, you have to go to that mod\u0027s configuration window and tell it to use the Toolbar mod instead of the stock toolbar. Then got to the toolbar mod and tell it to display the other mod\u0027s button.\n\nNot all mods have the option to use the Toolbar mod instead of the stock toolbar, so you may still have a few on the stock toolbar. Most mods have the option, fortunately.\n\nQuestion 3: (Procedural Fairings)\n\nProcedural Fairings are a little more versatile that stock, although supposedly stock got much better in 1.0.3/1.0.4 when they fixed the fairing weight. They didn\u0027t just make the lighter, but the weight\u0027s now in the fairing as it should be instead of in the base. So, you know, when you jettison the fairing the mass of the vessel actually decreases. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Stock fairings allow more control over the exact shape. Procedural fairings go about it a bit differently and are easier to use. \n\nQuestion 5:\n\nA few mods I like that I don\u0027t see on your list (I may have missed them, or you may already be using them but not included them in your list):\n\nKerbal alarm clock: This \\*completely\\* changes the game for the better in that it gives you a reasonable way to manage multiple missions simultaneously. In my opinion this should be part of the stock game.\n\nHyperedit: I don\u0027t use it to \u0022cheat\u0022, but I do use it to run \u0022simulations\u0022. Testing Tylo landers without actually having to fly each iteration of the lander to Tylo from Kerbin makes things much more fun. Same thing for Eve ascent vehicles. Note that although it has an option to change Kerbin so it mimics other planets (so you can test rockets for, say Eve, right on the launchpad), although it seems to correctly change the atmosphere and gravity, it does not change the engine performance to match the increased atmospheric pressure. So if you test for Eve on a hyperedited Kerbin, it probably won\u0027t work when you\u0027re actually on Eve because your rocket engines will be producing much less thrust than they did in your \u0022simulation\u0022 back on Kerbin.\n\nMechJeb for when you get tired of manually flying rockets with a keyboard.\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator is excellent, and unless you use MechJeb to dock for you, this really helps. In my opinion this should be part of the stock game.\n\nAction Groups Extended is excellent. In my opinion this should be part of the stock game.\n\nRCS Build Aid is pretty nice. It shows you both your wet and dry CoM so you know where to best put your RCS thrusters.\n\nWaypoint Manager lets you manage your own waypoints, as well as showing distance and bearing to the active waypoint."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:22:15Z","Content":"As this question is specifically about mods, the thread has been moved to Add-on Affairs."},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T08:10:14Z","Content":"With RemoteTech, you can set up a second \u0022command center\u0022 - six kerbals and a large probe core - which will act as a second Kerbin as far as control and delay are involved.
