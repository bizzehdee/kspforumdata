MechJeb, for example, will stop controlling the craft if it loses the comms signal, which makes no sense. The signal delay, while realistic, is, again, a bit wonky with other mods, and unless you\u0027re up to writing kOS scripts to control your probes there aren\u0027t enough mechanisms in place to deal with the signal delay in an in-game manner. There\u0027s also a huge gap between the smallest dish antennas designed for use within the Kerbin system (Kerbin/Mun/Minmus) and the next larger dishes which are designed for communicating with the inner planets. Neither is suitable for communicating between the Joolian moons. The Kerbin dishes don\u0027t have the range, and the inner planet antennae have beam widths that are too narrow to use \u0022cone\u0022 mode. You can still make it work, but it\u0027s harder than it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion 2: (Toolbars)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor each mod that has a button in the stock toolbar, you have to go to that mod\u0027s configuration window and tell it to use the Toolbar mod instead of the stock toolbar.

They didn\u0027t just make the lighter, but the weight\u0027s now in the fairing as it should be instead of in the base. So, you know, when you jettison the fairing the mass of the vessel actually decreases. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Stock fairings allow more control over the exact shape.

Testing Tylo landers without actually having to fly each iteration of the lander to Tylo from Kerbin makes things much more fun. Same thing for Eve ascent vehicles. Note that although it has an option to change Kerbin so it mimics other planets (so you can test rockets for, say Eve, right on the launchpad), although it seems to correctly change the atmosphere and gravity, it does not change the engine performance to match the increased atmospheric pressure. So if you test for Eve on a hyperedited Kerbin, it probably won\u0027t work when you\u0027re actually on Eve because your rocket engines will be producing much less thrust than they did in your \u0022simulation\u0022 back on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb for when you get tired of manually flying rockets with a keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking Port Alignment Indicator is excellent, and unless you use MechJeb to dock for you, this really helps.
