It really only comes into play when multiple ships are within physics range of each other though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is and always will be CPU bound, it\u0027s doing ALOT of physics stuff and that\u0027s hard to multi-thread properly. Physics really have to be on a single thread barring some future breakthrough in the area, this is a limitation in computing in general. Pretty much every game is bound by single core performance, you just don\u0027t notice in the other games because they are hardly using your CPU. Multiple cores are really only good for doing...multiple things. Most of the time when you are doing one thing, like playing a game; one core is doing pretty much all of the work. Why? Because there really isn\u0027t anything for the other cores to do, and no way for them to help without getting in the way.\u00A0Imagine 8\u00A0people trying to wash the same dishes,\u00A0in the same sink, with one sponge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good news is that the 1.4 update is going to bring an upgrade to the new Unity 2017 engine, which should improve performance for everyone somewhat as well as eliminate some nasty garbage collection issues/memory leaks KSP has always had. However this won\u0027t magically change how physics/multi-core computing work so it\u0027s not going be a magical solution to your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-08T22:37:26Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2017 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Rocket In My Pocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
