By the time that patch was applied, I had already given up on Mk1 fuselage-based stuff and was working with Mk2. There were a fair number of us in 1.0.4 working on high dV spaceplanes for long-range missions, and based on this thread none of them seem to be very happy. The thick atmosphere high up makes trying to circularize on the nuke engines quite a bit harder. Doing that is always a narrow-margin exercise, and that little bit of extra drag up there made it seem to me like I would have to increase TWR a fair bit, i.e. boost less fuel and/or ship more oxidizer. On top of that, while I could just get to 1500 m/s on air plus the nuke, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t sustain that speed to nearly the same altitudes as I could in 1.0.4, so I had to switch to bipropellant quite a bit earlier. It will be interesting to see later how getting the body lift back may mitigate all these problems. It also seems like they fixed the intake air situation with that patch, as I noticed I needed significantly more intakes to keep flying up high afterwards, but OTOH my range seemed higher once I had enough. If they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve fixed it so that this thicker air now sustains combustion in proportion to its drag, then we might be in a different movie...\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E...So I went back to my old plane and tried it, and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s definitely better than it was before the patch. Nonetheless, it still can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make orbit the way it is and will need to ship more oxidizer. I suppose with the cheaper transition to supersonic flight, that might actually work out to more or less a wash.
