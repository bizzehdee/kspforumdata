LOD doesn\u0027t yet check its exact error code (added that, now), but its most likely out of memory. We have to see how else we can reduce the amount of memory used. v3 aims to reduce LODs own footprint while loading stuff, especially removing spikes in bad situations. Another bunch of memory are high res textures currently loaded by LOD. After v4 i hope to implement support for DXT compression to make loaded textures smaller.
