Say you have 4X symmetry for reaction controls on the CM, and you are using 6X for boosters. If you move the mouse past the 4X stuff, the symmetry changes to 4 from 6, and it locks up. It might happen more with the big SRB because it\u0027s so bloody hard to place them properly as the pointer has to be on the booster (which then seems to center), as well as over the radial separator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking it\u0027s reproducible this way (brush past a different symmetry while moving a large SRB).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T10:20:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game does have a bit of an annoying feature where if you\u0027re attaching something to a part that was itself attached using symmetry, the only options it will allow you to select are the symmetry of the part you\u0027re trying to attach to, and 1x.
