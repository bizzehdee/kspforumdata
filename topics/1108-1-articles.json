By the time the boosters are done I\u0027m well above 10 km, and by the time I get the orbit rounded out, I\u0027m always at 150-300 km, with anywhere from 75% to 150% of a tank of fuel left.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot15.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13297749/screenshot15.png)\n\nYou know it\u0027s a good design when all three Kerbals are smiling!

The \u0027orbiter\u0027 section (chute, capsule, decoupler, fuel, fuel, engine) still makes it EASILY into orbit with one whole tank left."},{"CreatedByName":"Eyes","CreatedById":4416,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-28T14:16:48Z","Content":"I tried this, and it\u0027s floating at around 1500K.

I left them orbiting all night last night. got up this morning and had enough fuel to do a deorbit burn (started just before perikee so there wasn\u0027t as much velocity to kill) and brought them safely home.\n\nWell, several hundred kilometers from \u0027home\u0027, but they were safely on the ground anyway."}]}
