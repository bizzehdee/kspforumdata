They both have excellent ideas about how sanity could be implement through kerbal interaction and with parts.\u003Cp\u003EThings to think about in relation to sanity: Communication (you already got this), Entertainment, Crew interaction (might just require two or more kerbals occupy the same part? Or more?), Living space(people will go insane after years of being stuck together with other people without personal space), Personality (would Courage/Stupidness do anything?), Veterancy (experienced kerbals will take much longer to stress out and go insane),\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust to add a few more to your list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESeniority / rank?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EChain of command - who is the commander etc?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T10:55:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022codepoet\u0022 data-cite=\u0022codepoet\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have ummmmed and arrrrrred over the idea of sanity mods, and there is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69532\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread \u003C/a\u003EI started with some of my ideas.

So the risk is that your mod introduces a new gameplay problem that is solved by adding a part. It turns out that this does not make the game more fun - it just increases the size of your booster.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhat to do when kerbals loose their sanity? They could top themselves - but then this is the same as them dying because they ran out of food or oxygen. If they just dies when they run out of \u0022sanity\u0022 then you might as well use a life support mod with a new resource called \u0022sanity\u0022. It turns out that this will not make it much more fun either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow do kerbal characteristics affect their sanity? I played around with this in my KerbalSocial idea, but it turns out that there is just a level of sanity that the kerbal tends-towards and then flat lines. It turns out that this is not much fun because the level is either acceptable or not in which case you either win or loose. Where is the gameplay challenge?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe alternative to sanity levels tending towards a level in a given situation is that that increase or decrease over time. If this is the case then decreasing sanity puts you back in the situation where you have got x days to complete you mission before you kerbal tops himself. Where is the fun in that? - It just limits which bodies you can reach.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAnother problem is how to get sanity to respond to events? It would be nice if kerbals freaked out if they thought they did not have delta-v to get home, but how to implement this?
