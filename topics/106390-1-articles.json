Played around with the research options for the first time in my new vanilla unmodded career game. When i wanted to return to space center (ESC - menu -\u0026gt; space center button) nothing happened. No errormessage either and the button space center wasn\u0027t displayed orange. Then i thought i try to tab thru nearby vessels, probably changing vessel helps. Tabbed into a burned out stage that was floating nearby. Same, can\u0027t go to space center. Also tabbing further lead to me floating without ship or anything in space and the errormessage that no vessels are nearby and i should select one in map view. Went to map view but don\u0027t get any right click or left click menues on anything. So this was also not an option. This is really a game breaking situation, lost like 2h gameplay and ended up reverting to launch of my shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing i can think of which might have caused this is the new research option of the lab module with which i played around a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post the logs please DocMoriarty, there should be an error in there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
