I saw a team of developers that, after working on this thing for 4-6 years, probably have a crazy huge list of mind blowingly awesome things that they\u0027re working on, but before they\u0027re ready to move forward, they wanted the heart and soul of this incredible fan base to be a part of their development. They released an very limited early access version that they knew only the biggest die hard fans would get right away, and want to use our initial thoughts and reactions as a part of their UX research process, with a promise that they\u0027re going to keep grinding away at the development of this game. I honestly don\u0027t know a dev team that\u0027s this devoted to their fanbase that they would do so much to show that they\u0027re not only diehard fans themselves, but also willing to let us play this much of a role in the development of this game. It gives me goosebumps, ngl. Anyway that\u0027s just my two cents about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
