In this case I broke up the following SRB into 8 sections and then rotated and mirrored tha new sections to complete the cylinder. When imported into Unity, however, the seams are visible when specular is enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe textures are mirrored, so this problem shouldn\u0027t be caused by the texture, but rather the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve removed the normal map, so that isn\u0027t causing the problem either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rLE79\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

You are a way better texture artist than me so im not sure how much i can contribute here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst im going to assume you are using a baked speculear map. it doesnt look like you didnt merge doubles after mirroring but then again you didnt mention it. Perhaps you used the mirror modifier in blender that does that for you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut if the issue lies in the spec map i guess id suggest baking your spec map after adding a circulear array(if youre using blender) so your object looks like it will when complete while baking. Since baking is dependent on geometry flow, any edges(like on a 90degree cone segement) will catch highlights etc. Near those edges that would not be there on the completed(360 degree part) i use circulear arrays but ive seen some people use rotated duplicates while baking too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway. For repeating/tiling textures on cylinders/cones it might be a good idea to use arrays instead of mirrors as the resulting uvs and geometry will be arranged going in one direction But im not an expert on the subject\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T03:08:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by landeTLS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T10:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you sure the mesh is manifold?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a normal map?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T13:00:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard edges? you sure everything is welded properly after your mirror operation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
