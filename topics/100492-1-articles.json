I\u0027ve included the original, larger sizes as well because it is nicer to look at; 256x160 is pretty tiny. I also made a Valentina\u0027s Day Contest submission that I was pretty proud of so I wanted to post that here too. I\u0027ll try to put any flags I make in the future here too, if I remember.\n\nFirst, here is my Valentina Art Contest submission, featuring Val and Jeb. It turned out a millions times better than I expected, since the sketch I was working off of was made in about 10 minutes or less, and I\u0027ve also never really done anything like this, starting completely from scratch. Usually I am working from a photo or something. If you like it, by all means **voice your opinion** in the official contest thread [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110612-Valentina-s-Day-community-contest/page16). A very hires version can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/MVFtinB.jpg) if you want to see all the little details I put into it, or play Wheres Waldo with the mistakes I made.\n\n **\u0022Kapture the Flag\u0022** \n\n![Q5goDwK.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q5goDwK.jpg)\n\n**Flags**\n\nRocket Capsule\n\nThis is the first flag I made for KSP. It is still my favorite but I seem to have lost the larger version of it.\n\n![5kFRhLf.png](http://i.imgur.com/5kFRhLf.png)\n\nKonstellation Series\n\nMade for Superpowasonik\n\n3 versions of a flag based on the emblem for NASA\u0027s cancelled Constellation Program.\n\n![2KkhJaD.png](http://i.imgur.com/2KkhJaD.png)\n\n![EWfpfz7.png](http://i.imgur.com/EWfpfz7.png)\n\n![pevWp3J.png](http://i.imgur.com/pevWp3J.png)\n\n![CcUQsvH.png](http://i.imgur.com/CcUQsvH.png)\n\n![N6Bc5bw.png](http://i.imgur.com/N6Bc5bw.png)\n\n![ufceOHt.png](http://i.imgur.com/ufceOHt.png)\n\nLathe \u0026 Jool\n\nMade for DMSP\n\nA flag with Lathe Floating in front of a field of swirly Jool.\n\n![YP9QdQf.png](http://i.imgur.com/YP9QdQf.png)\n\n![g5cwnew.png](http://i.imgur.com/g5cwnew.png)\n\nEeloo Star\n\nMade for DMSP\n\nEeloo with a star/ship going to it. Requester wanted it to stay simple/cartoonish.\n\n![IIXCfXN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/IIXCfXN.jpg)\n\n![OMdvR2Y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OMdvR2Y.jpg)\n\nAlbatross\n\nMade for Sampa\n\nThe requester wanted a flag for an epic explorer and the Wandering Albatross seemed like the best way to convey that idea. This is probably my second favorite of the ones I\u0027ve made so far.\n\n![Jq1bNu7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Jq1bNu7.jpg)\n\n![sr8Owg5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sr8Owg5.jpg)\n\nRomaKerbal\n\nMade for r4pt0r\n\nThis is supposed to look like a mix of the Roman Empire and KSP.\n\n![OU5POdY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OU5POdY.jpg)\n\n![JMCup79.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JMCup79.jpg)\n\nEagle\n\nMade for Superpowasonik\n\nJust a flag with a bird on it. The bird is based off Panem\u0027s flag/emblem but with the wings changed.\n\n![a5dIFKZ.png](http://i.imgur.com/a5dIFKZ.png)\n\n![YorVSme.png](http://i.imgur.com/YorVSme.png)\n\nHalo Paw\n\nMade for SelectHalfling0\n\nAn enlarged and improved version of the requester\u0027s Halo Clan emblem.\n\n![vLQP8Ug.png](http://i.imgur.com/vLQP8Ug.png)\n\n![czlMGgk.png](http://i.imgur.com/czlMGgk.png)\n\nRocket Portugal\n\nMade for Eunito\n\nA kerbalized version of the flag of Portugal, with a golden, decoupling Saturn V.\n\n![h2Rjdrz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/h2Rjdrz.jpg)\n\n![NgOvXqm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NgOvXqm.jpg)\n\nKpain\n\nMade for EpsilonGalactic\n\nA kerbalized version of the flag of Spain, along with a flag that is just the Coat of Arms over transparency. Spain\u0027s motto means \u0022The Great Beyond\u0022 which is about as kerbal as you could ever hope for in a motto.\n\n![Rku2qzt.png](http://i.imgur.com/Rku2qzt.png)\n\n![P7RM22I.png](http://i.imgur.com/P7RM22I.png)\n\n![VAaBm6W.png](http://i.imgur.com/VAaBm6W.png)\n\n![qQazahz.png](http://i.imgur.com/qQazahz.png)\n\nMobius\n\nMade for Zodiak\n\nA simple mobius strip design, based on Zodiak\u0027s original design.\n\n![RPoH6gS.png](http://i.imgur.com/RPoH6gS.png)\n\n![t8ay0yG.png](http://i.imgur.com/t8ay0yG.png)\n\nBebop\n\nLooking back through some non-KSP related art today, I saw this and thought it would make a cool flag for any Cowboy Bebop fans out there.\n\n![MvbF4ga.png](http://i.imgur.com/MvbF4ga.png)\n\n![g3LgRlc.png](http://i.imgur.com/g3LgRlc.png)\n\nKerbalkind\n\nMade for MrWalrus123\n\nA flag meant to represent all of Kerbalkind.\n\n![PDL5N4y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PDL5N4y.jpg)\n\n![QP5Qyou.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QP5Qyou.jpg)\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nP.S.
