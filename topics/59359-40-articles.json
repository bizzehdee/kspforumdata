That image is of the original design before I noticed the clipping problems. I\u0027d love to see how it looks with the new part in-game though. Anyone want to try it out? I won\u0027t be on KSP for another 18 hours. Be sure to use the correct athlete part for the top (I forget its name).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T01:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiusInfuser\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I won\u0027t be on KSP for another 18 hours.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know at what point your relationship with KSP is when you start counting in \u003Cem\u003Ehours until playing again\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T13:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, guess what, I found an amazing thing to go with the new legs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/i9J6as7rOkbHY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i9J6as7rOkbHY.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.minus.com/i19PdLNkq8ZOC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i19PdLNkq8ZOC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the LV-1B from Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp.
