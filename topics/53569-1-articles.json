Semi-deployed parachutes (what you get before they hit 500m altitude and fully deploy) still offer more drag than stowed parachutes, so having them out earlier means you\u0027ll slow down more before they jerk you to a halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, if you\u0027ve got any fuel or engines left, use it to slow your descent just before the parachutes open.

Just before 500m above the surface, when the chute deploys, burn all of your engines to slow yourself as much as possible and relieve the strain on the lander can/chute connection. Once the single chute is deployed, open all of the others immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T22:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any ability to provide thrust at all?

The lander can doesn\u0027t have a very strong connection at all... I was actually able to spin my craft with reaction wheels alone to snap it off and send it flying.
