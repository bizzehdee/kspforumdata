That news room isn\u0027t even there, that\u0027s a computer too.\u0022 Not that I don\u0027t think CGI is cool, but there\u0027s far less creative thinking involved in creating an effect that nobody has ever seen before. I\u0027ve actually become more interested in stagecraft lately for this very reason, because non-digital wizardry is still being used there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T14:47:46Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunrana","CreatedById":138830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T16:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was watching Star Trek TNG the other day, and they had a moon entering the atmosphere of a planet at apogee.
