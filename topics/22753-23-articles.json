Advsasmoduletoggle.dll a plugin used in this mod, the .dll is on the \u0027old\u0027 loctation because (I guess) it needs to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... KAS.dll (ok, this might need to be removed, as KAS has been updated, not sure, I deleted it because I have the Full KAS 0.20 version already)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... Romfarer.dll, \u0026lt;I beleive Bobcat was going to delelte this as it was an older version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;ships\u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u0026lt;vab\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... ... iss.craft files. this is the premade ISS.craft file, for referance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elooking at the 0.051.zip file I just got from the Spaceport, all I see is that the KAS and Romfarer .dll are in there. other than that, EVERYTHING is right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eremember that the ISS effort is multi-authored. many peoples hands are in it. and some aspects of it are still \u0022v0.19\u0022-ish, but most of it has been moved to the v0.20 style \u0026lt;gameData\u0026gt;. since I have Lazor, and KAS already, I simply deleted the v0.19 files for them, and left the AdvSas .dll \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was referring to was the \u0026lt;Plugins\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PluginData\u0026gt; directories - if these are used then they should be beneath the ISS directory - otherwise if another mod comes along that could overwrite those files if copied into the \u0026lt;GameData\u0026gt; directory they could be overwritten with another version which could break compatibility with the existing mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am saying is although it creates duplicate files it would be better if the \u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;PluginData\u0026gt; were in the actual mod directory as then nothing but a new version of the mod could overwrite them ; ensuring that even if you do download a new version of the KAS or Romfarer dlls through the installation of another mod that the new mod will not touch in anyway the existing mod ; thus ensuring that both will still work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf those files are 0.19 files then they shouldn\u0027t IMHO be in the GameData directory at all as that is only for 0.20 mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMulti Authored or not - All mods need to follow a standard set by the developers and I have not yet seen that standard defined - keeping the \u0026lt;GameData\u0026gt; directory only for \u0026lt;mod directories\u0026gt; and then everything else below the \u0026lt;mod directories\u0026gt; ensures that parts can not overwrite other parts which was one of the most annoying things about 19.x.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WCOLE360","CreatedById":57227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:37:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EATV \u002B Ariane 5 released! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/12106-0-20-Lionhead-Aerospace-Inc-ATV-Ariane-5-released-now-%21%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/12106-0-20-Lionhead-Aerospace-Inc-ATV-Ariane-5-released-now-%21%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T12:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah I got it before you posted that :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T13:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol I forgot to update ksp \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keenan Smith","CreatedById":60992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m Doing an Antares/Cygnus mod if you\u0027d like to know more here\u0027s the Forum link:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33066-Orbital-Systems-Antares-Cygnus/page2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33066-Orbital-Systems-Antares-Cygnus/page2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:46:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecool, love to see it when its done, also im gonna look around for a COSMOS sat...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keenan Smith","CreatedById":60992,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T14:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s my first mod so it\u0027ll take a While... i\u0027m currently still in the info Gathering stage but not for long... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poldarias","CreatedById":58016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T15:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecool!
