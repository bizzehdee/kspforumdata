I had trouble getting the log to post without killing the page so I started from the line which logs the change from loading to the main menu. it is posted \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/vCxam3vi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eat pastebin\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed is that the error which is spammed at the end includes the term \u0022BOSS\u0022 which I think has something to do with the Ordan telescopes mod. I had assigned controls for the Ordan telescope\u0027s camera to action groups and then I realized that the hotkeys for the lazor system use some of the same numbers. could this be part of the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EUnityException: Input Key named:  is unknown\u003Cbr\u003E  at (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Input:GetKeyDownString (string)\u003Cbr\u003E  at UnityEngine.Input.GetKeyDown (System.String name) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at BOSS.OnUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at Part.ModulesOnUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E  at Part.Update () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q6WTnFg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022q6WTnFg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try mapping the camera\u0027s function\u0027s to a different action group and relaunching the craft.
