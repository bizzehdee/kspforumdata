It seem like the Scancom is not present at all when I have it at lauchpad. I made the assumption that the JSAT folder is put into Game Data as most of the mods. However, the ModuleManager that came with the zip.file was different to the one I use (version 2.7.6). Is my version of ModuleManager causing this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf any of you have tested the mod or have any input in this matter, please leave a comment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-29T20:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse the most recent version of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and dont have muliples of it in GameData.
