Started in career mode and never looked back. Currently have a bunch of kerbals stuck on Mun that are looking back though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I now have been able to advance up to tech tree for a bit after landing on the two moons and proudly launched my first space... thing. Station is a bit too optimistic as docking is 50/50 at this point. It has the MPL-LG-2 module installed on it, but whenever its used it returns (after processing) with \u0022Not Enough Data Storage\u0022. However, the data does take up some of the 500 space it has on board. Transmitting does not yield any science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something? I looked over the wiki, but didn\u0027t see anything. Full disclosure, I have the recovery mode installed, as I got annoyed that I couldn\u0027t figure out how to recover parachuted in-atmosphere parts. I also have the space station science mod installed, but I haven\u0027t gotten that far yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a great game!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T16:44:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ASmallHero\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlanP","CreatedById":148656,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-17T03:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome seems like you are doing well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science processing lab requires a Kerbal scientist or two and takes time to produce science and a lot of electricity so have alot of solar panels.
