So valuable in fact, that they were one of two options in the decision about NASA\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s post-Apollo future (the other being a manne Mars mission). They are valuable because they allow us to gather data over an extended period of time, something which is not possible with a normal spacecraft. This can be scientific data or data about long-term performance of both man and machine in the dangerous environment of space. Both require an extensive infrastructure to provide enough power, life support and living space. KSP does not do any of this very well or at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Would KSP Need?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo things are necessary to make space stations the valuable research platforms with large crews that they are in real-life: science-over-time and an incentive to have large crews.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience-Over-Time\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad hasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t been too welcoming of the idea of science-over-time (SOT). It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been described as too easy. I agree with that, but only SOT when landed. The challenge in surface science lies in directing your spacecraft to its ideal location. Once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve landed, there is no more challenge. This is different with space science. In space you can be in a safe, stable orbit or on a flyby course or even an impact course. At the moment, due to instantaneous space science, flyby or impact courses are ideal. They require less maneuvers and less Delta-v, which all means it requires far less skill. An orbit might help you with the couple of experiments that offer biome-specific science in orbit, but that kind of science is so boring and tedious to gather that it is often skipped. An orbital science lab also has some use, but this is also quite limited due to the setup of the science system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you HAD to get in a stable orbit before you could do certain types of science, then that would add more variety. SOT is an ideal way to achieve this kind of science. The time requirement would require a stable orbit and it could introduce the need for a decent power infrastructure (at the moment you can get away with very few solar panels, simply because there are few parts that draw power over an extended period of time). SOT would allow you to easily get science by timewarping. But since there is first the challenge of building a space station with the necessary science and power parts, as a whole orbital SOT requires skill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECrew Incentive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA real space station needs to be manned though and by a decent-size crew too. In stock KSP, most manned missions can be done, and are more easily done, with a single crew member. How to prevent that from happening to space stations as well? One could require a minimal amount of Kerbals per lab \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0 la the MPL-LG but that would put an upper limit on the Kerbals you would need. You could just move your Kerbals from one science experiment to the next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA more ideal solution would be to add a bonus to science based on the amount of crew members on the craft that the science part is attached to. It would raise the maximum value that could be extracted from the science experiment in that area (ex. Low orbit around the Mun). To prevent 100-man stations gaming the systems, there would be diminishing returns. Let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s say an experiment has a normal maximum value of 10. A 1-man crew or an unmanned probe would not change this value, but a 2-man crew would increase it to 15. A 3-man crew would make it 17.5, a 4-man crew would get 18,75 and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your views on this suggestion or on KSP space stations in general?

The problem is that not everybody finds space station building and maintenance fun and rewarding and introducing game rewards for that will not make it any more fun for them, it will only turn to achievement/economy hunt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real world, the main purpose of space stations (should we even use plural here?) is research of materials and organisms behavior in microgravity. There is a lot of research to be done and it goes very slow, with results turning to practical improvements over the course of many years. Even with that, there is only so much to be researched in microgravity and over (very long) time there will be very little left to research/discover on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, you get your first little ship to orbit and bam, you have all the microgravity research done in one step.
