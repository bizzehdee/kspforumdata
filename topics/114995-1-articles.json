They are meant to answer this general question:\n\n- What is the **optimal engine** for a given **payload mass** and **desired** **\u0394** **v**, subject to a **minimum TWR** (or acceleration) restriction, where by *optimal* we mean that the resulting ship should have the least possible mass?\n\nThe calculations include the dry mass of the tanks and consider a variable number of engines to satisfy the TWR restriction. The purpose of these charts is not to design the ship for you ([there are tools](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65011-WEB-1-0-KSP-Optimal-Rocket-Calculator-v1-19) for that), but to provide general guidelines about which engines are the best choices for a wide range of circumstances.\n\nThese charts are inspired by [tavert\u0027s original engine charts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR), which I continued (with a different approach) and expanded for 1.0 [in a previous post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121565-Optimal-engine-charts-for-1-0-2).\n\n**How to use the app**\n\nBasic instructions:\n\n1. Choose a **fixed variable** out of Payload mass, Minimum TWR or Delta-v. The remaining two variables will be on the axes of the 2D plot.\n2. Fill in the **chart parameters**, including payload and \u0394v ranges, minimum TWR, atmospheric pressure and maximum number of engines.\n3. **Select the engines** that should be included in the analysis.\n4. Click \u0022Calculate!\u0022 and the chart will appear; details will be shown on the panel to the right.\n\nYou can get more help by opening the collapsible areas by clicking on the ![NFNajr8.png](http://i.imgur.com/NFNajr8.png) buttons. Some extra details are also given by mousing over the ![lHS0fQw.png](http://i.imgur.com/lHS0fQw.png) tooltips.\n\nThe chart is interactive:\n\n- **Mouse over** the chart to see details for the point under the mouse in the panel to the right.\n- **Click on** the chart to lock the details panel to a specific point in the chart; click again to unlock.\n- **Click-and-drag** to pan the currently displayed view; the chart will be recomputed with the new ranges.\n- **Hold** the **CTRL key** and click-and-drag to zoom the chart to the selected area.\n- Use the **button controls** under the chart to change the ranges, recall previous settings or save the chart.\n\n**Further details and assumptions**\n\n- **Single-stage ship**. As we all know, dropping mass is the way to reach higher \u0394v budgets, but I\u0027m keeping it simple here. As a rule of thumb, above ~5000 m/s it\u0027s probably better to use multiple stages.\n- **Ship has only one engine type**, since testing all possible engine combinations would require a different approach.\n- **\u0022Payload\u0022** is defined as everything that is *not* the propellant, tanks or engines used to push the actual payload around. This means \u0022payload\u0022 includes stuff like structural elements required to mate the actual payload to the tanks/engines.\n- **Propellant quantity is treated as a continuous value**, so tanks are considered infinitely divisible. While this is not entirely realistic, one could approximate this in practice by using a large numbers of small tanks. In this respect tavert\u0027s original analysis is still superior. This means that the analysis can be inaccurate for light (\u003C 2 tonnes) payloads.\n- **The thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR) restriction** should be used to ensure solutions remain practical (sure, a single LV-N pushing 1000 tonnes will have fantastic \u0394v, but burns will take *forever*). Note that Kerbin-relative TWR is equivalent to minimum acceleration measured in standard gees.\n- **Assumes the full-to-dry mass ratio of the tanks is 9** in general, except where noted. All \u0022rocket\u0022 LFO tanks have this ratio in 1.0.4, while the \u0022spaceplane\u0022 LFO tanks (i.e. Mk2-Mk3 tanks) have slightly worse ratios, very close to 8.\n- **The change to liquid fuel-only for LV-N is accounted for**, and I\u0027ve used a tank full-to-dry mass ratio of 8 for it, which closely matches the ratios of the Mk2 and Mk3 liquid fuel-only fuselages.\n- **The KR-1x2 \u0022Twin Boar\u0022 liquid booster** is treated by discounting 4 tonnes from its mass, which is the dry mass of one orange tank; the propellant it can carry and the dry mass of the tank are included elsewhere in the calculation.\n- **The RAPIER is only considered operating in closed-cycle mode**, i.e. \u0022rocket mode\u0022 using liquid fuel and oxidizer.\n- **For the O-10 monopropellant engine**, I\u0027ve assumed a full-to-dry mass ratio of 7, which is close to the average value for the *larger* tanks; the smaller tanks have worse ratios.\n- **For the \u0022Dawn\u0022 engine** the full-to-dry mass ratio is assumed to be 2.3, roughly that of the xenon tanks. Also, by default the analysis will include an extra 100 kg of mass per engine, which accounts for the mass of the solar panels required to continuously operate the engine *at Kerbin\u0027s distance form Kerbol*. This extra mass can be turned off with a checkbox.\n- **Engine specs for 1.0.5** are used throughout, extracted directly from the game\u0027s .cfg files.\n- **Airbreathing engines and SRBs** are left out of the analysis, for now.\n\n**Formulas** \n\nFor a given desired \u0394v and payload mass (m\\_payload), the optimal (i.e. minimum) total mass of the ship for a given engine type is:\n\n![vxRIrJm.png](http://i.imgur.com/vxRIrJm.png)\n\nwhere m\\_engine is the mass of the individual engine, I\\_sp its specific impulse, g0 standard gravity (assumed to be 9.81 m/s^2), and the number of engines, n\\_engines, is given by\n\n![mqJ5rDE.png](http://i.imgur.com/mqJ5rDE.png)\n\nwhere TWR\\_min \u003E 0 is the minimum required Kerbin-relative thrust-to-weight ratio of the ship, TWR\\_engine that of the engine by itself, and ![807e2debc359ab4b141d93f1b47e6742.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/0/7/807e2debc359ab4b141d93f1b47e6742.png) is the *ceiling function*, which indicates to round the result *up* to the next integer. If no TWR restriction is imposed (i.e. TWR\\_min = 0), n\\_engines is simply 1.\n\nIn these two formulas, the parameter alpha (\u03B1) is defined as the *propellant**-to-dry* mass ratio of the tanks; it is equivalent to the conventional *full-to-dry* mass ratio *minus one*:\n\n![9sTrH8C.png](http://i.imgur.com/9sTrH8C.png)\n\nFinally, the calculation requires computing the maximum theoretical \u0394v of a the engines, which depends on \u03B1 and the minimum TWR as\n\n![PVEL6Mg.png](http://i.imgur.com/PVEL6Mg.png)\n\nHere\u0027s a plot of this quantity for some of the engines (click for larger image):\n\n[![OXHJ2tnm.png](http://i.imgur.com/OXHJ2tnm.png)](http://i.imgur.com/OXHJ2tn.png)\n\n**Planned/suggested features**\n\n- ~~Option to plot a different set of variables as the axes of the plot (e.g., minimum TWR vs. \u0394v for a given payload mass)~~\n- Option to determine optimal engine by *propellant mass*, not total ship mass\n- Ability to add user-defined engines\n- Cost information?\n- Engine pics\n- ... suggestions are welcome!\n\n**Changelog**\n\nSpoiler\n\nVersion 1.1.2 -- April 28, 2016\n\n- Updated engine stats to KSP 1.1.1 (no changes since 1.0.5 though).\n\nVersion 1.1.1 -- March 2, 2016\n\n- Changed default maximum number of engines to 10\n- Other minor fixes (e.g. default fixed variable is now correctly set, fixed min/avg/max row display in runner-up details).\n\nVersion 1.1.0 -- February 22, 2016\n\n- New feature: fixed variable selector.

It\u0027s common that one has a specific payload mass in mind, and wants to have an idea of what engines are good for a range of jobs. Or maybe one has a particular mission\u0027s delta-v in mind and wants to determine what engines would be appropriate for a range of payload masses.\n\nI also uploaded the project to Github, for personal convenience and for code sharing (it\u0027s all GPLv3, of course): [https://github.com/meithan/engine_charts](https://github.com/meithan/engine_charts). Feel free to browse the code, fork it if you so like or submit pull requests (@gfrodo will be particularly interested, I gather).\n\nThe next feature on the roadmap is to add alternative ranking choices for what\u0027s considered the \u0022best\u0022 engine: I\u0027m thinking propellant mass and tankage\u002Bengines total cost as obvious choices. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to implement but let\u0027s see how the week\u0027s work comes out.  \n\nCheers all, and thanks for your interest and support (bug reports welcome of course)."}]}
