WHY ? how ? what\u0027s the advantage of confetti over clamshell ? the small pieces get stuck in between other parts of the rocket way too often... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) the texture... that\u0027s subjective, but really, the yellow line repeating over and over when the fairing gets long looks very weird.

You have to make some kind of lip, make the fairing wider than the base (much wider than the payload) in order to build it. The only way is not to use an adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s the fact that the text saying wether it can be placed shifts from light green to light brown, difficult to see, and sometimes when you click while it says that you can\u0027t place a cross-section, the text will never turn to green again... Very very annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i wish that it was possible to make rounded fairings, so far they are always pointy-ish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery last thing, why are the fairing bases so heavy and so large/thick ? Having to use a 1 ton part for a very small interstage is disturbing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : forgot to mention the interstage fairings that cannot be closed around adapters (you\u0027d think that\u0027s were an interstage is closed....) and that provide no structural joints like the engine fairings do, along with the \u0022cannot activate engine while stowed\u0022 nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2 : Don\u0027t get me wrong, the fact that we have fairings is awesome already, this is just a list of stuff that could objectively be improved, i\u0027m not whining as if it was terrible (although some aspects are...).
