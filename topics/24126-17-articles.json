Its about 8 tons to heavy for Duna and probably more then twice for Laythe but I will refuel in LKO with a smaller SSTO that will bring plenty off fuel to top all the tanks up so I can get it to Laythe. Its 3 tons more then I lifted before so I will run out of jet fuel before I run out of intake air, thats the big problem so thats why refueling will be needed. Also added JATO sens I cant realy rotate more then 6-7 degrees (plus it looks awesome in a video) with an over sized payload unlike the 10 degrees or so required to take off and it was close enough with 43 tons so 46 tons is even harder. But JATO seems to work if timed right after that is climbs fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel tanker has RCS to and 4 landing legs that will be useful if you get a flat. A bit of a problem with heavy crafts, inflating might not always be possible with out tires braking again. So that solves that problem. Also plenty of power to power modules with there own wheels so good for moving a base around. It can be remote controlled but also take two kerbals. Good if you get a flat. I use a similar truck on Duna but unfortunately I forgot the RCS on that one and no legs but gravity is lower there so that helps. So its a utility truck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img12/3843/screenshot1240.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1240.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img706/3059/screenshot1241.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1241.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img839/2397/screenshot1226.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1226.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T01:16:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T02:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETesting out the new wheels.
