Most rockets release their payload fairing under power as they get into the upper atmosphere to prevent additional orbiting debris. I like to do this as well just to get rid of them early and get rid of the weight. However, your fairings eject the bottom hardest and thus the nose sticks to the rocket, potentially causing damage. Is there an ejection sequence change I can make to get it to work, or is it an ejection force issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dani-Sang","CreatedById":4234,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-21T15:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the video on the first page... specifically the one at the payload section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pack has the ability to dispatch payload fairings 2 ways.
