Photosynthesis, which is the reaction plants use to sequester solar energy in the form of chemical bonds in carbohydrate molecules, is an endothermic reaction, which means it requires an energy input. Generally, that energy comes from the sun. Oil and other fossil fuels are formed through a long chain of a variety of chemical and physical reactions, but carbohydrates are the materials those reactions work on. Combustion is the process of getting that energy back out breaking hydrocarbons back into CO2 and water. Even if the cycle were reversible at that point (it\u0027s not, c.f. 2nd Law of Thermodynamics), it certainly wouldn\u0027t be after we use that energy to heat food or move cars around or light our houses. Think of our fossil fuel reserves as a giant battery that took hundreds of millions of years to charge. We\u0027ll deplete the battery within a couple of centuries and that\u0027s it; it\u0027s not coming back on any timescale that concerns us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see fusion as a potential solution, but it\u0027s not a panacea. Even if we can get fusion going before fossil fuels are gone and before climate change wrecks havoc on technological industry and supply chains etc, (note: without high-tech factories and global supply routes and foundries and hundreds of other components of our technological civilization, fusion will never ever happen) it will require a massive change in how we get and use energy. Specifically, it\u0027s hard to imagine how overseas and airborne shipping works in that paradigm. Trucking disappears and we go back to using trains for continental transport, which means that paved intercontinental roadways probably are left to decay. (Space travel, needless to say, is impossible without fossil fuels.) Everything becomes more local, prices rise, standards of living fall, and we get used to living in a world that, while higher-tech, is probably somewhat similar to the early 19th century . . . until big-agriculture collapses due to climate change and 8 or 9 billion humans strip-mine the biosphere for food as we starve to death.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T17:49:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot true.
