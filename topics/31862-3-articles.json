It\u0027s heavily dependant on how much spare RAM KSP can address, so if you\u0027ve got a 2.5-3GB instance of KSP running then BOSS will probably crash it at anything higher than 3-4. It\u0027s best to simply increment it by one each time and check to see how your system handles it. There will be roughly a 10 second hand for high values - around 6-7 on most systems. That\u0027s the point you should probably stop incrementing, heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost systems and installations with a couple of standard part packs should handle a value of 5 pretty well, especially if running on a low resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe log won\u0027t be too helpful, other than letting me know if an error other than a too high supersample value occurred.

You set it and forget it. Yes, atm the super interlace settings arent saving because of a bug, but, its essentially the same thing. I may be misunderstanding something, but I see at this present time no different from the descriptions you guys are giving me.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cardgame\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cardgame\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, well okay then. I was describing the differences between the two from a ~year ago where there was no such functionality.\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, supersampling to 3x breaks my game, I successfully did it once, getting an 18.2MB file, and the second (~10 seconds later) froze the program. I remember getting size 3-5 shots pretty easily from the earlier version, but I also had a lot less mods and this was prior to art passes which presumably also increased RAM use at the highest settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes card. hes right you can currently press Z to take the screenshot. interface-less. Also, the reason it is not saving the supersampling value, is because it is not being saved to the xml. I thought this was made by design. Being that sometimes people like to take 1 or 2 shots, slowly at 4. But would crash the game normally it would crash set at 4. If i hit z a couple times. Like for example,when i\u0027m building my rocket when i have to hit ctrl - z. But this is a feature that is easily addable. If you guys wanted it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, like Ted said. The reason you are probably getting those crashes is because of the amount of mods people are using/the amount of ram they need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key to this plugin. Which i\u0027m going to go over, because I don\u0027t think people realize how its working in the background. Say I take a screenshot at 3 or 4. Thats already 5000 or 7000px big image. Thats huge. So you shouldnt need to go any higher yet. Second when you take said screenshot. If you take another one really fast. It may not crash it. But it probably will. depending on your computer and the amount of mods you have and whether or not your using the mod i mentioned above. Reason is. Your first screenshot is still being super-sampled. in the background. It can take up to 30 even 40 seconds sometimes in the background to finish. So if you double it up. Your doubling the ram the plugin needs to finish the tasks. Thus this can push you over the limit. So the key to it. Is find your comps limit. I have found that mine can handle 4. With alot of mods. As long as im using this. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-2-14-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-2-14-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs%21\u003C/a\u003E. I also have 2133mhz ram. and a 8core proc. So it may be the limit is 3 for others. Were working within the confinements of the memory limit as always. And super-sampling uses alot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working with Ted to get some features added to BOSS right now. Heres what you can look forward to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev2.1.3 - added choosing of skins, burst shot mode, help window, cleaned up code ALOT. Added saving of supersampling value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadded to toolbar(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863-0-23-0-Toolbar-1-4-0-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60863-0-23-0-Toolbar-1-4-0-Common-API-for-draggable-resizable-buttons-toolbar\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efixed crashing issue by limiting the user to 1 screenshot while the unity engine is still antialiasing the image. Option to turn off this limiter will be added to the help window. But you have to learn to use it. so it doesnt crash your game. If you take this limit off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother bonus. I have written an external supersampler. That can be used to do it outside of KSP. I\u0027m going to set it up to do the entire folder its placed in. So that if you guys want you can super sample images that are already taken. They wont look as good as the unity engine will do it. But i must say, it does work. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://coreyjones.info/boss2.3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022boss2.3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-19T21:43:53Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2014 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by synik4l\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T21:16:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve pushed out the update that synik4l has been working on.
