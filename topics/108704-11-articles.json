I\u0027m assuming capture range is the range at which it considers itself to be docked, and is 6 cm? But Basic Orbit says it\u0027s still 25 cm away when they\u0027re touching... Still, it isn\u0027t doing any translation at all.\n\nPrior to the start of recording, all I did was land about 80m away, drive up to it, target the docking port, then click Extend, and approach as straight-on as I could get it.\n\nEdit: Seems like the capture range is the issue. I repositioned the docking port to be precisely aligned and tried again, only this time with the docking port in standard mode. The magnets engaged, straightened it out, pulled them together, then it held there for about 2 seconds before giving up and separating again. Any thoughts? I did reposition the target craft\u0027s docking port when I built it, for better aerodynamics, IIRC, but normal docking ports have no issues with that. Also, it\u0027s built onto a Science Lab, covering up the rear crew hatch, if that might be relevant.\n\nEdit Edit: Tried one last time, with a regular Clamp-o-Tron, and it was able to dock without issue. So it seems it\u0027s having trouble docking with a normal clamp-o-tron, at least for me.\n\nWhile docking, the regular clamp-o-trons blinked green lights continually once the magnets engaged, and until they were docked. No green lights blinked with the flex-o-tron. Could it be that the normal clamp-o-tron didn\u0027t recognize the flex-o-tron?\n\n![ISevcuo.png](http://i.imgur.com/ISevcuo.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-19T20:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2016 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FirroSeranel**\n  \nUpdate"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-19T20:58:18Z","Content":"[@FirroSeranel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/144343-firroseranel/) Do you have a save file from when you are trying to dock them together?

Would it be possible to skip the stock transfer menu ? Having the highlighting show right after clicking on the portrait button ?"},{"CreatedByName":"pheenix99","CreatedById":159480,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T13:25:22Z","Content":"So glad I found Science Relay.
