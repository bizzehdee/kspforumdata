Another round of whoops and hollers, then Ol\u0027 Sam poured a strange-looking concoction into something that resembled a small rocket nozzle and handed it to Burdous.

Valentina used to opportunity to quickly run her own eyes around his office.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the wall behind him, between two large windows looking out on the launchpad, was a massive group photo of the current Kerbonaut Corps, all smiles posed before a mockup of their Orbiter and upper stage in their shiny metallic pressure suits. Nearby was a much smaller picture featuring a dozen or so rather overwhelmed looking faces clad in blue. Valentina guessed this must be the first fledgling class of new cadets. Below it was room for many more frames.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe utilitarian, white-painted cinderblock walls were festooned with all manner of stylized space art. Sleek painted rockets roared past enormous ringed space stations, or towards more exotic destinations like Duna or the moons of Jool. Mixed in were more realistic renderings of space capsules and satellites. She even noted several Ussari works, including the all too familiar portrait of... Sergei.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne wall was mostly empty, just a few old-looking photos of Gene with some Kerbals she didn\u0027t recognize, all looking very happy, but oddly cropped. In the center of them all was a single framed picture, a different image of the same young, smiling Kerbal from the case in the bar, the one no one would speak of.

It bore a very passing resemblance to \u003Cem\u003EZarya\u003C/em\u003E, but could certainly not be called a copy. It looked like little more than an upscaled version of their conical orbiter capsule mated to an overly large fuel tank and engine, which she suspected was actually the last stage of the lifter. She also noted, it did not appear to actually \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0any sort of docking port.

Burdous\u0027s flight was a great success, just have to get over this one little hump, now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery recent Rockomax launch had failed, every one that wasn\u0027t crewed, that\u0027s what someone had said. Could he not see the obvious? Or was she just being paranoid? Rockets were tricky things, after all, prone to failure from the tiniest flaw, and the entire program here seemed far behind the Union\u0027s. Ironic, since so much of the Union\u0027s hardware came from...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thought evaporated, as another flash of distant emotion wandered through Valentina\u0027s mind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pushed it away, and wrenched her attention back to Gene, \u0022still, uh, you should get rest.

Really show him what you\u0027ve got. It\u0027ll be fine.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey stared awkwardly at one another for a few moments.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, yes, you can go,\u0022 Gene rolled his eyes, then clapped a hand to them, \u0022and on your way out, do me a favor and kill the lights, please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe stood, saluted again, felt a bit silly, then went to the door. At the light switch, she paused a moment, wondering if perhaps she should punch \u003Cem\u003Eit\u003C/em\u003E, but Gene probably just meant \u0027turn them off.\u0027 So many incomprehensible figures of speech here, like turning your hat in winter. Shrugging, Valentina flicked the light switch. The room didn\u0027t change much, with the late afternoon sun streaming in the windows as it was. Gene didn\u0027t seem to register it either way, he now sat with his face in hands, fingers rubbing his forehead.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina gave him another concerned frown, and quietly closed the door behind her. She made her way down the hall, out past the ever-smiling secretary, and through the legions of apparatchiks clacking away at their typewriters, to the elevator.

Jerdous, at least, looked more himself today. Something... something was not right there either. Nightmares. She could understand that. But something else about him just felt... wrong.

Odd, that was an awful lot of fuel for one small rocket, with a launch still weeks away. She recalled that PropelOx stored well, but--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thought blew away like breath in the breeze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing down the path were several pipeline workers, roughnecks, they called them.

She bared her teeth as his back. Why of all the...! That... slimy... GAH!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spun around, stalking off beyond the concrete of the Space Center proper. The sun was nearly touching the ocean, now. She always expected it to make a comedic \u003Cem\u003Eshhhhhhhh\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sound and sink into a cloud of steam. Yes, she\u0027d been watching \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0too many of these absurd Foreign cartoons. Nevertheless, it did amaze her how fast the sun set here on the equator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack home, the sunset seemed to last for hours, the fading light filtered by towering trees. Not far from where she grew up, the sun never really set, in a land of eternal twilight. It was always cold there, too. She wouldn\u0027t mind that, it would be a welcome change, the cold never--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slight tickle on her arm drew Valentina\u0027s attention. She looked down in horror to find a tiny mosquito helping its self to dinner at her expense. For a moment, she could only gape in disgust. How did these people \u003Cem\u003Elive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like this?! One of these... these... these... \u003Cem\u003Evermin\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0could just make a meal of you and you \u003Cem\u003Emight not even know!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0At least the mosquitos back home had to put up a proper fight, first!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnarling, she balled her hand into a fist and \u003Cem\u003Esqueezed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0until the mosquito burst like macabre balloon. She picked the head off and wiped her arm on a convenient plant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlant?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked around, and found herself surrounded by lush green vegetation and stunted trees. Ah, this must be the lake everyone talked about. She walked toward the shore, until her shoes squelched in the soggy ground. It certainly was a very pretty lake. She knew a lake that looked like this back home, for the few weeks it wasn\u0027t covered in thick white ice. To the west, the sun had fully disappeared, the splash of orange in the sky fading to red and deep crimson. The dwindling light was maintained by a brilliant, pallid M\u00FCn just peeking over the mountains far to the east. She sat on a convenient log, and watched it rise, occasionally batting at the mosquitoes. Somehow, this, too reminded her of home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHome. She finally realized how homesick she was. The brighter stars began to pop into the sky, one by one, bringing with them an odd contradiction of emotions that were, thankfully, entirely her own. Her time in this bizarre place was beginning to sink towards its own end, and oddly, she felt wistful about that too. She wondered absently if she would still feel the same \u003Cem\u003Etomorrow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0night. Pivoting on that thought, she was thankful this day was over, and couldn\u0027t possibly get any worse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd instantly regretted it. Of \u003Cem\u003Ecourse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a splash and a plop, something emerged from the water. Valentina tilted her head. It was... no, it was more... well, it looked sort of like a fish. And also like a squirrel. But also like a rat. The fact that these descriptions referred to the same creature surely violated some cosmic law of decency. Just \u003Cem\u003Elooking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at it made her eyes water.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it hopped and squished forward, its big fishy lips curled into a hopeful grin, its long whiskers... whisked, and its bushy, sodden tail flicked with anticipation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina held its beady-eyed gaze and scowled, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t even think about it\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe critter\u0027s countenance fell, and it turned, crestfallen and sniffling, and sulked off back into the lake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanding, Valentina sighed. Two hours in a confined space with D.N. She would rather go running through the forest rapping on Sticks with sticks. Or maybe kiss that... \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomehow, she doubted tomorrow would end so peacefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-07T23:17:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2016 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KAL 9000","CreatedById":140704,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T23:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222567811\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022113974\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462659142\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257438\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CatastrophicFailure\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, CatastrophicFailure said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 57: Wanderings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina wandered aimlessly across the space center grounds, no real destination in mind.

No, not even that one deserves such, rude as he is. A smack on the head, perhaps, but he already seemed to be well supplied with those. She continued on her way across the grounds. Jerdous, at least, looked more himself today. Something... something was not right there either. Nightmares. She could understand that. But something else about him just felt... wrong. Wrong... yet, familiar. Like in the spring, when the days became sunny and beautiful but all that which had died during the long winter began to fester, and the sticky sweet smell of decay mingled with the subtle perfume of flowers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt felt like... when the voice had called out to her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...do not think too hard on such things...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it be?

It all seemed so ridiculous. A rational mind didn\u0027t didn\u0027t think like this. Didn\u0027t hear voices and feel emotions that were not its own. Either she really \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0going mad... or the reality was far, far worse than she imagined.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...you took an oath...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what could she do?

She ground her teeth and rubbed her own temples. She most \u003Cem\u003Ecertainly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0needed a cheeseburger. Or three. Or eight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOff to the west, the sun was sinking down towards the horizon, silhouetting several enormous propellium tankers sitting at anchor. Odd, that was an awful lot of fuel for one small rocket, with a launch still weeks away. She recalled that PropelOx stored well, but--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thought blew away like breath in the breeze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComing down the path were several pipeline workers, roughnecks, they called them. Their faces were streaked with sweat and grease, but their enormous hats were utterly spotless.

She bared her teeth as his back. Why of all the...! That... slimy... GAH!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spun around, stalking off beyond the concrete of the Space Center proper. The sun was nearly touching the ocean, now. She always expected it to make a comedic \u003Cem\u003Eshhhhhhhh\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0sound and sink into a cloud of steam. Yes, she\u0027d been watching \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0too many of these absurd Foreign cartoons. Nevertheless, it did amaze her how fast the sun set here on the equator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack home, the sunset seemed to last for hours, the fading light filtered by towering trees. Not far from where she grew up, the sun never really set, in a land of eternal twilight. It was always cold there, too. She wouldn\u0027t mind that, it would be a welcome change, the cold never--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slight tickle on her arm drew Valentina\u0027s attention. She looked down in horror to find a tiny mosquito helping its self to dinner at her expense. For a moment, she could only gape in disgust. How did these people \u003Cem\u003Elive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like this?! One of these... these... these... \u003Cem\u003Evermin\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0could just make a meal of you and you \u003Cem\u003Emight not even know!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0At least the mosquitos back home had to put up a proper fight, first!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSnarling, she balled her hand into a fist and \u003Cem\u003Esqueezed\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0until the mosquito burst like macabre balloon. She picked the head off and wiped her arm on a convenient plant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlant?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked around, and found herself surrounded by lush green vegetation and stunted trees. Ah, this must be the lake everyone talked about. She walked toward the shore, until her shoes squelched in the soggy ground. It certainly was a very pretty lake. She knew a lake that looked like this back home, for the few weeks it wasn\u0027t covered in thick white ice. To the west, the sun had fully disappeared, the splash of orange in the sky fading to red and deep crimson. The dwindling light was maintained by a brilliant, pallid M\u00FCn just peeking over the mountains far to the east. She sat on a convenient log, and watched it rise, occasionally batting at the mosquitoes. Somehow, this, too reminded her of home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHome. She finally realized how homesick she was. The brighter stars began to pop into the sky, one by one, bringing with them an odd contradiction of emotions that were, thankfully, entirely her own. Her time in this bizarre place was beginning to sink towards its own end, and oddly, she felt wistful about that too. She wondered absently if she would still feel the same \u003Cem\u003Etomorrow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0night. Pivoting on that thought, she was thankful this day was over, and couldn\u0027t possibly get any worse.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd instantly regretted it. Of \u003Cem\u003Ecourse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a splash and a plop, something emerged from the water. Valentina tilted her head. It was... no, it was more... well, it looked sort of like a fish. And also like a squirrel. But also like a rat. The fact that these descriptions referred to the same creature surely violated some cosmic law of decency. Just \u003Cem\u003Elooking\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at it made her eyes water.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs it hopped and squished forward, its big fishy lips curled into a hopeful grin, its long whiskers... whisked, and its bushy, sodden tail flicked with anticipation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina held its beady-eyed gaze and scowled, \u0022\u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t even think about it\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe critter\u0027s countenance fell, and it turned, crestfallen and sniffling, and sulked off back into the lake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStanding, Valentina sighed. Two hours in a confined space with D.N. She would rather go running through the forest rapping on Sticks with sticks. Or maybe kiss that... \u003Cem\u003Ething\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomehow, she doubted tomorrow would end so peacefully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, the infamous RatSquirrelFish!
