To answer this question, one can\u0027t simply add the amount of science an initial test recieves for every biome on every planet. Repeated experiments do add more science. I am too lazy to do the math so I am hoping someone else has it figured out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr3Runn3r","CreatedById":73353,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T09:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what it is, but yes there is a definitely a cap aas if you do each experiment enough times it just starts giving 0 science\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gslarmour","CreatedById":78249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T10:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s 10783.
