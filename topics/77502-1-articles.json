Rotation is about 175 knots and landing can be expected to be around 200 knots. Cruise speed is mid mach 3 with the ability to go faster since the engines are more powerful (and the compressor fans don\u0027t melt). Endurance for the vehicle is about an hour and a half which will get you a range upwards of 6,000 km at cruise (You can circumnavigate all of Kerbin with that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll additional pertinent mods and stats are listed in-video. Some for the environment, and some for the fuel truck you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMxv2Yhy7eQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may have overstrengthened the frame itself as it can handle more than 2 Gs provided no excessive aerodynamic loads... In case you missed it (due to a slightly longish pause after the showcase flight), the final third of the video is me literally finding ways to break the thing. Surprisingly, a few failures I was expecting took real effort to push the aircraft beyond its envelope. I tried to overspeed the aircraft to decimation, burn it up in the atmosphere, and even push it through its Critical AoA for the dreaded backflip of doom. I think I tuned the control surfaces to the point that it won\u0027t LET that happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
