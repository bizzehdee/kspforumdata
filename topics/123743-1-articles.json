Although the cannon is originally designed to fire a hollow aluminum ball, a bullet-shaped projectile is later designed with the purpose of carrying people. It is now known that neither concept is viable using such a cannon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fictional columbiad is made of cast iron six feet thick, is 900 feet (274 m) long, and has a bore with a diameter of nine feet. It weighs more than 68,000 short tons (61,700 metric tons or 60,700 long tons) and is therefore cast directly in the ground, rather than being mounted on rails. The cannon is then loaded with 400,000 pounds (180,000 kg) of \u0022pyroxyle\u0022 (gun cotton) to give the projectile sufficient velocity to leave Earth\u0027s atmosphere and reach the Moon.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbiad#In_fiction\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbiad#In_fiction\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMust be done if copyright ended after author death, accordingly to laws.
