It seems likely that most, if not all, star systems develop planets, so I put that value at 100%. However, Kepler data suggests that one in five sun-like stars has a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone, so I think the number of habitable planets per star system is about 0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it gets a little harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the fact that Earth life arose very shortly after the continuous orbital bombardment of the surface ceased, it seems that most habitable planets develop life. However, \u0022terrestrial and in the habitable zone\u0022 is not equivalent to \u0022habitable\u0022. The thickness of the atmosphere and the strength of the magnetic field can vary greatly from planet to planet (just look at Venus and Mars). Both Venus and Mars are in the habitable zone, so I\u0027ll use 33% for this value as I have nothing better to put.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the intelligence factor, I am going to side with the \u0022life trends towards intelligence\u0022 side. Yes, many many species have existed on Earth over the course of it\u0027s 4.5 billion year lifetime, but the ancestors of modern humans were in a much better position to develop intelligence than any other species before. Life began simple and worked its way up towards intelligence, so that now we have a whole host of intelligent creatures from humans to apes to octopodes to crows, and most stars in the galaxy are red dwarves, which have lifespans of trillions of years. It seems likely that most planets with life eventually develop intelligence. Thus, I set this value to 85%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we turn the \u0022percent civilizations that can communicate across space\u0022 bit into \u0022percent civilizations that destroy themselves\u0022 (I put 50% (although it should probably be less): we came very close to nuclear war with the Soviet Union several times over the course of the Cold War) and take the length part to mean how long a surviving civilization lasts (if they overcome the threat of destroying themselves, probably a very long time), we get a more interesting answer. It tells us that there are about \u003Cem\u003Eone and a half million civilizations\u003C/em\u003E in the galaxy. Most of them probably wouldn\u0027t be detectable, though. If we assume that all civilizations get the ability to send radio waves out into the galaxy but this period only lasts about 100 years (as seems to be the case with our civilization), that means there are only about \u003Cem\u003E34 detectable civilizations\u003C/em\u003E in our galaxy. That few civilizations means that we probably will never detect another alien civilization, unless the more advanced ones purposefully contact us or we ourselves gain the ability to detect their \u0022radio\u0022 chatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, 1.5 million civilizations means that around only one in every 200 (0.5%) stars has ever hosted a civilization, and only in every 9 million or so (0.00001%) have a civilization around our own level of sophistication that we could detect. With these statistics, SETI seems like a pointless endeavor. To scan 9 million stars in 100 years would mean that each star would only be given 350 seconds of listening time, which is simply unrealistic. Of course, building more arrays would enable us to scan that same number of stars in significantly less time, but the nearest civilization would still be so far away that the chances of detecting them would be minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still, one in 200 is a lot. There could very well be an advanced civilization within one hundred lightyears of us, more than capable of determining the existence of life on Earth through spectral analysis. We may have no idea where they are, but don\u0027t be too sure about them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T01:28:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tangle\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tangle\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause honestly that\u0027s just deciding that going to the moon still isn\u0027t worthy of being declared a race with the capability of space travel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei was more pointing out that i dont consider humans civilized at all, and i doubt that other life forms in the universe would be any different. hence \u0027lots of barbarians\u0027. frankly, humans still act like monkeys, monkeys that have gone to the moon, but still monkeys. we are not as civilized as we think we are. our social structures still closely resemble the natural pecking order of your typical monkey troupe. the only difference is a matter of scale, and possibly our tools being slightly more advanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit also makes things interesting in a first contact scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T17:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m really playing Devil\u0027s advocate here, I suspect that there is other intelligent life out there, I just don\u0027t think we can consider it likely enough to call it a given.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the basis for that, in light of the cosmological principle?
