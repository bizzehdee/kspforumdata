It seems to be due to having a large object above the seat. Of course when you exit a seat the game has to look for a place to put the Kerbal, but if there are large collision meshes nearby... I suppose the game sees them as much larger than they are, and places the Kerbal in a bizzare position beyond the object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T03:09:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I can tell, if you have a Kerbal in a command chair and any ship part is above that Kerbal\u0027s head then KSP will spawn the Kerbal on top of the structure above you when you leave the chair - no matter how far away that part is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this very frustrating when I was trying to build command chair operated craft that I wanted to dock inside of cargo bays.
