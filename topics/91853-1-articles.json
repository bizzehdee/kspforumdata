Not to mention taking some of the stress out of extremely long burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing we need is the ability to set an arbitrary navball target (say, by clicking on it - referably you could even drag the pointer around, while the pilot follows it) - which the kerbals could then be instructed to point at. Sure maneuver nodes work, but there are times when you don\u0027t need to go into map view and set up a node to know the right direction to go, but that would be required if you want a Kerbal to hold that course. This way you could just toss a pointer at 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and the pilot will take care of it. This would allow for not-quite-autopilot launches, where you can give more focus to throttle and staging, and less to turning, or can get a smoother turn by sliding the pointer with your mouse instead of using the keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that clicking the ball would place the target at the location of the click, right clicking the pointer would remove it. Right clicking and dragging the ball would rotate it (some visual effect would come up to show that the ball is no longer showing you your heading, but is in edit mode), right clicking the edit-mode ball would cause it to snap back to normal mode. Clicking and dragging the pointer would allow it to be moved, and the pilot would follow the position. Clicking while a pointer is in place would either allow another pointer, or pop up a button to \u0022move pointer here\u0022. In the case of multiple pointers, clicking the pointer (and really any of the basic ones) should produce a context menu with the option (if your pilot is capable) to have them target it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T17:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if you can use this to make space stations always keep an orientation you want.
