Either different sized parts or the versions I made with builtin decouplers. If I stick one of those in the bottom and a normal one on the top, it works ONCE. Then if I have to reload the craft I then have to replace all the fairings that are broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I made an absolutely GIMUNGOUS fairing... On the bottom we have ring fairing that has a quad adapter attached and four nuclear engines. The top is a ring fairing facing down and a clamp Sr. on top because this is supposed to be a drive section for a Duna mission. Next I attached the procedural fuselage because I didn\u0027t want this being jettisoned. That\u0027s it for the inside. Everything else is attached to the fairing. Four lift units - 3.5m KW tanks, Griffon XX. I think I filled them with LH2 \u002B LO2 to keep them light. Or it might be Liquid Fuel \u002B LO2. Two feed into the others and I jettison those after about 1 minute, 5km up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was built in a single session with no testing and made it all the way to apoapsis (80km) on the first try. There were however issues with control up in space and I was not able to orient it for its first orbital burn. Ultimately I ended up abandoning the giant fairing idea. I may revisit it however as Duna Voyager drive section mk2 is being a colossal PITA to get into orbit right now. Now that I think I have a handle on the control issues I might just come back to this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, right, so inside this is just a stack of 3x2.5m tanks filled with pure H2 (for the Modular Fuel Tanks Real Fuels mod) then six identical stacks attached radially to the center tank.

You placed your bases properly as far as I can tell but you didn\u0027t attach any fairing PIECES. There are three different kinds. Grab one and attach it to one of the attachment nodes on the fairing base. It will automagically shape itself to the payload. Be sure to activate symmetry to close the fairing. The differences between pieces are: Conical has sharp angles. \u0027egg shaped\u0027 is more rounded. Fuselage is like egg shaped but it has NO decouplers and it cannot be jettisoned from your craft. Like the name says it makes a fuselage and you can put stuff inside it or attach things on the outside. (see my picture I posted above. That giant thing between the rockets used the fuselage fairing. It has RCS and solar panels attached directly to the outside. Can you mount things on the inside? I\u0027m not sure... have to try that. I think you can...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso press \u0027R\u0027 when on top of the fairing base and drag the mouse to resize it. You can get different shapes by resizing the top or the bottom and attaching the fairing piece to the ring you resized on. (works best if the fairing is on so you can see the changes in real time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the fairing base is between an engine and a fuel tank be sure to put the mouse over the base and press \u0027G\u0027 to allow fuel to pass through the fairing base. Otherwise you will have an ignition failure event during launch.
