To clarify, I was not being snarky, just sort of fed up with the amount of issues and error reports that lack proper documentation to help me help you.\n\nThe bigger issue is you say that the edit all button doesn\u0027t save all the info for the contract types, which is very odd.\n\nLooking further into the settings file is shows that you have Kerbin as a blocked string, instead of a blocked body.\n\nAlso a lot of contracts are being deleted because of max funds being set too low.

Oddly enough, by not using the \u0022close\u0022 button, and using only the save button, it did however remember the setting in the GUI. As in, I close the plugin GUI, or go to another filter category and I come back and the blacklisted body is still there. But it doesnt seem to be applied.
