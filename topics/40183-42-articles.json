The problem is that clicking the little icon of the rocket, which SHOULD make the current mission window appear, doesn\u0027t - at least not while you\u0027re on the SPH screen. Once you leave the SPH screen and get to the KSC view, then the current mission window is suddenly there. Both this error and the error with the ship cost window seemed to start happening at the same time, although they don\u0027t both manifest at the same time they both seem related.

And the devbuilds already have this.. Anyway the new version has what is called custom contracts where you can make your own missions and a company will fund these missions for you. When you play the new version you can either just pay for the missions yourself out of current funds (for doing other missions) or you can set up a custom contract that you can specify the orbit of the station you want to supply (where it is) and that you want to dock with it. Then land at kerbin (or not pays out more the more goals you have) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you set up your vessel, and send it up under the new contract once you dock with vessel you will get payed for mission you just made. Unless you want to land, then you will get payed once you safely land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a nutshell with the new custom contracts you can in theory make any mission for any mod you like.. Including Remote Tech 2 and all the others that specify certain vessels to be at a certain place. And its all pretty simple to do. I can make missions in about 45 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes those mods work with MCE I using them right now in my Game with .50. But instead of KW rocketry. I use AIES instead.
