It could, in theory, reside in an external location.\n\nFor me personally -- I have a personal requirement to keep all \u0027necessary\u0027 files with a repository.  If 7-zip is \u0027necessary\u0027 to build the app, it needs to be in the repo.  If some .dll/s libs are needed for building... those have to be in the repo as well (or really should, even though in this case I\u0027ve had to leave them out for licensing issues as well... GD copyright BS).\n\nThis is because I work on the mod from multiple locations/multiple computers -- I need to be able to simply clone/pull the repo and have it ready to go.  If I have to go fishing around the internet to find libraries, dependencies, or apps needed to build it... then the repo has failed at doing its job and I might as well lug things around on a flash-drive.\n\nNot to worry though -- I\u0027m building a c# .exe that will have .zip functionality built in.  Kind of a micro version of ant/etc; will take a very simple build-config-file, and, well.. build things (more packaging though, as everything will already be built/compiled by the time it is ran)."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-05T16:23:55Z","Content":"Multiple locations/computers?

But going to need some info in order to balance things.\n\u003E \n\nI already started to play around a bit with the current settings. First i adjusted the weights of the shields, based on the apollo heat shield which at 3.9m diameter apparently weighted about 850kg. Thus i set the mass of the 3.75m medium shield to 0.4 and its ablator to 450, yielding 850kg for that part.\n\nAlso i changed the massMults of the different types to linear, so a light shield is half as heavy as a medium, while a heavy is double the weight of a medium.\n\nNext, i took a  look at the heatCurve, and wondered about its many points. I plotted it, and noticed it\u0027s not interpolated very smoothly, i confirmed this in an in game curve editor, so i created a new curve out of 6 points which is smooth and easier to scale because you don\u0027t have to edit that many points. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) I can\u0027t attach images here, will post them on the github issue.\n\nAfter that i balanced the light and medium shield curves and the ablation efficiency, and i made quite some progress. Especially the medium curves i looked a bit closer at, and made 2 curves for now.\n\nOne which has a bit more headroom (to overpower the ablation for the 1.25m shield from outer Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, you need 1,5t and a -40km periapsis or 2t and 0km periapsis), and one with a bit less (already exploded with 940kg, eg not much more than the pod, at a periapsis of 0km).\n\nI\u0027ll post screenshots and details of the curves at the github issue, i guess.\n\nEdit: Curves posted in [https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/553](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/issues/553)\n\nI\u0027ve also updated that post with some experimental results. Now, does anybody have an idea what might be good test/balance conditions/targets for the heavy and extra heavy shields?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-06T21:10:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2017 09:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Mike\u0060**"},{"CreatedByName":"DocRockwell","CreatedById":174979,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-09T19:20:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9/4/2017 at 5:25 AM, Rodger said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Who likes SSTU and Ven\u0027s Stock Revamp??  \n\u003E   \n\u003E [![e7JA43v.png](https://i.imgur.com/e7JA43v.png)](https://i.imgur.com/e7JA43v.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![66RRmUD.png](https://i.imgur.com/66RRmUD.png)](https://i.imgur.com/66RRmUD.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E So far Poodles, Skippers, and mounts have been SSTU-ed  \n\u003E [https://github.com/Rodg88/SSTUVens](https://github.com/Rodg88/SSTUVens)\n\u003E \n\nWill this work with 1.2.2 (playing RP0)? \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-09T20:45:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2017 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DocRockwell**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-09T22:05:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, DocRockwell said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Will this work with 1.2.2 (playing RP0)?\n\u003E \n\nNo idea, but if the engine module SSTU hasn\u0027t changed much since a 1.2.2 version, it should?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike\u0060","CreatedById":180637,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-11T09:38:54Z","Content":"In case like you feel like modeling an engine again, what about the MR-80B?

What for? Indeed small, unmanned landers, like it is/was used for IRL. As i removed any stock engine from my game, i didn\u0027t have anything for that purpose - the LMAE came closest, but that thing is still comparably huge and heavy for a tiny unmanned mun-lander.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Equivalent PDF for bipropellant thrusters, just for completeness:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.rocket.com/files/aerojet/documents/Capabilities/PDFs/Bipropellant Data Sheets.pdf](http://www.rocket.com/files/aerojet/documents/Capabilities/PDFs/Bipropellant%20Data%20Sheets.pdf)\n\u003E \n\nThe R-40B at 4kN irl thrust also looks very good.
