(I had previously explored this directory so that I knew these icon files existed, although had not compared icon file names with profile variable names)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe icons have names like cs_mk2 where as the mouseover is \u0022mk 2\u0022 and the variable name is \u0022mk2\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo somewhere in the game script or a config file there must be some sort of loading and conversion table for stock profiles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me the mouseover names and ordering suffices, they should suffice for any modder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hoojiwana\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI tried it out briefly and couldn\u0027t get it to work, seems to be that a plugin would be required just to add a simple icon. From my testing, the game seems to automatically sort things based on their attachment nodes if specific bulkhead profiles are not defined, so things with size 4 attachment nodes would all be auto sorted into a size4 category. If people are going to be defining bulkheads for non-stock diameters then as long as everyone sticks to the same standard (size4, size5, etc.) it\u0027ll work out for the users, with the exception of the icons.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot use their naming conventions because their naming conventions use cs_size1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand this is what it says in the readme\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMake sure to not use the \u0027_\u0027 char or any other \u0027weird\u0027 chars in your icon names.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK so you cant use their conventions, what conventions can you use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuppose your profile name is \u0022size4\u0022 then you should have two files one named\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022size4.png\u0022 (what the unselected Icon looks like)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022size4_selected.png\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey belong in a folder you have to create (called \u0022Icons\u0022) And they have to be loaded by a script \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027PartCategorizer.Instance.GetIcon(\u0022size4\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor the stock variables they also have scripts assigning them to the size toolbar and also assigning mouseover names. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say that because of this script and because there was no cfg visible that does this assignment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIOW your icons have to have a painted background and foreground, and selected is specified by two pngs icons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir icons have an invisible background and are specified by a single file in simpleicons.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-15T13:59:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
