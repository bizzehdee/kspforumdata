So you can without adding icons recognize your parts tab. In addition those names fall into alphabetical order\n\nIOW mk4 follows mk3 (mk 3). \n\nHOWEVER . . . . . . . . .\n\nThe stock names (e.g. \u0022size1\u0022) has a mouseover name of \u0022size 1\u0022 but the added names have mouseover names exactly as written into the variable\n\nEach added tab gets a [dotted ?] \n\nSo for instance in the model: liquidenginePoodle.cfg\n\n\u0022bulkheadProfiles = size2\u0022 but is found under a tab with a mouseover name of \u0022Size 2 [2.5 meter]\u0022\n\nMysize4 mod in the same folder: grizzly.cfg\n\n\u0022bulkheadProfiles = size4\u0022 and is found under a tab with a mouseover name of \u0022size4\u0022\n\nSo we can conclude that for stock profiles the game recognizes the profile and assigns them to a tab by attaching it to an class defined object that contains both an icon and a tab name. \n\nSo where do the icons come from?\n\nThe are found under \\PartList\n\nhere is what the readme for the folder says\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Note on all icons::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\u003E All icons contained in the \u0027Icons\u0027 and \u0027SimpleIcons\u0027 folders are automatically loaded into the game and available to be placed on any custom partlist tab category or subcategory.\n\u003E \n\u003E All icons are supposed to be 32x32 in png format. Icons in the \u0027Icons\u0027 and \u0027SimpleIcons\u0027 folder will be named after the myIcon.png template. In this case the name of the icon would be \u0027myIcon\u0027 and can be loaded by script with \u0027PartCategorizer.Instance.GetIcon(\u0022myIcon\u0022);\u0027 Note that PartCategorizer is only instantiated within the VAB/SPH.\n\u003E \n\u003E Make sure to not use the \u0027\\_\u0027 char or any other \u0027weird\u0027 chars in your icon names. \n\u003E \n\u003E -------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0027Icons\u0027 folder:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\u003E \n\u003E This folder contains standard icons and are loaded in sets. for example.\n\u003E \n\u003E myIcon.png\n\u003E \n\u003E myIcon\\_selected.png\n\u003E \n\u003E myIcon.png represents the \u0027normal\u0027 state of an icon, The one you see in the partlist toolbar when the filter/category/subcategory is not selected. Typically a dark colored icon on a transparent background.\n\u003E \n\u003E myIcon\\_selected.png represent the \u0027selected\u0027 state of an icon. The one you see in the partlist toolbar when the filter/category/subcategory is not selected. Typically a light colored icon on a transparent background.\n\u003E \n\u003E -------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E The \u0027SimpleIcons\u0027 folder:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\u003E \n\u003E This folder contains simple icons [that] are generated from white icons on a transparent background.\n\nLooking into the squad/PartList/SimpleIcons folder you will find the Icons in PNG format listed. (I had previously explored this directory so that I knew these icon files existed, although had not compared icon file names with profile variable names)\n\nThe icons have names like cs\\_mk2 where as the mouseover is \u0022mk 2\u0022 and the variable name is \u0022mk2\u0022\n\nSo somewhere in the game script or a config file there must be some sort of loading and conversion table for stock profiles. \n\nFor me the mouseover names and ordering suffices, they should suffice for any modder.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I tried it out briefly and couldn\u0027t get it to work, seems to be that a plugin would be required just to add a simple icon.
