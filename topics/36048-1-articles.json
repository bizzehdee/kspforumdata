However, when i go to do this, the prograde marker moves very fastly around the navball, its the same with the retrograde marker. This is very difficult as i cant determine where the prograde marker actually is on the navball, making docking very difficult. Any help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMichael\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deejay2000","CreatedById":73422,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T22:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s because you are turning your rocket, so the module gets a couple meters away as you turn. I don\u0027t think there is a way to fix this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T22:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Deejay is spot on. Your relative velocity is calculated from the control node (pod/probecore/dockingport/etc.) but you rotate round your CoG. If your CoG is on one side of your ship, the control node on the other and your relative velocity is near zero rotating will result in a sideways vector. However small that vector may be it will cause your navball to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest solution is to ignore the navball in the last few meters, eyeball your approach and rely on ASAS (or whatever other guidance you might be using) to keep your craft stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
