I\u0027ve changed it a little here and there to suit my needs. The lander at the top is rather large for my rocket. I made Jeb really happen by adding the large SRBs to the bottom of the entire rocket, making the entire assembly larger than the launch tower. Your middle stage is actually almost exactly the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since I\u0027m such a newbie at orbital mechanics (when Mun is about 35-40 degrees from orbiting overhead I launch and do a straight shot), I\u0027m asking around for good flight plans and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prozach","CreatedById":19466,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T21:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spartan117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spartan117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOh, you mean a tri-coupler for the LARGE fuel tanks?
