In some cases, you might even need it only running B9.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the basic version of ATM drops the RAM usage to half - about 1.6 GB. The aggressive mode drops it by around another 300 MB. I\u0027ve found no significant errors running either x86 or x64. ATM seems to work in both, but remember ATM has specific x86 and x64 versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you\u0027re having problems, step 1 is definitely get Active Texture Management. Step 2 is to completely wipe B9 and its dependencies from your directory, and re-install. That should fix most of the issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Chris, you might need to be blunt and a bit more direct in your OP about the RAM limit. If you want to add the RAM figures to the post, I\u0027ve got them here. These were taken at the main menu with only B9 (without the depreciated files) and ATM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex86\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.01 GB - No Texture Management\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.58 GB - Basic Compression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.30 GB - Aggressive Compression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex64\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Unknown) - No Texture Management\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.67 GB - Basic Compression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.39 GB - Aggressive Compression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t get the usage from x64 without texture management, as it crashes on load for me.
