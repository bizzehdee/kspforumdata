I\u0027ve made a couple different designs all capable of hypersonic flight (1550m/s\u002B) but none of them are too stable, turn to sharp and the whole thing explodes and they can\u0027t reliably hit it either. I\u0027m doing a challenge with my friend to use only stock parts and air breathing engines to see who can make the fastest plane.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142663-fastest-aircraft-possible/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EThis Post\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0interested me but I can\u0027t seem to replicate the design of the aurora as there are discrepancies in the pictures. I was looking to see if I could make and improve it but I guess not so I decided to make a post asking for tips on how to make a stable and reliable hypersonic air breathing aircraft in language that wouldn\u0027t be difficult for someone who is relatively new to the game to understand.

M replication of the aurora couldn\u0027t quite reach 1700m/s but was however much more stable.

But \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is also a really good mod, it ovehauls the whole stock lift and aerodynamic and gives you a great overview how stable the craft is, what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E to maintain on certain speeds etc..\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027re not a fan of mods, I suggest you to either limit the rudders, elevons etc.. and press CapsLock, so you get the fine controles, the roll, yaw and pitch indicators will turn blue in fine mode and red in normall mode.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, a small design standard, always make sure the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E. The further away the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, the more stable the craft is, but harder to\u00A0maneuver. To far behind will make your craft an uncontrollable lawndart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I always build crafts is on the wings I put flaps on the wings, to increase my lift surface during take-off and landing, these don\u0027t have pitch,\u00A0 yaw or roll. On top of those I put spoilers, these are only activated when hitting the brakes. And on the sides of the wings I put some Ailerons with\u00A0only roll. Way back on the plane on the tail wing, I put the elevons which control pitch only. And on the tail itself the yaw control rudder.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis way, your crafts has just enough control authority. If taking of proofs difficulty you can also increase the authority or the amount of pitch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Airplane-Parts-and-their-Function.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022359\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.newfoxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Airplane-Parts-and-their-Function.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022541\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe longer you make your craft, the beter it handles aerodynamics in relation to fuel storage.
