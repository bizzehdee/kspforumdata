I\u0027m probably going to be averaging about 135-140 m/s, and that\u0027s with quite a lot of fuel, enough to go the whole distance. I\u0027d be hitting close to 160 m/s when certain \u0022stages\u0022 run low on fuel as well. Not sure what my starting speed will be though, I haven\u0027t put the whole boat in the water yet. I\u0027ve mainly been putting buoys/miniature lighthouses at the major points of land I need to turn at to keep the straightest path.

Also I just did the calculations for travel time vs average speed, calculated ~7.9 hours, and the fuel consumption rate of my engines at full throttle meant my former design was short about .4 hours. So, I added some tanks, and I should be able to make it all the way! I have 48 tanks, and I believe somebody in the old thread calculated something like 45 tanks @ something like ~115 m/s average (with only one engine) would make the complete circumnavigation. I\u0027m using two engines, plus 2 more until I drop the first 20 tanks.

Everything that could have gone wrong did. Not with my craft, fortunatly though. I\u0027ll not make any changes. I guess I was fortunate enough to realize early on about the mk2 tanks. my original design had mk1s, but I switched over to the mk2s when I realized the lighter weight vs more fuel, however, the tanks are almost twice as large. but not quite. So if size matters to you, you get more fuel with two mk1s than with 1 mk2 for about the same size. Routing the fuel is something I descovered too. not only for weight distribution, but for equal fuel to all my engines.
