It\u0027s annoying but without clean up and now the reduction in scene changes - what does that do to overall memory use and release? Has any efficiency been sought to improve the release of memory?

I\u0027m slow, but interested and motivated. What Mu is talking about, I think, is a good thing. It will allow for more efficient use of memory by \u0022grabbing the code by the ****\u0022, so to speak. In other words, instead of relying on Unity garbage collection to release previously used memory that is no longer needed, he is instead trying to close those \u0022memory calls\u0022 himself by optimizing the code. Now that KSP is getting close to 1.0 and feature complete, he is taking the opportunity to condense and streamline. Just my guess.

That sort of thing is kind of annoying.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, some of the limits already in game are somewhat problematic ... like when you\u0027re orbiting the smaller bodies, due to their smaller orbital velocities. I do understand why those limits are in game as it is ( if they should be needed at all is another discussion ) , but some of them look to have been in the fly stuff that would benefit from a redo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this was a very, \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E old issue, that is pretty much as old as the game. While it is good to see it fixed, it makes people wonder why did it took so long ... and now hopefully the derpiness of manouver nodes ( that somehow was exacerbated in recent patches ) could also get a fix, please \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T20:49:37Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r_rolo1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI do understand why those limits are in game as it is ( if they should be needed at all is another discussion ) , but some of them look to have been in the fly stuff that would benefit from a redo.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI agree. If anything the fix to SOI transitions should be a great reason to re-examine the time warp limits and why they exist since SOI transitions will now be handled properly. Hopefully that fix also applies to body impacts as well.\u003Cp\u003EE: I mean, honestly, is there any \u003Cem\u003Esound reason\u003C/em\u003E why I can\u0027t blast timewarp in an 80km parking orbit to make my transfer window, or does it \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E require me to switch to the space center or some geostationary satellite?
