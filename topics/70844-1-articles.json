A newbie\u0027s mistake, I believe, as I am completely puzzled by the large amount of engine choices, and I don\u0027t know exactly what I should take into account when I select an engine for any particular stage. I know to keep an eye on my TWR for the first stage, or my rocket won\u0027t get off the ground. I also have an idea of the dV I will need for any particular mission/stage, and I try to build a rocket that will top that requirement. But keeping only this in mind, I feel that my rocket building process resembles more of an arms-race between fuel weight and dV, rather than a guided, calculated process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my questions are: how do you select the proper engines for the stages of the rocket? Are there any guidelines? Am I correct in assuming that higher Isp and lower engine mass is better? How do you factor in thrust and type of fuel? What are the energy densities (if that\u0027s the correct term) of various fuels, and how does that affect the choice? Is there anything else I should be thinking about at design-time (concerning staging, engines and fuel) to ensure a fuel-efficient launch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your thoughts,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrMonte","CreatedById":90841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo why wouldn\u0027t you try the stock parts only first. \u003Cem\u003E(That\u0027s my thoughts)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T12:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are no set guidelines for selecting the proper engines, but I\u0027ll tell you what I know!

If you\u0027re landing a vessel onto a planet/moon, shorter and lighter engines are the way to go. These are better for landing/lifting off and allow easier placement of landing gear. Radial engines always have pretty poor Isp, but can be placed in areas where no other engines are possible. Another (highly unorthodox) method to try is jet engines on rockets for their ridiculous efficiency.

As for the staging you decouple that pair first, that runs out of fuel. Than in the next stage the next pair and so on. For the outer tanks you can implement a toggeling of the gimbal of their engines in an action-group, witch prevents the launcher from wobbeling around.
