Trying to transfer to another planet by trial and error, or by having to go to a website that tells you a rough approximation of where and when to burn, is not fun. The lack of any way to know when the launch window for a particular planet is, is a huge oversight by Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Not hard for the larger planets, for the smaller worlds with large SMA its a its a bit tricky. Intercepting small planet SOIs can often be achieved in three stages, a base burn, a refinement burn about half the distance, and the circularization retro.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA2. yep, true\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA3. Ascent guidance is not as efficient since 1.0. I found it made the gravity turn way too soon and some craft will be unstable. Ascent guidance is one MechJeb feature I rarely use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA4. Delta-v stats in VAB is very useful. But MJ sometimes does not know how to calculate the staging properly (amny features in 1.0 do not work optimally). I use the stats as a guide but rely on experience to guess how much DV I will have at orbit. Guessing on how much DV one is going to get is silly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELandings I have been a bit lazy with lately, I mean seriously farming the Mun for science hitting each domain 2 or 3 times, Once is enough. However, even if you do not use the autoland feature, the pick target on map also shows biome boundaries (textual) which means if you know what the Mun biomes are then MechJeb can help you find the best place to land. For instance don\u0027t try to land the Polar lowlands at the North Munar pole, there is flat surfaces near the south Pole that are much safer, the MechJeb pick target feature can aid the finding of these areas when they are sol facing (sort of). I lost a ship to MechJeb the other day trying to complete a mission where the target was a small strip of flat area on the lip of a crater, MechJeb got confused and basically inverted the rocket at a non-existent landing site in clean space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking, lost too many ships to McJeb glitches. Do not use it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For planets, I let McJeb make the base burn, I focus on the target celestial and generally retrograde a touch to the closest I can get to my target orbit (the refine the intercept about 1/4th the distance to the target), for some planets like Moho, I want my intercept to be distant from the planet, because I am coming in hot and generally will need ion drive or nuclear engine to get there, I need time to slow down and that early retrograde is going to drive the periapsis close to the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T03:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use both...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepends on the situation.

This mod (like many others) provides basic functionality that should have been built-in to the stock-game, as soon as interplanetary travel was implimented. Indeed, Squad themselves, have been planning to add MJ-type functions for some time now (it already has been partly - hence those nifty little buttons by the navball, that offer kimited SMARTASS functionality) .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. MJ by no means, provides \u0022The Easy Option\u0022 as it raises it\u0027s own challenges; this is because you can still fail VERY spectacularly with it, even if it predicts things accurately and \u0022behaves itself\u0022. Moreover, as you need to understand what you are doing before you can use it properly, it actively, enhances your skill\u0027s not bypasses your shortcomings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. MJ (and KER) allows you to approach your designs more realistically and build much more efficient hardware (just like a true-life engineer);\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit allows you to make intelligent design decisions based upon TWR/Delta-v calculations etc, and so, takes an awful lot of the \u0022sillyness\u0022 out of the design-process, (guess-work, erronous assumptions, bad-design etc). Granted you \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E use a spreadsheet for Dv calculations or take a stab at TWR in your head, but best of luck if your figuring these out accurately for a 23-stage Eve lander. Thinking about it, isn\u0027t using spreasheets or online data sheets a form of cheating, as some have implied in the past?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It\u0027s educational. I didn\u0027t know the first thing about Dv - now I do, because of MJ. Surely, dicovering what all those mysterious figures mean when you right-click an engine, through, actually, being able to to use them, is a good thing? Which begs the question, why are things like, ISP, thrust etc published, anyway, if they aren\u0027t meant intended for a mod like KER or MJ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It allows you to fly more realistically, baring in mind auto-pilot\u0027s have been around since the 1930s! Moreover, it takes-out an awful lot of unecessary (and boring) faffing-about, regarding node set-up, transfers etc; and removes (or reduces) piloting inconsistancies during flight-test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill not-convinced? Well, let me put it this way: do you honestly think Nasa or the Russian Space Agency throw up billion-dollar probes, and risk people\u0027s lives, by building rockets based on \u0022personal experiance\u0022, hunches or because something simply looks \u0022coooool\u0022? Or trust someone to fly a Soyuz properly while poking at the capsule\u0027s instrument panel with a stick, as his face is being pulled-off during a 6G ascent?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEr, nope. Even \u0022back in the day\u0022, Nasa fired up their mighty tube-powered IBM 1701\u0027s and the russians their massive Ural II\u0027s, dug out thier slide-rules and \u003Cem\u003Efigured it out\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EAll of it\u003C/em\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EBefore they even considered building a prototype. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to flying, even Gagarin\u0027s Vostock (apologies for the spelling), back in \u002761, was controlled entirely from the ground. in 65\u0027, Gemini was designed with a primative on-board computer that did a lot of the piloting. Although Armstrong \u0022took over\u0022 the landing of the LEM, the rest of the Apollo mission was almost completely computer controlled, partly through the onboard guidance computer, and partly from ground uplink. There\u0027s a good reason why, for years, test-pilot\u0027s referred to Astronauts as \u0022Spam in a Can\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- BUT, HERE\u0027S THE REAL POINT...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless of all the above waffle, this whole topic is a bit daft, anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit all comes down to what turns you on about the game, as to whether you consider MJ (or any mod for that matter) to be cheating or not.
