The launch, insertion burn, flyby, and return burn (to bring the periapsis into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere) went smoothly. Then I realised a potential problem: The time to return to Kerbin was going to push the limits of the onboard batteries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was nervous at this point, and activated the parachutes in the hope that they would deploy automatically without charge, then I found that due to a Subassembly gaffe I only had one parachute rather than the intended three. I was now quite uncertain that the little probe would make it back, and all of this would have been a waste. I could only hope at this point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA time-warp later and the probe was re-entering, it was going at something like 3 kilometres/second when it hit, and at 20 kilometres up..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/Pro-X-M-1/Screenshots/KSP/Close-Shave/screenshot28.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chute deployed, the gamble had worked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.majhost.com/gallery/Pro-X-M-1/Screenshots/KSP/Close-Shave/screenshot31.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe probe landed safely, and was free to be recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat made this even more awesome was the fact that I was playing \u003Ca href=\u0022http://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/ftl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFTL: Faster Than Light\u0027s soundtrack\u003C/a\u003E, which couldn\u0027t have summed up the atmosphere better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I gained 102 Science from the mission, well worth it in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketTurtle","CreatedById":67534,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T19:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow try with deadly reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T19:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne time I had a 200 ton ship returning from Jool.
