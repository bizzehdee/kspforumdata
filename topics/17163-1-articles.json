So I have a question what is the best way of moving Boats I got on in the water with 4 rocket fuel tanks and 2 lil engines and it moved at like 0.6 meters a second... so is there a secret? rcs plane rockets? and is there any mods to make it easier?

Just about the only thing I\u0027ve learned is to have the smallest number of parts touching the water, and an incredible amount of engine power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T00:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the fastest boat, you want a lot of surface area for stability, but you also want to make sure you have the least amount of parts touching the water at one time. The game doesn\u0027t simulate drag on the water properly as of yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kacperrutka26","CreatedById":18849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-18T12:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made a plane with mk3 parts, and I landed in the water. But the thing was the engine didnt fall off because I set it up higher on the rocket so it doesnt crash first and fall off. I used the aero spike and traveled about 30 m/s.
