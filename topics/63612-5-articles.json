Ok to answer the original question literally, yes it\u0027s probably possible to get the shader code you referenced to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I don\u0027t think that by itself would solve the problem you\u0027re describing. I\u0027m assuming that KSPI is using KSP shaders and that what you\u0027re talking about is the emissions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would probably have to happen is that the KSP shaders would have to be modified to accept environment mapping, which is how reflections work. It\u0027s just rendering 6 views from a camera to create an environment map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dirt_Merchant","CreatedById":69465,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T23:48:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022White Owl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022White Owl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI want to point out that Stretchy Tanks and Stretchy SRBs are largely being phased out in favor of Procedural Parts.

So you could have something like really polished aluminum but then a glossy painted on surface that is only mildly reflective. Unfortunately you share specularity strength with the same alpha channel, which is unavoidable until we get a shader that accepts an additional texture to control that separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, near future I\u0027m going to update with improved performance when timewarping.
