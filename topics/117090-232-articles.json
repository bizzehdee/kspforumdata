Given how existing SSTU part works it could be a single one. Light gray are scaled proportionaly, animated traps and leg could be placed there without discarding the fairing. Dark gray are fairing , jetisonable or not, technically there would be way to make them animated door but I will leave that part aside for simplicity.\n\nAs for the different shapes, it is controlled trough 5 joints for the frame, 5 for the fairing, scaled in X Y, plus Z for the nose, frame and fairing can be scaled together, I will explain that later. Every joints are at the center of symmetry control a single edge loop around the Z axis, the first and last joint control ends scale as well. Bottom two are larger and progressively scaled in X, note that it would be a problem for traps. Middle one have a ballistic shape trough X and Y, and so on... Top one is there to to give a idea of what it would look like if two would be jointed together. Scaling joints if fairly basic stuff, the shape could have been round, rounded top with flat bottom or even a much more complex shape, as long as joints are aligned it will work.\n\nThat\u0027s how it work in maya. As for Unity and KSP I do not know. I do not know if stock KSP fairing would allow joints and deformation. If not then it would have to be a separated part and scale copied from the frame, or you might come up with a alternative. On my end every joint is scaled separately on 2 axis, plus the two ends its a total of 12 value to control. To get a nicer shape it would require more edge loop, so a auto scale would be nice.\n\nThere is a alternative that would be much simplier to control. Its based on bezier curve, the curve is the shape of the frame and fairing, leading angle of the two end cap act as  bezier handle angle, that leave only one value per cap to control the shape. So, in KSP, say you have 3 part, you have the middle frame and a variety of ends caps with different shape and different leading edge to chose from. You set your frame length and select your cap size, the frame bar and fairing auto adjust to a default weight on both Bezier handle. Basicly you have a soft and progressive blending. If you reduce the bezier handle lenght of the front cap it will make the front curve sharper while leaving the curve from the bottom cap relatively intact. Reduce both bezier handle lenght to zero and faring and frame with be straight. Now, you do not have to generate a mesh using these curve, (does Unity support nurbs?) You can use this on top of the joint scaling system by sampling the curve at regular distance and use that value to scale your joints...\n\nI hope I was clear enough. Its a \u0022simple\u0022 idea and it might be much more complex to put in practice."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T14:39:10Z","Content":"Good shots of ISS on this... \n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/stQvMaz-5gY?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-03T18:07:08Z","Content":"[@RedParadize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129285-redparadize/)\n\nThanks for the mock up and suggestions.

Its not complicated at all. Last time I played with unity (6 years ago?) there was some issue with skinning, but these problem does not matter given influence will be 100% or 0%. There was also some problem with scaling joints hierarchy, that would be a problem only if you decided to have doors on fairing. But there is way around that. As for bezier curve, they do not need to get into Unity, there only serve as a mathematical formula to calculate scaling of each cross section. I am not that great in math and programming, but I am convince that if I do you a graph of the logic behind it you will pick it up quite easily.\n\nAs for how it would be handled in KSP, thats where the \u0022divide in conquer\u0022 come into play. It will not solve every problem. First off, in the basic concept, every animated bay and maybe engines placement would be located in end cap so shielding and occlusion would handled using stock or existing SSTU stuff. As for what\u0027s inside fairing section. I see two option. The first one would be to have two modified \u0022box\u0022 SSTUAirstreamShield, one for the top fairing and one for the bottom. Simple enough, If you discard the top fairing, then everything contained into it would create drag but should still be shielded from heat since the bottom still create occlusion. Its not perfect but it should work. The other option would be to have a 3 state variant of your SSTUAirstreamShield. 1: Fully protected, no drag is produced. Solar panel and engine don\u0027t work.  2: One panel is discarded then everything work, but everything is still protected and create no drag. 3: two panel are discarded, nothing is protected.\n\nThis only cover for cap and frame/faring. So 1 part if frame/faring section is merged with end cap like it is for your tanks. 3 part if caps are separated or if fairing are part themselves. 5 parts if both fairings and caps are separated. I might do some 2d graph later on if you are interested. If its not the way you want to go its all good, I had fun thinking about this.\n\n[@blowfish](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/119688-blowfish/)\n\nI trough about this issue as well. The only skinned part that absolutely need colliders is the frame itself, carefully choosing frame shape could allow a unskinned collider to match only trough translation and scaling, same for potential cross section.  \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-03T19:47:49Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2017 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RedParadize**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-04T00:23:21Z","Content":"Made a Jupiter-246 just now.

Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003Ertg\u003C/abbr\u003E, legs, etc; the old system for those was a giant collection of hacks, and I have no desire to go down that road again.  Instead I am working on a system of \u0027pre-built\u0027 leg sets that will ship with KF.  The new tanks will likely also be less of a \u0027bare tank\u0027 look and more of an enclosed fuel tank segment; makes it far easier to allow for the length/model adjustments used by the MFT module (still undecided on this, might be able to get bare tanks working).  When the tanks are created I\u0027ll also work on creating some octagonal mounts and adapters for them.  One final bit that I\u0027m going to investigate is allowing for standard rigid/animated landing leg setups to be included in the tanks (probably as one of the adapter/end-cap types); these legs, if included, would feature no suspension functions and would be driven to deployment by a standard animation  (WIP support for this kind of a setups is in place for the cargo-bay modules, can likely back-port it to be usable on the MFT modules -- which would also allow for MFT nosecones/adapters that had built in service bays and the like, and possibly other uses not yet considered).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The second line of lander parts will be designed for horizontal lander creation.

E.G. Orion is ~5m real life, which would be 3.2m at 64%, but the closest stock stack size is is 3.75, so went with that instead. \n\nSame thing with the RS-68.  Although I think the engine is closer to 64% scale, the shroud is likely a bit off as it needed to work with the stock stack-sizes.  Real life bell diameter = ~2.43m, scaled diameter = ~1.612m, actual scale = ~66%."},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T16:52:01Z","Content":"about Orion, I included a cloned version of it at ~64% scale (3.125m) at SSTU-expansion.  \n\nIt\u0027s cloned, so it doesn\u0027t remove the original 3.75m Orion ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-06T17:01:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, JoseEduardo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E about Orion, I included a cloned version of it at ~64% scale (3.125m) at SSTU-expansion.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s cloned, so it doesn\u0027t remove the original 3.75m Orion ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nI did exacly the same.
