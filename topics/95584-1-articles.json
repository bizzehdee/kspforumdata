It\u0027s possible it\u0027s KCT, but it\u0027s weird that no one else has reported similar issues. I would suggest a binary search of your mods to determine which one is causing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do that, start by taking out roughly half of your mods, then check if the issue persists. If it doesn\u0027t, swap out the mods with the other half. Whichever half causes the issue, cut in half again and test the same way.

The first thing noted points me toward KCT\u0027s code that overrides the launch button, but that\u0027s just a guess and I have no clue how that would cause this issue.
