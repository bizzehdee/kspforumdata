This is why they really hoped Germany and the USA would be allies... both nations hated the USSR... Germany because its leader was fanatically anti Communist and the USA because it was anti Communist because they were (and still are) a Capitalist nation (although they always mentioned \u0022democracy\u0022 when denouncing the USSR!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T13:20:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stargate525\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stargate525\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually... No. We whitewash a TON of the popular opinion of the US before and during wars. In 1936 it was entirely possible that the US could have thrown in with Germany. They, like us, were lagging behind on colonial claims abroad, and we weren\u0027t terribly happy with how we had to bail France and the UK before. A large majority of the population of the United States was (and mostly still is) Germanic European.

(Not to mention there was still lingering feelings of antipathy that dated back to the Revolution.) In both wars it was a combination of a largely anglophilic (American) upper crust and German over aggressiveness that ended up tipping the balance and causing events to unfold as they did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:10:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey underestimated the fallout that would result from such use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHindsight is always 20/20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence - testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_%28nuclear_test%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_%28nuclear_test%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagan_%28nuclear_test%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagan_%28nuclear_test%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwi1960","CreatedById":81697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T00:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mrfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey underestimated the fallout that would result from such use.\u003Cp\u003EHindsight is always 20/20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence - testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_%28nuclear_test%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_%28nuclear_test%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagan_%28nuclear_test%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagan_%28nuclear_test%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting?
