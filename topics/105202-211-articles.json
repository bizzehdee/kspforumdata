Editing the save file afterwards? I\u0027m not well versed in the editing of ksp file, I have downloaded KML but could not figure out what to do...\n\u003E \n\nI think I fixed it!\n\nIt seems there is a problem with non-english trait-names (i.e. Engineer = Techniker). So all you have to do is rename your Kerbals traits to the english name.\n\nSorry for bad english and Good Luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kleea","CreatedById":203223,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T14:06:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 3/8/2020 at 6:00 PM, Kleea said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think I fixed it!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It seems there is a problem with non-english trait-names (i.e. Engineer = Techniker).

Find all Kerbals with non-english trait identifier an substitute them with the correct english trait identifier (for Pilots: trait = Pilot, for Scientists trait = Scientist and for Engineers: trait = Engineer)\n\n- save the file and load the save in KSP. You dont need to restart the game, just load the savegame.\n\n- i guess, whenever you get a new Kerbal of the 3 standard classes, you have to rename his trait in the savefile.\n\ni hope this is more of an instruction!"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T17:16:39Z","Content":"Sorry for all the questions, but would it be possible to view Life Support time/status in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E screen?"},{"CreatedByName":"COL.R.Neville","CreatedById":168067,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-10T22:15:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, dlrk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sorry for all the questions, but would it be possible to view Life Support time/status in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E screen?\n\u003E \n\nisnt there a green square in the stock buttons that does that already? think you need to be in the tracking station for it to work like that though. \n\none that is usually next to it has a green square and planet and that one shows the planetary logistics system and all of your transfers. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-10T22:22:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2020 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by COL.R.Neville**"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-11T03:44:58Z","Content":"It opens the settings menu"},{"CreatedByName":"COL.R.Neville","CreatedById":168067,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-11T15:42:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, dlrk said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It opens the settings menu\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 17 hours ago, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E.R.Neville said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E isnt there a green square in the stock buttons that does that already? think \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eyou need to be in the tracking station \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003Efor it to work like that though. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E one that is usually next to it has a green square and planet and that one shows the planetary logistics system and all of your transfers.\n\u003E"}]}
