That will slingshot me in to a much higher orbit. From map view I align my view so that my orbit and minmus orbit make a perfect cross, and wait until my ship is at that cross. Then I burn north or south to change my orbit so it aligns perfectly with minmus orbit (this is called a plane change maneuver*). Now I just wait til minmus is some 20-45 degrees ahead of me, and expand my orbit by proburning until the patched conics tells me that I will enter minmus SOI.

This will put you in a suborbital trajectory, unless (1) you\\\u0027re very lucky and happened to launch at just the right time to hit Minmus (rare) or (2) you\\\u0027re going to be thrown off by the Mun (also rare, but slightly more likely to occur). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt approximately 2,000km (you can do it anywhere along the path really) altitude, using the map, I make my initial North-South adjustment burns. I burn about 5%-10% throttle, pointed to either 0 or 180 bearing on the navball, along the horizon. This will adjust the projected apo north or south without greatly altering its projected altitude. The target is to put the Apo directly on Minmus\\\u0027 orbital path. A series of fine adjustments is needed. (RCS burns would work too here, but I seldom bother with RCS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce apo is aligned, I burn again prograde or retrograde to put my apo at 46,400km (ish) (the north-south burns can throw it off). If necessary, I repeat the adjustments until it\\\u0027s \u0027good enough\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, timewarp to near the apo. Using this method, your relative velocity will be almost nil, due to the suborbital nature of your trajectory. Turn the ship to exactly 270 degrees, on the horizon, and full burn until your velocity is 274.1 m/s (ish). If you were perfect, you should be on a direct collision course with Minmus. More likely, however, you will be on a course to enter Minmus\\\u0027 zone of influence, from where a properly timed retro burn pulls you into a stable orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside to the method is, naturally, you will be entering Minmus\\\u0027 ZOI with a velocity of about 548 m/s relative to Minmus. Still, I\\\u0027ve almost never had a problem performing the required retrograde burn to enter Minmus orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I say this is a wrong method? Ideally, realistically, one would perform the adjustments while in Kerbal orbit, and time a transfer burn to Minmus from there, similar to the Munrise method. The reason would be, if there was a failure, it would be far easier to recover your kerbonauts from near Kerbal orbit, than it would be at 46,400 km away. (and if you miss your adjustments, you don\\\u0027t have a second orbit to try again, since you spend much of the trip sub-orbital). I suspect its also a bit inefficient with the delta V, since you\\\u0027re making essentially two correction burns - one in the polar direction to get the eccentricity, then one to set the collision course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne could use the same method to reach Mun (the eccentricity adjustment being skipped as unnecessary), but you would need to Apo at 11,400 km, and then do a 270 burn to 542.5 m/s - and your velocity relative to Mun would therefore be nearly 1100 m/s. I prefer the Munrise method for Mun, but I haven\\\u0027t found a good equivalent for Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESummary: There are better ways to do it, efficiency-wise, I\\\u0027m sure.

As mentioned before, you only need about 80 m/s more to burn into a Minmus intercept than you do into a Munar intercept from LKO, and if by some miracle, you don\\\u0027t manage to spend more than that in delta-V adjusting your Munar flyby trajectory to give your exit path an apoapsis Minmus orbit, you /will/ spend more than that in delta-V circularizing at Minmus\\\u0027 orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why I advocate doing the plane-change late in the transfer; The faster you\\\u0027re moving, the harder an orbital plane change is, and the farther out you are, the slower your spacecraft\\\u0027s moving, and at 30,000 km over Kerbin, you\\\u0027re moving pretty darned slow.
