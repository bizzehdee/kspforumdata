Despite the increased launch angle and because of the way rocket debris fell back toward the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E last launch, to be on the safe side all spectators had to be either inside or within 5 feet of a building entrance in order to view the launch from the campus. As launch time approached, the launch team under Flight Director Lanalye performed a flawless countdown and the Progeny Mk3 shot up into the sky right on time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight profile for this launch called for a maximum coast period between stages in order to give the rocket time to reach a higher altitude where engine efficiency would be greater and the atmosphere would be less resistant. Once the booster stage expired, it was immediately jettisoned to reduce weight however the next booster stage was not activated until the vertical speed of the rocket dropped back down to zero. We essentially launched this rocket three times, just not all from the ground! The flight of the first stage went just as planned, with a clean separation followed by a coast of the remaining rocket. The new fin angling (1st stage 1\u00B0, 2nd stage 0.5\u00B0 and 3rd stage 0.25\u00B0) put the rocket into a steady spin, but at a slower rate than engineers would have liked. Additionally the length of the rocket and possibly the lack of spin speed eventually caused it to pitch well over towards the horizon by the time it stopped climbing and the second stage was activated, sending it off laterally towards the southern-edge of the pre-planned ascent corridor. With the rocket now almost flying level, the coast period between the second and third stages was very short, and when the third stage was ignited it pushed the rocket past the boundaries of the ascent corridor. Following established protocol, the Range Safety Officer saw this occur and triggered the Flight Termination System, destroying the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough the loss of the payload is regrettable, we still gathered a lot of useful data on this flight, which is yet to be fully analyzed by engineers. The stream of telemetry to the tracking station still contains numerous useful parameters all recorded once per second, so while the loss of the Telemetry Data Unit aboard the payload is a pretty big blow to the program, we can still come to useful conclusions with the data we have in addition to the video footage, which will be posted this weekend. Next week we will perform a full review of the latest launch and decide when/how to launch the third and final rocket in this campaign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECivvie Production Model Certified for Flight\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFollowing up on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=3082\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eground testing\u003C/a\u003E carried out by Commander Val at the end of last week, Captain Jebediah took the new Civvie up for two test flights this week to ensure it\u2019s ready to begin taking on actual missions to satisfy contract work that has been piling up in the weeks since we\u2019ve been unable to fly any aircraft.

That was rather annoying given that for all this time I\u2019ve had no problems with long hour\u002B missions in KSP. However given the PC itself rebooted I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s just a general hardware glitch from too much uptime. Will have to hope it doesn\u2019t happen again but luckily for airplane flight this happening isn\u2019t really a huge deal. Since I started taking screenshots every second instead of continuous video, this meant that I had a record of where I was right before the computer crashed. So I was able to use the coordinates from my last location and place my aircraft there using Hyperedit\u2019s ship lander. Of course I had to also remember to re-enable the VOID logger, image capture and Persistent Trails track. I forgot the last two on separate occasions so it took me three tries to get the aircraft back on track but it worked in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETakeoff/Landing Video\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve added to my Before Takeoff and Before Landing checklists to begin recording video using a button on my joystick. I really do like the smaller file size of just stitching together the 1s images but when crashes happen during takeoff/landing the extra FPS really helps me see what went wrong and make it easier to share that exact data in my public reports. So now I just record video during these segments of the flight only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EJoystick Control Issues\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately it seems the AFBW mod that lets me use my joystick without input lag doesn\u2019t play nice with the KSP trim controls, nor does its own trim control work properly. When you set the KSP trim, moving the joystick will move the control surfaces from 0 pitch/roll/yaw instead of started from wherever the trim is currently set. I made note of the this in the first Civvie test flight and said it was fixed in the second. It isn\u2019t fixed, I\u2019m just dealing with it using the aileron trim. I tried to go back to stock KSP joystick controls but input lag still prevents me from using it. Any delay in the physics ticks of the game (yellow/red time) will also slow the input from the joystick. Even if you don\u2019t see the timer as constantly yellow, sometimes it will briefly flash and the controls will lag. I also thought I had found a way to program my joystick to ensure only a single keypress was sent when a button was hit, but turns out I still need to be careful about how I mash the buttons on the joystick (Saitek X52) to ensure I don\u2019t, for example, start and immediately stop recording video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBetter Overland Distance Calculation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I want to know how far a ground vehicle will travel I use Vessel Mover, which lets me zip a vessel across the surface while Persistent Trails is active measuring the distance I\u2019m traveling along the route.

The original is on the left and the modified version is on the right. There are two key differences. First I\u2019ve made the navigation lights on the Civvie look like they are lit. Second and more subtle, the daylight shining in through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E skylights and windows has been dimmed to match the outside light conditions better. A lot of my images have these small changes to help enhance their look and feel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgeny Launch #2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis launch took me two tries because when I initially created the Persistent Trail entry for this launch I made two by accident, and I deleted the most recent one, assuming they were both recording. Well, when I had the payload under chute and waiting for it to descend, I noticed the distance measurement on the trail had not increased from 0. I should have deleted the first trail I created. D\u2019oh! But on the other hand, this was a fortuitous break in my progress because it made me go back and think about how awry the launch went from a trajectory perspective and that it probably should have been terminated for exceeding the range limits. That made for a more interesting event, so I went with that on the second launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also did a better job on the video this time, remembering to use multiple camera angles. This is a trick I had forgotten I already knew to do from the original run of the KSA when I had to \u201Cstream\u201D launch video right alongside telemetry, so events had to occur properly at the exact second. Having multiple angles allows you to jump ahead in the footage without anyone realizing it by switching to a different viewpoint. It\u2019s almost impossible to tell the next scene after the cut is actually 6-7 seconds later in the footage to allow things to sync up properly.

The base pitch was adjusted from 6\u00B0 to 5\u00B0, matching the angle used for the Progeny Mk2 launches. The rocket fins for the second flight were 1st stage 1\u00B0, 2nd stage 0.5\u00B0 and 3rd stage 0.25\u00B0. These have been increased to 1st stage 1.5\u00B0, 2nd stage 1\u00B0 and 3rd stage 0.75\u00B0. The larger increase to the upper-stage fins is due to the fact that these two boosters will be coasting longer than they will be under thrust. The main problem with the previous launch was how flat the boosters fell as they lost momentum. Although the same thing will happen again, the increased spin rate should slow down this pitch over. Additionally, we don\u2019t plan to wait until the rocket gets that far over. The flight profile for this launch will wait only until the pitch of the rocket falls by 3\u00B0 since the start of the coast period. This should be able to put the rocket into the upper atmosphere at last.

I\u2019m now 4 weeks ahead and that\u2019s plenty to coast on, so after today I will be able to go back to the routine of banging out a day of ops and using the remainder of the time to work on other things. Well, I\u2019m not entirely out of the woods yet since I still have a lot of database updating and mission log prepping to do for events that have transpired over the past 4 weeks in the KSA operations. I was originally planning to just handle them as they came up the actual day before, but that\u2019s not really smart since I have the ability to schedule things well ahead of time I might as well use it fully. So technically I still have some catching up to do. After that it\u2019s back to getting KSP v1.2.2 set up and running \u2013 just in time for the new update pre-release to drop!

The struts however add 0.1t to the aircraft over the version with the fixed gear, but I consider that to be negligible. Lately I was having trouble getting off the ground because it would roll fine until 40m/s when the tail wheel would come off the ground (as is proper) and then it would hit the smallest of bumps in the terrain and the main gear would launch the craft into the air before I had reached a flight speed of around 50m/s. By pitching down after the tail wheel comes up to keep the main wheels on the ground longer I can usually make it off the ground intact (for the record the pitch down is also a correct procedure for tail draggers taking off but bouncing into the air isn\u2019t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other problem that threw me into a fit of rage was the fact that AFBW doesn\u2019t respect the stock trim settings, so if you set the trim with the Alt-WASDQE keys and then move the joystick, the flight controls will all re-center and pitch/yaw/roll from a neutral position. I spoke about this in last week\u2019s desk notes. Well, I thought I\u2019d be okay just handling the roll with aileron trim but the Civvie is so twitchy along the roll axis I\u2019m trimming left/right like mad to compensate \u0026amp; it\u2019s just a pain in the ass. So I finally looked into the trim axis available through AFBW since I have two rollers on my throttle I\u2019m not using. The AFBW trim worked fine in the flights I did this past week, however the way its setup is rather dumb, in my opinion. Rather than using the actual axis value to set the trim (move the axis 1/4 and have the trim set to 1/4) the trim tab is moved in the direction you twist the axis at a speed defined by the magnitude of the axis. So if I want to finely adjust my trim I need to twitch the axis roller to nudge the trim tab a little bit in either direction. ARRRRRGGGHHH!!! But it worked, even if it was super annoying to control this way. There\u2019s a newer build for KSP v1.2.2 that is said to respect trim in its change log, so hopefully I can go back to stock trim soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA final frustration was being unable to stop my Saitek X52 from sending multiple button presses for a single click. Even though I created a macro that had a single key down/key up action, just pressing \u003Cem\u003Eand holding\u003C/em\u003E the button to take a single screenshot produced 2-3 screenshots. So stopping/starting video was a complete clusterlove because if it sent 2 actions the video recording would stop but then immediately start again. So I have to take my hand off the throttle to begin/stop recording during takeoff \u0026amp; landing, which is really annoying.

First example was a photo I took of the launch pad and I was going to say Bob took it, until I remembered all the astronauts were away on an excursion and he couldn\u2019t have been there to take it. So I just tossed out the image \u2013 it was mostly filler anyways. But then as I was reviewing a tweet that was going to be published in a few hours, I realized I had done it again. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/RSp6pq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis image\u003C/a\u003E was going to be credited to Bob, but he was off on the MSV Tongjess waiting to launch a high-altitude balloon at the time, so I quick switched it to Val just a few hours before the tweet was published.

So I realized that was pretty far and everyone would have originally seen it head out over the ocean and figured it was reasonable for them to assume that\u2019s where it ended up. Then I decided it should be found on launch day because of course we\u2019d go through the trouble of getting ready to launch when something like that happens.

Given that GeoGebra has an interactive web application, I\u2019m seriously considering whether I can use this to create a dynamic version of the orbital position maps currently included in the Flight Tracker. This would be a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E time saver in the long run. Even though I can generate these images for a week mostly automatically and get them all ready to upload in 30-45 minutes, moving forward with more space objects and potentially more bodies things will start to get more complicated for rendering the graphs. Being able to just input some orbital data and having the body/craft be rendered for a given date/time would be a great thing.

But the day before, I looked at it again and really hated that I had Val behind the camera and out of the shot. So I made the decision to insert her into the photo. The easiest way would be a selfie-style image, but I couldn\u2019t fit her in adequately without having to also shift Bill over a little bit to the right so you could still see him waving, which meant I also had to reveal some buildings/landscape behind his head. But first things first \u2013 getting a shot of Val I could use. Luckily one of the animation poses I had already made gave her a nice head tilt, and I just had to position the camera properly and make sure the lighting was correct \u2013 I still lit her mouth a bit too much but if anyone asked I was ready to explain how she\u2019s standing in front of the bunker doorway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 width=\u0022650\u0022 style=\u0022height:257px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154-300x188.\u0022 height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KSP_x64.exe_DX9_20170314_045154-1024x640.png 1024w\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nVal in Jeb\u2019s pose.

I crashed the game a few times while experimenting with how far I could push out the cloud particle rendering. Ultimately it came down to increasing the size of the cloud particles more than increasing the distance at which you could see them. I still don\u2019t fully understand the numbers used by the plugin, but I eventually got a look I liked, then took the photos around mid-day to reduce the amount of shadows seen on the ground. Since the large cloud particles made things pretty hazy, I adjusted the contrast to bring out more definition, but go too far and you can see the borders of the 2D sprites clipping into each other, so a balance must be struck. Rain was a simple after-effect added by creating a bunch of noise and then applying a motion blur to all the pixels.

The first try when I triggered the action group that was supposed to destroy all the fins (using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94674-113-kaboom-v111-another-way-to-not-go-to-space-today-detonate-parts-from-eva-part-menu/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKaboom\u003C/a\u003E mod) only the lower-stage fins were destroyed, and triggering the action group a few more times destroyed the remaining fins in progression. Ok, weird. Second time I tried again, I just spam-clicked the action group button (using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-Action-Groups-Extended-%28Ver-1-1%29-250-Named-Action-Groups-with-in-flight-editing\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAction Groups Extended\u003C/a\u003E) but than made it disappear and the button below moved up to its place, making me also destroy the 3rd stage fins.

For one thing, try as I might to do things the way I did in the original flight the fins on the third stage would suffer aerodynamic failure and rip off. I tried multiple times to the same effect. I double-checked aero failures were enabled in the save game I use for actual missions and they were. So I just disabled aero failures in my save game I use to recreate missions.

Although we are still awaiting the safe arrival of the balloon payload so we can\u2019t celebrate \u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E just yet, today\u2019s mission was still a great accomplishment.

There was a small issue Jeb had to deal with from the Civvie which he dubbed \u201Crunaway trim\u201D, where the trim wheel would slip and roll up, pitching the nose violently. He\u2019s already informed the HAB crew to have a look at it, they suspect a loose element in the system will need to be refurbished or replaced \u2013 no one expects this to be a serious issue. Overall though his first flight with a payload attached to the Civvie he says was very manageable and after Val discovered that even pumping a little fuel to the rear can greatly assist with landing, Jeb tried it with the same results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe expect the recovery crews to return very early tomorrow around 1st sunset.

While the Genesis Program itself is still in the red thanks to the recent development of the Deuce, the future is looking bright for the program overall as once the Deuce enters service it will be able to offer up even more income opportunities beyond what the Civvie is capable of. The program\u2019s growth will also allow us to phase out heavy reliance on other companies like maritime and airship operations, keeping more support services in-house and expenses down on missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the start of work on the Deuce, C7 has finished up its new factory in Kravass City which will produce as many as 4 Civvies per month starting in May. There is already a pre-order list over 300 names long, so it will take a while to meet demand at the current pace but once C7 gets this factory running smoothly they plan to scale up quickly. The completed aircraft will be shipped to the nearby Kravass General Airport where kerbs will receive their flight instruction from our own Jeb and Val. The initial group consists of hand-picked top airship captains who will then become the first cadre of full-time flight instructors. By the time the first Civvie rolls off the production line in May, it will also have a newly-designed suite of cockpit instruments and our own production model will receive an upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience/R\u0026amp;D Labs Begin Work on New Instruments\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the successful deployment of the Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer instrument \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/?p=3259\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elast week\u003C/a\u003E, Head of R\u0026amp;D Wernher has already focused his laser-grade attention on the next project, which of several proposals he selected to be a negative gravioli detector.

Both the barometer and thermometer devices currently in use are not vacuum-rated and she will work with the scientists to develop casings that can allow these instruments to function in space. Why send a barometer to space, you ask? Great question! The answer is that while we strongly suspect most of the moons and some of the planets out there don\u2019t have an atmosphere, how can we know for sure unless we measure the presence of a vacuum?

The road to get there though is still a long one and it\u2019s been a bit more of a struggle than I anticipated, which is why it\u2019s been over two weeks to get one week of KSA ops completed. Okay, v1.2.2 isn\u2019t the only reason, I digress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGetting old sucks\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019m suffering from a bout of tendonitis at the moment in my mouse hand. I felt it coming and I ignored it and now I\u2019m paying the price. All that clickclickclickclickclick scrollscrollscrollscrollscrollscroll for hours on end has taken its toll and the tendon leading to my pointer finger cries out in pain if I use it in the slightest wrong way now. So, I just need to force myself to take more breaks. I had an issue earlier this year with carpal tunnel in my mouse hand \u2013 I could make a thumbs up, tuck my thumb into my fist and angle it downwards and it felt like the tendon in my thumb wanted to escape from beneath my skin. But rest and changing how I use my hand has healed it, so same here, changing the way I click \u0026amp; scroll, now using my middle finger more and keeping my pointer finger straighter more often. And yes, more breaks. Well I have a few months of magazine subscriptions to catch up on. And if you\u2019re wondering I\u2019m 34 going on 35 so yea I\u2019m bellyaching a bit much here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBack to v1.2.2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so after taking a few days off completely from the computer I came back and dove into getting v1.2.2 setup and ready to rock and roll. Overall performance-wise things are roughly the same as in v1.1.3 although the default physics tick is shorter so I see the yellow clock pretty much all the time even when I uninstall all my graphics mods. But I feel no lag at all in my control inputs and the game barely stutters so I will leave it set to 0.4s as opposed to the 0.6s I was using under v1.1.3. Also loading my huge save of asteroids doesn\u2019t work as well as it did under v1.1.3 and I had to create a batch file that uninstalls all but the mods I need for asteroids and now things are snappy again. Not a huge deal. There have been problems though. Oh yes, there have been problems. In several instances I\u2019ve spent hours tracking down issues. I made detailed notes about them but to be honest I really don\u2019t want to bore anyone with the details now that I\u2019m writing about it so I\u2019ll briefly cover some of the issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E developer build was voxelizing propeller spinners, which was creating a huge amount of drag. Thankfully ferram is actively working on things and had that problem fixed in a few days.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWheels still suck, or its just the v1.2.2 terrain issues, but whatever the case getting the Civvie Production to takeoff on the grass was almost impossible in v1.1.3 and now it\u2019s pretty much completely impossible. As soon as the tail wheel comes up the plane wants to swerve sideways. So now I\u2019ve been using flying starts. I taxi out to the turf runway, use VesselMover to move the plane back a ways, mark the spot in Hyperedit\u2019s ship dropper and then drop the airplane from about 600m up, enough for me to recover just above the ground and then fly low and slow over the runway to \u201Ctakeoff\u201D, where I begin to record telemetry data.

Full analysis of the launch data will have to wait until the teams return from a well-deserved vacation for most of next week but as with all launches we expect to learn a lot. Although the goal of 18\u002Bkm has been reached we still have a ways to go and data from this launch will help show us how to get there. Still, rounding upwards we have reached 1/3 of the way to space, which puts a significant portion of the thicker atmosphere behind us. After igniting, the third stage boosted for a mere 2.4s whereas the upcoming Liquid Fuel/Oxidizer engine will have a run time of 31s. Could the first Progeny Mk4 reach space?

I had previously flown the Production model with no real issues, but the Mk2 was a whole different story. For some reason it really really likes to pitch up now and I don\u2019t really know what has changed. I removed the chute on top (just when I\u2019m flying not officially) in case some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E/RealChute bug was at play and also changed the landing gear from the two-wheeled medium gear attached straight to the wings to the one-wheeled light gear strutted to the fuselage at the same height/width as the fixed landing gear (can\u2019t use those at all). That helped but I was still forced to apply a permanent amount of down-pitch trim to get the aircraft to handle close to what it did in v1.1.3 (I have videos of every flight so I can go back and check). And although I did attempt a normal takeoff it didn\u2019t want to cooperate and so I\u2019m using flying starts for this one too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4th Time is the Charm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay so really 3rd time since I deliberately messed with the last launch, which could have reached the upper atmosphere. But where\u2019s the drama in that? This was also the first time launching the Mk3 in v1.2.2 so I expected problems and there were some \u2013 mainly the fact that all the boosters had their atmosphere curves changed so the performed differently. The first-stage booster accelerated the stack so fast the rocket came apart shortly after it finished its burn! So I went back and checked the values I was using in v1.1.3 and was stunned to find all 3 boosters had the same atmosphere curves. This was astonishing because I had discovered this before even rebooting the KSA and called out RoverDude on it, who then released a fix shortly before the reboot and so I could have sworn I was using boosters in v1.1.3 that each had different atmosphere curves \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t?? What the crap!? Even the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E numbers you see when you hover over the engines for the rocket pages is what I thought was being used (have since updated them to all be the same now). This would be a \u003Cem\u003Ehuge\u003C/em\u003E retcon that I couldn\u2019t begin to even handle, soooo now I have the ability to \u201Cupgrade\u201D these booster should I need to down the line. Yeeesh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight itself took the usual few tries to get right. The first attempt is when I realized something was wrong with the booster performance, the second I panicked when the payload actually splashed down in water and rushed to recover it before it sank too far (which I know now isn\u2019t possible, you can recover it even from the ocean floor) and forgot to save the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPersistent Trails\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/119337-Part-1-0-Graphotron-v0-3-May-4-2015\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EGraphotron\u003C/a\u003E data. The third launch I somehow forgot to set the Graphotron to enable on launch, even though I literally have a checklist I follow that has the item to set that option. Epic fail.

How symbolic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFilming the recreation was easier than I thought it would be, although that came with a few minor issues as well.

The ascent for the final launch called for the flight controller to initiate booster ignition during coast once the pitch of the rocket had decreased by 2\u00B0 since the previous booster had been decoupled. Launch occurred at a pitch of 85\u00B0 and the initial acceleration of the rocket pushed the nose up to 86\u00B0 before the spin was initiated and pitch stabilized back towards 85\u00B0. The coast period of the second stage was defined by the gradual decrease in pitch from 85\u00B0 to 83\u00B0 over the following 22 seconds. After the second stage was dropped, the third stage began its coast from 82\u00B0 \u2013 but it never reached 80\u00B0 and the booster was ignited when the backup parameter was met as the vertical speed dropped to 0. This led to a momentary flattening out of the trajectory that ultimately cost us at least several hundred meters in altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IybA-YPCQPBHW7wen4RtdF-RXZQPYKQIYqwQ_3b8gD8/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Progeny-Mk3-4-e1492626528723-300x111.png\u0022 height=\u0022111\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Progeny-Mk3-4-e1492626528723-300x111.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Progeny-Mk3-4-e1492626528723-300x111.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Progeny-Mk3-4-e1492626528723.png 339w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe purple line is altitude.

Click the image for the full telemetry data\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Progenitor engineers agree we are getting closer to an optimal ascent profile but much more tweaking and experimenting needs to be done. For the Mk4 we have several changes in mind. First, we are going to be playing around with the amount of thrust produced by the first and second stage boosters, as currently they push the rocket\u2019s dynamic pressure values far higher than is nominal. Even though we know the rocket will hold together after the punishing 190kPa endured by the first Mk3 launch, the amount of drag produced is excessive. This final launch saw a Max Q of 96.8kPa during the first stage boost and 51.9kPa during the second stage boost.\u00A0 We would like to keep dynamic pressure below 40kPa during both segments of the flight (third stage boost topped only 5.6kPa due to the thinner atmosphere, and we can throttle our \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O engine so only the first two stages are an issue here as far as dynamic pressure is concerned). We will still be launching the first Mk4 with a hot stage ascent to get a baseline for performance, but after that these considerations will be put into effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore we plan to tweak the fin angles once again, since the spin-rate of the last launch was still a bit too fast, and extra spin just uses up energy the rocket needs to climb higher. We feel the first stage fins are good, but the second and third stage\u2019s pitch angles need to be lessened some more due to their longer flight time. We will be dialing them back each 25\u00B0 which will make the second stage 0.85\u00B0 and the third stage 0.50\u00B0. Additionally, there was still a little loss of altitude gain in the second stage coast period so we will reduce the coast until the rocket pitches over only 1.5\u00B0 instead of 2\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, we will be changing the backup ignition parameter to ignite the booster if vertical speed falls below 100m/s while pitch delta remains below 1.5\u00B0 \u2013 we expect this to only be an issue with the third stage and 100m/s is just a starting estimation based on the simulated performance of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/O engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a look at all 4 launch trajectories together:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable align=\u0022center\u0022 border=\u00220\u0022 style=\u0022border-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);width:65%;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr style=\u0022border-color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctd style=\u0022border-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o-300x188.png\u0022 height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_035959_33292642173_o-1024x640.png 1024w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd style=\u0022border-color:rgb(255,255,255);background-color:rgb(255,255,255);text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o-300x188.png\u0022 height=\u0022188\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o-300x188.png\u0022 srcset=\u0022http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o-300x188.png 300w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o-768x480.png 768w, http://www.kerbalspace.agency/KSA/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ksp_x64exe_dx9_20170417_040159_33713471200_o-1024x640.png 1024w\u0022 style=\u0022border-width:0px;\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that the Mk3 has reached its goal of breaching the upper atmosphere (18km), work has shifted fully over to the Mk4, which we hope will be able to reach space at last.

I had to lower the value a lot to get asteroids to finally show up. It was made more complicated by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80483-0-23-5-Custom-Asteroids-1-0-0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECustom Asteroids\u003C/a\u003E, which I thought was outright suppressing the stock spawner but the real reason was a bit trickier \u2013 since it would take so long for the stock asteroids to show up, Custom Asteroids would have already spawned enough unknown objects to exceed the maximum amount allowed by the stock spawner. I thought it was using its own internal count of asteroids spawned, not the number of untracked objects.

Originally I wanted to use the embedded tweets feature (paste a tweet link \u2013 done) of the forum to compose mission reports, but that would have been a lot of tweets and the thread would have been hell to scroll through. In the previous KSA iteration I stuck them in spoiler tags, but those were images of tweets, and the embedded tweets don\u2019t work in spoiler boxes. No way am I taking the time again to make images of every tweet to post, especially when my current mission report format here on the site (which also used to use those same tweet images) looks so damn nice with an embedded timeline. So it just languished for a while until the fix to the imgur album embeds gave me the idea to redo it this past weekend to hold all the operation summaries and will continue to update there weekly.

I didn\u2019t want to have to go into deciding exactly how much each program should get given their level of involvement and the amount of funds they have to expend relative to each other and just made it an even 50/50 split. But then Genesis also has a 50/50 profit/expense split agreement with C7, which is a completely separate company that I don\u2019t keep records for. So if a joint contract payout is 6,356 funds, that would mean that KerBalloon would get 3,178 while Genesis would only get 1,589 after their split with C7. However since C7 profits do not factor into KSA profits when I make the income entry for the monthly financial sheet (not the program/craft financial sheet) I have to record the total income as being only 4,767, which is less the 1,589 that was paid to C7 and thus shouldn\u2019t end up in KSA\u2019s accounts. What\u2019s that you say? It\u2019s not so complicated at all? Great!

Same data as in my text file with the outline of events to complete but just more condensed and easier to look over to ensure I don\u2019t continue to mistakenly reference astronauts doing some event when they are actually someplace else.

If the schedule holds we should have our first completed Progeny Mk4 rocket ready to be rolled out next Wednesday prior to launch early on Thursday. This first launch will follow previous first launches and use hot staging to subject the rocket to extreme levels of dynamic pressure during flight to see how the new third stage handles itself. In other words, no \u2013 we will not be going to space next week. The following launch however has a pretty good shot at making it most if not all of the way.

The flight itself almost didn\u2019t make it off the ground when a strong storm was blowing in from the south on the day it was set to depart. With a lot of work from the ground crews we were able to compact a new turf runway in a few hours out on the field to allow the prototype to depart to the south and into the winds that would have knocked it over had it tried to takeoff facing east or west. The aircraft overflew Umbarg on its way west to the desert and we hear some aircraft enthusiasts went topside to spot it. Navigation was done mainly by compass as the prototype does not carry any radio navigation equipment common to airships (but this will come standard in the new production models being manufactured in Kravass) and Jeb had no trouble finding his way to the airport itself, as the 5km\u002B peak of Kravass Mountain was easy to spot over the horizon once he got close enough.

Jeb was extremely pleased that he was able to climb the Civvie directly over the mountains this time without having to circle around to gain more altitude. Although control wasn\u2019t a serious issue before, the KerBalloon unit mounting was still adjusted slightly to better improve the center of mass of the aircraft. A low cloud ceiling during the mission prevented the airship comms relay from being able to maintain a station higher than the mountains, which meant it had to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tXGbTso.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emove between\u003C/a\u003E allowing us to talk to the Civvie or the UTV teams after the KerBalloon unit was dropped and Jeb headed south on his secondary objective \u2013 however this did not lead to any problems during the mission.

Thankfully though since I\u2019ve switched to taking screenshots every second with which to compile into a video afterwards, if the computer does freeze up all the images will already be written to disk.

I was never good at this either when I flew Flight Simulator, although I did have a flight planner program that I used. Basically, I took an educated guess for this flight that the Civvie would have enough fuel to make it to Kravass. I had no idea what I was going to do if the fuel ran out along the way, but thankfully that wasn\u2019t an issue. Still, I don\u2019t ever want it to be an issue because that would be rather embarrassing even if it does happen in real life for various reasons.

I added a third layer of the bright photo so I could separately control how the Civvie parked on the tarmac outside was lit by light bouncing off the ground. Then I just had to get an internal shot lined up, black out the HAB windows and also reduce the amount of light on the skylight walls. But then after all this I realized the Deuce should be visible! I thought at first I would just say it had been moved well off to the side, but the game was still running with the camera at the same angle so I just merged the Deuce construction save file and managed to setup all those parts off in the distance without moving the camera. Oh yes, and I also placed a girder out there so that I could take a photo with and without the HAB crews so I could edit out those marshallers outside the building. That gap between the Deuce parts? That\u2019s where a marshaller stands because when I placed those parts I had the HAB crew re-enabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBatch File KSP Run Detection\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a batch file that removes all non-essential gameplay/visual mods so I can clean up execution for the tons of asteroids when I load the ATN save, and also a batch file that removes all visual mods when I need to fly a vessel with good FPS.

They still have not completely ruled out some sort of malfunction with the engine itself during combustion, or perhaps a combination of these two factors, but they do feel that high levels of dynamic pressure are the main cause. The third stage\u2019s structural integrity was probably compromised during the second stage boost and only held together until separation occurred. This failure however isn\u2019t really a setback, because we purposely threw as much dynamic pressure at the rocket as possible in order to test theoretical stress limits of the rocket\u2019s various components. We are now pretty sure that those theoretical limits have been exceeded in the case of the liquid fuel tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to make sure the engine wasn\u2019t an issue during flight, we will be static-firing the second one on the launch pad early next week to ensure that it is performing at the expected levels of thrust under various throttle settings. Since these engines are not designed to be lit off more than once, it will take another two days to refurbish \u0026amp; replace the ignition system before it can be integrated into the stack. We\u2019re aiming to launch NET May 30th.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis next launch isn\u2019t going to make things much better for the rocket either, because now that we know how fast not to go in the \u003Cem\u003Elower\u003C/em\u003E atmosphere, the question remains how fast can we go in the \u003Cem\u003Eupper\u003C/em\u003E atmosphere? Once the air starts to thin out the rocket can really begin to accelerate and the lack of air to transfer heat away means that thermal build-up is a serious concern that will need to be managed. First though we need to find out where the limits are. We will be switching to a normal launch profile for the second launch, coasting between stages, to ease up on the dynamic pressures early in the flight.

This is the problem with having such a short lead time, I don\u2019t really take any time to properly plan things out because I feel so rushed to get things done. I have to be extra-extra careful about things too because I don\u2019t have the liberty of realizing I made a mistake three weeks from now and being able to still go back and fix things before they are posted.

Long story short is all the parts were there I just hadn\u2019t deployed them properly so that they could all be used. So for example, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/etPUe44.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis photo\u003C/a\u003E is wrong because those two KerBalloons should have had nosecone chutes to free up the two remaining KerBalloon parachutes (that attach direct to the case) to be used by the aircraft drop and UTV carry missions over land. So the missions that were carried out \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E possible with the parts available, thankfully. I\u2019ve further tweaked the part inventory sheets to help me get better at this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk4 launch clusterlove\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI probably could have had this all wrapped up yesterday had I not screwed up the Mk4 launch so badly in so many ways. First big mistake was that I forgot I had planned to have the launch be slightly delayed, so I flew it launching at the original L-0 time of 12:45 local. Then for that launch I forgot to save the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49216\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPersistent Trails \u003C/a\u003Edata so I had to go back and fly it again. After that I finally realized I needed to delay the launch so toss everything out and start over with the new L-0 time of 12:54. Okay, get that launch in the bag but then when breaking down the rocket in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to get deltaV \u0026amp; weight measurements I realize the thrust limiters on the boosters are dialed back. This was from me previously testing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E settings for future launches but it wasn\u2019t supposed to be dialed back for this launch. CRAP I need to redo the launch again. But wait \u2013 I\u2019ve been flying this launch with coasts between stages and OH MY loveING GOD I\u2019M SUPPOSED TO BE HOT STAGING THIS LAUNCH \u2013 at this point I managed to not pick up and throw things around, but I did \u201Ctoss\u201D all my launch video \u0026amp; data once again and flew the launch all over for a third time (really fifth or sixth time but third distinctly different launch scenario). Finally I had launch data, video and events I could actually use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBesides all that I spent some time figuring out how to destroy the rocket with a big boom, because using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94674-113-kaboom-v111-another-way-to-not-go-to-space-today-detonate-parts-from-eva-part-menu/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKaboom\u003C/a\u003E mod only made things go \u003Cem\u003Epoof\u003C/em\u003E in a bunch of smoke.

I tied its position to a static object at the airport so that when I reloaded the game I could snap right back to the same point and take another photo with scatter objects and not have to deal with moving around anything, just click a few buttons and capture the shot.

Of course, that could eventually get me in trouble with twitter but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T18:34:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just found this awesome project of yours via your signature, and I am impressed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you hire (Programmer, Engineer, Public Education Manager or such)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T20:40:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063453\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495391698\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245759\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MarkusA380\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, MarkusA380 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you hire (Programmer, Engineer, Public Education Manager or such)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, it\u0027s all me because ironically teamwork involves more work, if you get what I mean \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E - especially on a hobbyist project with high levels of varying commitment among team members\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you like tho, hope you enjoy the continuing adventures...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarkusA380","CreatedById":45759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T21:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063554\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495399235\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Drew Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, Drew Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, it\u0027s all me because ironically teamwork involves more work, if you get what I mean \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E - especially on a hobbyist project with high levels of varying commitment among team members\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad you like tho, hope you enjoy the continuing adventures...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo bad, but too understandable \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-21T21:05:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223063573\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022147386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495400619\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002245759\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MarkusA380\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, MarkusA380 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToo bad, but too understandable \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut hey - I forgot to point out you\u0027re already helping me out greatly with this by creating and continuing to support Persistent Rotation!
