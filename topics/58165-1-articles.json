I\u0027ve tried both burning at about 100 degrees with maneuver nodes and manually watching for munrise, but both methods usually leave me either too far away from the Mun or entering into Munnar orbit from the Mun\u0027s trailing edge, so my velocity increases as I swing around. I managed to get a perfect transfer exactly once, and then burned up on reentry and lost all my science and a valuable member of my space program.

You can swing either side, the trick is to kill your unneeded velocity when you are the closest, to take advantage of the Oberth effect. It also helps if you make a precise Hohmann transfer when approaching the mun so your kerbin periapsis is where the mun should \u0022catch\u0022 you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i usually do: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. make the transfer maneuver node (about 800 deltav i think)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. start the burn at the right time (if its 6 min burn needed then i start at t-3min)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. when the burn is almost done, i check the map if the plan goes well or not, and stop burning before rather than after the right point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. make a new maneuver node with 2-4 min eta, to make a rough correction (usually a small deltav, dont remember well, maybe 50)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. make a new maneuver node with 5-10 min eta, and play around with it to make a precise arrival, like, 10km from the mun surface (about 0-2 deltav)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe sooner you make the corrections the better. if you try to make corrections later, then it will be a lot of deltav wasted\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i enter the mun\u0027s SOI, i immediately make sure that my path is good, if not, i correct it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen i\u0027m 10km from the mun\u0027s surface i kill my velocity to make a nice orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"armeggedonCounselor","CreatedById":98952,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T02:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright. I made a couple of good Munnar orbits today, thanks to some of this advice. So, thanks.
