If you download and unzip the files you should put the 3 folders (SSTU, KSPWheel, CRP) and the ModuleManager.dll in the Gamedata folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can look for mod incompabilities.

I would recommend grabbing the latest version directly from GitHub -- the Curse version is not updated with the latest (Curse was down last time I was publishing releases).\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.7.38.144\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/releases/tag/0.7.38.144\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Make sure you are using KSP 1.3.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) If you are still having problems, please post your KSP.log file -- it will contain the necessary details to debug/diagnose what is going on.\u00A0 You can upload the log to dropbox/etc, and simply post a link to it from there.\u00A0 For shorter log files, PasteBin is a good alternative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Your mod list looks fine except for the \u0027SSTU-Expansion\u0027 -- that has not been updated in quite some time, and will only break things (like, all the things).\u00A0 (note to self, remove links to the expansions until they can be updated...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Feel free to continue this conversation in the SSTU dev thread (is what it is for) if you are still running into problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5863915861\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117090-wip131-sstulabs-low-part-count-solutions-orbiters-landers-lifters-dev-thread-10-09-17/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"powellxcix","CreatedById":182726,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-11T09:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey!
