Of course the mod forum will have the more visits than the others. More people are going to be interested in what kinds of mods are available (even if just browsing) than need technical support or tutorials or simply just want to chat. That doesn\u0027t mean that KSP is being \u0022kept afloat\u0022 by the modding community. It just means that KSP community has a healthy interest in seeing the kinds of mods that are available, and extending the game beyond stock capability. \n\nWithout a doubt, mods and the entire modding community are an important aspect of KSP. But they are neither vital nor necessary to enjoy the game. Plenty of people can, and do play with stock KSP, and many more run with only minimal mods, myself included. I currently only use Kerbal Engineer, SCANsat, and RCSBuildAid. That has nothing to do with memory or capability, and is simply a personal choice.\n\nOn topic:\n\n32-Bit Windows will be not be the death of anything. We\u0027ll continue to have/use 32-bit KSP until such a time as SQUAD can ship out a quality 64 bit Windows version thanks to an upgraded version of Unity. Don\u0027t forget: There\u0027s a perfectly fine 64-bit linux version for the people that simply MUST have that capability. Is the situation perfect? No. But it\u0027s the best we have available to us, and it\u0027ll be just fine until we can have better."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T06:34:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Take a look at which forum gets the most visits on a constant basis and at the download counts for various mods and rethink it.\n\nHow many of those views are repeats?

And occasionally, a stupid user, who thinks they know everything, drops by and says \u0022you should do 64bit!\u0022 or \u0022you should do multithreaded!\u0022.

The only thing it really adds is some more virtual memory space. Which allows you to map more memory, IF it\u0027s available (and there are tons of systems with no more then 4GB of memory)"}]}
