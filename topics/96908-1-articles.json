I was also trying to land in a very specific set of coordinates because it was part of a challenge. I succeeded in landing the probe within 100m of the target, but it wasnt a perfect landing. There was an error in the programming and the landing gear never deployed so it landed fine then just rolled down a hill and then deployed its antenna. But it was successful mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7r46pYb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227r46pYb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OJXTKTc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OJXTKTc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VJELEUr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VJELEUr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MKsVYze.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MKsVYze.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FCbdu3e.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FCbdu3e.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OAupcQv.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OAupcQv.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the last time I sent anything to Eve.... kind of sad really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROXunreal","CreatedById":133129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T18:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll just have to quicksave and see how it goes I guess, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T18:57:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227-0-90-Smart-Parts-V1-5-1-KSP-AVC-and-AGX-Compatibility-Jan-8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESmart Parts\u003C/a\u003E.
