The other thing is you have two gimbal transforms - I\u0027m thinking that\u0027s not going to work - I don\u0027t have access to Squads code but I would guess that ModuleGimbal simply rotates the gimbal transform you provide to move the engine bell and thrust transform. With two ModuleGimbal\u0027s would you get double the angle(assuming the transforms are in the same spot)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GK7","CreatedById":205162,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-07T17:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, If I do 2 thrustTransforms, and under that both of the individual engine models\u00A0unity doesnt load the texture, it just loads the model which is incomplete\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-09T03:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m probably misunderstanding the situation but Unity shouldn\u0027t care about the transforms - I would think you wouldn\u0027t see the problem until you were in KSP.
