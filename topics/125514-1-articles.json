Since I play in Career mode a large part of that has been the tech tree, which I put some thought into and edited a lot of part files (including stock) to arrange them in a way that each node was rewarding, and each tier had no clear \u0022best node\u0022. I also made edits to balance resources and such; Some mods tend to over-power their items, or sometimes I like to buff a stock item to make it more competitive instead. You know when you get a bunch of mods and then try to play Career, you end up with like a battery that\u0027s ten times as good in the same tech node and it costs way less, I always want to fix that stuff! I thought I did pretty well and was happy with the result, however, along comes update 1.0.5, plenty of mods come up with updates too, and all my edits are washed away. That all happened before as well, back when update 1.0 came out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping mods up to date and working well is enough of a consideration, so I\u0027d love if I could set my own independent definition of where parts should go on the tech tree, costs of items, and other basic parameters sometimes. I\u0027m not concerned with redefining nodes on the tech tree, I did fine with the stock layout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my own personal editing of kerbal files I\u0027ve gotten the impression that something like this is possible with @part calls or something. Maybe a utility of the ModuleManager plugin if I remember, which I\u0027ve had around for other mods. So I\u0027m wondering, what sort of syntax could / should I use to achieve this blanket balancing in a separate \u0022mod\u0022, that will survive just fine through all these updates that come along? Is it as simple as making a new folder with a .cfg file in it? Could I throw all the @part calls I want into one file, or a separate one each time? I\u0027ve seen no load order definition, is there a trick to superseding other files? Pitfalls with this idea, or just not going to work? Maybe it\u0027s already written somewhere and I didn\u0027t find it when I looked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T13:10:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can do that with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModuleManager\u003C/a\u003E.
