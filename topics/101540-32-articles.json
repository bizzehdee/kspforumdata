What you are looking for is called chain-scaling (toggled with leftCtrl\u002BK). Had to look this up in the code because it is a feature I never used. This propagates a scale change to child parts (recursively so scaling the root part will try to scale the whole vessel)."},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T22:26:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 9.8.2016 at 7:15 PM, SpannerMonkey(smce) said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Somewhere lost in the mists of time and forum I\u0027m sure i saw a  scale exponent that only allowed scaling in two axis.  I\u0027d like to scale x and Y while leaving z untouched, If my memory isn\u0027t just making stuff up, can you point me in the right direction? If I am suffering mod hallucinations, is the scaling of only two axis possible? I\u0027m hoping it is as I\u0027d rather not go down the procedural route if i can help it.

I think the model transform of a part allows non-isotropic scaling. However, including it in TweakScale would introduce a lot of complications (starting with UI and ending with an unknown amount of connections to other mods). Also there are very few models that look reasonable when distorted that way.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, NightshineRecorralis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hi!
