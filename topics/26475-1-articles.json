The fourth wheel was the backup wheel, one of the three others failed last year. Once the backup fails the telescope will probably not be able to continue its mission searching for exoplanets. it relies on its reaction wheels (SAS?) to keep itself pointed at the same stars continuously. NASA is evaluating alternative missions the telescope could achieve with the functionality it has left once this failure has occurred. the Kepler project has discovered more exoplanets than any other project to date. I think it is the TESS telescope that will take up the torch in the near future. it will be an all sky survey, whereas Kepler observed a small patch of sky.

All of the others are launched as-is; if something turns out to be broken once they\u0027re up there, there\u0027s not a whole lot we can do about it. (The fact that Hubble is the only telescope we\u0027ve launched that DID end up having a critical design flaw at the start? Kinda lucky.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the reason for this is that it was expensive to send shuttle missions to fix these things. Hubble\u0027s orbit was high enough that a mission to fix it required a dedicated launch; the Shuttle wouldn\u0027t be doing much else on that flight, and that meant an awful lot of money had to be spent on each servicing mission. As in, enough money that we had to convince Congress to pony up each time, and you can guess how easy THAT was. Part of the problem is also the design itself; all of the optics need to be precisely aligned, and a guy wearing a bulky spacesuit isn\u0027t exactly in the best situation for being precise. (This is why they\u0027d talked about sending up a dedicated robot designed solely to do the installation when they needed to put in new parts.) It\u0027s just much easier to build something that isn\u0027t intended to be modular, and that fits together perfectly before it goes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the biggest reason? Low orbit is just a lousy place to put a telescope. It\u0027s crowded and dirty. The tiny amount of atmosphere at those altitudes doesn\u0027t do much to a spacecraft (unless it\u0027s up there for several years), but for a telescope it\u0027s an added source of distortion, so even the telescopes in Earth orbit are put in higher orbits than the Shuttle was designed for. An object in LEO goes into the sunlight every forty minutes or so, which is really awkward for a spacecraft whose turn rates are measured in minutes per degree and who can\u0027t look at the sun, the illuminated atmosphere, etc. without burning through coolant at an untenable rate. (This is why losing those gyros is crippling.) And that big blue planet just gets in the way too often when you\u0027re trying to look at things. So, nearly all of our space telescopes are either out at the L2 point (Herschel, Planck, Webb once it\u0027s launched) or in a trailing orbit (Spitzer, Kepler), neither of which would be possible to reach with a spacecraft to maintain anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line, space telescopes are almost always one-shot affairs. They go up, and 3-6 years later they run out of coolant, which is needed to keep the electronics cold; since thermal noise is proportional to temperature, the noise goes up by a factor of ~4 once the coolant runs out. When that happens, they\u0027re pretty much dead; Spitzer\u0027s managed to find a use for two of its seven IR bands (the ones closest to the visible spectrum) doing exoplanet searches, but Herschel (which just ran out of coolant last week) is useless now because it operated further in the infrared. At that point, NASA funds some archive programs, and people look for new jobs. (I worked on Spitzer and Herschel.

The problem is that it\u0027s in a slightly slower orbit than Earth, so right now it\u0027s over 1 AU away and getting further every year. If you wanted to send something to refuel it, you\u0027d have to put a LOT of energy into launching, setting up the right intercept, and then matching speed at the other end. You\u0027re trying to offset ten years of orbital drift in a reasonable timeframe, and that requires a lot more work; frankly, it\u0027d be easier and cheaper to go to Mars instead. Of course, if we\u0027re willing to wait fifty years it\u0027ll come back around again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not quite as bad for the L2 telescopes, but it\u0027s still not a trivial amount of effort needed to get there. The question becomes, why bother sending a ship designed to get there AND find its target AND dock AND refill, when you could just send a new telescope instead? You wouldn\u0027t have to worry about a perfect intercept then, since the L2 point is only metastable (it\u0027s stable in two axes but not the other, so things there need to expend fuel to stay there). Let the old, outdated telescope fall out of the area, and put the new one in roughly the same spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHubble was a different story. It was in Earth orbit, which is relatively easy to reach. But the telescope itself was far more complicated, and that meant that it wasn\u0027t as simple as topping off the fluids and rotating the tires. When they\u0027d service Hubble, they\u0027d do four things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; Refill the tanks. Coolant was the big one, but there were a few others. These are the easy things to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Replace the broken gyros (steering flywheels). Hubble came with six, and these were the easy way to maneuver; not fast, but no fuel needed. Over time, they\u0027d stop working, which\u0027d limit the telescope\u0027s ability to maneuver. The telescope could operate with three, and could even work with only two if they were the RIGHT two and you didn\u0027t mind taking much longer to get to your targets. These were the main reason for the timing of the servicing missions; if we waited until too many failed, all sorts of other things would go wrong. (Generally a mission would happen when it was down to 4, but before the last one it was at 3 and was in real danger.) Fairly easy to do, but not something that could be done just by hooking a hose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Upgrade outdated equipment. Hubble had four slots for instruments, although for the first couple years one of those four was used for the corrective optics to deal with the mistake they\u0027d made in the mirror. (Later instruments had the corrective gear built-in, so eventually that fourth slot was used for a new instrument once all of the original instruments were replaced.) Each slot was upgraded at least once over Hubble\u0027s lifespan, with a couple going through two upgrades (like WFPC -\u0026gt; WFPC2 -\u0026gt; WFC3, and no, that\u0027s not a typo). This is the one that required a lot of precision work, since the new instruments needed to be placed exactly; at least twice, something was installed incorrectly during a servicing mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Strap on a new booster to get it up to a better orbit, to offset the slow decay of its orbit due to atmospheric drag. Easy to do, but I wouldn\u0027t trust a robot to do it remotely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you put a telescope far from Earth, it\u0027s not easy to maintain. Even if you could reach it, you wouldn\u0027t be able to do the sorts of things necessary to really extend its lifespan long enough to be worth the effort, unless it\u0027s so low that the shuttles could reach it. Generally, it\u0027s just cheaper to let the old telescope die, and build a new one. Hubble, for instance, cost $2.5B to put up in the first place, in 1991 dollars. The most recent servicing missions cost almost a billion dollars apiece. There were five servicing missions, so even adjusted for inflation the total cost of maintaining it was more than it would have taken to just replace it, and the replacement would have been much better in other ways (like not having a faulty heat sink or flawed mirror). Technology advances so rapidly that the telescopes we design these days are FAR superior to the ones of even ten years ago. As I said, after 3-6 years you just throw these away and make a new one; the biggest complaint about the JWST hasn\u0027t been its cost in itself, it\u0027s that NASA\u0027s had to put on hold all of the OTHER telescopes they\u0027d wanted to launch (like WFIRST) to keep Congress from cutting their budget to an untenable level, and us science types can get far more use out of a bunch of small telescopes than fighting over the time on the one big one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T10:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m holding out hope that the scientific parts in KSP will be important to the game in some ways.
