(took me a few crashes on the moon to realize only VTOL\u0027s are fit for landing on the moon. (if you can land a slightly tweaked A4 with no VTOL additions on the moon kudos for you) (and i\u0027m using fuel cheat, obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I went to launch this A4 the astronaut was none other then [drum roll] Jebediah! The [old] jebediah was still landed safely on the moon. I thought it was pretty weird but would be funny if I could get these two side by side. You can even EVA them beside each other (note: I\u0027m probably not the first one to find this \u0027bug\u0027, if it is a bug and I realize this)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought that\u0027s weird, probably never going to happen again. So just to see who I get next, I launched another spaceplane (can you guess who I got?), well I got Bill, and next i\u0027ll probably get bob. The only question left is: Who will I get next?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a few pics.

I just crashed. (once was due to time warp smashed right into the moon at 200\u002Bm/s :[ )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI replaced the Jet engines with rocket engines, and yes i\u0027m using fuel cheat, this is meant to be a fun vehicle to cruse around in. Took my awhile to balance the VTOL it takes some time getting used to on the moon. It feels really weird floating over the surface. (it docks onto the lander to stay fueled with electricity so the ship doesn\u0027t run out and become useless) fun fact: I broke like 4 solar panels off of the thing with Jeb[1] while in EVA (Rage Quit) (not really)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Y7H1Qps.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Y7H1Qps.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it for my ramblings.
