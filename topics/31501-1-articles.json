I have been in KSP since last Friday and am loving it. Reminds me of my early days having discovered Minecraft before it became what it became. I am hopelessly addicted to this game and have only played it 3 or 4 times O_o\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - I have been working on just really basic stuff so far - establishing equatorial orbits on Kerbin - messing around with different modules. Last night I reached the Mun almost entirely with RCS thrusters. I still have 65% fuel in the RCS fuel tank. I\u0027m surprised how well those actually work for this purpose - even though I know that is not their intended use. I fully expect to be able to get back to Kerbin with the RCS thrusters now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got my self into a fairly circular, equatorial orbit. Also deployed solar panels for first time.
