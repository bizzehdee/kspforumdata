I prepared a probe with a few science-y bits and set it off. Everything went to plan really. I did make it to space just fine, but I miscalculated on two things. Firstly, I was not correct on my estimation on the timing for the Duna trip window. I was behind schedule. I burned a lot of fuel trying to recover from that. Secondly, I severely overestimated the size of Duna\u0027s gravity well (I think I got within 1000k or so, but I don\u0027t remember exactly). I expected it to be comparable to Kerbal\u0027s. I did not do my research. As such my probe ran out of fuel, is now on a severely skewed Kerbin orbit that takes it within Moho\u0027s orbit and just outside Duna\u0027s orbit.
