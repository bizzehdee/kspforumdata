Not only do you have to match the inclination itself, but also the longitude of the ascending node. (LAN) (NOTE: technically, it\u0027s the \u0022right ascension of the ascending node\u0022 because this needs to be measured against the background stars, but I prefer to say LAN instead of RAAN). If you omit this latter part, getting into the same inclination could actually put you in for a bigger plane change later than if you\u0027d launched into an equatorial orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you don\u0027t grok LAN, it works like this. It\u0027s easier to visualize thinking about a long, skinny elliptical orbit but it works the same for circular orbits. Anyway, when viewed from above, this long, skinny orbit is pointing in some direction like the hand of a clock. Because it\u0027s inclined, it crosses the central body\u0027s equatorial plane at the ascending and descending nodes. The central body\u0027s equator is marked off in longitude, so the Longitude of the Ascending Node tells you where around the equator the ascending node is, which in turn tells you which direction the long, skinny orbit is pointing. If you don\u0027t know this direction, the orbit could be pointing in any direction, all its possible locations forming a funnel-shaped surface with the central body at the bottom. Every orbit that could be on this funnel has the same inclination but only those with the same LAN are in the same plane with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you want to really match planes with the target planet when you launch from the ground on Kerbin, you have to wait until Kerbin itself is at one of the 2 points along its orbit that are aligned with the line between the target\u0027s ascending and descending nodes. One these 2 days of the year, you can take off from KSC heading NE (if the target\u0027s ascending node is closer to Kerbin) or SE (if the target\u0027s descending node is closer to Kerbin) and end up in an orbit around Kerbin that\u0027s in the same plane as the target planet. Then you wait in this orbit until the \u0022launch window\u0022 (actually, the transfer window) to the target comes along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that physically launching from the ground into a plane-matched parking orbit and the \u0022launch window\u0022 for transfer from that orbit to the target are entirely separate things, based on entirely different parameters. The first is based on Kerbin\u0027s position relative to the target\u0027s orbit as a whole. The 2nd is based on the relative positions of Kerbin and the target in their paths around Kerbol. These 2 circumstances rarely, if ever, happen on the same day. So the drill is, launch into the parking orbit first on the day Kerbin aligns with the target\u0027s nodes, then leave when the next transfer window comes along, whenever that is. If you don\u0027t follow this 2-step procedure, then you\u0027ll have to do some sort of plane-change burn en route or during the transfer burn, which sort of defeats the whole purpose of launching into a specific inclination to begin with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut also note that the rotational axes all planets in KSP point straight N-S, even those in inclined orbits. So, suppose you follow the above procedure and make your trip to the target all within its plane, so you don\u0027t need any plane-changing burns along the way. When you get to the target, you\u0027ll be in an inclined orbit relative to the target\u0027s equator. So, if you\u0027re interested in achieving an equatorial or polar orbit at the target, you\u0027ll have to do a plane-change anyway upon arrival. But this is only 1 plane change, compared to 2 if you launched equatorial at Kerbin and made a plane change somewhere en route, and it\u0027s usually less expensive than an en route change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T16:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is already a lot of good advice here so I won\u0027t repeat it. But I do want to suggest that if you are learning how to reach an inclined planet that you practice on Dres rather then Moho. If Eve is the most advanced planet to return to orbit from its surface, Moho is the most advanced to enter orbit from Kerbin. Dres will let you learn about inclined transfers without subjecting you to massive delta-v costs if you don\u0027t pull off a perfect approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alexmun","CreatedById":68608,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T18:00:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to match inclinations upon ejection is to leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence at one of the nodes (either ascending or descending). Your ejection trajectory will actually need to have a greater inclination than your target orbit\u0027s inclination because when you leave Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence your net solar orbital velocity is the sum of Kerbin\u0027s orbital velocity (which has no inclination) and your velocity relative to Kerbin. But the fact that you have to leave the sphere of influence at the node makes matching the inclination directly from Kerbin orbit usually infeasible because it is rare for a transfer window to line up with a node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is you don\u0027t actually have to match inclinations at all in order to transfer. All you need to do is get a node (either ascending or descending) of your transfer orbit to intersect your target\u0027s orbit at the right time. This method can save a ton of delta-v relative to trying to exactly match the target\u0027s inclination, but it can be more difficult to find an intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T18:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E to give me the launch windows, then I use a good ol\u0027 protractor to draw the angle on a sheet of lined paper (thin).
