For example, the worst possible way to get into a polar orbit around the Mun (or anywhere else) is to get into an equatorial orbit first, and then wrestle it around by 90 degrees.\n\nThe most efficient way to set your orbital inclination around a body is to do it as far away as possible from that body.\n\nFor example, if you\u0027re in equatorial LKO and want to go to a polar orbit around the Mun, the best way to do that is to do a slight inclination change long before you even enter the Mun\u0027s SoI. Then it takes very little dV.\n\nEven better is to launch directly into a slightly inclined orbit when taking off from Kerbin, much better than launching equatorial and then changing inclination later."},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:03:42Z","Content":"\u003E Even better is to launch directly into a slightly inclined orbit when taking off from Kerbin, much better than launching equatorial and then changing inclination later.\n\nHow would I get an encounter with the mun if my orbital plane doesn\u0027t match it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:27:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How would I get an encounter with the mun if my orbital plane doesn\u0027t match it?\n\nBy picking the right time to launch, so that the Mun is located at your orbit\u0027s ascending or descending node when you get there.\n\nFor example, let\u0027s say you decide to forego circularizing to LKO first, and are launching directly to munar intercept. If you were doing that equatorial all the way, how would you do it? You\u0027d sit on the pad and wait until about the time that the Mun rises over the horizon (give or take a few degrees), then launch eastwards to intercept, right?\n\nSo, suppose you do that same thing, and burn about the same amount, but instead of heading due east when you make your gravity turn, you head northeast (or even due north). You\u0027re launching from the same place, at the same time, with the same periapsis and apoapsis, just with a different inclination. Which means that you\u0027ll reach apoapsis at the same time and place as you would have in the equatorial case, which in turn means you will get a Mun intercept-- just from a different angle."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T04:29:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even better is to launch directly into a slightly inclined orbit when taking off from Kerbin, much better than launching equatorial and then changing inclination later.\n\nIn the general case this would be tricky to pull off timing wise, and you could easily lose more sidereal rotation boost than the small maneuver at mid-plane would take.\n\nEDIT: Ninja\u0027d, but still relevant. Generally this is complicated enough to easily mess it up enough to hurt your fuel situation more than you help it. It the kind of thing I might try if I tried the normal way and ran out of fuel. However, if you know you are going to run out of fuel at launch time, you also have easier options to fix low fuel ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-07T04:41:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/07/2015 04:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cybersol**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arkalius","CreatedById":40968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T05:21:08Z","Content":"2 \\* v \\* sin(i/2)\n\nv is your orbital velocity while making the change, and i is the inclination change amount.\n\nA 60 degree change will require a delta-v that is equal to your orbital velocity at the time you do it. It kind of makes sense. You\u0027re trying to change your velocity vector angle by 60 degrees and maintain the same velocity. Thus, the delta-v vector will form an equilateral triangle with the other two.\n\nThe slower you are moving, the less delta-v you need to change inclination.\n\nI\u0027ve done some math on this. If your need to change your inclination by notably more than 45 degrees, and are in a low-eccentricity orbit, it can actually be cheaper to raise your apoapsis of your orbit, then at apoapsis, do your plane change, then lower your apoapsis again than it would be to simply do the plane change on your existing orbit. Of course, this will take a lot longer, but if you have the time you can save up to 40% of your delta-v depending on how much of a plane change you\u0027re doing and how high up you push the apoapsis."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T06:02:07Z","Content":"For \u003E90\\* you can save even more by aerobraking some of the retrograde component, which is particularly useful in the case where you do a full 180 around a body with an atmosphere."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T06:50:52Z","Content":"Actually, for the Mun, going equatorial and changing inclination at the highest point during the injection may be a bit cheaper. \n\nAlso note that any inclination you have at Kerbin orbit is generally going to be accentuated at Munar SOI, so you\u0027ll have to take this into account too."}]}
