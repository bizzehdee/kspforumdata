You can sell comsats to KTV for their pleasure. The way this would work, they would either buy or rent. You can change deals somewhat like Civilization 5, so you can propose 100 currency instead of the 50 they offered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this, you can also sell satalites to Kerbal Scientists.

You get random offers from goverment or civilian companies\\individuals to put satelites with specific parts to specific orbits within the given time, for money. The same way space tourism might be implemented where you need to put the special kerbal to suborbital flight, orbital flight or Mun, and get him safely back. The same way big govermental projects may be implemented they would use the same mechnic but offer a more difficult tasks with bigger bonuses and wider timeframe to achive. This side mission might be a good way to boost up the economy in the first stages of the game and get player more used with game mechanic also they may encurage the player to do things that some players skip in the game such as planes\\space planes develpment, rovers e.t.c.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T17:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a nice and relatively simple way to get money early in the game. Perhaps also add missions for hire to repair/upgrade/decommission the satellites from time to time.
