It makes use of a mixture of heavy and light armor, as well as magnetic locking of the supercooled wings to hold the them in place. It has lost over 30% of its parts in battle yet survived fight another day. However, when it does get shot down, in my testing it was because a bullet phased through its armor to explode the fuel tank or command pod within, which bisects the craft.  \n\nIt is powered by two Wheesley Turbofan engines, one in the back and the other in the front with its thrust reversed.\n\nThe second plane is a simple yet surprisingly effective design. Coming in at only 18 parts, if damaged it becomes worthless as a fighter, but with the wide vectoring range of the Pather afterburning turbojet engine, it can usually survive the loss of one wing and avoid crash landing.

I went through something like over a dozen different aircraft designs before I decided on this one.  Both my aircraft are the same model but one has two 20mm cannons and the other only has one. I took inspiration from the SU-37 and MiG-29 when making this, and I think it turned out pretty well. Please tell me if I need to change anything.
