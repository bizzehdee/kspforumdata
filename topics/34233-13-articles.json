A long-range utility vessel has been commissioned, built to be semi-modular and carry multiple load configurations as well as be able to replace its engines should Hanland stoop so low as to space piracy of unarmed vessels (highly likely). This vessel will be under tension, rather than compression like most vessels, and as such the engine module will be brought into orbit in a separate launch, to prevent wibbly-wobbliness during ascent. In the event that this flimsy steel pole with nukes on the front is shot off by aforementioned space pirates (yarr, you bet your hind end it\u0027ll happen, matey), mobility will be restored via a launch from KSC.
