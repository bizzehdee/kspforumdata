If you have a space tug that merely moves stuff from the Moon to LEO, without having to launch out of that deep gravity well, then you\u0027re going to have a significantly easier time. Also keep in mind that the numbers given were for a single stage - if you allow for multiple stages, then you drastically reduce the effort it takes to get a high dV. And multiple stages don\u0027t mean no reusability. For example, having a dedicated lifter for Moon surface to Moon orbit and then a dedicated space tug for Moon orbit to Earth orbit is a two-stage system, and both stages are independent and fully reusable (assuming there\u0027s a fuel depot in at least one of the orbits for the tug to refuel at).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EClarke\u0027s idea was for a \u003Cem\u003Elunar\u003C/em\u003E SSTO.

Just two superdracos firing would be over a G of impluse, and likely can\u0027t fired less then 4 at a time in order to be have thrust centered correctly, so that is over 2 Gs of impluse.
