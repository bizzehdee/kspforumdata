I mean SMALL, this thing had to fit inside a 1.25 meter fairing. It\u0027s freakishly tall, but it works. I\u0027ve crammed a materials bay, 2 goo canisters, and 6 thermometers on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first four biomes went great: I\u0027d drop off the lander, perform a materials study, get 2 goo looks, an EVA report, crew report, take a couple temperature readings, grab a surface sample, and plant a flag to mark the biome. Wait for my MPL/mothership to complete it\u0027s orbit, launch and rendezvous, dock, and refuel for the next go. Upon docking, I would use the lab to improve the transmission value of the goo and materials lab, then transmit those along with the crew/eva reports and thermometer readings. I\u0027d then go on EVA, and take the surface sample over to my hitchhiker storage unit, which would ultimately be the return vehicle for my 3 crew (1 lander pilot (Jeb, of course), and the 2 scientists in the lab (Bill and Bob)). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, a thought, both monstrous and wonderful dawned upon me: what if I could remove the materials and goo samples from their equipment, and store them in the hitchiker for the return trip as well? I tried it, and, sure enough, it works! This can also be done with the thermometer readings, though on my vessel they\u0027re a bit tricky to reach on EVA (this will surely inform my lander designs in the future..). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at once delighted, as instead of losing over 65% of the data value on material lab transmissions, I can return 100% of the data to Kerbin, but also a touch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E, as I technically \u0027wasted\u0027 several hours conducting landings, only to burn away most of that precious potential science by transmitting the data, thinking I had no way to return the sample home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that brings me here, to post my findings, with the hopes that another brave explorer may avoid making this same mistake!

I did *8* Mun biomes, getting a single goo, jr, temp, seismic, gravioli, surface sample, and crew report from the surface, and a gravioli and eva report from above the biome, and brought them all back up to orbit where I cleaned out the containers and stored all the science for full (well, mostly full) return. I got over 6000 science from that run. I only stopped because 6000 was all I needed to complete the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Callmedave\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Callmedave\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a limit to how may experiments i can store in my lander capsule?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.

You\u0027ll likely flip it within 2 minutes unless you designed it really well). By take longer, I talking hours. Landing in the right spot could have 4 or so biomes within easy driving distance, but you really need to plan your landing for that. And once you\u0027re done, don\u0027t forget to transfer any remaining data to the pod for return. Also note, returning data is always better than transmitting it, That\u0027s why I said visit everywhere twice - transmit the boosted first set, then return the second.
