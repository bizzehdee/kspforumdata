Is it me or some parts from the KSPX part pack have been added as official parts to the .20 update? Like the one man landing can looks EXACTLY like the KSPX one, so does the space station pod (panopticon?), the \u0022Atlas\u0022 Engine has been added, with the same description (power of large cities...) So yeah is it just me?? Also the two new probe cores are pretty much the same as the RC guidance units from the part pack, but with a different texture.

I probably use it in 80% of my 2.5m rocket designs as the top stage engine as thrust is usually much less of a concern for the final stage, but the lower weight is a big help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T16:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30472-KSPX-Kerbal-Stock-Part-eXpansion-mod-reposted\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30472-KSPX-Kerbal-Stock-Part-eXpansion-mod-reposted\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"birrhan","CreatedById":62148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T16:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30472-KSPX-Kerbal-Stock-Part-eXpansion-mod-reposted\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30472-KSPX-Kerbal-Stock-Part-eXpansion-mod-reposted\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPraise the Kraken!!
