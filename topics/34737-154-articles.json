The scalable parts feature is really nice. Thanks for your hard work!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat rotating hub looks really cool. I\u0027ve made rotating mid sections of stations before using a powered rotatron and a free moving washer and they\u0027ve worked but there has always been an odd result/limitation (and this is going back to Dammed Robotics days). If you put command pods on the rotating section, the IVA view does not move with the rotating section. The view stays still, but you can see parts from the rotating section clipping through the view. If you use a static camera on the rotating section then it\u0027s view moves as the section rotates, but IVA view seems to be relative to the ship, not the movement of its\u0027 part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything that you can do to fix this? Or is it a limitation of the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having a bug with docking and robotics parts and its produced two interesting results (sorry if you already know this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working on a unmanned construction rover, so it\u0027s a fairly standard docking-port-on-hinged-arm-on-wheels type craft. The only thing is I was building it as a subassembly so its\u0027 probe core is not the root part of the craft file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover could pick up small things and things that didn\u0027t have a command pod, but when picking up something over a certain weight or any weight but with a command pod then the arm (all robotics parts) would stop working. They stop moving, or move extremely slowly with very limited range. When the docking goes well the camera just pans to the side to account for the change in mass, when it goes badly and the arms break, the camera re positions to be zoomed out just like if you\u0027d quickloaded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I increased the mass of the rover, then it could pick up heavier objects without the arm locking up. It\u0027s almost a \u0022that not a bug, that\u0027s a feature\u0022, the rover has to have a mass \u0026gt;= to what it\u0027s trying to pick up otherwise it\u0027s hydraulics get shot, which is kinda realistic, just would be nice to have a way to fix it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still anything that had a command pod could not be picked up. As I was building it as a submassembly, the root part was not part of the rover, the rover has its own probe core and it decouples from the root part. With that setup, if it was picking up something that contained a command pod then the arms would break. BUT if I changed it so the root part was part of the rover, then it doesn\u0027t matter if the thing it is trying to pick up has a command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically your \u0027rover with a docking port on hydraulic arms\u0027 has to a) have a mass \u0026gt;= what it\u0027s trying to pick up and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E contain the root part if it is going to pick up a command pod (if its just picking up debris and things with probe cores, then it doesn\u0027t matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a different subject, do you ever plan to add rotation limits to the free moving washers?

The hinges and rotratrons seem to have stornger joints, so the attached part is much stiffer. Is it possible to make it even stonger, so that the connection is 100% fixed. In the gif you can see the hinges are not entirely stable, they wobble alot after the movement stops (hyperextending knees) and the joints are not fully stable.
