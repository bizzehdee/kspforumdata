Getting sufficient RocketParts to your building would be a bigger issue. Currently, the build rate is 5 kerbal-hours per ton of dry-mass. A 10kt (dry-mass: crazy big) ship would take 50kKh to build, however, getting 40-60Kh/h out of a single workshop is not difficult (especially with level-2\u002B engineers) (theoretical maximum without KerbalStats* is 105.9, but good luck finding 10 badass kerbals with 1 courage and 0 stupidity)). That\u0027s down to around 1000h (167d (6h)) to build. Four such workshops (40 kerbals) would get you down to 42d: two Kerbin-Minmus round trips. Your main issue will be supplying those kerbals with 10kt of RocketParts. Your next issue will be how PhysX and KSP cope with a single 10kt part (the dock or survey station), especially with it suddenly drops to \u0026lt; 5t when you finalize the build: this is unknown to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*~154 with KerbalStats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, it was with utter relief that I removed the insta-build code: it was poorly maintained because I never used it and thus never tested it. The only reason it lasted as long as it did was you absolutely had to sit there with the builder while time-warping. With the advent of background builds, I was able to toss it out without a qualm. Yes, doing so has thrown a spanner into the works of some people\u0027s play styles (particularly those who prefer unmanned missions, though I have some plans to fix that), but I consider that to be a fairly small price.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile EL for the user is about building stuff that can\u0027t be launched, or just building away from KSC, EL is really about the logistics involved in such building. How do I supply the resources needed to build (and fuel) my craft? How do I build my craft in a reasonable time? (If using an LS mod) How do I keep my kerbals alive?
