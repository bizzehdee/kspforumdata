Its now Narcissa! That caught me by surprise yesterday! I got nothing agaisnt that, it\u0027s his (her) descision, but I really didn\u0027t see it coming... I haven\u0027t tuned in into her channel (or any other channel for that matter) in a while, I don\u0027t know if she talked about it before... But I didn\u0027t expect that! I mean as a he, she was always extravagant, with the haircut and nail polish and everything. But I thought she was just extravagant. I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d go for such a change!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, I\u0027m happy for her, as long as she is now happy with who she is, it\u0027s fine by me! I\u0027ll just miss the name... Cosmo was a legend. I hope Narcissa will keep being a Legend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I was bummed out when I noticed she took all of her records from her twitch profile, I hope she\u0027s just in the process of revamping the page, I don\u0027t care the name by which she\u0027s now known, those records are still hers, I don\u0027t want them to just... dissapear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApparently the fanbase is now super LGBT oriented... Thats a bit sad to me, I feel like its going to take the Cosmo feel out of her channel... I would have liked everything to just stay how it was as far as streaming and speedrunning and overall feel of the channel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully now with her new name, she\u0027ll want to pursue another OoT Any% record! haha \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. I could watch her work on that for hours and hours and hours, I was watching live when she got a few of her records! Cosmo was by FAR the most impressive player I have ever seen! I hope Narcissa keeps being so ridiculously MLG!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest of luck to you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T23:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWithout getting too into topics that violate Forum Rules, I must say it\u0027s a little weird that you think the channel\u0027s going to change in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was another person running the channel, your response would be justified. But it\u0027s really not. Narcissa\u0027s just the same person with a different identity. I don\u0027t think the channel will lose any of its former \u0027feel,\u0027 and I don\u0027t think that she\u0027ll stop pursuing streaming records.
