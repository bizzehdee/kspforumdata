I have, on a few occasions, simply left the game running at 1x speed as a craft left Kerbin, and read a book or watched TV, glancing over occasionally to see how much smaller Kerbin looked. Then, on Minmus, my favoured means of getting from one site to another thus far has involved rovers that are actually rockets with a fair supply of monopropellant, and aircraft undercarriage for wheels. Set them going at up to 15m/s, and they can be left to their own devices until they get close to hills or cliffs or the site you want to visit. \n\nThe Joolian system and Duna are getting an increasing amount of my time lately though."},{"CreatedByName":"TheKutKu","CreatedById":117026,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T10:21:41Z","Content":"~400 h, yet, i have never done a manned Jool mission ( and i have never visitedmoho)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T10:50:42Z","Content":"299 on Steam, but I only moved there around .23.5.
