Control surface deflection being used in place of airbrakes is allowed.\n\n\u003EEngines pushing up for lift, or down for traction are not allowed. This challenge about lift-to-weight, not thrust-to-weight.\n\n\u003EMods are allowed, but any parts that defy gravity, or are lighter than air, are not. You may use these *only* if the vehicle that actually lands doesn\u0027t have means of taking off, and they must be decoupled when the craft goes to land.\n\n\u003EGuns follow the same rules as engines.\n\nScoring:\n\n\u003EM\\*(P-L)=T\n\n\u003EM = Takeoff mass. This is the mass of the craft at launch. Heavier crafts net more points\n\n\u003EP = Part count at launch. This includes the part count of any craft that helps get the landing vehicle into the air.\n\n\u003EL = Parts lost. This includes the part count of any craft that helps get the landing vehicle into the air.\n\n\u003ET = Total score. Double this if the craft landed without engines attached.\n\nLeaderboard:\n\n1. 12617 - Serassa (Counting tonnage, not kg)\n\n2. 2214 - Blue Canary\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T20:15:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BoomShroom**\n  \nClarity involving propulsion rules, leaderboard"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:45:58Z","Content":"Nice landing!\n\nLooks like fun, I\u0027ll give it a try. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:03:07Z","Content":"(this is my first forum post, so sorry about the inevitable screw ups)\n\nSo, I tried this with a heavily modified version of my UC-1 light stol cargo plane:\n\n![sERijal.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sERijal.jpg)\n\nRATO takeoff, this version of the plane has detachable main engines for double points, and extra internal fuel and drop tanks for more weight for points.\n\n![5Kt8ZHq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5Kt8ZHq.jpg)\n\nMessed up the approach several times and had to go around, not sure if this was the good one or not\n\n![N6KDZIz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N6KDZIz.jpg)\n\nCame in high and fast but stopped just before the edge, didn\u0027t explode, even a little bit ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSo, 2\\*13.5\\*(86-4)=2214 points by my (probably dodgy) maths.
