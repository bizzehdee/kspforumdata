If not I think it would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m playing with Remote Tech and I\u0027m trying to figure out how to land a probe. Getting a lot of hard landings. Even with a parachute it would be nice to have a retro rocket that would fire at a pre set altitude. Some thing like a sepratron where you could pre set the altitude and amount of fuel to soften the landing. A couple of different sizes would be nice. And while we are on the subject crush material with a high impact absorption and low bounce. Send a command to arm it and let the guidance computer orient it opposite to the trajectory and let the rockets fire by altitude to hopefully let you survive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a better way to do this or if I\u0027m missing some thing here please enlighten me. It just seems like this sort of system is used a lot in the real world and I can\u0027t seem to find any thing like it in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T13:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod that does this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61294-0-25-XT-Landertron-Smart-Retrorockets-for-Landers-and-Spaceplanes-v0-08-Oct-10\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61294-0-25-XT-Landertron-Smart-Retrorockets-for-Landers-and-Spaceplanes-v0-08-Oct-10\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T13:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
