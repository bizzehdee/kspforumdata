How can I make a rover for Kerbin? Whenever I try to the wheels clip into the ground and the vehicle doesn\u0027t move.

Although I would say a very common starter problem is that often people use the ruggedized wheels, and those wheels are not (by default) oriented correctly in the SPH. If you look at the axle of the wheel, there is a wider side and a narrower side. The narrower side needs to point at the ground or the wheel will not work properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can take pictures by pressing F1.
