It heavily relies on this.\n\n1. .craft file is loaded and parsed to find the locations and rotations of every part in the craft.\n2. The importer is called for every unique part (a crucial speedup over importing for every part).\n3. Parts are cleaned up by hiding collision meshes and things like that, then given a bounding sphere for manipulation.\n4. Parts are grouped into stages and can then be selected by stage.\n5. Materials are reworked to function in the Cycles renderer, Blender\u0027s physically-based render that (in my opinion) gives much better results.\n6. Animation data is time-shifted so that parts can be deployed and undeployed as desired.\n\nAdditionally I have added a custom menu pulled up by pressing K in object mode. I\u0027m open to any suggestions for more features for this menu.\n\n1. \u0022Select Ship\u0022 (based on the current selection, for moving everything around)\n2. \u0022Select Stage\u0022 (if you wanted to break down the ship)\n3. \u0022Select All of This Part\u0022 (like if you want to delete all the struts)\n4. \u0022Toggle Deploy\u0022 (to go between the deployed and undeployed positions... getting reworked soon)\n5. \u0022Make One Mesh\u0022 (useful for quickly applying one material to the whole ship)\n6. \u0022Make 3D Printable\u0022 (almost works... makes the ship a unified, manifold mesh)\n7. \u0022Toggle Editable\u0022 (to make the actual ship unselectable, only the spheres (more like how it is in game))\n8. \u0022Delete Part\u0022 (use this to delete stuff... selecting a bounding sphere and pressing delete won\u0027t get it all)\n\nI\u0027m still working on several parts of the project to bring extra functions.\n\n1. Working on a kerbal, who you can see on the Trello page.\n2. I\u0027ve also spent some time making an alternative model set that would give you a geodesic, \u0022low-poly\u0022 look if you want that instead.\n3. I put some effort into making the model 3D-printable, but it\u0027s not as easy as it might seem.\n4. I will be reworking the animation toggle with Blender \u0022Drivers,\u0022 a cool feature I recently learned about.\n5. I\u0027m going to add a streamlined process for creating panaround gifs and other simple renders.\n6. Like you, some of my coolest creations were assembled in orbit and not the VAB. I\u0027ve found a way to import them from space... I just need some time to sit down and write the code.\n\nWhy you should care\n\nI can\u0027t make you care if you don\u0027t want to ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif), but I\u0027m very excited about this project. It enables you to render any ship from any angle, with any lighting, with any setting. You could also render multiple ships together. Ultimately, you have nearly infinite freedom with Blender, from things like making gifs to show staging separation to making your ship look like it\u0027s made out of solid gold. Though you\u0027ll have to learn some Blender if you\u0027re going to do that stuff, which may or may not be an ulterior motive of mine ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif).\n\nWhere the project lives\n\n[https://github.com/Dasoccerguy/io_kspblender](https://github.com/Dasoccerguy/io_kspblender)\n\nI\u0027ll be posting updates both here and on reddit, something like once a week until this is as done as it can be.\n\nPlease download the demo (and follow all the setup instructions) on the Github page and let me know what you think. Follow the installation instructions in the readme and you should be good to go!\n\nUpdate 3-1\n\n1. Turned a messy collection of scripts into an easy-to-use Blender addon\n2. Continued work on the kerbal and low-poly modelset\n3. It should work on Linux and Mac now! Huge thanks to Sma for debugging.\n4. Added Kethane mod support, and working on B9 Aerospace.\n\nUpdate 4-7\n\n1. Sorry I lied about the weekly updates\n2. This now supports EVERY MOD (thanks to Cptman\u0027s work)\n3. Tons of minor fixes to make things work a little better\n4. **I need your help with the mods, though. There are going to be bugs, so please let me know what goes wrong!**\n\nThis plugin is GPLv3 licensed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T00:26:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dasoccerguy**\n  \nminor updates"},{"CreatedByName":"BenjiGH","CreatedById":30582,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T23:12:34Z","Content":"Won-der-ful if it work (I\u0027ll test it tomorrow) making animation and picture for ksp will be a hell lot easier thanks to this"},{"CreatedByName":"philotical","CreatedById":109390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T23:26:29Z","Content":"Impressive..\n\nwelcome to the forums.."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T00:14:45Z","Content":"That\u0027s some crazy stuff.

Extract, put \u0022io\\_object\\_mu\\_master\u0022 folder (the whole folder) in Program Files\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\2.72\\scripts\\addons4. Enable the addon in Blender. Press Ctrl\u002BAlt\u002BU or go to User Preferences under File. Go to the Addons tab, search \tfor \u0022mu\u0022 and enable the addon by clicking the little checkbox5. Download kspblenderdemo.blend from this repository6. Place .craft file into the same folder as the Blender file (they can be found under \u0022saves\u0022 in the KSP.exe folder)7. Follow these setup instructions: http://imgur.com/a/oTjPTChange to Coding viewChange line 23, the KSP.exe \tdirectory, to your own directory (be sure to use double backward slashes!!!)Change line 1196, the craft \tname, to be the name of that fileChange back to Default viewPress Run Script in the bottom rightWait \tpatientlyPress Render (or F12)7. Ask for help on reddit if these instructions suck8. Render, then press F3 in the render window and save the image where you want it.9. You can do tons more, but it will require learning some Blender.
