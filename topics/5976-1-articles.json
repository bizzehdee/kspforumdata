Our kerbonauts are in a high circular orbit with the spacecraft nose pointing directly at Kerbin\\\u0027s center. Suddenly they lose attitude control even though the gyro stabilizers still work. The only way to get home is to boost quickly downwards in that constant direction, and hope that their path will intersect Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFrom a near circular orbit around Kerbin, point straight down at Kerbin\\\u0027s center, set SAS to fix that direction in space, then try to get back home by boosting in that direction only. What is the highest circular orbit from which you can do that?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- all components must be 100% stock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once you\\\u0027ve set the initial downward direction, you cannot change it, e.g. to continuously point towards Kerbin, otherwise you could easily spiral inwards with enough time and fuel on your hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No waiting around. You must start boosting when pointing straight down at Kerbin, and must complete the challenge in less than 1/4 of your original orbital period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You must stay in Kerbin\\\u0027s sphere of influence at all times from orbit to periapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the initial circular orbit must have peri- and apokerb within 5% of each other. The perikerb altitude will count and be reported as your attempted orbit height. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Achieving any periapsis below 30 000m is considered \u0027mission success\u0027. \u003Cem\u003E(Edited, see reply 3)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How you get up to orbit is up to you, but thanks to enviromentalists\\\u0027 protests about orbital debris, NO jettisoning of any tanks or other solid items once you start the radial boost (i.e. any tanks you empty have to stay along for the ride), until you reach Kerbin\\\u0027s atmosphere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Acceptable proof consists of 2 pairs of screenshots - spacecraft view \u0026amp; map view (with Navball) just before boosting, and spacecraft view \u0026amp; map view (with Navball) just after achieving success or partial success. The spacecraft and map views should be within 2 minutes of each other. (We need the before and after spacecraft views to confirm that all the bits are still there). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried from 350 000 m altitude, it was easy. From 3 million m altitude I failed, but I didn\\\u0027t try very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots attached of my failed attempt (sorry, not very good ones, but showing that I couldn\\\u0027t get periapsis low enough in time).

One explanation from a physics standpoint is that higher orbits have more angular momentum, which the constrained boosting direction can barely change, so to have the same angular momentum at a low periapsis means you have to add a bunch of orbital energy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
