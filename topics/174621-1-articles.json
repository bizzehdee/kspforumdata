When I load ANY of my dozens of ground bases, they start partially inside the surface of what ever body they\u0027re on, and end up propelled upward. This is okay for my older bases, but about a half dozen are mobile bases with no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and therefore no way to right themselves before crashing. Even with the unbreakable cheats on, they still end up on their sides or even somehow falling through the body they\u0027re on. I have no choice but to restore 1.4.2 from my backup drive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried the trick where you change terrain detail levels to force the game to reposition ground vehicles, and it had no effect. I haven\u0027t reported this in the bug tracker because I simply don\u0027t know to use it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had this problem? I can provide the player log file if someone where tell me where and how to send it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMac OS 10.13.4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever the most recent upload of 1.4.3 was at about 4:30 PM today\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods are the most recent mechjeb and kerbalalarm, both are up to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
