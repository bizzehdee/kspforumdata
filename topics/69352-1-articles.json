I have experimented with Hyper Edit and i reckon changing a solar system from thew inside is more tricky just purely because of those awesome numbers that mean something i only mostly comprehend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.stefanom.org/spc/?view=2340256\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.stefanom.org/spc/?view=2340256\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers Guys oxo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T14:00:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you make Duna orbit Kerbin?

I get why they scale down the size of the planets, but it\u0027d be really cool to have everything accurate. Plus, you could even try to recreate star systems from fictional universes. How cool would that be!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
