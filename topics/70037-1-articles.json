Say i wanted to search for a mod, like the kethane mod. If i typed in \u0022the kethane mod\u0022 in the search tab and searched it, i would get a list of random threads that had almost nothing to do with kethane (for some reason, the interstellar mod is almost always on this list, i dont know why). However if i go to advanced search and click \u0022search titles only\u0022 i get lots of examples related to kethane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just thinking that maybe it would be better to have \u0022search titles only\u0022 as the default when using the search tab. is there a way any moderators do this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust my two cents \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh and P.S. im sorry if this thread is in the wrong place. i thought the forum forum would be the best place to put it, but im not sure if i should have put it in suggestions or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T20:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an issue that\u0027s been brought up in the past a few times.
