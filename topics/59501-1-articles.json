So enlighten me. I have no problems getting to the mun and I made it back (with a bit of luck and catapulting), but for me it seems impossible to plan a return correctly, because the maneuver markers aren\u0027t accessible at all until the damage is already done. My rockets, although asparagus staged, aren\u0027t that efficient nor are my landing skills in terms of conserving fuel so I am hoping, that I could try and brush up my plotting skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example I was on the southern pole of mun, no problem since course plotting works. Now I am sitting there and I want to make the orbit directly in a fashion that would keep me out of any inclination so that I could launch myself to kerbin. I failed and ended up with a strong inclination and it killed my return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo playing stock, how would the ascent look?

In order for your lander to be able to boost directly into the station\u0027s orbit, it must be at a lower latitude than the orbital inclination of the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest setup for this is to A) orbit the station above the Mun\u0027s equator (orbital inclination = 0 degrees), and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E land your landers only on the equator (latitude = 0 degrees).
