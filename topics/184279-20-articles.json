After the Take Two changeover there was a lot of concern about unscrupulous monetization of the game via low effort DLCs, I\u0027m relieved to see that real value will be delivered for the DLC money. Making History was... OK I guess, but it felt like a parts pack and the Mission Builder thing just never resonated with me. This one, however, has features I\u0027ve long desired.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKudos as well for keeping your promise to the early supporters of the game regarding free expansions; a part of me expected that to fall by the wayside under new management.

To land in a spot and just over the hill, a long lava tube that goes on and on, and deep inside, are new types of surface samples (perhaps individual features could be their own biomes) that add even more to science and perhaps even prestige. I mean seriously, I would love to see the analogue of Olympus Mons or Mariner Valles on Duna lol.

Something like Snacks integrated into the base game would be fantastic. Something simple, but can easily be expanded/replaced by something more detailed by modders for those that want a more full system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for storyline, I kind of think of contracts like that. Something more expansive would also be nice, maybe hooking into contracts to give the player a little freedom in the storyline.
