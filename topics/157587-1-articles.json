I did this for fun and nothing here is \u0022kerbal canon\u0022. I will be making references to the kerbinside mod so when you come across any locations in the story that you have not heard of before its due to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA history of kerbal universe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthousands of years before the modern kerbal a great precursor race lived (ill give you 5 guesses of what this precursor race is)on what is now known as kerbin. this race was very advanced, to the point where they used large monolith networks to communicate across the kerbal system. This species was not unlike the kerbals. For they too ventured skywards launching from a place called \u0022cape Canaveral\u0022 to the stars. There they built stations and ventured to there moon and beyond. They even went so far as to colonize there moon with a few bases. But this species was not to last. A large \u0022meteorite storm\u0027 was detected drifting towards there planet and thus they were doomed. The storm drifted towards there home world slowly picking up speed. When the storm hit it did not hit as hard as it would thanks to the gravity of there moon. That pulled many of the asteroids to itself which resulted in its surface becoming covered in craters. The home planet was not to be so lucky, the largest of the meteorites slammed into the side of the planet. Knocking a good amount of the planets land into space and creating the large crater on kerbin we see today. The population on the home world was wiped out. The moons colony\u0027s were destroyed by the many meteor strikes. The many space missions that were out in the system died out due to the nonexistence of a suitable planet too return to and the lack of food and oxygen that originated overtime. Over the thousands of years of time the system that this race knew morphed and changed. New planets formed from old. The waste knocked from the home world formed into what is now mininus. And so the local system seemed dead.....for a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot all life died out when the meteorite hit. As life returned to the planet bit by bit and soon something evolved. This species was green,short and not all that different from the race that proceeded it. But most important of all: it was intelligent. This was the kerbal species and they were to become the new dominant force of this planet. At first they lived in small groups but soon these groups combined into small \u0022settlement states\u0022 so that they could control small territory\u0027s. But soon these settlements combined with others to control more land mass. One of the greatest of these groups became known as the \u0022Kabalonian empire\u0022. Originating from the desert they became one of the most powerful groups of the era. They invented irrgation and built pyramids in the desert to live in. Like all great empires the Kabalonian empire fell in due time. As time went on New groups formed and fell but as the years marched on something new evoloved:technology. Soon what was ounce small empires became nations. New ways of building were made along with improved ways to move large distances. Factory\u0027s became the new way of mass production for items. then along came electricity, then came the automobile, then came the mastery of flight. Theres thousands of other inventions too name. Each one advancing kerbalkind. But with this advancement came conflict. The kerbals had rediscovered something that their predating species had to deal with: war. Most wars were small and short. Mainly between two country\u0027s. Thankfully most kerbals can live there lives knowing that they most likely will never be thrown into a horrible conflict. As time continued some country\u0027s became more stronger than others. One result of this strength? The united kerbal states. This adequately sized country boasts large industry, a highway system, and a relatively well off population. Of course the kerbal states have a up kept military consisting of: UKSA (united kerbal states army) UKSMC (united kerbal states marine corp) UKSN (united kerbal states navy) the UKSAF (united kerbal states air force) and finally the UKSCG (united kerbal states coast guard). Whilst country\u0027s flourished something else flourished along side it. That was astronomy. Many kerbals got together and began to use telescopes to look skyward. They discovered more planets then they could have seen in the night sky and gave them names like, Duna Bop Jool eve and many others. With these discovery\u0027s brought questions such as, \u0022What is the meaning to life?\u0022 \u0022Is minimus made of ice cream?\u0022 But one of\u00A0 the most important questions: \u0022could we visit these other planets?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany debates broke out about what was the most logical way to get to these planets. One crazy idea was to build a giant glider and use a aircraft carrier launch catapult to fling it to the mun. Of course most of the theory\u0027s never made it into exsistance. Heck most kerbals did not take space travel seriously, that was until Wernher came along. Wernher \u0022von\u0022 kerman was a engineer who was quite interested in exploring space. He soon developed a theory to use tube like craft to get kerbals into space. Wanting to put his ideas into action he went around trying to sell his theory to major company\u0027s. They all turned down his ideas, believing that he was trying to scam them by telling them that they could create a \u0022new industry\u0022 \u0022that could create jobs and income for many years\u0022. Wernher now having to turn to the military for funding his idea. Nearly all of the top brass turned his idea down. Well that was until he tried to sell his plans to the UKSAF. The air force general at the time Hammond kerman found Wernhers findings and theory\u0027s quite interesting and gave the green light to begin construction on step one: building a complex to launch from. The site would not have to be that big. But it would have to be discrete and in a area relatively uninhabited so no one would be killed by falling stages. The site chosen? North rock AFB (now known as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E 2). After 2 months the launch complex was completed. 3 Months later the first rocket \u0022Genesis 1\u0022 lifted off the pad. This rocket was unmaned and only had 1 stage but its launch sent a very important message \u0022rocketry is plausible\u0022. 2 Months later \u0022genesis 23\u0022 became the first piece of kerbal engineering to leave the atmosphere. Many more rockets were launched not all successful but all important none the less. A year later talks began about sending a kerbal to space. Rocket systems were becoming safer by the launch and most of the directorial personal agreed that a manned flight could be quite plausible. Development began on a suit that could protect kerbals from the harshness of space that was discovered by the \u0022Genesis 35\u0022 that used instruments to uncover the quality of the environment that is space. Suit development and capsule development was easy but finding the right kerbal for the job? It was hard. After 26 weeks Wernher and his colleges decided on using pilots from the air forces \u0022craft dynamics testing division\u0022 (or CDTD) which is based out of the \u0022green sands proving grounds\u0022. Or more specifically the runway known only by its Air force runway ID \u0022runway 110011\u0022 or \u0022area 110011\u0022 as many of the kerbals stationed there jokingly call it. Many of the pilots were tested but one stood out of the rest. The name was Jedediah kerman and he was one of the best pilots that got cropped up. Jeb was sent to the North rock site for training and preparation. Wernher and his team then began to work on a manned rocket. The result was the \u0022MF-100\u0022 but most people who saw it and or its highest range called it \u0022the jumping flea\u0022. It was shorter than the unnamed designs and could barely get its occupant to space but this was all for safety reasons.(and to see if a kerbal could survive being launched up to such a height) The day of the launch had clear weather a cloudless sky. The \u0022jumping flea\u0022 was moved to the pad without incident and was soon fueled for launch. Jeb would be quoted as saying \u0022That day was like kerbmas. You either get a toy (a good launch) or a ton of socks (a explosion)\u0022 Wernher was also quoted \u0022When that timer hit 0 our hearts stoped beating right there and then. It was so quiet with nothing more than the roar of the engines. The silence was broken with a sigh of relief and the sound of Darrel opening a sun khips chip bag\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch went off like clockwork with 100% mission objectives completed and the safe return of jeb to the ground. Although many unnamed rockets went higher than jebs first flight. The mission brought back important data on how launches affect kerbals. for many months after successful launches followed like the \u0022kerbal 1\u0022\u00A0 and \u0022kerbal 1-2\u0022 launches. Then with the launch of the \u0022science jr\u0022 mission jeb became the first kerbal to pass the atmosphere into space. However all this was at a cost and buying the materials from company\u0027s then assembling rocket parts on site was quite costly. (company\u0027s like kerbodyne were not founded yet) So jeb volunteerd to use his (now famous) name to create a company to fit the air forces needs. The result? \u0022jebediah kermans junkyard and spacecraft parts co\u0022\u00A0 As time went on space travel became a increasingly popular idea and soon the \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E 2\u0022 found that its complex was not large enough to house the increasingly enlarging mission payloads. So the kerbal air force green lit construction of a newer complex. This complex was to be built in \u0022star cap bay\u0022 and would have a larger pad for larger rockets. The complex\u0027s runway would serve the duel purpose for transport and a new base for the local coast guard units whose nearby island runway was becoming quite aged. Add to this the on site labs and the idea was sold to the administration team. The complex would become part of a sub branch of the air force \u0022the kerbal space program\u0022. The branch got a large boost in funds during the construction process that took 4 years to complete. Not long after the complex\u0027s completion Wernher\u0027s team made quite the discovery: spacecraft could be kept in orbit for a long amount of time. As such the focus of the program shifted to get kerbals into orbit. However the program would need astronauts that could make repairs in orbit if anything went wrong as well as kerbals that could study space in orbit so that the science team would not have to wait for the return of the mission. Of which could take days. The result of this fore planing was bill and bob kerman. Bill had a collage degree in engineering and had long time experience in pressure systems\u00A0 and structural suspension. Bill was given engineering classes during his training to expand his knowledge of rocket systems as well. Bob was a major in physics and was very interested in what could be found in space. However he thought that rockets were still to dangerous to be used in manned flight. None the less he accepted his invitation and joined KSP where he was trained in basic biology and geology. \u0022They wanted me to know everything encase i encountered everything. And that\u0027s the planing i like!\u0022~bob kerman KSP then turned to making the rocket only to find that company\u0027s had sprouted up and were vying for control of the market. The program decided to begin to hold competitions with the winning company\u0027s rocket being used. The winner for the orbital missions? The K-X893 or \u0022kerbal X\u0022 as it was called. After a long testing period the \u0022kerbal x\u0022 was cleared for manned flight usage. And so on a sleepy morning the original 3 climbed into the kerbal X rocket for the \u00220RBITR-1\u0022 mission. The launch went off as planned. resulting in a basic orbit around kerbin. \u0022the sight of kerbin from that high was amazing. It was like seeing the world you knew was nothing more than a large model ball in space\u0022~bill kerman 4 Days later the mission de-orbited and splashed down into the waters off of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The data brought back was revolutionized the kerbals understanding of their planet. The KSP began to recruit more astronaut personal not long after for the many flights ahead. 7 missions later jeb became the first kerbal to preform EVA. Wich he did for 30 minutes before reentering the capsule. The orbiter missions were the longest running mission series in the KSPs history. Even continuing past the munar missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 years into the orbiter missions life time the administration began to consider a manned landing on the nearest orbital body. The decision was made to begin development of a lander system. The finally result was a heavily modified kerbal x orbiter stage with landing legs and ladder. the Administrative personal wanted to use a new rocket design but Wernher reassured them that the kerbal x had enough fuel for such a trip and the cost of the launch system was lower than what development of a entirely new system would be. After 6 months of testing the \u0022munar 1\u0022 mission was go for launch with jeb confirmed as mission commander. the trip took 2 days to transfer between kerbin and the mun and then land. The landing went down in kerbal history as a very important moment with the famous quote: \u0022one small step for kerbal,one giant leap for kerbal kind\u0022~jeb The crew spent 5 days on the mun surface before returning with at least 23\u00A0 surface samples. 8 more landers were sent to the mun that continued the work of the first landing. 4 years after the first landing many things have changed. A station was built in orbit around the mun and kerbalkind has landed on minimus duna and ike. Now the kerbals have there sights set on jool and its surrounding planets. With this want to explore and with the tech needed in hand the kerbals destiny now lies in the stars. All they need is kerbals with the bravery such as\u00A0 jeb bill bob and valentina and they can explore beyond there wildest dreams.....they also need to pack snacks lots and lots of snacks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your reading this than thank you for reading it all the way through.
