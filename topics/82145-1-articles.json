A strange white kerbal with five fingers and a large body is found living in the craft. The young man has a label on his suit: Neil Armstrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThis generates a subplot where they try and get Neil Armstrong back to Earth using the first Warp Drive, culminating in a scene with Real Solar System where the Apollo 11 Moon Landing is taking place and Neil suddenly disappears, and Buzz bravely pilots the lander down to the surface, but it crashes in the boulder field. Buzz survives, but the Ascent Propulsion systems are heavily damaged. He is forced to stay on the moon for days, as Neil returns to the crash site with Jeb, Bill, and Bob in the lander.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBuzz joins the crew of the Interstellar Lunar Lander craft as they liftoff from the moon and attempt to rendezvous with the C/SM, which has already burned for return to the Earth with Michael Collins inside.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll of this culminates in the Interstellar lunar lander hurriedly docking with the CM just before re-entry heating (already in the upper atmosphere!)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe Jeb manages to get the interstellar lunar lander craft into a decaying orbit, where the Interstellar Mothership picks them up. Parts of the craft rain down to Mexico rain down years later and a damaged nameplate reading \u0022Kerbal Spa e Pro r m\u0022 inspire a young Felipe Falanghe to launch firework rockets with tinfoil astronauts called Kerbals on them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EEpilogue: not shown in the series:\u003Cbr\u003E(Years later as he works at a Marketing Company in Mexico City, Felipe pitches the idea of a game called Kerbal Space Program to his bosses. They eventually agree, and a let\u0027s player called Scott Manley plays the game for years until his latest series tackles an interstellar quest. His Kerbals find a strange white kerbal with five fingers and a large body is found living in the craft.
