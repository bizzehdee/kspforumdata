All of them before this one have been tiny and unable to deliver any payloads into space, so it feels good to finally have created one with actual function. However, it\u0027s plagued by a pretty serious problem. At first when it takes off, it flies pretty smooth. However, I notice later in the flight that it becomes unstable when activating the rocket engines. More importantly, this only happens after a while of flying on jet engines. If I burn with the rocket engines at take off, it still seems to fly pretty smooth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it\u0027s not the aerodynamics of the craft, because it happens in space too. I can actually get it into space, but it\u0027s a constant battle. Leave the engines burning for too long, the nose rises until the spacecraft goes into a complete spin. My first thought was the fuel was becoming unbalanced later on in the flight, and indeed this may still be the case. However I tried flying it with TAC Fuel Balancer active and it still does the same thing, so I\u0027m really stumped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s so frustrating because without this problem, the thing would be pretty efficient and my first truly successful advanced SSTO.
