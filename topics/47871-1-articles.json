I finally downloaded the demo a few months ago and have been playing the full version for a month now. Wow. Just wow. Now I\u0027m jealous of the guys out there that have built dedicated consoles. I can\u0027t wait for the full release and I hope this game one day gains enough popularity to have a community like MS Flight Simulator X. Multiplayer alone would be the -snip-, even on just a LAN connection, like the old Quake days. I\u0027m currently trying to dock some small probes and learning the difficulties of such. Many thanks to the fellow Kerbals who\u0027ve uploaded vids to youtube to help me out there. Hopefully someday soon, I\u0027ll be able to return the favor to other noobs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3_bit","CreatedById":52836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T00:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I personally hope the community shrinks a bit. It loses it\u0027s personal touch when it gets too big. (ever been on MinecraftForums?) I\u0027ve had whole threads moved to a place they don\u0027t belong there without any notification. Anyhow, welcome to the community, and if you need any help, feel free to PM me. I\u0027m definitely not the best but I can pull of some Manley-like maneuvers at times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
