If it ever becomes reality, then I am concerned this is an extremely short sighted idea driven by some people\u0027s hunt for the Fantastic while not seeing, be it through bias or pure lack of insight, the long term consequences. First, if warp drive or anything like that violates the laws of physics then interstellar travel will have to be a journey over hundreds, thousands or millions of years. Imortals could cope with such a quick trip but time is still time and how would they cope with it mentally? My point is, unless we somehow can get to other star systems with our wits intact, and being alive when we get there, then we\u0027re stuck in this system. It can only hold so many. How are we going to deal with a world wide population growing out of all proportions? Or would we enforce a population control where we only allow newborns if someone else die and make room? If noone die except in accidents or through diseases (they do evolve too, the diseases), where will all of us live?
