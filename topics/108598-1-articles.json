It was around version 0.20 and resources were just behind the corner or so did we thought... In the end the whole project failed mainly because it was impossible to bring so many orange tanks from Kerbin to Laythe. But now things have changed and I want to re-boot the whole thing.\n\nQuestin is: Where would you get ore in Joolian system? Options are mostly just Vall, Bop and Pol.\n\nPol is far, but has low gravity and not as much inclination so getting refined fuel to Laythe orbit should not be that problematic and I see it as best option. What you guys think?"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:45:33Z","Content":"Once you\u0027re in a system, distance is by and large irrelevant. It\u0027s only if you\u0027re in a hurry that you have to consider distance, and I doubt you are if you\u0027re doing a Joolian mission. Bop and Pol are roughly equivalent in trouble for getting anything from them down to the inner moons, so it would be best to use Pol as your mining base."},{"CreatedByName":"Andrewx21","CreatedById":140332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T15:58:33Z","Content":"Wasnt it pol that is known to have the occasional land glitch, were the land is rendered lower than it is?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tada","CreatedById":57283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T16:54:31Z","Content":"Meh, I made few experimental miners and everything seems fine.

Once we get the hang of this sort of thing, it\u0027ll become a non-issue. This whole package was dropped into our laps with little warning as to the specifics, so we\u0027re all still learning as we go.\n\nThe bigger problem, for me, is the scanning; the clamshell scanner is just too big. Back in ye olden days, I\u0027d put a Kethane or Karbonite scanner on an ion-propelled mapping probe capable of fitting inside a half-length Mk2 cargo bay and lofted by my light spaceplanes. The new narrow-band scanner is a bit larger than those, but it was still possible to make a decent design. However, the survey scanner is just far too large for anything like that. It\u0027d be one thing if its mass actually required a larger probe design, but it\u0027s only 0.2 tons so you\u0027re still going to be moving it with tiny ion drives and such, and that leads to some ridiculous appearances."},{"CreatedByName":"vej","CreatedById":143657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T18:52:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The bigger problem, for me, is the scanning; the clamshell scanner is just too big.

You won\u0027t get 26k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV with that extra weight but it\u0027d be much easier to do longer burns without having to time-accelerate through battery recharging every 30-40 m/s. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nMy plan is to have Pol be the refining center and have a dockable tanker that can move around to different orbits.

They\u0027re really expensive, but go with RTGs; one RTG can offset the drain from that scanner, although it\u0027d take 12 to produce enough electricity to keep an ion going at full thrust. Realistically, I\u0027m planning my ion probes to use four of the things and run at 33% thrust once I\u0027m near Jool. If you\u0027re only using this probe to scan each moon once and then leave, you could even do it with fuel cells, but I prefer probes that can stick around to fulfill science contracts as well so that\u0027s not really an option.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My plan is to have Pol be the refining center and have a dockable tanker that can move around to different orbits.\n\nBack in ye olden days, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027d do with my Kethane and Karbonite fuel networks. Pol was the primary fuel depot for the Jool system, and I\u0027d keep one refinery there and one tanker down at Laythe. I\u0027m planning on doing the same with the new system, although it\u0027s also handy to have a land-based refinery (using a large rover) that can meet up with already-landed vessels. I had small 20-30 ton rovers and huge 600-ton megarovers for this sort of role, and it worked nicely."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T22:09:52Z","Content":"Just send a probe to see..."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T23:02:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E it\u0027d take 12 [RTGs] to produce enough electricity to keep an ion going at full thrust.\n\nRemember that there\u0027s a thing called \u0022batteries\u0022.

Yes the solar generated is much less out there but if you have to time-accelerate it doesn\u0027t really matter how long it takes. My puny battery and puny solar panel recharge in something like one in-game day, maybe less. I don\u0027t even have the 4k battery unlocked yet.
