I really, really like like this idea but these lists quickly get lost in the very active addon forum. We really at this point could use a subforum in Add-ons for this type of list both to encourage list making and to make finding them easier. There are so many mods. And so many mods that don\u0026#39;t get the attention they deserve. This would be a great opportunity to crowdsource different mod lists for various purposes and reasons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI Am sure there are some rules that would need to be established but I truly believe this would be a great benefit to the KSP community.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust a thought and thanks for reading.[/INDENT]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T02:09:32Z","Content":"\nMy 2 cents, if they were to do something like this it would be a subforum of this forum or Addon Releases rather than a Forum in Addons.
