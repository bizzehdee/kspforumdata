This craft is a tractor type space craft and the tractor portion has its gimbals disabled. This operation took several hours and multiple launches with early game technology. When all was set and I was ready to go, the craft lost control. After a bit of a confused investigation I found that one engine in a set of symmetrically placed engines doesn\u0027t get any fuel. (See screenshot, notice the staging shows it has no fuel. The shut off engine is a Soyuz and is supposed to be off for the duration of the mission.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t find any reason for this as the whole thing is symmetrical. There aren\u0027t fuel lines, but the other 3 don\u0027t need them. Any ideas on what is going on? Bug?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. All 4 engines worked fine when I put the ship into orbit.

Also many ships have docked and undocked including a tanker. Having said that the engines on the main propulsion module do have a little bit of fuel. There is a small tank the engine is directly connected to that provides a bit of thrust but when the other engines are taking fuel from the last tank in the ship this one engine is taking fuel from only this attached tank.
