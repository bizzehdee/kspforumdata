I believe that the results for certain experiments should change in relation to the spacecraft\u0027s distance from Kerbol, especially if it\u0027s in or around a planet\u0027s orbital area. Is there a mod that adds extra biomes to achieve this, including \u0027interstellar\u0027 ones?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
