Unless I\u0027m hearing it wrong he says you are able to touch the tiles because they dissipate heat very rapidly. It should be the opposite, these tiles are a near perfect thermal insulator and dissipate heat so slowly that you can touch the tiles before any significant amount of heat is transferred to your fingers. When we feel hot things, it is not the heat we feel, but the rate at which heat is being transferred to (or from in the case of cold objects) our hands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T22:44:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw this on Wimp.com a few hours a go, and I have a question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy can you touch the corners, but not the faces.

The issue is that when you touch the face of the cube, the contact surface area between the cube and your fingers is much greater. This means more heat will be transferred in the same amount of time, making it feel hotter, and a higher risk of being burned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T22:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe corners underwent more initial cooling, simply due to having more nearby surface area.
