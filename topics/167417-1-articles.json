Like a lander full of fuel, especially on Kerbin since it has greater gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding legs simply aren\u0027t very strong in the vanilla game. If it leans to much you might want to install a few more legs or angle them differently as that may also help.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have to use dampener and spring to absorb impact collisions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen any of the landing legs are pushed to their maximum suspension by leaning it will generally bounce with the surface if the spring setting is to low.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe higher the mass of your craft, the greater the spring setting should be. Do you still run into this problem at max spring settings, then you need more legs.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0027dampener\u0027 and \u0027spring\u0027 settings are very arbitrary, I or anyone else can\u0027t evaluate these settings into logical numbers. You\u0027ll have to see what works for you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso know that the landing gear qualities are optimized for all planets, not just Kerbin. There are more worlds with less gravity rather then with greater gravity, thus on most worlds you want very generous amount of suspension and the settings provided in the menus are scaled so it can be optimized everywhere. Unfortunately that means just strapping landing legs with default suspension settings on a heavy craft landed on Kerbin is not always the best thing to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, it may look foolish. But you can also use landing gear as landing legs. They\u0027re a lot sturdier, in magical ways I must add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-11T08:19:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2017 08:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Helmetman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"At4851","CreatedById":181304,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T00:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, with mine I noticed it happens with the heavier ones too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
