I did buffed the cfg for the external fuel tanks that i used as Landing gear suports tough, not in an unrealist matter, since real life external fuel tanks usually weight close to 1kg per liter of fuel caring and i used that formula (kerosane actually weights 0.8kg per liter so the rest is weight for the scructure of the tank).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a SSTO and also Mun lander capable craft, but VERY hard to control for several reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Very low lift, this is the nature of the original design, only small wings holds the engines nacelles and they can\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be very long otherwise the increased momentum would make the engines wobble too much\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) While the ship showed to be actually a viable and controllabe design it MUST have extended advanced and automatic throttle/tilrotor controlls and be a full fly-by-wire craft. While the game actually does make a good job on automatic directing and adjusting the angles of all the controlls, rudders wings and thurst vectors, they are, however oriented in the navball direction and assume all thruster are in the same direction axis, the automatic controlls does not account for the variable angle of the VTOL controll, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) even worse, the best MOD that allows controllable mechanical moving parts on a shift, where extremely good, thanks in advance for the creator, does not allow a more fully customizable speed/angle dependency and automatic sas controll while calculating the thurst direction, well of course i imagine that would be too hard do program, so you have to manually adjust the main engine nacelles thurst angle AND: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) THE AUXILIARY TAIL THRUSTERS. That\u0027s right, that is indeed present in the original design, even when i tried to simplify the desing and allign perfectly the engine thursters with the center of gravity the craft proved to be even harder to controll without the tail stabilizers thursters, so i kept the two separete controlls, even tough they are cubbersome to control simultaneously. You should be gentle with them and abuse of RCS and SAS controll while gently turning both thursters. That should, of course be an automatically function\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Abismal poor Roll control, That\u0027s right, the original design does not have horizontal stabilizers, instead have large rudders, that is pretty dumb so if you roll while acelerating more than 15 degrees, you\u0027ll lose controll, disable the thurst and rely on rcs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added LOTS of powerfull rcs thursters all over the craft to help stabilize it and save the ship in a out of controll spins. They are not mandatory tough, you could fly the ship, even in space, entirely without rcs, but with the poor and slow separated controls of the tail thursters and main engines that proves to be very difficult, specially because while the ship gets lighter by burning fuel, the center of gravity will change and demand different adjusts of controlls. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to rebuild the ship from scratch three times till finally fouding the best stable design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is too heavy to use actual standard jet engines, while it is possible to make it lighter with less fuel and non-horbital, i would have to completely rebuild it and the center of gravity would be harder to be put forward on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used SEVERAL mods if anyone actually WANTS this ship i will try posting all of them here, you can try of course figure they out by the pics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4FAN0h.png\u0022 alt=\u00224FAN0h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/x2VDyh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022x2VDyh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LXIQVh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LXIQVh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6XtCqh.png\u0022 alt=\u00226XtCqh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lhwz3h.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lhwz3h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9808/vlcsnap2012081802h46m57.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vlcsnap2012081802h46m57.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-12T16:53:16Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2012 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"supermichael777","CreatedById":44546,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T13:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eawesome and impractical.
