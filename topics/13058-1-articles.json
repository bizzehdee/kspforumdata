Harv has been quite faithful at keeping us apprised at what is coming up next, what is coming soon, and any new ideas he is toying with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1st: Harv has stated the rocky planets will be instituted next for new worlds to the solar system. I wouldn\\\u0027t be surprised if they get added in 0.17. Gas planets are down the road since they require a whole new batch of code for interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd: Yes, Harv did create warp drives. However, there is no promise of them actually being added to the game. Some things get made during the development cycle to see if it might be possible. If they are added, they might just be for facilitating faster interplanetary travel. Think EVE Online for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd: I wouldn\\\u0027t expect anything on this until the Kerbol system is finished and polished. As KSP stands, I wouldn\\\u0027t mind if it just constituted only the Kerbol system. If Squad feels it is a worthwhile endeavour, they might just consider adding interstellar travel as a later expansion. There are already a few real life designs* for interstellar travel that could be incorporated into the game. Wiki the Orion Project for one example. Whether Squad wants to go a bit further into science fiction for that is up to them. Consider, though, that additional solar systems is a whole new nest of eggs for coding and such that would need to be done. Whether the Unity engine is up to it is also a factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4th: I wouldn\\\u0027t mind if we could view other galaxies in the sky around Kerbol, but to visit them? I don\\\u0027t think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5th: See the bit about science fiction under 3rd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6th: That is coming, it is a project unto itself that has been getting touched on. My forecast? Maybe 0.18\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7th: Considering the campaign mode has been mentioned to include maintenance and construction of your main KSC, building a second isn\\\u0027t so far fetched. I am hoping that it will be possible to build a munar base from which to launch missions. But this kind of detail I wouldn\\\u0027t expect until towards the last quarter of development. I pretty much see KSP as still being in its first quarter still. even with all that\\\u0027s been added so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*:As in, we can actually implement and build them right now. You can thank current arms treaties for keeping the easier one of them on paper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, by the way. I feel it is prudent to remind you and other newcomers that many of these points have been visited and already talked to death. I don\\\u0027t mind sharing on them as it keeps my excitement still a bit high and I do like to help new friends along. I do hope other veterans who share their part here have my patience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, in KSP failure is always an option.
