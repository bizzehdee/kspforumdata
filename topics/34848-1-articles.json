Jool is about the same size as Earth and has a similar orbital speed. Only difference is that Jool has a little less gravity at 0.8 g\u0027s, making it slightly easier to get into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve needs anywhere from 8000 to 12000 m/s delta-v depending on where you land, mostly because of its atmosphere being so thick. But Eve also requires much higher TWR since its gravity is a lot higher than Earth\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
