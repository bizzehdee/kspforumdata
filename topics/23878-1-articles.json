If I recall correctly, Apollo did that on purpose. Landing at a specific spot on a world with an atmosphere is actually quite hard, because even a slight change in your approach angle or speed will cause you to pass through the air on a very different arc, and will change the landing spot by miles. Aim for a spot quite far beyond where you want to land because the air will slow you down quite a bit and you\u0027ll fall shorter than that. But how far to aim ahead of the target? That has to be an educated guess. After splashing down, yes, end flight to retire that ship and put the crew back in the rotation roster.

Fortunately, the capsule will shed most of orbital speed all by itself, just from air resistance, and the chute is only really necessary to cushion the final contact with the ground. Open the chute any time after slowing to 300m/s but before 350m from the ground, and it should still open in time and slow you to a survivable touchdown speed. Of course, it\u0027s kind of risky to play chicken with the ground like that, and at least 500m above the ground is advisable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
