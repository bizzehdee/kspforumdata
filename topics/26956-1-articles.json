I have a couple of questions which will help the frustration im having. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Ive created a hibernation capsule with legs, lights, batteries and solar panels etc which im planning to use as part of a mun base. ive coupled it to a lander craft which ive designed to land on mun, decouple the capsule and then fly back off to crash somewhere on mun. I started my build using a small control pod (unmanned) on the lander craft and built the hybernation pod under it but as soon as i decouple the hybernation capsule i loose control over it. I think i understand why and thats because the control pod is on the lander craft so there is no control availiable. If i add a second control pod to the hybernation capsule, decouple it but as soon as the lander crashes i cant select the hybernation pod, if i dont crash the lander craft and land it somewhere nearby i can select the hybernation capsule (using [ \u0026amp; ]) but i cant control anything on it. Ive tried right clicking the 2nd control pod and clicking \u0027control from here\u0027 but nothing seems to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get a prototype landed on mun and a kerbal i had nearby jumped into the hybernation capsule (prototype version but the same bar some slight tweeks) and be could control the lights, 1/2 of the solar panels but not the gears or ladder. ( i had enough electricity) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that was one anomoly, my other is if i add a 2nd (manned) control pod to a craft when a primary unmanned pod was used its empty when i get on the launch pad, where as if i added that first it would have 1 or 2 kerbals sat ready to go. Is there anyway you can manually add kerbals to mannable control pods? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T21:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not clear about what you\u0027re describing, but does the hibernation thingy have a source of electricity? The game will only automatically put Kerbals in a command pod if it is the original part you chose from which to start the build. After that, you either need to have Kerbals from another vehicle climb ladders to the capsules, or use one of the mods that control capsule staffing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T21:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. If by \u0022hibernation capsule\u0022 you mean \u0022Hitchhiker Storage Container,\u0022 the main problem is probably that the Hitchhiker isn\u0027t actually considered a control capsule itself. You\u0027ll have to have something else attached to it to get it to function, either a probe body or an actual manned pod. There\u0027s also some weirdness associated with that part, especially if you\u0027re playing on a Mac.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the \u0022root\u0022 control pod of the craft is an unmanned capsule, your vehicle will always launch unmanned. In the stock game, you could consider spawning a manned \u0022crew car\u0022 through the Spaceplane Hangar, then EVA them and put them in the pods you want manned. (Figuring out how to get them up there will be left as an exercise for the reader.)
