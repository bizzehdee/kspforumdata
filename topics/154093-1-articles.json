My dream relay kessler would include about 12-18 probes that include their own reaction wheels, boosters, solar panels, and of course, the relays. This is heavy, RAM intensive, and somewhat impractical if the kessler itself had enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E to transport the relays.\u00A0So far, I have gotten a stable design that only holds six of these probes. I added heat shields and parachutes to go to Eve. They would\u0027ve survived long-term if it weren\u0027t for the gravity smacking them hard enough on the ground to shatter their solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupposing the kessler has enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E and torque (for stability) to transfer simplistic relays (just a probe core, solar panels/RTGs, a relay, and possibly a battery just in case)about the Kerbol\u00A0system would theoretically shave off a large amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E to waste.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest challenge I find myself encountering is the means to deploy said relays. Some designs have a structural element on top of the 2.5m probe core and the small girders to hold\u00A0separators. My latest attempt has simplistic designs encased in stacked 2.5m service bays. These have to be much more simplistic and have huge trouble getting out of the bay, often breaking the solar panels, but it\u0027s lighter. I\u0027m thinking of deploying an empty mothership with several docking ports and launch several of the small probes to dock with it, but then what\u0027s the point of wasting all the time and effort when it can all be in one simple launch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also been trying to find a career-friendly way to incorporate this \u003Cs\u003Emalicious\u00A0military and government surveillance device\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0wonderful way to cross together a DSN.
