It\u0027s the stagnation themperature, which is the temperature air would have if all it\u0027s kinetic energy would be transformed into thermal energy. Now the latter is rather hard to actually calculate, so the \u0022hack\u0022 used to calculate it is to say that 1m/s=1K, which is actually rather close. So yes, you can expect Temp ext to be pretty close, if not the same as the velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Make sure you know what you\u0027re even looking at before blowing stuff out of proportions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that is exactly what i was saying (and everyone else; no one is confused about that)... have you read the whole thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo one ever questioned why atmospheric temperature (i.e. external stagnation temperature) was so high....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe are confused why there is heating when readout for Temp_ext (stagnation temperature) is BELOW part temperature...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathanKell proposed a reason here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117511-Serious-Bug-in-Convective-Aerodynamic-Heating?p=1886854\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1886854\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117511-Serious-Bug-in-Convective-Aerodynamic-Heating?p=1886854\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1886854\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, there is still a bug since Temp_ext is not used above Mach 2 or so, so it is misleading, to say the least...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuthermore, I\u0027m not convinced that the form of hypersonic convective flux is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econvective flux = density*velocity^3*convection_constant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the physical basis for this form (any sources?)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, there also seems to be a numerical problem: at hypersonic velocities, flux is independent of part temperature so part can be heated to infinity, even above the stagnation temperature of the compressed air. this is clearly not physical \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only hand wavy explanation i can give is that since radiation heat transfer coefficient grows with T^3, (flux grows with T^4), radiative heat transfer coefficient will be dominant anyway... though i\u0027m not really convinced that is the case\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(for example: h_radiation(T=2000K)~=5.67e-8*2000^3=450 W/m2-K.... that is not large at all...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T05:14:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T06:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found a good reference for the convective flux relationship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econvective_flux = density*velocity^3*convection_constant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/nikos/courses/AE264/pdf/Hypersonic.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESee Page 22\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, the derivation assumes that the wall temperature is much less than stagnation temperature.
