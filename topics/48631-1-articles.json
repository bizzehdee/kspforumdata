With one of the other landing gear options now available I was able to bring the nose up for a shorter takeoff run, without needing the pylon. I added a tail gear to limit my initial nose up, and to keep from scraping the tail cone off. As the wings are now crossfuel capable, I got rid of the LFO fuel lines. I added an RCS system, and added some batteries, as I still using electric while in orbit. I found out that in addition to changing the Sabre mode from air-breather to rocket, I had to also shut off the air intake. Before I added the intakes to the mode switch action group, at about 30km I\u0027d get a flame-out and then the engines would never act in sync. And unlike before, I couldn\u0027t recover as the Sabres would start up at different times and put Spike into a flat spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve taken off and got into orbit, now I got to land the spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
