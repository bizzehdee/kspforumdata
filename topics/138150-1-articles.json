So if you accept the \u0027rescue a Kerbal from X\u0027 type contracts you would get a lot of these. For me these are really good, as i find them a good money return doing a single rescue mission is ok, but if i can rescue say 4 Kerbals with one launch (assuming all within Kebin SOI) then the returns are even greater.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI need a large staff rosta as i have many missions underway at once, with scientists in labs all over the place, and pilots heading to places, etc. plus it saves me having to pay for staff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you purposely grinded a certain contract type knowing you can do it easily and it gives a good return?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T09:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t intend to grind rescue contracts, but I got a good system going which would let me pluck a rescuee out of low orbit with a 12-15 minute flight time, so I did a couple just for the cash. So I\u0027m now up to 16 Kerbals on my roster on day 22 and still getting a load of contracts offered, and haven\u0027t even set foot on Minmus yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, if you do a couple of tourist contracts to get the launchpad, mission control and astronaut complex upgraded, and avoid exploring too far (ideally without even going to the Mun), you can game the system to get dozens of crew quite quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, 10 of those 16 are all engineeers.

Which can easily be worth six figures, due to the ridiculous hiring cost scaling. If you fly a mission that collects multiple Kerbals, the payout is even better. And they flat-out ignore your hiring limit as well. And the Kerbal you rescue starts with one experience star, due to returning from orbit, not with 0 stars like regular new hires.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck, even if rescue contracts gave you zero funds, they\u0027d still be the most valuable contract you could possibly take if your goal was to get more Kerbals. But they do give you good money too. So yeah, if you want to min/max your contracts, doing exclusively rescue missions is definitely the way to cheese yourself to riches. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T09:23:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 09:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T15:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose \u0022rescue XY from low Kerbin orbit\u0022 actually made me construct a lot of more and more efficient SSTOs.
