Correct me if I\u0027m wrong (I\u0027m currently working on a private pilot\u0027s license, so I shouldn\u0027t be wrong) all aircraft have to preform a maneuver known as a landing flare. What this does is it causes your main gear to touch down before the nose gear. If you put the weight of your space-plane on the nose gear first, odds are it\u0027ll snap right off, causing the nose to slam into the ground, followed by a chain reaction of explosions and structural failures. Also, don\u0027t flare too much. You don\u0027t want to slam to the tail into the ground.
