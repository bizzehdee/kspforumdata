First you need to demonstrate that you can actually restart the Merlin engine, which isn\u0027t exactly trivial, especially when it is facing the airflow. Then, you need to demonstrate that it can actually decelerate and land. Then you want to test the actual launch profile, which is different from an expendable launch. You also need to test navigation systems and avionics. And finally, you want to test the \u0022throwback\u0022 manoeuver, which is the extra burn that puts the rocket on a RTLS (Return To Launch Site) trajectory. Before throwing the first stage back to the launch site, you want to make sure that it can actually land safely and not crash into a populated area. After that, you need to do extensive testing to make sure that the first stage wasn\u0027t damaged, buckled, or bent, in the process. The whole thing might turn out to be not practical at all. They don\u0027t really know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause rockets are expensive, they will be testing each of these individual steps on actual commercial launches (I assume that customers get a discount for the extra risk or payload loss). The first stages are assumed to be expendable, so after they have done their job, instead of ditching them, they will try out some of their new systems to find out if the RTLS manoeuver is actually practical before actually risking sending one back to the launch pad that might crash into the VAB. Each step actually decreases payload fraction (a reusable F9R will have a payload of approximately 7mt to LEO instead of 11mt for the F9 1.1), so if you are testing on launches that are paid by a customer, it makes sense to minimise payload loss by only testing parts of the RTLS system each time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T08:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst you need to demonstrate that you can actually restart the Merlin engine, which isn\u0027t exactly trivial, especially when it is facing the airflow.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could also leave it on a low throttle setting while they steer the first stage around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T08:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really a good idea to have your first stage thrusting (even on minimal thrust) during separation of the second stage.
