Sometimes BSOD. The only time this happens is when I am parachuting into the ocean looking at the craft. From IVA I have no problems landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods Installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print, Chatter, RLA_Stockalike, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, Realchute, SDHI, FAR, Remotetech, Engineer, KOSMOS, Procedural Fairings, Firespitter, KWRocketry, DeadlyReentry, Thunder Aerospace, and Lionhead_aerospace.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReproduction Steps: After I noticed the problem I checked and rolled back my Nvidia driver. This offered no change so I thought my GPU might be dying. After running a few other high resource games and Furmark to stress test a GPU failure seemed unlikely. I reinstalled KSP and reinstalled all mods besides graphical mods like hotrockets and texture replacer. Once again I had problems landing in the ocean. I uninstalled and reinstalled without any mods and again I had problems. A week later I updated the latest Nvidia driver and tried again. This time landing on solid ground. No graphical problems occurred. Thinking the problem was fixed I launched another craft and tried in the ocean this time. The ocean started giving me graphical artifacts with squares disappearing. Before landing I relaunch and try again landing in the ocean. I get a full BSOD. Whocrashed says either hardware or driver issues. I find this strange and run more tests playing other resource heavy games and again no problems come up. I launch once more and try landing in the ocean. Black screen again and windows recovers from driver crash. I switch to IVA to see if I can land like that. No problems at all landing in IVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2AV8GQxE0kka0ZsVGlNOHlwZG8/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2AV8GQxE0kka0ZsVGlNOHlwZG8/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alttabmatt","CreatedById":42817,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T23:32:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn update.

I rolled back my drivers to September and re-installed the game. Checked Nvidia\u0027s forums and seeing a lot of people with the same problem with my series of card. Seems to be Nvidia\u0027s issue not KSP\u0027s. Problems may be driver related, heat related, or the card may be going out but I still doubt as KSP is the only game to give me problems.

Which drivers? What video card do you have? Your problem seems very similar to mine. Do you monitor your video card usage % when the crashes happens?
