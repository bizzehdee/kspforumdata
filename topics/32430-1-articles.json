Thank you! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up using mechjeb to dock it. I\u0027ve docked plenty of ships before without issues and I always have an ASAS module and I\u0027ve used that to keep the ship steady whilst docking. It\u0027s worked really well, but the ships were a lot lighter (usually one or smaller engines). I didn\u0027t factor in the ridicolous weight of my LN-Vs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all docked and refuelled now ready for the trip to Moho. The 7 LN-Vs have 3500 Delta-V and the lander around 2000. I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s enough to get me there and land? But it probably doesn\u0027t have enough to get back to Kerbin.

It starts off normally, with a small 1200m/s burn for the transfer. But then you often need a huge 1000m/s of orbital adjustments because theres really no way to have a perfect Hohmann transfer with it\u0027s inclination and eccentricity. Then, the capture burn turns between 2000m/s and 4500m/s, depending on if you\u0027re lucky enough to catch it at it\u0027s apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is due to two reasons: one, Moho is insanely close to the Sun, it\u0027s twice as close as Mercury actually is if I remember correctly. This means that to approach it, you need to go \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E deep in the sun\u0027s gravity well, and you pick up an INCREDIBLE amount of speed going down. Second, Moho\u0027s gravitational force is pretty low for a planet, meaning it\u0027s escape velocity is also very low. There\u0027s no aerobrake possibility, meaning you have to burn up a huge amount of relative speed to get a catch around Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s the same problem with probes trying to reach Mercury. If you look up on Wikipedia, it\u0027s the only planet that they talk about the insane amount of delta V required to reach it. Mercury is actually the planet with the smallest orbital inclination, but the largest eccentricity: it\u0027s nearly 1.5 times further away from the sun at it\u0027s apoapsis than it\u0027s periapsis. The delta V required to reach Mercury is even higher than the one require to escape the sun :l\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, basically Moho is hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
