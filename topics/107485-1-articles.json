Previously, my planetary landers have been mostly like this:\n\n![A7yVbOo.png](http://i.imgur.com/A7yVbOo.png)\n\n(Sorry for the size; it\u0027s a screenshot)\n\nNow, with the new aerodynamics model, that won\u0027t work. I tried it, it won\u0027t go up efficiently enough, let alone make a gravity turn.\n\nA redesign would probably be vertical, for a more apollo style system, or just a big fuel tank. That, however, would cause stability issues with the landing legs. \n\nWhich is always fun. I\u0027m sure Jeb would LOVE to be stuck on the Mun again.\n\nNow, should I go with One Big Tank, or a couple of smaller ones and an engine in the stack that decouples and blasts off from there?\n\nOne Big Tank is good on part count, but I\u0027m hauling the empty tankage all the way back.\n\nApollo style means hauling another engine AND another decoupler up, and down to the Munar surface. And if I\u0027ve miscalculated, I\u0027ve got to dump my landing legs partway down. Which sucks.\n\nI\u0027m stuck. I can\u0027t decide which way to go, and it\u0027s blocking me from doing anything until I work through it. So I come here, in the hope that input will help."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:55:27Z","Content":"I just choose to ignore the aerodynamics for the most part.\n\n![mun_mission_1.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/mun_mission_1.jpeg)\n\nThe Mainsail is powerful enough that you can deviate a few degrees from prograde during the ascent without any trouble.\n\n![mun_mission_2.jpeg](http://jltsiren.kapsi.fi/ksp/1.0/mun_mission_2.jpeg)\n\nI may have forgotten some less useful parts, such as landing struts."},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:28:31Z","Content":"Yes, but I don\u0027t HAVE a Mainsail.

I suggest [Kerbal Engineer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230-1-0-2-Kerbal-Engineer-Redux-v1-0-16-6) so that you ensure you have enough dV to get there and back. Also each engine has it\u0027s specific niche. The Skipper is a good light lift/second stage engine. The Poodle is a good in space engine."},{"CreatedByName":"SlabGizor117","CreatedById":135987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:50:04Z","Content":"One idea I had for a mun/minmus base is to have a \u0022Ferry\u0022 rocket with a Nerv on it that can push a payload up to whichever moon and have the payload insert itself in the moon\u0027s orbit, then have the ferry aerobrake to get back into a stable Kerbin orbit, ready for it\u0027s next payload. you could even have docking port detachable heat shields and refueling ports and stuff, for a resupply mission to rendezvous with the ferry to switch heat shields and refuel it. It may not be the most efficient, but I think it would be fun! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Poofer","CreatedById":110117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:55:28Z","Content":"Concentrate on getting the fairings if you\u0027re having trouble with aerodynamics while ascending.\n\nedit: also, if it\u0027s strictly a Mun lander, you can get away without fairings and a fairly tall/slim design.

Stick with 1-Kerbal landers for now, and build them as tiny as possible. Fairings are pretty much a must-have for launching any kind of lander off of Kerbin. Even if the weight is symmetric, the drag might not be. ALL of my Mun and Minmus landers (and launchers) have been entirely 1.25m parts so far, and I \\*do\\* have the Mainsail unlocked.\n\nAlso put fins on the core launch stage, preferably the ones with built-in control surfaces, and your launches will go a lot more smoothly."},{"CreatedByName":"Methusalem","CreatedById":125765,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:55:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you\u0027re going for a single vessel to land, re-ascend, and return to kerbin you\u0027re sort of stuck with something relatively large.

It uses a Scientist as crew and has still SAS, since the fuel tanks are arranged around an OCTO probe core. The lifter was a simple 1.25m design with a T45 as main engine and 4x T30 around it in asparagus staging.\n\nAs long as you make sure to only use parts with a temperature resistance of 2000C for anything facing the atmosphere, you don\u0027t need a heat-shield for the orbital and moon missions. And if you build everything symmetrically (both, mass and drag) then it also doesn\u0027t need fairings. To be honest, they are cool and everything.
