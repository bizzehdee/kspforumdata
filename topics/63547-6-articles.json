So engine thrust loss and FAR drag loss should be synchronous, in theory. AJE uses in-game air pressure too, so this should not be a problem\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T03:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I thought you were still using EngineSim\u0027s calculation based on altitude.
