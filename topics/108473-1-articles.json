The first of the rovers was damaged during initial exploration, the second held the bugged antenna. I detached the rover, drove it a considerable distance from the base, and destroyed it to eliminate the bug. I then launched an autonomous rover equipped with a claw to land on the moon. After successfully landing only 3 km from the base, I drove over and attached to the base.
