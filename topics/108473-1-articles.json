It was built to carry two docked rovers to the moon with me, each of which were held attached by a junior docking ring, each of which carried the only antennae installed on the base. The first of the rovers was damaged during initial exploration, the second held the bugged antenna. I detached the rover, drove it a considerable distance from the base, and destroyed it to eliminate the bug. I then launched an autonomous rover equipped with a claw to land on the moon. After successfully landing only 3 km from the base, I drove over and attached to the base. Its antenna was able to successfully transmit the science data home, and since I loaded it with a few new science implements, I was able to increase the science production at the same time."},{"CreatedByName":"BUJI","CreatedById":150390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T16:26:17Z","Content":"I had this same problem. Had a roving science lab on Mun that was full of science like a thanksgiving turkey, it would transmit to 100% and then just start over again. Sometimes I would leave it to go check on another ship and come back to try it again to find it stuck etc. I fixed it by sending chauffeuringineer Bill out with a KAS wrench, removed the antenna, and re-attached it. Worked like a charm after that.

I tell it \u0022transmit science\u0022\n2. There\u0027s a long, slow period while it does the transmitting, and I can watch the \u0022percentage complete\u0022 gradually increase\n3. It gets to 100%\n4. It says \u0022done\u0022\n    - Note, this is a novel use of the word \u0022done\u0022 with which you are likely unfamiliar, because it isn\u0027t actually done and nothing important has happened yet\n5. **There is a pause of 2-3 seconds** for no readily identifiable reason\n6. I actually get the science \u0022deposited in my account\u0022\n    - This is the step that *\u003Cu\u003Eactually matters\u003C/u\u003E*.  This is where the science is actually transferred out of the lab.\n\nThat step #5 has bitten me several times.  Because what I typically do is,\n\n- Switch to the MPL so I can clean out the science\n- Impatiently wait a loooong time until it\u0027s finished transmitting\n- I see the \u0022Done!\u0022 notification\n- I immediately (without waiting, \u0027coz I\u0027m impatient by this time) switch back to KSC\n- \u0022Hey, where\u0027s my science?!\u0022\n\nAnd what happened here:  I switched away from the lab **immediately when I saw the \u0022done\u0022 notification** (i.e. at step #4), and I didn\u0027t wait a few seconds (step #5), and thereby switched away before step #6, which is the step that really counts.\n\nThe good news is that the science isn\u0027t lost; the only thing that\u0027s wasted is my time, and the electricity it consumed while trying to transmit.  If I go back to the science lab, the science is still sitting there, waiting to be transmitted, so I can go through the rigamarole again, only more patiently.\n\nNo idea if that\u0027s the thing that\u0027s biting the various posters on this thread, but I\u0027ve been bitten by it *\u003Cu\u003Erepeatedly\u003C/u\u003E* (despite knowing about the problem!), so it wouldn\u0027t be surprising if it\u0027s responsible for at least some of the woes I\u0027m reading about here.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T18:23:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"battlekruiser","CreatedById":158966,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T14:19:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 20.02.2016 at 0:22 PM, battlekruiser said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have similar problem.
