Meanwhile we do perceive sound waves from beyond corners and make a clean picture where they come from. Our ears are point receivers, and sound waves come from a, roughly, semi-sphere. But our brain can transform it into a picture, guess the distance and even understand what happens beyond the corner. You also can have a picture of where the sound was moving in 3D (like you can close you eyes and still understand where the speaker turned their head when talking). And I guess if light could bend around corners better, we\u0027d perfectly understand that and have an anequate mind picture of 3D space, even though our eyes have a 2D image. So if you could have similar mediums in a 2-d environment, you\u0027d be able to have a 2d picture of the surroundings, and 2D side shooter is a good representation of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T17:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyes.. wolfenstein3D had a 3D view but internaly, all the calculations was 2D... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame is mostly true for doom.

A 2D world from a 2D perspective would be that, just expand it horizontally so it takes up the whole image. This is because the 2D creature wouldn\u0027t be able to see in 2D: it only sees in 1D (line, that\u0027s its entire FoV). We as 3D beings, can only see in 2D. Yes, we \u0022experience\u0022 it in 3D but the depth we perceive visually is only because of our 2 eyes. Like a modern television can\u0027t truly display 3d images.
