The slow diminishing return eventually meant that sending the same report over and over would eventually render 0 gains...this made sense, even if it allowed for manned missions to repeat a lot of data and then bring back physical data as well and get credit for all of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the current 180 on this, rendering science equipment inoperable after transmission unless you reset your science systems at a Science Lab is not well thought out. Especially since the Science Lab itself is an 11 ton piece of equipment thats not exactly easy to get into orbit with other fundamental payload additions to something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe early tech tree of KSP depends heavily on sending probes to Duna and Dres and Jool (if you can squeeze enough fuel into a rocket to get it done...some people can, some people can\u0027t, everyone plays KSP their own way) after having completed manned missions to Minmus and the Mun. Its simply the only thing you can do because you cannot throw enough manned mass to Duna...much less Dres or Jool and expect to get there, aerobrake through orbit and eventually land AND return with the data. Its a simple impossibility for most average players....and I\u0027d consider myself fairly average.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo probes were my way to reach my next level of manned missions. I\u0027d send probes to Duna and Dres and sometimes Jool though I\u0027d usually run out of fuel before I could get into a stable orbit at Jool, but at least Duna and Ike and Dres would yield enough science return for me to make up for my technical deficiencies and then begin building up for manned missions to each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this isn\u0027t to say that I can\u0027t send several missions to Duna and Ike to get the data I need...but thats onerously repetitive simply to get data that one good probe was able to get in 0.22, and unlike some superstars....I simply do not possess the engineering skill, nor am I a physicist nor a mathematician so calculating how to design a rocket with mixed tier 3 and 4 parts that can lift a multiprobe payload into orbit and get them all the way to the target is a huge endeavor and believe me I\u0027ve tried several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just recently completed a multiprobe design that did get to Duna...only problem is 4 probes was about the most I could lift with the tech I have, and 4 probes yielded about half the science of one probe in 0.22...also once used these probes become completely worthless because there really isn\u0027t anything they can do beyond their one shot landing and comm burst. Thats it. So I\u0027m basically throwing away a lot of tech just to make a very minimal gain in tech in return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think the diminishing returns system was good enough, cause not only is this really retarding my technical progression, its also making using probes and communications next to worthless because not only do you only get the one shot from the science equipment on board the probe, you\u0027re getting 30/60% of the worth of the data if you could simply bring it home and....sorry but I don\u0027t know of any probe design that can land on Duna, take back off and reach escape velocity and return to Kerbin. I simply cannot engineer a probe that can do this and keep the probe small enough to not need immense amounts of LFO...which simply adds more weight which kills my TWR from KSC even more regardless of how well designed my rockets are....theres only so much you can do with 1.25m parts as an average player (don\u0027t get me wrong...I know there are some seriously insanely good players that can probably go everywhere on 1.25m parts..but I\u0027m not one of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in summary:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Inoperability after transmission devalues the time and effort in even trying to reach a destination and send data. I mean what if I have enough fuel on one probe to hop to a couple biomes? What then? I can\u0027t take new science readings without transmitting the original readings, so....its basically a long drawn out project simply to spend a minute and a half doing a couple interactions on the planets surface then...thats it, nothing else to do, probes dead, head back to the Space Center and kill it like the debris it is I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) If transmitting data must require inoperability. Then data transmission should not have a degraded level of return in comparison to physical return, base rate for any scientific data gained should be 100%, physical return of data should get a bonus...especially if equipment is going to be basically rendered useless after one set of tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that some people felt the tech tree was \u0022too easy\u0022 in 0.22, but this stuff is eventually going to start costing credits/kerbal shekels/resources, its not going to be economically feasible to spend 4 probes doing something that one probe could do if it was only allowed to operate like a real space probe. Its not like WMAP sent back one MRB image and then was completely incapable of doing anything else. We just don\u0027t design satellites like that in real life...its far to expensive to launch even a 2 ton payload under the considerations of it being a one time use apparatus. So this really needs some thought. The \u0022science spam\u0022 in 0.22 was probably not in line with challenging the hardcore KSP player, I\u0027ll more than happily agree with that, especially after looking over Abyssal Lurker\u0027s video montage...but Abyssal Lurker isn\u0027t the average KSP player either. Making communications worthless in comparison to manned missions puts a serious difficulty cliff to climb for players working with tier 3 parts that have already exhausted their near Kerbin opportunities which is also far easier to do now because the only reports that matter are the very first reports made. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E(Not to mention the fact that it makes excellent mods like Remote Tech 2 kinda pointless busy work since setting up a satellite network has very little point if you\u0027re simply going to avoid using communications at all to maximize your science potentials)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Even if you got every biome of Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus you\u0027d still be fairly challenged to step up to the next level without probes first, and even then...getting EVERY biome would require you to literally spam Kerbals at the Mun and Minmus in a rapid fire line of launches simply to achieve it at least 30 launches just off the top of my head, to get all the Kerbin system biome data and..of course, return it all....which is, once again, not something thats going to be feasibly in line with a KSP that is eventually going to have resource costs attached to part usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay I\u0027ve belabored that point long enough. Overall it needs rethought. Communications are the backbone of any space program, and unmanned missions are far more common than manned missions. We haven\u0027t sent a man outside LEO in over 50 years after all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Equipment....It Doesn\u0027t Make Sense\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I\u0027m just going to focus on Science Jr. here and the Goo pods mostly but....early in the tech tree they\u0027re fine. But in my sandbox game I\u0027m finding myself staring at them going....so why exactly do I need to attach these things to my 11 ton lander?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple math here would kinda indicate to me that these parts should become redundant and integrated into command modules that you achieve later in the tech tree. A Mark 2 Lander Can should not need to have a Science Jr. attached to the top of it to do science...its ridiculous cause effectively anything the science module is doing should be contained in the lander can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a much shorter suggestion/complaint that my previous one but as much as I\u0027m enjoying KSP after 0.22 (I got kinda bored with it since it had no progressive goals previous to that, and you can only launch so many insane rockets into space before it becomes kind of yesterdays news and having no reason to actually go to other planets previous to 0.22 other than to figuratively get a t-shirt didn\u0027t really entice me to bother) these science parts are literally ridiculous once you start dealing with 2.5m parts. They\u0027re just inane and unnecessary weight that should have been 1) superceded by a better part for the 2.5m design. Or 2.) Been integrated into 2.5m capsules and command modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean what point do 2.5m command modules have other than to have more space? Obviously they have more space because they weigh a lot more, and obviously internalizing this testing equipment would be a logical step when increasing technical capabilities from the 1.25m design schema to the 2.5m designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in short, science is making my rockets look stupid, and my landers look even stupider. It doesn\u0027t make sense that my 1.25m landers are now 3 meters taller by default because of the 2m science part...and the fact that I\u0027m needing to use FLT-400 tanks, rather than FLT-200 tanks, to adjust for the weight increase as well. My 1.25m landers don\u0027t look so much like landers as they end up looking like stubby fat pencils. My 2.5m landers are hilarious because regardless of anything....the lander can or command module. has to wear a Science Jr. Hat..cause its the only way to do it that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, it would be nice if these science parts evolved a bit more through the tiers and, eventually became integrated as stock functionality in the heavy command modules because...seriously we\u0027re already throwing enough weight up into the atmosphere in that regard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah...thats my first post and I\u0027m not saying I am right and this must be done my way....I\u0027m just saying this is how I feel about KSP 0.23...I like it of course, but career mode is getting fairly frustrating. Cause as \u0022cheaty\u0022 as being able to send multiple communication reports and return physical data might have seemed....simple facts are it was a lot less easy than simply opening your persistance.sfs file and changing your sci value to 20000 or something. So in short...some of us felt like we were actually achieving something in KSP in 0.22, and now in 0.23, I feel like all I\u0027m achieving is relaunching the same mission over and over and simply changing the orbit inclination a bit to land in a different place....its kinda boring, imho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Styrr","CreatedById":98389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T09:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi ZeroTolerance,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere is a post adressing the issues you mention in \u003Cstrong\u003EInoperability and Diminishing Returns for Science Transmission\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62786-A-change-in-how-science-works-in-relation-to-transmitting-and-returning\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62786-A-change-in-how-science-works-in-relation-to-transmitting-and-returning\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with both your main points.

Though, in my opinion probe missions are not significantly easier to do in KSP (especially with RemoteTech2). Since we don\u0027t have to cope with radiation, food/oxygen supply, isolation etc. for our Kerbals, there is nothing that makes a manned mission or a haul back more difficult besides to bring with you a little more deltav for return. So it\u0027s a players decission to do unmanned first to have a realistic storyline. This is perfect for sandbox mode.

E.g I can do 1 probed and 1 manned mission to get the same science as for the manned mission solely. So why bother with probes?

You can land a probe on Duna for LESS dV than you can land on Mun, simply because of aerobraking. You can also get to Jool and do flybys (which is all a probe needs to do) of all those moons for less dV than landing on Mun.

If you play like this then this update seems to make it far too hard. Getting back alive from the Mun or minus is in fact fairly easy as they have no atmo and very little gravity.

I would NOT like to see a return to 100% transmissions or even 50% really for one simple reason.
