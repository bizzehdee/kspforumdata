I use Kethane as the only usable fuel for the LV-N, but it is still convertable into the stock fuels. I learned a bit about fuel usage - as I had to adept the volume and masses of Kethane and its tanks to be equal to what stock LF/O would give in terms of dV - but ultimately it was not as much fun as I expected, although the thought of having more than four different fuels and one/some special ressources (especially for the LV-N) still dances around my brain cells. So I will just drop some of it in here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine having kerosene for jet engines, LF/O for rockets and being hydrogen and oxygen, monopropellant being whatever it wants to be, and then some special fuels for ion engines and LV-Ns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen and oxygen could be found in various places and are readily available on Kerbin/in VAB, as would kerosene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-Ns might come in two variants, one using hydrogen and a fissionable element.

It may just be me, but it seems like you are wanting to make this a lot more difficult than it had to be. Why try to create something from scratch when we can build on what\u0027s there? Also, I agree, people will want 50 different things, and to be clear, what route do you intend to go with these resources, more realistic, or more, ehh I guess imaginative. If you want more realistic, then yes that would be way more involved. If the other route, we can build and refine on 2 popular mods already in use. I also see resources as a late game added objective instead of a have to thing like C\u0026amp;C or any other rts. This is solely my .02 and may be completely different than what direction you where leaning to, so bear that in mind and no disrespect on my end. Resources shouldn\u0027t be a grind, you shouldn\u0027t have to start the game and have to start up an oil rig to process your jet fuel...no thanks. Resources as an objective should be for rare fuels for end game travels (career mode) or future tech (sandbox). Again, if you want more realistic, you would probably need to start from scratch, if you want to go the other route, we already have a very nice foundation to build from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
