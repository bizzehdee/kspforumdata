This mod would allow two players to interact with the same craft at the same time. Both of them in IVA mode.\n\n Imagine having two of three seats in a Mk1-2 occupied by a live pilot and commander. \n\nThey communicate with each other and handle different tasks. The commander can stage and fly during launch using the console buttons and MFDs.\n\nThe pilot can handle transposition and docking. He\u0027d also become the pilot for landings. Just imagine the voice chatter and feeling of immersion this would bring. Calling out rates of descent, remaining fuel, etc.\n\nWho else would like something like this? Is it even possible?\n\nIf it\u0027s possible I\u0027d be willing to pay Triple-A new release money for it."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T10:12:36Z","Content":"It would be direful. Unless IVA is redone. For example, you can move around, manage life support, and, most importantly, you can see out from the pod windows properly, witouth double-clicking on them."}]}
