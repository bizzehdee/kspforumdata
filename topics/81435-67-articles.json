Anyways, I also thought of the \u0027cliche\u0027d \u0022Capture The Flag\u0022 in 2 separate types. 1 flag, or whoever gets the other team\u0027s flag first, but that would require that vehicles move a certain distance (like tanks only move 60 meters foward or whatever) during a turn so that the first faction can\u0027t win on first turn. That is, unless there\u0027s already a limit to mobility. As opposed to setting battles on the surface of planets, space battles would be difficult to establish...not that I\u0027d spend much effort as the rulemaker for anything such as space battles...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027d appreciate if I can test my assets with someone else, not going to beg, but I\u0027d appreciate some testing and perhaps some fun! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T21:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ejudedude13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ejudedude13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI really don\u0027t know how to build a ship like Macey dean with low part count.

Macey Dean constructed ships before many of the weapons and armor technologies we use now were discovered, so newer ships tend to have higher part counts. As an example, guided missiles like Zekes\u0027 drek missiles have pretty high part counts (25 ish) compared to a simple SRB with a decoupler and a docking port for only 3 parts.

A long cylinder or diamond shape won\u0027t be the best at defense but it is easier to build and lower part count than a more complicated design. As an example, my (not very good) battleship from 0.24 had fewer than 500 parts, which is pretty low for a 114 ton ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VWCfNKP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VWCfNKP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ejudedude13","CreatedById":125297,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T03:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sdj64\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sdj64\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow low is low part count?

Thanks sdj. Also, im looking at under 500 cuz most other computers probably cant handle more than 500, even though the game can run with some lag, like 20 fps, on my computer under 1000. More than that, its aound 10 fps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ejudedude13","CreatedById":125297,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T06:15:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NuBKw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
