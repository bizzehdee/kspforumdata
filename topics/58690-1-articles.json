The main components of every stage fly back to KSC for reuse and it carries 3 kerbals to LKO with no trouble.

Just be careful and start the gravity turn early so that you don\u0027t have to steer too far away from the prograde marker. It turns easiest in yaw, so if it gets a bit difficult to control, just roll it a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: Once you reach orbit, enable roll control on either the small control surfaces or the canards. For some reason the game makes them work in reverse during the first stage flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately you can\u0027t fly the first stage back AND get the rest to orbit, but it is capable. Maybe you could do this when they add multiplayer. Or you can write a kOS script and change the unload distance. I would love it if someone made a video of that!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T02:12:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a falcon equivalent that can make orbit and still land the first stage, but it requires stupidly good timing.
