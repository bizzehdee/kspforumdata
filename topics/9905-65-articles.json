You can kinda guess at where a \u0027close\u0027 button would be in the upper right of each interface, but yeah, they don\u0027t display properly on Mac. And I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s related or not, but now I can\u0027t use the drop down menu on Blizzy\u0027s toolbar.

And that\u0027s just happened since installing Lazor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this might not be a bug, but apparently the cruise missiles require a line of sight to their targets? Several times now I\u0027ve tried launching one from the KSC runway to a target on the island runway. The targeting sequence works fine and the missile (launched vertically), flies to about 1200m, levels out and tries to fly on a bee-line to the target. And because of the curvature of the planet and/or an inability to stay above the terrain/water, it ends up crashing into the surface of the ocean between KSC and the island. Again, this might be intended/a limitation of the system at the moment, but I thought it was unusual for what\u0027s supposed to be a long-range weapon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, it\u0027s great to see this being updated and it\u0027s lots of fun to play with.
