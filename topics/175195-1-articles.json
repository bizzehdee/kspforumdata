I was wondering if people here would like to sign up for a multiplayer game. Seven people may play, with myself being the game master.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nIn order to join this diplomacy game, you must know how to play or at least own a Diplomacy board. When you want to join up, comment down below which country you want to be. As soon as there are 7 players ready and waiting, I will open a new thread here called, \u00221st Diplomacy Game Active\u0022. You needn\u0027t worry about time frames though. Each round will be played over the space of a day. Just send in your orders and I will play them out on a master board in my house. At the end of the twenty-four hours, I post the positions of all the pieces to be correlated to the pieces on your board.\u00A0\u00A0I will also set up a Diplomacy chat here as soon as people join up for communication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\nJust as a note, my time is 7 hours ahead of eastern time.
