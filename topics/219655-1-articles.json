If you can handle low frame rates and some bugs when doing complex missions, then maybe yes. I have played KSP2 and see it as a fun game with potential. So, if you are the second type of people, or willing to see the game getting better, I would recommend you to buy the game, ideally during a sale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is indeed a refund period of 2 hours, but I have heard some people unable to refund, so consider about yourself before deciding whether to buy it.
