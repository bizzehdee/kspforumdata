MINIMUM size of the drone should be (excluding engine) 1m highx1m width/depth. The Stayputnik core may not be suitable as once it runs out of power it\u0027s dead.\n\n- Missile must launch from the KSC vertical launch pad.\n\n- Use of MechJeb for terminal guidance recommended.\n\n- Missile should be out of propellant by the time it leaves the atmosphere. RCS system may be used for attitude and minor course corrections during ballistic phase.\n\n- Mission success or failure is a binary condition. ANY structural damage caused to the drone by the missile counts as a kill.\n\nChallenger\u0027s note: I actually did this accidentally while launching a survey satellite, I intended to place it in a low orbit but ended up running out of fuel following a pitiful boost burn, going ballistic and crossing the path of one of my anchorages - plowing right through the centre of an OKEB-500 solar blanket and kicking the anchorage into an atmosphere-skimming death orbit."}]}
