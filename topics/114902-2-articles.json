I\u0027ll track down the problem and release another update later today.\n\nIn the meantime, you can edit the config file manually to make the settings stick. It\u0027s under GameData\\PartCommander\\PartCommander.cfg, and by default will look like this:\n\n    Settings{    useStockToolbar = True    enableHotKey = True    hotKey = P    hideUnAct = False}\n\nYou can turn the options on and off by setting them to \u0022True\u0022 or \u0022False\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:40:42Z","Content":"Thanks, manually setting them has worked ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"seanmcdougall","CreatedById":143691,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T21:21:18Z","Content":"Version 1.0.2.2 is now up which fixes the issue with persistent settings.
