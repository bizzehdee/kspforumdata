For example, you ha a satellite with relay antennas on Duna, and you are going to Eve, if you don\u0027t have direct line of sight from Eve to Kerbin, your signal can be raleyed from Kerbin to Dune to Eve (if range and line of sight permits).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember ir your lander also need to have a relay antenna.
