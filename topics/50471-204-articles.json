Then, in the RSS Config I just add a new planet line. It lets me make the planet\u0027s name correct (so Sedna says Sedna, not Eeloo), and I use as-accurate-as-possible data for all of the physical and orbital statistics. You can do planets or moons with this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace Engine is seriously brilliant. I discovered it planning to use the procedural textures for stock KSP packs but then I discovered how MUCH of our solar system is in there. Hundreds of asteroids, comets, KBOs, Scattered Disk objects, and both Sednoids. All of them have textures, and although they don\u0027t know what many KBOs look like, they are as accurate as possible (e.g. Sedna is very red, almost as much as Mars, as it is expected to be). Just look at this list \u003Ca href=\u0022http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html\u003C/a\u003E. Basically, the limit is my computer\u0027s memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, Sedna works, although the orbit extends past the zoom limit so you have to angle your view to see the whole orbit. I had Eris and Dysnomia working properly but once I added Sedna it messed with their textures so I need to work that out (I may know the problem but I can\u0027t test it yet). I suspect typos are the issue, as usual. I\u0027m really really excited about being able to send missions to all the new stuff.... There are SO MANY OBJECTS in the Kuiper belt, and some of them have moons big enough to be spherical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know the limit of planet creation yet, as in, how many can be in there with Kopernicus before memory takes a drastic hit. I also don\u0027t know if there are size limits (imagine having Comet 67P and having to get orbit around it, where orbital velocity is 1 m/s. ). There may be because when I tried to land on Deimos in RSS it devoured (literally) my ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pozine","CreatedById":134382,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T00:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I managed to get ceres ingame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Sedna, there may be a way to edit camera settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea how to make planets not spherical?
