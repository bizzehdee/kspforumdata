Have no idea how to start in Career Mode. \n\n2. Are crawling around the KSC, scrabbling for science points in its different biomes. \n\n3. Trying to build aircraft to fly somewhere on Kerbin to do a visual report or something.\n\nI spent a couple of hours putting together, what I hope is, a useful guide to some of these people on how to go about the early stages of Career Mode.\n\nIt is not *the* ***right*** way to go about it. There is **no** right way in KSP. That is the beauty of the game. The way is ***your*** way. If you want to scrabble around the KSC, good for you. If you like building aeroplanes, fabulous. This is just some suggestions on how you might want to go if those options don\u0027t appeal.\n\nShould this be of any use to people, I will sit down next weekend and do a 2nd part. Part 1 takes you up to the first sub-orbital flight and upgrading the VAB.\n\nI hope this is of use to someone. Constructive criticism welcomed.
