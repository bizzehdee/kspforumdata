I am really looking forward to some more mechanics in the future.\n\nI am very torn with the idea of mining to sustain a colony, it feels wrong to rob a moon or a planet of its natural resources, because they are finite. It is the age old dilemma of running out of finite resources, which puts me off with most life support mods. Realistically Kerbals should thrive to achieve the same level of self-sustainability humans have been mainly dreaming of and that is infinite recycling of resources and infinite sustainability.\n\nObviously a far out goal, but it just feels like the right direction.
