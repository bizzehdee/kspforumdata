So build I did. It fits two kerbals inside the cockpit and has a surprising level of detail.\n\nI was following an image from the return of the Jedi, the battle on Endor so its modeled on the classic look of the AT-ST. I made one \u0027stowed\u0027 standing version and one in a different pose.\n\nAs it turned out the way I built it made it very tricky to move into another position..\n\nSo it does nothing other than look awesome. And that\u0027s ok with me!\n\n![11ltt6t.jpg](http://i62.tinypic.com/11ltt6t.jpg)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/pEWs8/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n![XAyTyin.gif](http://i.imgur.com/XAyTyin.gif)\n\n[**DOWNLOAD STATIC POSE**](http://www./download/ne393813144ip91/AT-ST\u002Bstatic.craft)\n\n[**DOWNLOAD MOVING POSE**](http://www./download/bof9otdzr4c9gc7/AT-ST\u002Bmoving.craft)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-29T03:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/29/2015 03:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim**"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T00:38:07Z","Content":"I literally have no words.
