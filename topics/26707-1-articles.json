It\u0027s the exact same idea as transfer between planets, only at much smaller scale, the transfer window happens much more often, the delta-V is a lot lower and the trip is a lot faster. From Mun to Minmus is a lot like from Kerbin to the superior planets, going from Minmus is to Mun is similiar to going to the inferior planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow then, once you got your feet wet let\u0027s have a look at our options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Atmosphere - going to other planets is a matter of time and delta-V. In a lot of ways to settle into an orbit around another planet is very similar to docking, you basically have to match its speed around Kerbol if you want to go into orbit. Now out in space there\u0027s only three things that can slow you down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003Erockets\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Esurface of the planet - lithobraking\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ethe atmosphere of the planet, if present\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the lower the delta-V requirement the easier it is to design the ship I would recommend first trip to be a low delta-V one. And since it\u0027s not really practical to design a craft that can survive slamming into a rocky surface at interplanetary speeds and survive that means you want to target a world with atmosphere. That narrows the range down to Duna, Ike and Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI won\u0027t recommend Jool for a first trip, mainly due to delta-V and the fact that you generally don\u0027t go to Jool because you want to visit Jool, you go there to visit one or more of its moons. The mission complexity involved in visiting one or more moons make the Jool trip more suitable for a later mission once you have a good grasp of interplanetary travel and gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that leaves Eve and Duna, both make good targets for a first trip. It comes down to what you want to do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a manned landing and return mission, go to Duna. Returning from the surface of Eve is probably the most difficult thing to do in the game and require a total mastery of rocket design. Duna on the other hand is very easy to get back from owning to it\u0027s low gravity and thin atmosphere. In fact even at Duna\u0027s sea level LV-N nuke engine has higher Isp than chemical rockets so you can simply use your interplanetary engine for landing and take off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a probe landing mission then consider going to Eve. Eve\u0027s dense atmosphere means parachutes are super effective and landing is often a simple matter of opening the parachutes and twiddle your thumb waiting for the touch down. In contrast Duna\u0027s thin atmosphere requires powered landing, though it\u0027s still fairly easy compared to airless landings. Eve is also excellent rover driving country due to improved solar panel output during the day and much better wheel traction due to high gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re visiting the moons then it\u0027s a toss up. Gilly is very hard to reach due to its tiny SOI and require something like 1800m/s of delta-V from LEO. However once you\u0027re in Gilly orbit the fun begins. Being the world with lowest gravity in the game you can do all sorts of trippy things at Gilly like EVA only landing and take off, balancing your landed spacecraft at all kinds of bizarre angles like on one landing legs or on the nose and use ASAS to overpower Gilly\u0027s feeble gravity and keep it in that unstable position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke on the other hand is very easy to reach. In fact Ike has the largest SOI to semi-major axis ratio in the whole game, it\u0027s SOI is so huge that Ike act as an \u0022orbital bulldozer\u0022 and perturbs a very wide region around Duna slinging satellites in all directions, you actually have to go to pretty low or very high orbit around Duna to dodge Ike. On the other hand aside from its tiny moonlet known as \u0022Magic Boulder\u0022 Ike is very Mun like in surface feature and not a very interesting place to visit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-14T01:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EndOfTheEarth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EndOfTheEarth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you\u0027re looking for an easy landing after an interplanetary flight, your best bet is probably Ike.\u003Cp\u003EIke has roughly the same surface gravity as the moon, and sits in a conveniently circular orbit about Duna.
