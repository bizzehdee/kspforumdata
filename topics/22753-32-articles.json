Turns out it works well with a probe core attached at the end, but you need to switch to tracking station after each docking. In general, avoid doing that unless you must (like during assembling the Truss).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally what I was referring to was that the actual arm has a \u0022Latching End Effector\u0022 on each end, while the BobCat/Romfarer version has an LEE on one end and a permanent mounting point on the other. Like I mentioned before, Romfarer and BobCat were originally going to include the track/cart system that allows the canadarm2 to move loads along the length of the trusses with relative ease. I can only assume that when Romfarer was picked up by Squad, he had to make the choice to cut his work on the Robotic Arms Pack short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a follow-up to what I said before... it would actually have been more complicated to make the Canadarm2 \u0022walkable\u0022 than I might have implied. For it to work one way, it would have to be independently controllable (a probe core, basically) and made up of at least two parts, with a docking point at each end. Then a corresponding docking point would be have to placed at every spot where a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Grapple_fixture_on_PMA2.jpg/220px-Grapple_fixture_on_PMA2.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egrapple fixture\u003C/a\u003E should be (you can see them on some of the modules included in the pack already, but they are only for aesthetics.) The other way would be to allow the arm to make multiple \u0022magnetic\u0022 connections (one at each end). I have never so much as glanced at the code for arms, so I can\u0027t say how feasible this would be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yogui87","CreatedById":23865,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-25T07:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince Devo left the project, I took up the cupola and probably all his planed parts.
