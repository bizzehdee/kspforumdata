Right now it adds extra tweakables to the stock fairings for number of pieces and ejection force.\n\n**Remote Tech** overhauls the antenna system to require Line of Sight and have the antennae be in range of each other. Unmanned craft won\u0027t fly without a connection to the KSC, which you get to provide by building satellite networks to bounce the signal. Mod makers are still working on this one, but the latest Dev Build is playable despite one or two bugs.\n\n**USI Life Support** is RoverDude\u0027s Life Supprt Mod.
