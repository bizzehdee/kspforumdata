When I started this mission it was in the midst of launching about 10 interplanetary mapping satellites and lander probes for distant planets. I used the same lifter for Jebs hastily made lander and literally have enough delta v to go just about anywhere.

And technically this is what you did today in KSP so it\u0027s fine !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally started planning about how best to bring all my station pieces from Kerbin to Jool and beyond (we all know bigger Kerbol system is coming one day, and I want to be ready by then). So far I thought of 3 options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1- Make a 4 engine \u0022future ion\u0022 tractor, using a derivative of the hybrid-ion pack I have adjusted to my liking, and pull the entire (unassembled) station with all of the pieces docked behind me. Might have 4 \u0022Pylons\u0022 to split the weight around and make it less of a snake... then again in space it\u0027s not that important, but I feel a too long craft wont be able to turn at all, making maneuvers very hard. The tractor design is mostly on paper (blueprint stage), but so far this is the one I am the most leaning towards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2- Make a lot of small launches in quick succession, and assemble the whole lot once there. The drawback is a lot of lost time and fuel with all the rendez-vous required. On the good side, if we still don\u0027t have unity 5 by then and less lag from superships, this might be a good alternative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3- That one I\u0027ve never tested, But there was a mod for mining metals and building ships in space or on moons. I believe I\u0027ve seen it on 5th Horseman\u0027s channel, but it was buggy as hell back then. Anyways with that option, I only have to send a mining rig, a Kethane rig, and the first crewed \u0022worker\u0027s\u0022 ship, and I can make all I need on spot, saving a lot of logistic nightmares from #2, or lots of preparation/dockings in LKO from #1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would test that build around Pol (my favorite Joolian moon), in prevision for the next gaseous planets of KSP... Waiting patiently of the Uranus analogue... I guess I should take pictures if I should ever go ahead with it and make a story like Bronto\u0027s (shorter most likely, but who knows).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T08:11:05Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 08:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Francois424\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T08:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally figured out a trajectory to get the U.K.S. \u003Cem\u003EEquinox\u003C/em\u003E (which is stuck in the inner Joolean system with 1500m/s in the tank) back to Kerbin.
