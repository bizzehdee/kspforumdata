Only problem i have:\n\nThe Navball wont show up. Its just black. I use the following mods:\n\nASET Probs, Docking Port Alignment Indicator, Fusebox, Kerbal Alarm Clock, KAS and KIS, Kerbulator, kOS, Mechjeb, MK1-2 IVA Replacement (of course), Module Manager, RasterPropMonitor, RasterPropMonitor Core, SCANsat, Toolbar, Vessel Viewer.\n\nThanks for help. I really want to test this baby in flight. But i must say. My flight skills are not so great that i can maneuver without it.\n\n![jeU6y.png](http://puu.sh/jeU6y.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"nukeboyt","CreatedById":68397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:24:01Z","Content":"Check to see if you\u0027re using the latest version of RPM.

VesselView and NavUtilities are still 1.0.2, so you shouldn\u0027t off the bat expect them to play nice, VesselView does, but NavUtilities doesn\u0027t yet have a tab to be selected on in the new MFD\u0027s (to my knowledge).\n\nBut, everything still loads up and is perfectly functional, so either 1) you\u0027ve installed wrong, or 2) I noticed VesselView has multiple types, unless you\u0027ve got Toolbar installed as well you must download and install the RPM version only of VesselView.\n\nEDIT: But if, as you say nothing is working, then that sounds a lot more like an installation blunder than a problem with VesselView."},{"CreatedByName":"masterdies","CreatedById":20349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T12:55:53Z","Content":"So i tried again.
