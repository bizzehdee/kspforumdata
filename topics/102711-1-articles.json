I collected and consolidated many scraps of ideas on my computer, and I felt I\u0027m just about ready to share it with everyone for giggles.\n\nAs such, without further ado, I present to you...\n\n**sumghai\u0027s KSP fanon**\n\nBefore we begin, I\u0027d like to make it absolutely clear that this is *not* official KSP lore - I just felt this particular backstory provides a logical progression for the development of Kerbal spaceflight.\n\nI\u0027ll also emphasize that while the events of my fanon draw parallels with actual Terran (Human) history, I am in no way making any political statements. So if you disagree with how I\u0027ve described a certain aspect of my fanon, that\u0027s fine - just remember to keep your comments civil. And please, no roleplay.\n\nFinally, this is a work-in-progress, but I\u0027ll try to update this first post with completed sections as often as possible.\n\n**1) Who\u0027s Who in the World**\n\nThis list focuses on Kerbals who have made major contributions to their understanding of their universe, as well as pioneers in manned flight and spaceflight.\n\nSpoiler\n\n**Kerman, Bill** (born KY 466) - Kerbalnaut and Confederate Air Force engineer.

Like many other tree species, the trunk as well as the upper branches support clusters of leaves; or in this case, fronds. Internally, the leaf clusters are fed via lateral offshoots of the main vascular bundles running through the trunk, which offshoots are responsible for the attractive dappled finish of leatherbark timber.\n\n*Sweetleaf*\n\nAnother sub-tropical species, not dissimilar to the Terran palm tree but with curled, serpentine, aromatic leaves. Until quite recently, conventional wisdom held that leatherbark and sweetleaf trees shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be planted in close proximity, due to the very different soil biota needed to support each species. This view has only been conclusively overturned within the last three kerbal generations.\n\n*Bottlebrush*\n\nEvergreen species found in the northern reaches of Kerbin, bottlebrush trees have a tall straight trunks, the upper fifth of which supports a profusion of slender, needle bearing side branches. Bottlebrush trees provide excellent straight grained timber that is exported throughout Kerbin.\n\nWeeds\n\n*Star poppies*\n\nLarge red, five petaled flowers, tend to grow in clumps\n\n*Rustbells*\n\nSmall, orange trumpet shaped flowers, somewhat like a Terran daffodil but without the ring of petals.\n\n*Cornshakes*\n\nGrow in dense patches, particularly in forested areas. Small sky blue flowers that are actually rather attractive but their extensive shallow but tough root networks will foul most agricultural implements.\n\n*Yellowjackets.*\n\nSymbiotes of the cornshakes that tap into their root networks. Exude a sweet, almost sickly scent that is particularly attractive to many species of insect.\n\n*Hookwort.*\n\nAggressive climbing creeper that, given the chance, will colonise and choke off most other plant species.\n\n*Knotweed*\n\nStringy green, low growing fibrous mats\n\n*Damsonwire*\n\nRelated to knotweed but with tougher, thinner and more dispersed fibres. Actively cultivated in some parts of Kerbin as a pleasant tasting and durable, natural dental floss.\n\n*Kerblets fingers*\n\nEdible weed, somewhat akin to Terran shepherd\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s purse but with segmented tubular seed pods rather than heart shaped.\n\n*Gingergrass*\n\nLong, flat bladed grass species that is prized for it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s flavour but cursed for its tenacity and speed of growth.\n\n*Broadweed*\n\nSlender green stems supporting whorls of pentagonal leaves at regular intervals and topped with a cluster of small white flowers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T13:00:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 01:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T20:28:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As promised, some additions for the flora section, focusing on trees and weeds.\n\nExcellent!
