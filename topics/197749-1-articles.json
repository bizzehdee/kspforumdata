Long ago, you see, the Daily Kerbal was, in fact, daily. Modding Mondays, Devnote Tuesdays, Video Wednesdays, Twitch Thursdays, and FanWork Fridays. The community was a bit busier back then, and the game was very publicly moving through development quick, but it still must have been a lot of work to have something to show off every day. As for what happened to them, my guess is showing off something new every week got a bit less feasible as things quieted down. There\u0027s still loads to show, but perhaps not loads of people who would get excited by it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, thanks. Because of this post, I scrolled back through the kerbaldevteam tumblr and experienced a bit of a reminder of what it was like back then.

I think I wish it had gotten a second pass rather than just being scrapped, but it might have been too incongruous with the parts we were using anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-10-28T08:24:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2020 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by RyanRising\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
