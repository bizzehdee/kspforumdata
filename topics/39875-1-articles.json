Design. Give it a wide stance and a low center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Turning on SAS, especially if you add an SAS (some still labeled as ASAS) module for extra torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Only make significant turns at low speeds. Have rear wheel steering ON for this to tighten turn radius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Only use high speed to cover long distances in a straight line. At most, just barely tap the A and D keys to tweak heading slightly. Helps to have CapLocks on for fine control and be sure rear wheel steering is OFF.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Don\u0027t hit bumps at high speed unless you\u0027re comfortable catching big air. Low, wide rovers with SAS on can usually stay upright if the bump isn\u0027t too severe but even they might get damaged when they come down. So the bumpier the terrain, the slower you need to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. DO NOT USE THE BRAKES EXCEPT AT LOW SPEED. Brakes at high speed will usually make you somersault unless you\u0027re VERY careful with short taps on B, and doing that doesn\u0027t slow you down very fast. The best way to slow down safely is to hold down reverse (S key), which has no tendency to flip you, then only apply brakes once below 5m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. DO NOT GO STRAIGHT DOWN STEEP HILLS. Most rovers can climb steeper hills than they can descend safely. If the hill isn\u0027t TOO steep, you might be able to come down using reverse constantly to keep your speed reasonably low, but this isn\u0027t guaranteed. So usually it\u0027s better to drive almost parallel to the contour lines across the hillside. This takes you well out of your way but better to get there late than not at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s usually a good idea to set up 2 custom action groups for every rover. But the brakes on one of these, which creates a parking brake. When you trigger this key, the brakes stay on forever, until you hit the key again. Keeps the rover from rolling off when you EVA. The other custom action group should toggle the steering on the rear wheels (and maybe the power on the front wheels, but this isn\u0027t really necessary). That way, it\u0027s easy to switch back and forth as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T16:12:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother tip is to retoggle the controls for the rovers, since WASD also control the torque making you roll easier.
