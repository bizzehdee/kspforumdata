It does depend somewhat on how you actually like to play KSP.\n\nFirstly manned missions do return a chunk more science, provided you have a couple of key building upgrades. If you cant surface sample then theres no point sending kerbals to my mind, it just means a return visit, if you cant even EVA then I wouldnt be landing off Kerbin. A probe lander that runs sci-instruments and then returns to kerbin yields a nice reward, just because its a probe doesnt mean you gotta transmit.\n\nManned missions need bigger rockets like you said, which requires pad and vab upgrades. Now I dont know what difficulty you play on, but certainly at the harder settings you never have enough cash for buildings (and even sci is thinner), so my first mun landing is 30 parts (ive usually upped the pad, 18t is tricky). I also cant be dropping half a dozen skippers everytime i wanna go somewhere, those things are expensive. So if you are playing these settings that slow the career trajectory then suddenly probes are the sexiest thing ever.\n\nIt boils down I guess to how many visits you want to make, if you plan to hit every biome with single landings, then yes you gotta go manned, but you also gotta cap out the tree for the grav scanner and good luck doing that before your first mun/min landings without skewing your progress heavily. I personally dont bother hoovering all the sci anymore, we never really needed it all anyway, instead probe landers gather and return the science, manned missions carry only an antenna for footprints, flags and reports. Removing the other sci stuff from manned landers slims those designs down hugely, that may not interest all folks with upgraded buildings and over-design, but some of us love the shoestring scenarios.\n\nFinally, probes are pretty much essential for early departing ballistic transfers. I can have a temp scanning satellite on its way to Duna by day 2 on a high-speed trajectory, sending a manned mission on that transfer would be a massive craft (costing at least 10x the cash) that I likely couldnt even build/orbit for a month. I cant wait for the windows, at any difficulty level I\u0027ve finished the tree before the first optimal window to anywhere and im too impatient to warp that far.

And once the necessary tech is available rovers in combination with a science lab on the lander can speed things up dramatically as it greatly reduces the need for multiple mission to the same planet/moon. \n\nPlanes, spaceplanes and stations/bases on the other hand are indeed completely useless.\n\n\u003E It\u0027s a game, and people play it because it\u0027s interesting, challenging and fun!\n\nWell, that depends I guess. On whether you\u0027re happy with doing things just for the hell of it. I for one expect the game to give me some benefit or reward for doing things, something that I can\u0027t get by other means or not as efficient. \n\nSpending hours buidling a space station? What do I get from it? Oh, I get to look at my creation and pad myself on the shoulder for this achievement! But does it help me progress through the game? No, it doesn\u0027t, hence it serves no purpose other than to suck up precious time.\n\nNow of course I will still build a space station at some point, and a Mun base probably. And I\u0027m currently planing a hugely oversized Duna mission (needing about 5 heavy lift launches). Because I love building stuff and I want to try and do something that at least gives some feeling of realism (which a 1 Kerbal in a Mk1 pod to Duna mission does not) and a bigger challenge. But it would just be so much more fun doing it if you could get something back for your effort other than personal satifaction. I mean that\u0027s how games work, they give you (virtual) rewards for actions you perform. If there is no reward, the motivation suffers and you stop playing the game.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u0027t be so hard to do that. Just add in experiments that need a very long time to complete, so that you have to put a ship in orbit or on a planet for the time it takes to complete. And then make Kerbals suffer in some way from to long living in a small capsule and generally beeing in space for to long so that living modules and regular crew changes would become a necessity. Then rework the tech tree so that you cannot get enough science between Kerbin, Mun and Minmus to get manned missions to other planets. So you would have to send probes ahead to gather some science for unlocking the techs for manned flights.\n\nThe possibilities are there, Squad just has to make use of them.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The career mode does provide incentive for some of these missions at least. It does depend somewhat on how you actually like to play KSP.\n\nLet\u0027s say I most appreciate games that don\u0027t tell me what to do but that still require me to do certain things in order to progress. I never liked mission or campaign based games, but I also never ever play creative mode in games that have it.\n\nI guess KSP science mode pretty much is perfect for me in at its core. It doesn\u0027t tell me what to do but still requires me to do progressively complex missions in order to progress through the game. The problem here is that not all its cool features are needed in order for progress.\n\n\u003E Firstly manned missions do return a chunk more science, provided you have a couple of key building upgrades. If you cant surface sample then theres no point sending kerbals to my mind, it just means a return visit, if you cant even EVA then I wouldnt be landing off Kerbin. A probe lander that runs sci-instruments and then returns to kerbin yields a nice reward, just because its a probe doesnt mean you gotta transmit.\n\nWell, I usually do a mission for each biome, which means I get plenty of opportunity for dooing all the orbital stuff with my manned missions. No need to send an extra probe mission to do that.\n\n\u003E Manned missions need bigger rockets like you said, which requires pad and vab upgrades. Now I dont know what difficulty you play on, but certainly at the harder settings you never have enough cash for buildings (and even sci is thinner), so my first mun landing is 30 parts (ive usually upped the pad, 18t is tricky). I also cant be dropping half a dozen skippers everytime i wanna go somewhere, those things are expensive. So if you are playing these settings that slow the career trajectory then suddenly probes are the sexiest thing ever.\n\nWell, that\u0027s career mode then, which I will never play. If science mode would introduce a budget or other restrictions that force me to slim down my missions to affordable levels I would welcome it. As long as I\u0027m free to do my own missions I\u0027m all for restrictions!\n\n\u003E Finally, probes are pretty much essential for early departing ballistic transfers. I can have a temp scanning satellite on its way to Duna by day 2 on a high-speed trajectory, sending a manned mission on that transfer would be a massive craft (costing at least 10x the cash) that I likely couldnt even build/orbit for a month. I cant wait for the windows, at any difficulty level I\u0027ve finished the tree before the first optimal window to anywhere and im too impatient to warp that far. (even on day 2 ballistic you have to restrain from capping the tree before it arrives)\n\nProblem is, you don\u0027t need that science. You can get enough from Kerbin, Mun and Minmus. So I just wait for transfer windows before I go interplanetary. And by then I also have all the tech needed for that.
