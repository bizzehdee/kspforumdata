It requires too much power to be relevant.I could understand it if it had good dV but I could not see those legendary dV amounts with nozzle either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I still have one more test to do with vista. There can be a relation with reactor rated power and what vista requires. In my example, reactor can produce much more than vista needs.This can be a problem; if load can not meet the demand, extra reactor power may transfer to extra dangerous heat. I need to test vista with smaller reactors, just enough energy generation for vista to use. May be the solution is not more power.

I used insulator to to protect other parts of ship and use extra radiators for vista.

It is no longer a viable engine for anything.\u003Cp\u003EThermal engine seems to be the only option for first stage at this point because i could not cool vista in atmosphere(need to deploy radiators).
