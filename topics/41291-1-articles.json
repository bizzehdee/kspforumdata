So I undock each pod and activated the chutes. But after the other one got 2.5km away, it got deleted. The thing is, it had a kerbal inside it. I thought the deletion thing only applied to debris and such, not to active spacecraft?

What happens to vessels farther than about 2km from your active vessel, they are treated like a single point on its current trajectory(like all the stuff you see in map view).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch \u0022simplified\u0022 trajectories won\u0027t be calculated in atmosphere, as that would require calculating air resistance etc. They are usually simply destroyed upon reaching atmosphere - try by launching two ships to a stable orbit, then lowering the periapsis of one to like 10km about Kerbin surface. If you switch to the other ship, open map view and wait until the other one gets to around 65 km altitude, you will see it disappear, even though it clearly couldn\u0027t have crashed into terrain(at least it happens to me). Even if you create some solid metal cube ship that can somehow survive impact at extreme speeds, so it would not be destroyed if you manually crashed it into a planet, it will still go bye-bye when \u0022simplified\u0022 and below some pre-set altitude \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pod that disappeared wasn\u0027t \u0022another active vessel\u0022, you can only have one active vessel at a time.

Once something gets outside a certain range of your focused craft (about 2.4KM is the default range but as pointed out the Lazor system can alter it), that object is put \u0027on rails\u0027, just like when you start using non-physical timewarps. While on-rails, the physics aren\u0027t actually being simulated. It just locks the craft onto its current orbit, as if it were a train on an invisible set of rails. One of the interesting things about this state is that objects that are on-rails can\u0027t collide with anything, they just pass right through it. And because the Physics aren\u0027t being simulated, anything that\u0027s on-rails inside an atmosphere doesn\u0027t get slowed by drag, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the effects of this is that any empty stages you drop, once they get outside of simulation range, go on-rails. If this puts them on a sub-orbital trajectory (as during a launch), this actually puts them on a defined orbit around a point at the exact center of Kerbin. Without any intervention, they\u0027d actually fall through the surface clear down to the center of the planet, then come flying back out of the planet up to their maximum altitude. And keep doing that forever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the game designers did to prevent that was to set it up so that ANY object which is on-rails below a particular altitude (Around 20km at least for Kerbin) immediately despawns. This makes it seem like it \u0027hit the planet\u0027 in the case of debris. Trick being, it applies to ANYTHING. If you airdrop a rover with a parachute and try to fly away, the rover will despawn the second you get more than 2.4KM away from it unless it\u0027s already resting on the ground when you fly off. This also goes for manned pods: If they get 2.4km away from the focused craft while under 20km, they instantly despawn. Because the game can\u0027t have their parachutes open and lower them safely to the surface while they\u0027re on-rails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Lazor System has built in features that allow you to change the distance at which things go on rails, mitigating this somewhat at the price of having to simulate more objects for longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the current behavior would cause some pretty major problems with career mode (Can\u0027t recover a stage that\u0027s been despawned), I\u0027m expecting some kind of alterations to it in future. Otherwise, the change they made several versions back that allowed parachutes to be deployed on a dropped stage would be kinda moot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T17:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo prevent this happening, wait until you\u0027re closer to the ground before you separate the two craft, so that they won\u0027t have time to go 2.5 km away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
