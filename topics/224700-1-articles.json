Can the game import 3D Studio Max files for eg and use them in the game? These would be detailed spacecraft based on latest research and I wish to add realistic images/videos in the article I am writing, thanks for your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advanced-propulsion-literature-paul-titze-9a57c/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advanced-propulsion-literature-paul-titze-9a57c/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCheers, Paul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
