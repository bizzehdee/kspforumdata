To me this would seem like a small sarcastic jab to Squad as such a figure would indicate that Squad is (relatively) loaded with money, but cannot contribute to keeping KS alive. So now I\u0027m starting to wonder is it really the case?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I understand it (correct me if I\u0027m wrong), Squad has only a handful of developers hired, a few managerial positions (marketing, finance, accounting etc.), a few external developers (whom I suspect are not permanently hired on limited contracts) and a few forum moderators. I would assume there is an office (fully equipped with hardware, software and normal \u0022office\u0022-facilities) which would account for a certain amount of assets and renting expenses. As for other expenses, they would probably subscribe to various hosting services, Curse, software licences, Unity,\u00A0various other licences (such as music etc.) etc. They probably also pay royalty fees, not to mention Steam claims a certain amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this considered (plus other things I haven\u0027t mentioned that which has an associated cost), it is normal to assume that the majority of the expenses in the(any) balance sheet is tied to the human resource compensation, which in this case is relatively small. Marketing costs should be low considering it\u0027s only available in two (online) outlets, and advertisements are seemingly few. As far as I know Squad does not seem to be tied to any investors or publishers, at least not venture-capitalist investors (perhaps an angel investor?), or else there would defiantly be a lot more speed on the development cycles and more staff hiring. Perhaps a bank loan would account for a certain amount of liabilities with connected expenses. Also, Squad does not seem to have public stocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for 40 USD (though less before) * 1 million copies, a relative small company, with (seemingly) little marketing, no (aggressive) investors and no public shareholders, it would seem like a pretty overflowing income statement. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf these assumptions are accurate, why does it seem like KSP development is running on tea and biscuits?

I did buy it cheaper long before the beta. And I have no idea what the discounted sales account for. Despite not taking into account price variations, it\u0027s should be reasonable to assume (if you trust Steam and Squad to have some grip of their own economy), that there is a substantial income compared to their assets, I.e. high profitability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing that strikes me (and somewhat worries me), as you said, is that it\u0027s run like a one man show. However in contrast to Minecraft, MC had a lot faster development cycles and a considerably lower adoption threshold, which arguably led to way higher growth rate as because of the WoM-effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout growth a company will eventually stagnate, which would mean the end for KSP. So, considering KSP have yet to include an \u0022up-to-date\u0022 game engine, and is still lacking a lot of content that was intended to be there, it surprises me that Squad haven\u0027t taken noticeable steps to increase growth despite seemingly having potential investment capital to do so. I remember Minecraft was quite quick to reinvest as soon as there was growth potential. I even remember seeing pictures of the company growing from one man\u0027s apartment, into a continuously expanding studio, into what it is today. During that period you could even see the dates between updates getting shorter and shorter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, due to the complex nature of KSP\u0027s gameplay, it will always have a handicap compared to other games. However there are other steps that can be taken to increase market share and stimulate growth regardless, but I don\u0027t see it yet (at least not in the blog).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point I\u0027m trying to make out, is that if it\u0027s really the case that they have a ton of money, where does it go? Not into development it would seem... And with today\u0027s economic climate, reinvesting should defiantly be more encouraged than saving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(not sure I understand what you mean by mods, but I make and maintain some mods, and I neither pay or get paid)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-16T06:31:06Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2016 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kimiko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Elanguage\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T06:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever figure you can come with will be wrong, you\u0027re forgetting those times that KSP was sold dirt cheap and people bough copies for even their dogs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222412322\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132220\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455598343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022112505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kimiko\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, kimiko said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Kerbalstuff (KS) has shut down, there was a \u0022fun fact\u0022 at the end of the shut-down notice, stating that the sales figures of KSP is estimated to be about 1 million copies, though actual figures are seemingly withheld.

I remember Minecraft was quite quick to reinvest as soon as there was growth potential.

If a company stagnates, the only thing that is happening is, that it is able to pay its employees and keep in business.

Rest assured that we\u0027re financially healthy, and the recent hirings of new developers and a handful of paid QA testers should attest to that. Could we have helped KerbalStuff financially? Perhaps, if we were given notice and/or if we had been asked for help, but that didn\u0027t happen.

The source of the number is the Steamspy website, which uses statistics to approximate the number of copies a game has sold. SteamSpy has, by our request, removed their indexing of Kerbal Space Program on the website. That request was well-argumented, as the website\u0027s manager will tell you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thead locked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: I would like to stress that Sircmpwn indicated to me that financial concerns were not the reason why KS was shut down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
