Apparently they will melt in normal use due to the high temperatures, to overcome this, liquid oxygen is pumped around the cone in a concentric spiral to cool the material down, in doing so, the heat helps get the liquid oxygen to a temp that is better for combustion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this true?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an Aircraft Inspector, i am familiar with the cooling science used in Jet Engines, where the high pressure turbine blades operate at a temp higher than their melting point and are cooled down below this actively. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDV\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T18:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompletely true, it\u0027s called regenerative cooling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epic DaVinci","CreatedById":58581,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T18:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, does oxygen like higher temperatures when used in a combustion chamber?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T19:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eisn\u0027t that hydrogen that is used for cooling ? higher capacity, lower temperature, and not as aggressive to metals as hot pressurized oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GJames","CreatedById":58866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T19:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Epic DaVinci\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, does oxygen like higher temperatures when used in a combustion chamber?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine can produce more power if the propellant is as hot as possible when it goes into the combustion chamber as it is at a higher pressure and will exit the rocket at a higher speed, producing more thrust.

And hydrogen has an awesome capacity to take away heat. That is why, at least on american engines like the J-2, it is used as coolant fluid for the nozzle and chamber. I don\u0027t recall what the russians do right now exactly, but they have metallurgy capable of handling oxygen-rich staged combustion, so I\u0027d say they\u0027d use oxygen \u0027cause it\u0027s netter coolant than RP-1.
