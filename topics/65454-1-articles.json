I have landed it many many times. I needed to see if the rover would be able to get out from under the lander in this version. At KSC the landing legs compacted too much due to gravity. Also the self righting mechanism on the rover acted differently. I was going through a few rover designs and fittings and needed to do a full mun mission for each test. It is now much faster to just launch the lander/rover combo, hack gravity to be the same as the mun and test the lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
