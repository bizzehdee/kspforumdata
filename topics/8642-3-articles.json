The landers can\\\u0027t be tall because then the ramps to get off wind up really steep which will break off the Bigtraks front attachments if it strikes the ground coming down the ramp. The other issue is because the fork attachments hang off the front making everything longer, the landing craft needs to be wide enough to allow the forks to fit which makes everything really big. I\\\u0027ll keep messing around with diffrent configurations but at the moment it looks like the crane lander may be the winner for now. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmiteZero","CreatedById":10862,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-10T04:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that carts themselves are just so BIG.
