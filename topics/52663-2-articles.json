Nothing that cannot be done by players themselves, but for those who can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to wait it\u0027s a good way to overcome those obstacles and it generates some income for Squad as well.

It\u0027s just that part design isn\u0027t done by the player, your Kerbal engineers are building launcher parts in that R\u0026amp;D building when you unlock things. They are clearly limited in intelligence though, what comes out is fairly standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said before that I could see a use for procedural design of parts if tied into a much larger economics system. You could design a specific length of tank or some wings or a fairings with juuuust the right dimensions, but it would take TIME and it would be EXPENSIVE, such that you would lose money on it if you just used it for one mission. It would need to be a part you use more than once to make sense in your program to do that, and it would NOT change dimensions. Change the dimensions, the time and cost are incurred again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, in sandbox it doesn\u0027t matter, but I personally don\u0027t use them because it makes building a rocket far more trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SunJumper\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SunJumper\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOut of curiosity, what do you think of the procedural wings?

Kerbals may not be the type to perform wind tunnel tests and such, but there would at least be some expense and time factors to swapping out a wing.

I still feel some sort of mission system is a good thing but maybe not \u0022go here and do x\u0022 maybe something else. Maybe a list of bonus objectives for each body. So you can do whatever you want but when you get there you can actually have a reason to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo going to the MUN or Minmus is pretty simple. However maybe you should get bonus credits for bringing back 2kg of surface soil or for scanning a crater or something.

Straight out \u0022Orbit MUN, land on Mun, Orbit minmus etc\u0022 isnt really what im looking for but something along the lines of \u0022explore kerbins SOI and bring back info.
