I would usually get from 50 fps to over 60 in any given situation but now, in VAB i get 40-50 fps with no craft loaded and around 25-30 fps with a small craft loaded (with merely 42 parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, thats no problem, i can work with that but when i tried to launch this rocket, i would be lucky if i had more than 20 fps at the launch pad ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy?
