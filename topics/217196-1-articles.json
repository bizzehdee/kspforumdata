Would be nice if they add a gameplay reason to use them. Like if kerbals stay longer in 0G, they will get less controllable (can jump less high and move/walk slower). If they stay very long in 0G maybe not be able to walk at all on some bodies.

Even if kerbals could survive indefinitely in 0G, the giant ring structures could be used for farming, to provide a means of generating self sustaining snacks (food)\u00A0 and oxygen for the kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would provide both a gameplay reason to build them, while not adding a feature that might seem like an extra layer of difficulty to some players.\u00A0 Such a feature could even still exist but be an option for players who do or don\u0027t want it similar to re-entry heating, while the farming aspect ensures that the artificial gravity rings still serve a gameplay purpose in both cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus the mentions of using 1g acceleration ships to simulate gravity would also remain valid in both paradigms. You would just use an \u0022in line\u0022 farm rather than a \u0022spinning\u0022 farm when you know you are going to be thrusting for a year or so. Then treat gravity as a resource that the farms need to produce food. So if thrust is under 1g, and the farm isn\u0027t spinning, the farm enters a dormant mode, or maybe just a low production mode, since I\u0027m fairly certain there are plants that can grow fine in zero g, it\u0027s just more difficult to manage them when you don\u0027t have linear ground to plant them in?
