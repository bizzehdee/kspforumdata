I wanted a plane able to load from the bottom, at the runway, for a mission to Minmus. I have from a previous (real) mission a space station at Minmus and thought it needed a rover and some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I got in to rover-building and measured it up so that it would fit in a Mk3 cargobay and then I drove it to the grass behind the runway and got to SSTO-building. Man, that was a hard thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first attempt (the Seagull1) actually got alltitude, but just barely. In Seagull2 I used verner-engines on the nose and engine to counteract what I later realised was the plane stalling. So after much tweaking, reading, learning, watching and trying I ended up with \u0022Seagull3\u0022. My pride and joy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It flies like a dream actually, it has great lift and reacts great to all controlls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe enginge-setup is 4 RAM-intakes per turbojet-engine and 1 engine per 10 tons.

I do not know what the fuel is worth but I think a fully tapped off Seagull would be more than 4k \u002B I lost my tailfin (not the most expensive of things, though). Since my engine-replacement method turned out great, the plan was to leave the LV-N at my space-station for future missions and land with the Skipper but the universe wanted different. But with that in mind, I can\u0027t really add the cost for my Mk3-delivery vessel. If so, I need to count for my Mun-mining vessel, the Fuel-delivery vessel and the entire space station because without them I wouldn\u0027t be able to complete my mission to Minmus \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E One can argue money and costs all night, let us not that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E The main thing here I think is that I managed to squeez in a contract for science around Minmus and it generated 80k in funds. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout my space station going crazy, dancing like it had disco fever, I thing you\u0027re spot on.
