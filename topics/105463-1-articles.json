The best way I can describe the sound is like it is a tape that is being played after suffering fire damage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any known programs that conflict with the game or engine? I know that LogMeIn Hamachi will cause the game to load extremely slowly until the connection is reset, but disabling it entirely doesn\u0027t fix the sound bug. Perhaps something else I have running can be conflicting?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brianprimm","CreatedById":116920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T02:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://soundcloud.com/brian-primm-3/kerbal-1-0-audio-crackle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://soundcloud.com/brian-primm-3/kerbal-1-0-audio-crackle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the same issue.
