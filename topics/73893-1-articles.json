That said, statistics can play a role. Suppose you have a lot of bugs and you\u0027re fixing them at a constant rate, but you\u0027re not sure how often to release an update. It\u0027s annoying for users when they have to update, and more versions in the wild makes false bug reports more common. On the other hand, you don\u0027t want to make users wait around for your fixes. How do you strike the right balance? It would be great to have statistics to see how quickly your users notice when you release a new version. Maybe that rate is different right after a KSP update. Maybe it\u0027s faster on weekends.

You want to add more parts, but you might push people over their memory limit. Do your users tend to have lots of memory-hungry mods installed? How many? Which mods? You can start to get a very good picture of the environment your code is running in with data like this. And let\u0027s not forget: we can make guesses about what kind of data we\u0027ll see, but inevitably data reveals surprises, things nobody had thought of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure why you\u0027re so quick to condemn ego. You don\u0027t think that plays any part in modders\u0027 motivation to program for free? I use download statistics to estimate my user base, and I put that on my resume. In interviews, I\u0027m asked where I got that number. It would be great if, instead of saying I pulled it from my server logs, I could say I wrote a statistics engine that counted active users.

Consider this: If it\u0027s only distributed with Kethane and KAS, then 100% of those mods\u0027 users will participate, but maybe only 20% of MechJeb users and 10% of Interstellar users. Those mods are thus underrepresented. If you want accurate stats for your mod, you\u0027ll need to include the statistics plugin, because there\u0027s always the chance someone uses your mod and doesn\u0027t use Kethane or KAS. Ego is a useful tool here: If the statistics say Kethane is fifty times more popular than Interstellar, that might prompt Fractal to include ModStatistics so he can improve that stat. There are all kinds of reasons to want accurate statistics, so I\u0027d say there\u0027s plenty of incentive to redistribute the plugin.
