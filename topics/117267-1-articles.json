In the real world (e.g. Mars Curiosity Rover), a lot of interesting geology happens from checking out different features over a scale of meters rather than kilometers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface biomes could be chopped up into procedurally generated sub-biomes. Instead of \u0022EVA Report from the surface at Duna\u0027s Poles\u0022 you could have \u0022EVA Report from the surface at [procedurally generated name XYZ] within Duna\u0027s Poles.\u0022 Names and zones could be similar to those that are randomly/procedurally generated for the various survey and scanning contracts, and I would imagine a lot of the existing code that was built for those could even be recycled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese sub-biomes would \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eonly be discoverable and accessible from the surface\u003C/span\u003E. From the atmosphere or from space, they would just show up as the regular biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would motivate more surface-based exploration (rovers!) by offering up a few more science points to people willing to drive around a little. It also doesn\u0027t seem too hard to implement, and wouldn\u0027t really break any existing game feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be up to the devs to decide how much additional science to award for going to sub-biomes. It\u0027s probably too generous to award full science points for just driving a few km. I would suggest, as a starting point for further discussion/iteration, awarding 15-20% of the baseline science for each additional sub-biome that was explored. So for example, you land in a new biome and your first set of experiments gets the usual award. Then you drive/walk/hop to some other place in a different sub-biome, repeat your experiments (assuming you have the ability to repeat), and get perhaps 15% more science points. A third sub-biome would give you another 15%, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts on this idea are welcome.

I was thinking, that maybe we dont need artificial interesting spots, but could do with what we have, if we just use a couple of more parameters for the experiments. For each geome there could be altitude as well as attitude \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4records\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. Like: Your first experiment in the given geome pays the usual (maybe compensated for the addtional stuff, as: ) and the altitude and attitude (slopyness of terrain) get noted. Now, you can conduct additional experiments at the same geome, but at higher/lower altitudes/angles, paying you science according to the difference of each to your \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4record\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (highest/lowest already conducted experiment of this type in the geome). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn effect, after landing and conducting the standard experiments as we know them, you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d want to drive around to cover a bit of altitude difference, go as high above and low below the landing site as you find reasonable to maximize your science rewards, and investigate this slope over there, while you are at it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA third parameter could simply be \u0022distance to landing site\u0022 rewarding just simply driving as far a way as you want to repeat the experiment on the landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave each of the parameters modify the reward for the repeated experiment for upto 100% max. The extra 100% for altitude would have to be split between at least two (additional, after the first) experiments as at least one experiment would have to take place at the lowest point of elevation of the geome and another at its highest (if you want the full 100% that is - you could chose to go with less, of course). Same for attitude, if the first experiement is not conducted at absolutely level terrain and the second standing at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (the full 100% will be very hard to get i guess, or the max could be set to \u0026lt;90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, say 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ).

Yes, or no? If the answer is \u0022yes,\u0022 then you are either suggesting that Squad manually scatter stuff on this tiny scale all over every world very carefully, scatter it randomly over every world on a level that you\u0027d find them at a reasonable rate---OR, it could be scattered randomly only in areas where the player has a craft capable of possibly spotting these tiny \u0022anomalies\u0022 of interest (these would be actual geology). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if you said \u0022no,\u0022 you are simply wrong, it\u0027s not a question of opinion. Curiosity, for example, finds things that were not visible from orbit practically every Sol. In the image above of the Apollo 17 site, that rock would have been barely visible in some high-res imagery. The LRO flying now can image Apollo sites with a resolution of ~1m, and the Lunar Orbiters of the mid 1960s did about the same. Ranger managed 0.5 m resolution on the last image before impact.

Such a randomized system would have to be done in the context of changing the game such that there is \u0022fog\u0022 about what the other planets actually looked like. Orbital elements are calculated with precision from ground-based astronomy, and some data about atmospheres is know pretty well (spectrometry). That said, the resolution of the surfaces would be pretty low. The first Mariner flyby utterly changed what people knew about Mars, for example. A random system need not have planets generated 100% randomly, BTW, they need only be placed and scaled randomly. Imagine the Kerbol system, but squad makes 10 more planets, and twice as many new minor planets/moons (tiny is size a, huge mons are size z)---they can be made at any detail you desire. A randomized solar system would simply alter the orbits, and pick 6-10 as \u0022planets\u0022 and give each a chance to have moons based upon size (smaller planets get 0-3 moons of size a-g, medium planets might get sizes a-n, and gas or ice giant planets get moons of sizes a-z. All can be as designed, or scaled by a factor of 1 to 6 (size, and orbital distances). The scale factor would be capped in difficulty settings, since 6X is about like 6.4X RSS. Kerbin would stay the same (or maybe scale from 1-3X so standard parts would fine (3.2 kerbin is great with nothing but stock parts)), though it could have the orbital distance chance somewhat (within kerbol\u0027s habitable zone).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have a random system that the player must explore to know about (again, better science instruments and \u0022science\u0022 in general to meaningfully unlock the secrets of worlds, taking images (camera part, like scansat) to make a map view at whatever resolution, for example).
