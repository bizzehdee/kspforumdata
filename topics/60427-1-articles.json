The sub-assembly system is very new and will be tweaked in the future. If you have struts or fuel lines that are not connected within the sub-assembly itself, then they will not be saved. You have to manually attach fuel lines and struts to pieces that are not part of the sub-assembly. And if you need to use 1000 struts, I would recommend a re-design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PetahSchwetah","CreatedById":68074,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T19:11:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[deleted]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-28T09:10:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2022 09:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by PetahSchwetah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fiddlestyx","CreatedById":57329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T19:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to have this problem when Sub-Assem was a mod, but when it was added to the game it seemed to stop messing up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-19T19:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heard it helps if you save/load the ship first, and only then save its parts as subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for me personally it always worked even without saving.

All the problems I\u0027ve encountered with struts/fuel lines not connecting when using sub-assemblies can be traced back to using alt-click rather than just dragging the actual part (remember to save your ship first so you don\u0027t actually lose the sub-assembly part...).
