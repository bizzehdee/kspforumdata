Note that the slightly different shapes of the RT-5 and RT-10 variants changes their drag (and therefore in-atmo performance) slightly, despite having otherwise identical characteristics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T04:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe most of these parts are located in the \u0022GameData\\Squad\\zDeprecated\\\u0022 folder.
