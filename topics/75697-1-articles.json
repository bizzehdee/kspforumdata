I was hooked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was immediately apparent that I had problems. Firstly, I was having to build absolutely huge rockets just to get a single probe core into orbit, and doing so with the tanks I had led to massive spindly affairs that flexed horribly. Procedural Parts fixed the flexing, by allowing me to create custom tanks in whatever shape and size I could desire. Real Fuels with the Real Engines pack fixed the sizing issue, by: i. introducing a variety of real-world fuel types with much more sympathetic masses, and ii. changing the stats of all engines in keeping with real-world varieties. I could now put my probe cores into orbit on things which looked like reasonable rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next target really broadcast itself - I must shoot for the moon! And so began a challenge which taxed my design ability, my flying skill, my understanding, my computer and my patience!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVoila!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/MBRpq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
