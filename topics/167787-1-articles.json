Specifically some tourism contracts. The requirements that want to be take them into \u0022Sub-Orbital Flight over Kerbin\u0022 seem to work just fine, but being in orbit of kerbin, the mun, minmus, etc. don\u0027t get marked. same with landing on any body. I have read some threads that specify that the Alt-F12 debug menu can let you force a contract to be completed, which is true, but it will only give you the \u0022Completion\u0022 reward. Tourism contracts\u00A0often don\u0027t have a reward for the full contract completion. most of their reward is\u00A0given on completion of specific tasks\u00A0and then for completing the full itinerary for the kerbal tourist, not for completing the contract as a whole. The F-12 debug cheat\u00A0 doesn\u0027t seem to give you the money for those individual tasks. Does anyone know of a way to check off the individual tasks of a contract as completed? either through a mod, or as a stock game option?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-22T10:26:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried quicksaving and quickloading while you are in orbit to see if the orbit milestone completes then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-24T19:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy experience is that \u0022orbit around [body]\u0022 completes as soon as the Map view shows a closed ellipse path within the appropriate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (or periapsis is above atmosphere, if it\u0027s a Kerbin orbit) -- if that\u0027s not happening, you may have a bug of some kind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you running mods?\u00A0 If so, which?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you sure you have the correct Kerbal aboard the craft?\u00A0 It\u0027s easy to cross up the passenger manifest if you accept multiple contracts at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there fine print in the contract (special requirements for orbit height etc.)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you use too much acceleration and render the tourist unconscious from G forces?\u00A0 That\u0027ll cause the remainder of the contract(s) for that tourist to remain open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-24T19:04:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2017 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zeiss Ikon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
