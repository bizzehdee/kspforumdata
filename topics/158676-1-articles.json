Well, since the Steam release of 0.21. This game has always captured my imagination and allowed me to go on fantastic voyages. Today however, as the subject line would hint, became more than personal for me. See, almost 1 year ago, I lost my cat of nearly 20 years \u0026lt;as in, had she lived just 60 days more she would have made her 20th birthday\u0026gt; and I requested the aid of a fellow player while watching Das Valdez to help making a flag to immortalize my dear kitty. He succeeded in spades and for almost a year now, her image has flown with me on every mission. Today though, with the use of the Kerbal creator tool in the alt-f12 menu, I generated a kerbal with my name as a pure lark. I did not expect what happened to me during a quick mission to a station I am building. I flew up an antenna to the final lift/orbital ops stage for my station \u0026lt;forgot to put one on during the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E time lol\u0026gt; so I could deorbit the stage after removing it from the station. I got the antenna installed using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and returned my engineer to the ship. I decided to take my kerbal bearing my name, my real name that is, on an EVA. I flew to just a few meters off the station and my ship and just hovered. I panned the camera around to see my kerbals face, and thats when it hit me. In the same moment I saw my kerbal grinning like an idiot I saw on my EVA pack my flag. There in all my beloved kitties glory she was on my back, sitting almost on the same shoulder she would ride as we walked around my house during her long life. Few games have the power to reduce me to tears, but, in that one moment, that one SIMPLE moment, a kerbal with my name on it, on EVA with my beloved kitty riding with me reduced me to tears, and even recalling it for this post has done so again. I now wish to share with you an image of that moment:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KRSHfIm.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022KRSHfIm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand just so shes easier for yall to see, here she is, her name is Pumpkin.

She was a show quality\u00A0Flemish Giant rabbit and she had been my special girl for 5 years. As my family always joked, I didn\u0027t adopt the rabbit, she adopted me. We formed a very close bond from the very moment I met her and I stayed close to her for 5 years. In those 5 years I entered a new school (private high school), and it saw me past through several online communities, one of which was this very community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing a giant, her lifespan was shortened. Granted living 5 years for a giant is most definitely living out her lifespan seeing as despite our best attempts the majority don\u0027t make it that long. So I am extremely grateful to have had her as long as I did. However she started to drop off in December, and slowly we saw her slip as she fought with breast cancer (yes rabbits can get breast cancer). In the months that followed we saw her constantly struggle with varying ails however she kept coming back from them however in late January she got to the point of critical and needless to say by this point it was wearing on my soul to see her in this condition. She was my best friend and it hurt to see in that bad a state.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 3 weeks after she started to get critical, we lost her during a night to multiple organ failure (we had done everything we could up to that point and there was nothing we could do). It was a stale morning and to be honest I likely won\u0027t ever recover from it since of how hard a bond she made.
