Key presses, everything.\n\nOkay! I had a container with a small command pod and parachute attached via separator to a fuel tank and engine, flew it over to my fuel-less ship, staged the separator and parachute and landed the container 70m from the ship (with the command pod and parachute still attached.)\n\nI EVA\u0027d my engineer Kerbal over to the container, detached the parachute and command pod with the electric drill equipped using hot key G since kerbals can\u0027t grab a part that has other parts attached. \n\nI transferred two of the four Oscar-B tanks to my kerbals inventory, then decided instead of trekking the fuel tanks from the container back to the ship, I wanted to pick up the container and take it over to the ship so I didn\u0027t have to run 70m back and forth four times. \n\nI transferred the fuel tanks back into the container (so it has all four fuel tanks, as it originally did) and stood in front of it, drill un equipped (so the kerbals hands are empty) and held G to grab the container. The icon says \u0022Grab,\u0022 the container lights up green (as it always does when you mouse over a part) but when I left click, he doesn\u0027t grab it. I opened the kerbals inventory to drag it in his inventory, but the icon still says \u0022Grab\u0022 and it\u0027s highlighted green. I move to all four sides, hold G, click in different spots on the part, but he never grabs it. I assume it should turn into the green \u0022ghost\u0022 part, which I can place on the ground somewhere or transfer to my inventory but it doesn\u0027t. \n\nI should note that the same thing happened when I detached the command pod and parachute - although eventually after zooming in and out and reorienting the camera, clicking in different spots they eventually do detach as they are supposed to. \n\nI also experience this when drilling parts onto another part, but as I said, eventually they do attach. \n\nOther mods installed are: MechJeb, HyperEdit, Kerbal Engineer, Near Future Propulsion, Near Future Solar, and the Endurance mod. \n\nUpon on booting the game, I get a message that says MechJeb, KSPAPIExtensions and CrossFeedEnabler are out of date and may not work with 1.0.2. Perhaps one of these is the culprit?\n\nThanks in advance for the help!"},{"CreatedByName":"ExavierMacbeth","CreatedById":110680,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:53:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It does on my machine.

I saw on Github its a known issue but when thinking it over this would be an issue for any small/transparent part.(LLL docking lights for example) They could end up getting lost easily. Might I suggest that any KIS icons have some kind of bevel or boarder so that even if there is no obvious icon, you still know something is there?\n\n\u003E Good idea, I think changing background color of a cell that has an item is much easier in terms of coding than making an outline of parts.\n\nThe missing icon is related to a KSP bug, introduced since one of the latest release unfortunatly. You can check ingame and see that the tooltip icon in the vab are empty for the external seat.\n\nI much prefer squad fixing this issue rather than taking time to implement something to fix it, so I\u0027m waiting the next update of KSP.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I am having a problem - KIS seems to erase the open node of a radial attachment point after removing an attached part from it. See below picture: I removed the battery stack from the radial attachment node, but now it is impossible to reattach. I can attach the battery on another open node like the docking port (or on the battery on the other side), but not back to the original radial point. I could reproduce the bug with the radial node on the other side as well.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So I figured out the first question, getting an item onto the kerbal\u0027s back. But the second seems to be a bug.\n\u003E \n\u003E If I set Equipslot = back for 2 items, I can still pull them both out of inventory and onto the kerbal, as if it isn\u0027t checking item slot \u0022back\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E If I detach one item and put it back on the kerbal and then try to detach the second one, it will tell me the item slot \u0022back\u0022 is in use. So basically KIS doesn\u0027t seem to check when pulling from inventory.\n\nThanks for the report, I will take a look.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Question:\n\u003E \n\u003E When I move items to and from inventory (left-hold mouse and drag), the Kerbal responds to the mouse as well by rotating, etc. Can KIS be modified to turn-off the Kerbal\u0027s behaviour? Or, is it something we just have to live with. Yes, I know that being on a ladder prevents this, but if I\u0027m free-floating in space, then a ladder is not an option.\n\nUnfortunatly, I can\u0027t do anything about that. Squad hard coded the mouse click to rotate the kerbal on eva.\n\nEDIT : I\u0027m working on a fix for KIS, currently if you attach a part from the inventory to another part and grab the same part after, you will get explosions.\n\nCurrently it broke my develop version of KAS so I need to fix this before KAS release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T08:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KospY**"},{"CreatedByName":"DDay2021","CreatedById":136105,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T13:08:30Z","Content":"Possible issue.
