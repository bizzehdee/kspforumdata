For most cases, simply detaching and reattaching the misplaced parts will do. We decided it was for the best to simply bite the bullet on this one, because there is no point in having old parts linger around, wasting our already cramped memory space, just for the sake of delaying this inevitable change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to start preparing your saves for the release, I recommend recovering all ongoing spaceplane missions. The parts that have been most changed are the C7 delta wing and triangular wing sections, standard and small control surfaces, and minor changes were done to the mk1 fuselages and cockpit, and the entire mk2 set.
