I looked around, and I realised I was in a mangled control room of some sort. I tried to reach up to a hatch, but something was blocking it, I tore a bit of wiring from the computer and tied a sharp piece of shrapnel to what looked like it used to be a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster, creating a primitive sort of knife. it wasn\u0027t much but it would do.

I got back out and scavanged through the rest of the debris for a while and then I found something interesting. it looked like a piece of a missile, and had scorch marks running all over it.

I examined the hardware and saw a broken red wire which must\u0027ve been damaged when I dropped it. I inspected some other components and saw a flashing light and an antenna on one of them. I heard a distant rumble in the sky, steadily growing louder. I looked up. several orbital missiles were barely visible but getting closer every second. for the second time in a minute I ran for cover. I jumped behind a boulder, using the piece of heat shield I had cut out of my capsule as a shield. the heat blasted into me and the shockwave rippled through me hurling me through the sky I saw as my capsule and everything near it was ripped to shreds including the ground.
