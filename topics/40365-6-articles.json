You could build a large station with several science labs to constantly generate antimatter, provided that you can keep them supplied with power! At 5GW, those power requirements are pretty immense. It\u0027s possible to fulfil with solar power assuming a large network of Kerbol solar satellites but you\u0027d probably have to put the labs around Moho in order to beam power back efficiently enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75m nuclear reactors are probably the best bet for powering antimatter factories, since the upgraded version will produce 15GW.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo help you out generating power, I\u0027m making the Brayton turbines upgradeable as well:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kjLsWyR.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kjLsWyR.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CeXsEA8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CeXsEA8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Brayton turbines upgrades to a KTEC solid state thermoelectric heat engine that produces power at 60% of (the theoretical maximum) Carnot cycle efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added some options for In-Situ Resource Utilisation using the science lab.

Much like how my thermal rocket nozzle detects the parameters of thrust and specific impulse it should use based on the reactor that it is attached to I decided to make the electric engines function in a similar manner.
