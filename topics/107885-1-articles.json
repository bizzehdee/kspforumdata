It\u0027s really pretty fantastic, and all I really used KW for was the 3.75/5m rockets anyways. SpaceY also has powerful radial monoprop engines that double as RCS thrusters, which I just love for docking tugs. They have reaction wheels, a really powerful (inefficient) 1.25m lifter engine, and even a stockalike 5m fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
