Actually, Holmes was sitting in a chair, smoking, and talking for both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe London criminals had heard that a new boss had conquered London, so when street boys were delivering messages from \u0022Prof. Moriarty\u0022, they were obeying and doing what he ordered.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the miracle potions were having let Holmes go, he was reading the journal of \u0022Moriarty\u0022 orders (which he had sent two hours ago), and then sending a letter to Lestrade, so the crimes were being solved to their mutual satisfaction.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(That was a little secret of Holmes\u0027 geniality and Lestrade career).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen \u0022Moriarty\u0022\u0027s henchman Sebastian Moran tried to shoot Sherlock Holmes from a pneumatic rifle, it was actually Holmes himself, shooting the wax doll in his chair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Sebastian Moran\u0022 was Holmes\u0027 childhood imaginary nickname, when he was imagining himself a brave hunter from South African jungle.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe pneumatic gun was chosen to not call police from nearby streets, and to not wake up Mrs. Hudson if she is sleeping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut finally Holmes and Moriarty in the Holmes\u0027 head decided to face each other in a mortal combat, and this brought them (actually, Holmes) to the Reichenbach waterfall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter talking to (himself) Moriarty, and writing a letter to (himself) Watson, Sherlock Holmes started fighting himself at the very edge of the rock, under shocked views of other tourists around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the process, Holmes tripped and almost fell down from the rock, but at the very last moment caught the edge and stopped on a small platform below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting fact: at that very moment the personality of \u0022Dr. Moriarty\u0022 had disappeared and never came again.
