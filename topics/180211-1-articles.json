An addition would be a fixed base on the moon, from which the player could start newly created vehicles. Some vehicles would take off from the ground base, and others from Gateway in the orbit of the moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn career mode there would be new contracts for the lunar base, get 100 liters of water and deliver to the base or orbital station in a few hours. Or design a reusable lander that allows you to transport your crew or supplies from the Gateway to the moon base, and any use of this lander must be within the costs specified in the contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe late era is large ion engines, large nuclear reactors that allow vessels to be supplied far from the star, larger Nerv engines. A fixed base on the moon, slightly larger than that from the middle era and a small fixed base on the Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf there will be life support in KSP, in this era we could get parts responsible for the production of food in orbit or terrestrial bases, and earlier eras would only have tanks with oxygen/food or parts that enable recycling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-02T03:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know the most hated answer for this forum is.... \u0027there\u0027s a mod for that\u0027, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t argue this isn\u0027t a good idea for stock, it is, but I don\u0027t see it happening.\u00A0\u00A0 That much work is into the DLC territory, and they won\u0027t make a DLC that is easily reproducible with mods, as it would kill the sales.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can set this up now, with careful application of mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
