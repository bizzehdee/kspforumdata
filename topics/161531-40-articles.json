It seems like the strangest mod to install for KSP. (Install an outdated mod, copy new files on top, add a half dozen dependencies including several outdated ones. It just seems like it *should* break.)

While NFT reactors were producing KSP Stock alike Kilowatts, KSPI engines we generating GigaWatt power. This problem was made worse by the fact that Despite KSPI reactors producing much more power than NFT-E reactors, the KSPI engines performance was worse than NFT-E engines. Combining the 2 mods however (Gigawatt reactor with Kilowatt electric engines) resulted in very unbalanced gameplay. To solve the problem, I realized KSPI needed some changes to allow me to create an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105841-0-90-Depricated-KSP-Interstellar-Near-Future-Integration-0-3-%28update-1-2-2015%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPI-NF Integration\u003C/a\u003E. Because a lot of KSPI configuration was hidden, I initially tried to achieve this by opening up KSPI parts and configuration files for modding. This also explains how \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EKSPI Extended Configuration\u003C/span\u003E got it\u0027s name. I though it was temporary until Boris of Fractal would return but they never did. Because it was too much work to work on 2 mods, I decided to integrate my ideas of KSPI-NF into KSPI-E and allowed KSPI-E tp adapt to NFT-E when it was installed. After modifying KSPI to open it up from modding, I leaned the code and managed to fixed several bugs and started to make improvements. NFT-E mode worked reasonably well until KSP 1.0 launch. After 1.0, many KSPI features we broken, taking me a quite some time to fix it. Now KSPI-E is close for beta (complete install) for normal KSPI playing but Near Future Mode still need some fixes. In intend to fix that as well, allowing you to play KSPI at NFT power level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that do not consider myself the person that have to determine the future of KSPI, it\u0027s just that nobody else seems to want to do it. I would be more than happy to share that responsibility. Anyone that actively want to develop KSPI is free to do it. It would appreciate it as it would allow me to focus more on advanced features I have ideas about. Also notice I haven\u0027t had the time yet to play a serious KSP 1.0 campaign yet. But now my hands are full just making KSPI-E functional again. I think KSPI could develop into something much better. The simply truth is, KSPI is too big for a single developer. I don\u0027t have the time nor the skills to implement everything that it deserves. I\u0027m especially frustrated about the lack of artist support. Many of KSPI models and effects look dated and ugly compared to more resent mods. There have been some artist and programmers offering their help but they often go AWOL after a short time. I\u0027m not sure If I can keep it up myself indefinably. I would prefer to create a team of developers that works on KSPI.
