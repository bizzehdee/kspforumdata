I thought that the new ARM liquid booster could make an interresting body-fuselage, so there it is \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch is a bit particular : you won\u0027t touch to anything else than the tweakable power of the main engine, which belong to the spaceship itself : tge gravity turn is given by the diffential in thrust and the non-aligned specific centers. It took a bit of time to configure and make it fit the different steps of ascension, but now this is fully reliable and kinda fun to use !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing by itself is a bit... Abrupt, since it was hard to take a good shot while manoeuvring. I decided for the record to lock a descent angle, but you can easily land smoothly while piloting and rounding the touchdown \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you\u0027ll enjoy the video, if you like it, don\u0027t forget to suscribe of course !

That is to say you\u0027ll need, before the launch, to right clic on the engine and keep the window. During the first step, you\u0027ll have to gently adjust power from initial (40% if I remember) to about 90% dependind on the curve you use to give. Then, the only \u0022tricky\u0022 step is right before the end of the 2 lateral booster : bring back the engine to 50% and hit space to decouple the boosters. You should be fine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast step is okay, just follow the necessity to reaugment power progressively. Take care, you\u0027ll probably need to reach 100% quickly as you get close to the end of the orange booster. Jettison before the end, this is more impressive and comfortable. As soos as you get the Shuttle and nothing else, everything is well centered, you can go 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it sound hard like this or unreliable but this is not. This is far more reliable than using extra engines to adjust the pitch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E And you only have one parameter to control.
