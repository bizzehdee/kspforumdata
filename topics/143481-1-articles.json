You don\u0027t have time to spend a minute making a new node that\u0027s 1-2 minutes ahead of your ship. By that point, you went like 1/8th the way around Kerbin compared to your initial node. And remember: your target is not merely an encounter, but rather a precise gravity assist that is supposed to give you an encounter with a secondary target, and so you\u0027re reliant on coming in from just the right angle at just the right altitude while the Mun is in just the right position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, because if you\u0027re in a tight orbit then waiting 1 more orbit is going to make likely to no difference on the launch window. \u00A0Interplanetary launch windows are measured in days, not minutes or hours. \u00A0There will be a small loss of efficiency in correcting for the small change in orbital position of the assisting body but since correcting early is vastly more efficient than correcting late, it\u0027s still much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCombine this with a course correction mid-way between the assist and the target (will be \u0026lt;10m/s) and you\u0027ll be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
