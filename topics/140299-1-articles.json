I\u0027m still fiddling around with ascent profiles, but I\u0027m a bit at a loss as how to handle the velocity. I remember that back in the day, there was some discussion about optimal velocities for kerbal ascent, but I don\u0027t remember whether or not there eventually came a consensus on this. Some argued that you should try to stick as closely as possible to the terminal velocity, since it should minimize losses due to gravity and atmospheric drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince it\u0027d be fairly trivial to write a script which dynamically keeps a rocket at terminal velocity, I was wondering whether this is still thought to be the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T13:02:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I am aware, when the atmosphere changed it became very hard to reach terminal velocity once you were above about 10km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndid a google search and found this answer which seems sensible\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan terminal velocity can still be estimated for a common spaceship?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can be found out experimentally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe terminal velocity of an object is the speed it reaches during freefall.
