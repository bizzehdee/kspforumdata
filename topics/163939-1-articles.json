I have been playing since version 13.2 and I can\u0027t stop playing. I am extremely excited for the Making History Expansion and I can\u0027t wait for it\u0027s release. \u00A0The Expansion pack is a great step, but its missing places to go to. \u00A0A new place to go too past Eeloo would be great. \u00A0But a new solar system would be even better. \u00A0Having a second or third star with new planets and moons to visit would be a great update for the game and get people to play again. \u00A0And to get there, warp drives or magnetic engines that use unconventional fuels, to get those fuels you have to go to distant moons. \u00A0The current Solar system in the game is old, people are not exploring as much anymore because they have already seen the scenery. \u00A0Having two gas giants orbit each other in a binary system would be amazing for scenery and a great place to go to. I know there are mods for this, but those mods take the current planet models and recolors and rescales them. KSP needs more places. This\u00A0game is amazing, its just needs to expand more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy launchings everyone\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-01T03:45:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther planets would be nice. There is a mod for it, well several. Outer Planets for one. Other star systems has a mod too but forget its name, interstellar I think.
