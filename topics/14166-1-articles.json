Altough this also means no symmetry trough the whole thing and flying is awkward since the pod itself is not pointing up when you are flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VDnWx.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFull speed ahead!\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really shouldnt be going any fater than im doing there and even that is suicidal.
