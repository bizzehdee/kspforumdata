The inclinations of both orbits (of the craft you are piloting and of the craft you\u0027re trying to rendezvous to) should be nearly the same (lie in the same plane). You can assess that by looking at the AN and DN markers (Ascending and Descending node) - they should be within 1 degree difference (the closer to 0 - the better). If not - do a plane change by putting a maneuver node in either AN or DN and try to match the planes as close as you can. (It doesn\u0027t matter for nearly circular orbits but in elliptical ones the dV difference between choosing either AN or DN can be quite significant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Once you have both orbits in the same plane see for the phasing rate (the frequency at which both crafts appear at the closest range to each other). At this point you might consider raising or lowering your orbit to increase the phasing rate (if both orbits are very close to each other and you are completely out of phase with another craft - i.e. it\u0027s on the other side of Kerbin). The closer the orbits are the longer you would have to wait for the correct moment to make a Hohmann\u0027s transfer. I usually set the ratio to 1:1.2 - 1:1.5 (meaning that if your target\u0027s orbit height is 100km yours should be either 120-130 km or 70-80 km). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now, place a maneuver node on your path and adjust it so that your final trajectory was tangential (appear to touch) the target\u0027s one. Two markers will appear displaying the resulting separation. Now slide your maneuver node along your orbit to see how those markers behave. This might take a while or you might even want to wait a few more orbits for the conditions to improve. Once you have successfully aligned your separation markers, execute the maneuver node. Naturally, the less the separation the better. Still, even 20-30 km will be normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Divide the distance to your target (in m/s) by 1000 and burn towards it so that the relative speed was about that figure (for example, if the distance is 20 km, your approach speed should be about 20 m/s). This ratio is not mandatory byt don\u0027t get too fast. You will need to turn your craft away from the target and burn again as you approach it to minimize the relative speed (ideally it should be 0 m/s).

It just comes out that way. If you keep playing a while and do this more often, you will soon learn to eyeball your initial orbit so that the waiting time gets reduced (if possible). Your orbit is 80km, to ~90km of your target. that is not much... you could in theory go up to - say for example - 150km and let the target catch up with you. this might be faster... but will cost more d/v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now i recommend playing this through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlant a flag at the KSC, switch to it.
