Proving that if you have a circle drawn around a circle and keep drawing another one at the intersect you get exactly 6 circle around a base circle without using any modern math. I was doing this to find an alternative basis for the unit circle basically and using only geometry to prove geometry. I found a proof with no modern math but I can\u0027t remember how I found it. I may have had to start a secondary pattern on the first and assume a few things until I proved the entire thing. The logic comes out a lot like a certain very old geometry proof book. I think it\u0027s greek in origin. It\u0027s fun to do and you can definetly proof the beginning of angles using this method for stuff that goes up to proving or developing a value for pie and the basics of triangles in what is basically a form of pre trig.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone messed with this or know how to prove it. I can\u0027t remember and can\u0027t refigure it out. Partially because I lack reliable drawing tools to help do it atm and it\u0027s hard t improvise those with enough accuraccy to be able to use it as a visual aid beyond the first set or two of circles without. It\u0027s a fun way to try to prove geometry related things though. BTW, you cannot use the cirlces position as proof from a drawing. You have to prove it with base logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact I may have used that old greek book to find the proof... Does anyone know what it is. I forget the name of the book. It uses worded logic to prove a bunch of very basic logical things in mathematics. I think it was written by Euclid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, sacred geometry is and was a real subject. I think it is known to have been used in ancient religious temples. And if you start playing with it and basically use euclidian logic to prove things. It\u0027s potentially very convenient for the development of measurement methods in potentially a very logical or very practical and basic way. The issue is you may need to do some interesting drawings to help develop the logic and it\u0027s sometimes hard becuase of paper standards and lack of size. It would basically be a lot more convenient with a lot of space some sand and people moving stuff around a stick potentially. \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou basically have to prove that 6 circles go around a circle and then use logic to prove other easy things and find proofs working your way up the almost exact stuff Euclid went through, but in different orders(I think I had to combine a few of his proofs to prove it.). It\u0027s almost like it\u0027s related to an older form of things used as pre trig and possibly related to very old practical building methods. And possibly ways to develop means of early architecture as you could possibly with enough knowledge use it to lay a foundation accurately without a modern laser pointer or other tools. Assuming you don\u0027t use something like it with it. If not you could use it to help develop the logic to make the tools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, it\u0027s very coincidental to euclidean logic and the unit circle in all forms. In fact euclidean logic, if you do this sufficiently, is basically giving the answers and a shorthand guide to how to prove these things with sacred geometry/pure geometry proofs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf no one has ever done this, you start out with basically what turns into a proven equilateral triangle that is then cut in half. You then use basic logic to start defining other base things found in basic geometry and math. I was trying to use it a pure geometric proof up to a certain point to prove things in trig/geometry with basically euclidean logic only. More specifically not using modern info until I developed it myself as a test to try to do it. It makes a very quick potential explanation as to Euclid/Greek obsession with triangles and possible relationship to Egyptian or other older schools of thought or mathematics if that is indeed the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found it. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEuclid\u0027s elements. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, has anyone tried to do this to prove pre trig and work up geometry? It\u0027s interesting to attempt. The patterns in sacred geometry basically make a grid to do the things in Euclid\u0027s elements. But you have to do a little of the leg work yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I had a hard copy of this book(A good long lasting version at that.).

You don\u0027t know if they are exact or merely appear to be. If you use several of the euclid\u0027s elements proofs you can find a proof they are all exactly 6 and equal in pattern in a circle. Hence all shown disntances in the () pattern are r. But there is an initial problem because you cannot use visuals as proof. It can merely look exact if drawn properly. For all you know it\u0027s an infinitesimally small fraction off of a perfect hexagon. As I said, at minimum, there are several proofs from euclids elements that if combined proves logically and absolutely that it is a perfect hexagon. Then also it\u0027s known it is a bunch of equilateral triangles. etc, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to be clear, you know the initial circle and everything from it\u0027s center to it\u0027s circumference are r. But you don\u0027t know if the outside edges of the hexagon are exactly the same by any visual inspection. Any further drawing of a pattern, which looks like it is a hexagon for many reasons, is not known to be an exact on it\u0027s face. Nor can it be proven just by appearance. It requires further logic. Hence the greek love of triangles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNormally in sacred geometry, you start with a point and draw a circle with the same distance from a point. This is the circumference. This is the same as the definition in Euclid\u0027s Elements. After that you can take any point on that circles circumference and draw a new circle with that new circles center point on the circumference of the first circle with a radius of r. then you take an intersect of the two circumferences and draw another circle of the same manner. You repeat this until it goes all the way around. You get a visual, that if drawn well, seem to be exactly 6 circles. But you are left with a logical conundrum of if it is really exactly 6 circles or whether infinitely repeating the pattern PERFECTLY, would eventually create variations. Hence it\u0027s not exactly 6 circles but merely appears to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know the distance between the circumference of the first circle drawn on the circumference and the center point of the middle circle do in fact touch because both are drawn with radius r.(excluding visual anomalies from drawing.) All circles drawn on the circumference of circles drawn on the middle circle with radius r touch perfectly the center point of the middle circle. But does the circumference of the sixth circle with the center point on the middle circles circumference perfectly create an intersection with the circumference of the first circle drawn with the center point on the middle circle perfectly on the circumference of the middle circle?(This is assuming you kept drawn circle in the same direction around the middle circle until they collided.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-03T01:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2018 01:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T21:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223426788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177183\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533257336\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/2/2018 at 8:48 PM, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you have to prove that the distance between the points is actually the same as r.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou used r in your construction.\u00A0 No proof needed.\u00A0 You have r from center to circumference, and two points r apart (straight-line distance, not measured along the curve) on the circumference, therefore (by definition) the three points form an equilateral triangle.\u00A0 Or are you asking me to prove that six of those make a regular hexagon?\u00A0 The construction is commonly done with short arcs, but it can be done with full circles; proof of their consistent radius is that they all intersect at the center of the starter circle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-11T04:43:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the point. It\u0027s a known equilateral triangle because by definition you stuck a same sized circle on the intersect of the other circles. So that 2-3 circles is proof of an equilateral triangle. But how do you know/prove it\u0027s a perfect hexagon? You can put the center point on the new intersect on the circumference, but I don\u0027t think you have proof of the most important part at that juncture. The very last connecting point of the hexagon. It still needs further proof that it is actually a perfect hexagon. You need knowledge of pie and the calculation of a circumference to proof it\u0027s a perfect shape otherwise and that is not usable until developed independently. Else it could be infinitesimally off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can go in either direction from the first circle on the middle circles circumference(and infinitely so.). But you don\u0027t know for certain that they connect when they visually appear to join at the last circle. You can only prove infinitely going around the circle in either direction independently, without further proof developed. But you never know if they actually connect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you get to the sixth circle on the circumference you can choose either of the other circles intersection with the center circle as a starting point to try to prove this. But doing that you do not have proof that the other one intersects perfectly with the other or that the center points are actually the same from the perspective of the outer circles or there intersects between each other. And changing the starting intersection does the same thing in the other direction. Hence the problem. All you can do is say the drawing is close and appears to be linked at that point. But it is not proven. It\u0027s literally circular logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do not have to prove a hexagon has six sides. That is part of the definition. What you have to prove is that this is a hexagon to start with. And not what just appears to be dots that get really close to each other and look like a hexagon at the last intersection. It\u0027s that last relative intersection between the two outer circles and the inner circle you have to prove are literally on the exact same spot. As I said, current logic only proves the connection as you go around infinitely, but you never know if the things drawn over each other are every connecting from opposite direction. Or even the same direction. This is the natural test here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogical test: If you draw three circles in this logic you get 3 equilateral triangles connected in a particular manner that looks like a half hexagon. It basically creates what appears to be a diameter. But how do you prove it\u0027s a diameter and what not just appears to be a straight line(AKA, 180degrees which have not yet been established nor that a equilateral triangle is 1/6th of a circle... I don\u0027t think.).
