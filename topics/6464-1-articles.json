The first - the \u003Cem\u003ESea Vulture\u003C/em\u003E-type - was more unstable, and the \u003Cem\u003EAnhinga\u003C/em\u003E was the result of what was learned from it. With good glide time, reasonable agility for a craft its size, and the ability to carry a large number of bombs or missiles, it can certainly hold its own in terms of usefullness. It has an unusually good ability to land, though having the engines running is a must. Over long flights, great care should be taken that it not use all fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA rework of the \u003Cem\u003ESea Vulture\u003C/em\u003E may happen in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EREQUIRES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-C7\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-C7 Experimental V3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENovaSilisko\\\u0027s ML-22 Lander Legs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHSTW Landing Skids\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-08T22:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s alot of lift- it looks like it could make a fantastic glider, but first you need to but the larger elevators on the front wings so you can change the flow from the front of the plane as well.
