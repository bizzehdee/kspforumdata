I assigned them to an action group but when I went\u00A0to shut them down the action group menu was locked so I had to manually shut them down which took time because I was using a xbox controller to operate the cursor. Eventually the action group menu unlocked for some reason when I was totally out of the atmosphere but I don\u0027t know why I wasn\u0027t able to use action groups while in the upper atmosphere while all my engines were firing.
