While your decision to protest is absolutely yours to make, there\u0027s no difference from Squad\u0027s perspective if you simply choose your own host instead. You\u0027re not providing Squad with content; you\u0027re enriching the \u003Cem\u003Eplayer \u003C/em\u003Eexperience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, perhaps it\u0027s your point of view that even doing that is further supporting the game -and by proxy Squad itself- and that\u0027s what you\u0027re really trying to stop. If that\u0027s the case, again, it\u0027s absolutely your own prerogative and right, but you should know that most players won\u0027t understand that. They know mods come from fellow players, and all they\u0027ll really take away from the event is that one of their favorite mods has fallen away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, they\u0027ll adapt to playing without it, and Squad will continue on as they will, because hey, let\u0027s face it: unless \u003Cem\u003Ethe majority \u003C/em\u003Eof modders follow your lead, nothing about their vision will be changed. You\u0027ll have honored the demand of your conscience, but unfortunately the method you\u0027re choosing is only going to deprive your fans of sharing in the beautiful results of your work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get your frustration at seeing Spaceport go away, but from a technical standpoint there\u0027s no way to translate it to another system, and it \u003Cem\u003Ecannot \u003C/em\u003Estay live. Seriously, it\u0027s running on Wordpress, and really close to vanilla install, at that. It\u0027s not using ANY of the necessary security practices or plugins, and is standing wide-open to anybody with the experience and motivation. At least one of the plugins it uses to modify post organization and display is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. To top it off, there\u0027s a massive botnet currently attacking Wordpress sites, stepping into the admin mode within minutes of focusing on a host. In Spaceport\u0027s case, it\u0027d probably take that botnet about two minutes to hammer out the admin password. Why? Because one of the security practices is to remove the \u0022admin\u0022 named account, and \u003Cem\u003ESpaceport hasn\u0027t done it! \u003C/em\u003EThere\u0027s another plugin to blacklist IPs committing brute-force attacks on the login, and \u003Cem\u003ESpaceport doesn\u0027t have it\u003C/em\u003E. These are only two of many big security holes existing on the site. Usability, stability and actual overall content quality are barely worth mentioning in light of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line: if I didn\u0027t care about the community and the game, I could almost literally walk into that admin panel, install a database viewer plugin, and copy the whole shebang down to my system. From there it\u0027ll take my local network only a few days to start breaking password hashes. From there, I\u0027m only a few cups of coffee away from walking onto peoples\u0027 email accounts, because you know darned well they use the same username and password for them, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that you don\u0027t want to see the whole thing just vaporize into obscurity and lose all the useful parts of the content, and efforts \u003Cem\u003Eare \u003C/em\u003Eunderway to preserve it for preservation\u0027s sake, but we can\u0027t expect Squad to shoulder the costs of continuing to host it. From a business standpoint, there\u0027s no use in maintaining it and spreading out points of access. Given the vulnerable state of the site, there\u0027s also some risk involved in continuing to keep it public, in that there could easily be malicious links posted there. It\u0027s not moderated, so who\u0027s been there to see if that\u0027s true or not?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, thanks to Wordpress\u0027 horrid database structure, it can\u0027t simply be converted for use with another file host (unless they too are using Wordpress, in which case what\u0027s the point of changing at all?) and no respectable host running their own dedicated software would be willing to assume the work, responsibility and risk of converting a Wordpress database to conform to their own system\u0027s structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, I\u0027m joining among the voices imploring you to just choose your own host instead. You\u0027ll still be satisfying your choice to protest Squad\u0027s decision, while at the same time keeping your efforts firmly ensconced in our game through every update, and protecting your fans from the pains of bad security practices and/or seemingly-blind marketing decisions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T00:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI need some help, I\u0027m trying to install the Mk3 Cockpit interior, but whenever I copy the files to my GameData folder there is a ding noise and the files inside the MK3 IVA folder in the Touhou Torpedo folder don\u0027t copy.
