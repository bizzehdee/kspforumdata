New Horizons didn\u0027t have enough fuel available to refuel Free Bird, so I reluctantly sent up another fuel can (still haven\u0027t worked out the Mother Goose 7 - the fuel delivery plane I was working on when my 3-year old borked the game).

Two of the readings were from Space High, so the first time, I put my apoapse to 400km. This caused everything to explode on reentry, so I reverted, looked up the border of Space High over Kerbin (250km), and had a lower apoapse the second time. Ran out of fuel trying to lift the periapse out of the ground, but managed to land without losing any parts. Combined with a science rover picking up readings from some of the KSC buildings, I have now purchased Turboramjets. And now, the tie to spaceplanes is clear: they\u0027re my next project.
