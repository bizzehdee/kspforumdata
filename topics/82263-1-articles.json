There are plenty of things that can and do travel or move faster than light, but they are not information carriers. The most popular example is the \u0022shadow on the Moon\u0022 thought experiment. Imagine you have a very powerful light source shining directly at the Moon, and you hold your finger in front of it. Now there is a shadow of your finger on the Moon\u0027s surface. You then move your finger at perfectly normal finger moving speeds, and observe to your surprise that the shadow whips across the surface of the Moon at speeds far larger than that of light! In a split second, it can go from pole to pole and back. This works because the shadow is not an information carrier; it is merely the result of an information exchange. The actual information travels at the speed of light, from the light source, past the finger, to the Moon, bounces off of it, travels back to you and enters your brain through your eye.

So lets forget gravity and curved space-time for a moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA specific point in space and time is usually referred to as an event. If you have two events in Special Relativity, there are two possibilities. They can be space-like separated or time-like separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the events are time-like separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Their order is fixed.

If A causes B from someone\u0027s perspective, then there is no frame of reference in which B causes A. (This is only true locally in GR.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf two events are space-like separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Their order can change, depending on observer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E The two events can be simultaneous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) They are not casually related, and no communication between two events is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simultaneity is the most important bit. In order to define time, there has to be a concept of \u0022right now, somewhere else\u0022. But if two events are simultaneous, they are space-like separated, and that means that from someone else\u0027s perspective, they are not simultaneous. Which means that they can\u0027t both be happening \u0022right now\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if the two events are time-like separated, you can always define the \u003Cem\u003Elongest\u003C/em\u003E amount of time a message can travel from event A to event B. As it turns out, in Special Relativity, this path is going to be a straight line from A to B. (In GR, it\u0027s going to be a geodesic.) What\u0027s even more interesting is that as consequence of point d) above, we can choose an observer from whose perspective that message stays in one place, and just has to wait for B to happen. This is the most natural way for us to define time between two events. It\u0027s unambiguous. It does not depend on choice of frame of reference. And it\u0027s usually what we are talking about anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I was talking about with the age of the universe. Big Bang has a special property that it has caused everything. Which means that absolutely every single point in space-time that you can get to is time-like separated from the Big Bang. As such, we can define the age of space near any event by this longest distance from Big Bang. Better yet, we can always define a coordinate system in which the location of Big Bang was \u0022right here\u0022, which means, it\u0027s only separated from us in time. So again, this kind of definition of the age of the universe is very natural. We just have to figure out what\u0027s the longest amount of time something could have aged between Big Bang and right now.
