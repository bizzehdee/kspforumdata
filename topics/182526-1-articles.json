Instructions were a wee bit thin (none) even after drinking multiple cups of coffee.

The desert site is now 700 meters under water for example. I would love to have Guiana, Vandenburg and a few others as launch options. I keep getting sucked into accepting contracts that want 0\u00B0 incidence which is kinda hard to do in the early 50\u0027s game time lol. Those take a wee bit of go juice to achieve and the early engines don\u0027t have terribly good isps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this has to be here but I can\u0027t find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wragie","CreatedById":155599,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-06T23:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one can help with setting up alternate launch sites????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-07T18:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should take a look \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=177216\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eat the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E thread\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.
