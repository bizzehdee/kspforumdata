Not sure why this would be though.\n\u003E \n\nSo I don\u0027t have hard data on this but about 2 or 3 years ago I read that the orientation package was jettisoned with parachute deployment.\n\nHere is the issue with that statement.  Where are the landing rockets?   I checked every photo of the VA I could find and never found rocket orifices or places that could be covers for said orifices....   This leads me to believe that the VA DID keep the Orientation package.     This made me think of an old proposed \u0022suicide burn\u0022 option proposed in the early days of US space flight for a recoverable satellite part (Likely a Photint pod.)   A rocket mounted above the pod fires just above local ground level and slows the pod down to ~0.1g negative acceleration (IE it is falling approximately 0.981 m/ss.)    The final altitude was to be something like 0.5m AGL.   The pod would release and the Rocket would then fly unguided up and at an angle away or the Rocket would auto separate upon landing.... there were many proposals for stuff like this before the world had the computing power to actually calculate when to do all these steps..   Final impact would be below 3m/s most landers seem to be comfortable landing.\n\nCould this be what VA does I wonder.\n\nAs it applies to VA this means...\n\nOrientation module (via pilot or autonomous via something like Mechjeb,) seeks correct heading for retro-burn.\n\nRetro rocket fires and after burning out detaches (... or see 1 below)\n\nOrientation pod keeps HS pointed at Periapsis through combination of drag/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E modules.   Aerodynamically for a conical VA Pod the Orientation module is like a big tail fin....\n\nlarge Drogue Parachute is ejected and slows the VA pod down to something like 15-30m/s   Again no hard data.\n\nAt point just before impact Retro-rocket fires releasing the VA pod automatically at ~ 2-4m AGL   After the retro-rocket separates the VA \u0022crash\u0022 lands at 1G of acceleration and approximately 3-5m/s\n\nThe Orientation Module has now rocketed back up to altitude (tens of meters... no more) and the drogue chutes now have enough surface area to act as a regular chute...  The VA Orientation Module is fully recoverable. (See 2 below)\n\n1)  Separation is likely but not certain.   All of my statements are based on the theory that the OM separates just before landing.\n\n2) Separating the OM is likely a crew safety feature... After all fuels would be UDMH/NTO.   To replicate this in game would require a plugin or a group of plugins for optimal performance (very few people have a reaction time fast enough to do all these steps... esp given the delays introduced in KSP itself in the manual staging process."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-14T16:12:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, Pappystein said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Here is the issue with that statement.

There was a good chance that it was causing the problems, but apparently not in this case.\n\nFrom the image you linked -- everything else on the part seems to be working, except the diameter adjustment.  This would point to the diameter unlock upgrades not being purchased in your career.  Could you upload your save file (persistent.sfs)?
