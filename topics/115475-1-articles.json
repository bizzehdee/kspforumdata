However, in many crafts these are antennas or batteries that don\u0027t need to be simulated. What I suggest is that we give the same internal/external temperature of the root part to the physics-less part, while keeping both parts max temp. This allows batteries to still burn up during high velocity reentries, but saves on heat and conduction calculations. It could also be applied to parts like the cubic octagonal strut, by making it\u0027s temp the average of the two parts around it- certain parts like struts and fuel lines shouldn\u0027t even be simulated at all. What do you guys think about adding this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcept heat often goes THROUGH some of these parts to reach others.

However, batteries are a bad example. Radial chutes, ladders, landing gear... all of these have to be visible on the outside for us to see them and to provide us with something to click and toggle.
