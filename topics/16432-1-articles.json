These are pretty rough and mostly made just to look like the do in the show, but most of them do fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve uploaded some screenshots to a gallery for easy viewing, right here - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/XBPeM#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/XBPeM#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what they are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFF-X7 Core Fighter (Mobile Suit Gundam 0079) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?ihiaon5hlxhdo1c\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ED/L LINK\u003C/a\u003E - Can achieve flight! Needs to be landed at high speed but has a parachute on the rear for safer stopping. I wouldn\u0027t recommend using the landing gear brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFF-X7-Bst Core Booster (MSG0079) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?0unsraio3h194u4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ED/L LINK\u003C/a\u003E - Sadly I could not get this design off the runway and others that have tested it have said they were also unable to modify it to get it off the ground. But it looks cool and also has a modified Core Fighter with liquid fuel rocket engines and RCS modules, if you ever get it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDFA-03 Dopp (MSG0079) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?8lt8fzbjjy6nd9j\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ED/L LINK\u003C/a\u003E - Zeon fighter jet. Flies well enough. Jet engines aren\u0027t powerful enough to get it off the ground which is why it has the liquid rocket engines installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG-Fighter (MSG0079) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?87aj9nuh78qldvj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ED/L LINK\u003C/a\u003E - Actually works remarkably well considering it is a giant sideways toaster. Can be landed reasonably safely with the parachute but using the brakes will cause it to explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFX-550 Sky Grasper (Mobile Suit Gundam SEED) \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?2panlucmhp891d2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ED/L LINK\u003C/a\u003E - This one is unable to fly with its present design. Simply doesn\u0027t get enough lift no matter what engines you throw in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mchizz","CreatedById":37072,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T02:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice Very Nice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxstar","CreatedById":42337,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T22:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eimages please:(\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T23:15:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn, I was expecting walking robots! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HYuy","CreatedById":9611,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T23:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, those are pretty spot on with the originals!
