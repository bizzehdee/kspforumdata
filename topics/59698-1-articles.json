Its engine, airframe, TPS, and pretty much every other technology are unproven. In theory, with some very optimistic margins, it should be capable of SSTO with a payload, but that\u0027s only theory.

We don\u0027t know how reliable it can be, what the service intervals or operation constraints will be, how much payload it can carry, how much it will cost to buy and fly, or if it can be economically viable.
