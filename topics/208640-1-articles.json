All must be calculated for good results, to check if a given equipment/setup lives up to the expectations. Don\u0027t get me wrong, as said, it is well possible for the somewhat experienced and aspirign, but not an trivial goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mentioned an observatory in your vicinity,\u00A0 sure they can explain things. The forum at cloudynights.com is a very good resource for all things atrophotography.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to get into that, don\u0027t bother with hunting artifical satellites in the beginning, observe visually, try images of the moon first, the big planets Saturn and Jupiter are also nice and the chances of success much higher. For deep sky, objects like Andromeda galaxy, the Plejades or the Orion nebula can nicely be imaged but need specific equipment due to their sizes (field of view, correction of errors of the telecope\u0027s optics play a role then, and fit of the sensor), before hunting such evasive objects as the ISS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-21T17:10:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2022 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Pixophir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
