I call it the \u003Cstrong\u003EStratos 7\u003C/strong\u003E, but I\u0027m still pretty uncertain about its name. Anyways, it\u0027s pretty cool in many aspects. Since its hull is partially made out of wings, it can really get some air and distance, and its wheels don\u0027t seem to break (I have a very light suspension going on). It uses a trick which gives it stability while driving and speed. It can drive far over 22 m/s, in fact, as fast until you break your wheels. It should turn stable up to 30 m/s, after that, its your own fault if you\u0027re not careful.
