Each one had a story, a background that mattered and together with the classic fighting system, the skill system (which I think was the best in whole FF history) and the epic story it made me play it 3 times and simply love every tiny piece of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMmmh second one is very difficult. FFX had a very good story but the world was very linear (don\\\u0027t know the right word :-[ ). FFVIII was my first FF so it gets bonus points ;P but yes the skill system was just wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to FFXII (there is no missing I, I really mean 12): I think the game is far better than it is handled among FF-fans. Don\\\u0027t get me wrong, the story and the characters were just boring and the fighting system new and exciting but nothing for all FFs to come. But think of the world. You are free to go everywhere and there are cities and villages with people, little stories and quests. IMHO this had could been the way a future FF could looked like (remember: only the points in the last sentence). The skill-system was also a bit more... FFIX? ;D Don\\\u0027t know how to explain but the skill system in these two FFs are my personal favourites as they are some kind of realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo where is VII? It is handled as one of the best FFs and I just don\\\u0027t get it. Why? I know that this is the first FF for a lot of people, so I ask the ones who are older or played it after VIII and so on. What is the part that makes you love this game more than the other FFs? For me this game was like getting from Monkey Island III to IV. 2D on SNES looked good. Why turning to an ugly 3D engine? Of course graphics are the last important part of FF but it gave me negative points which should be compensated on other parts but where? The story is good but also had some stretched parts... Please explain it to me.
