My current vessel is very large, and it\u0027s engines apparently are causing too much heat for the radiators, killing them (all ~16 of them) basically as soon as i start them. Even with heat cheat the heat from the radiators spreads very, very fast through the ship via conduction.

Maybe killed the number\u0027s bit-limit. Shot the thing into solar orbit and max radiation/timewarp, but no change.
