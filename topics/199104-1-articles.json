I have several probes which have small lander probes attached to them. When I decouple the lander\u00A0all control is lost, and its orbit speed it set to zero, with a time to AP of infinity. I can switch to the lander straight after I decouple, but if I go to the tracking station or something the name is either not listed or listed but I can\u0027t switch to it. I have a probe core on the lander, and when I switch to the craft it allows me to rename and things, but it doesn\u0027t respond to inputs.\u00A0 It has a full strength connection to the space centre.\u00A0 I have several craft all of the same design and they behave the same way - anything that\u0027s decoupled is bugged. They worked just fine before the update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a coding perspective, it seems when I decouple the \u0022new\u0022 craft that\u0027s created is bugged.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running a mildly modded install - It\u0027s most of Nertea\u0027s stockalike parts (which are great), kerbal engineer redux, kdex, and the MS3000 mini materials bay. As far as I know none of these are particularly heavy.\u00A0 All of these are uptodate I believe, I just went through and reinstalled the latest files this evening, and they were all marked as 1.5.1 (the other update/patch number?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[EDIT} I\u0027ve just tried launching a new craft of the same type and the issue persists, making it potentially save breaking....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas what could be causing this??
