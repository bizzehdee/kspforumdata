So technically, if we can get Lunic on the surface then we wont actually need to capture the transfer stage into orbit. Lunic burns 3/4 of its fuel supply at 1Mm above Minmus, this drops the approach velocity to more manageable speeds, decoupling the lander, Lunics transfer stage then burns all of its remaining fuel to slow down more and put its trajectory onto a collision course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PB22yfQ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PB22yfQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBreaking every rule in the landing handbook, Lunic III turns head down and burns towards Minmus trying to get as much lead over its transfer stage as possible.

Other than fuel stocks for the motor Nyx carries fixed position solar panels with a healthy battery stock, a 12Mm omni antenna and a 320Mm dish to allow it to contact KSC at any point in the asteroids predicted path. Nyx\u0027 very basic science payload is restricted to a single set of SR sensors, a magnetometer, a composition analyser and a thermometer, however the most important item carried is the \u0022Cats Paw\u0022 0.625m grabber, which will hopefully allow Nyx to hitch a ride.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA perfectly timed 355m/sec burn reduces Nyx\u0027 relative velocity with GFW-596 to practically nothing, at this point we realise that RCS thrusters would be useful to allow Nyx to move around the asteroid without needing to flip end over end all the time, fortunately it has a powerful enough reaction wheel to allow this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thermometer, SR sensors and probe report apparently show no signs of having detected an asteroid and no science is forthcoming, only the Magnetometer produces 30 Sci(near) and 45 Sci(attached) which is transmitted home.

The last flight of the Ic was plagued by what we shall call \u0022directional indecisiveness\u0022 both on ascent and decent, it is hoped that removing the triple motors and relocating the single radial parachute to a cone chute in the fairing structure a cleaner and less \u0027fighty\u0027 flight can be achieved. One issue of relocating the chute though is that the booster will now descend and land on its end rather than its side as before, this has necessitated the addition of 4 landing legs around the base.
