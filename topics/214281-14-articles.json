We go further, now we show only pictures and very short videos from the editor. Nobody noticed. Almost. What if we show a video with bad fps? Well, a couple of people grumble, the rest are happy. And another delay? What about early access with a roadmap? What about system requirements? Oh, the fans started grumbling more actively. How do you like the list of features that were still in KSP1, but which will not be in early access? There doesn\u0027t seem to be much outrage. And how do you like the release of early access, are there a lot of bugs? Oh, it seems that the fans have begun to suspect something, but the reviews are mixed, it seems that the bottom is still far away! What do you think about if the developers are silent for a week after the release? And how do you like a month without bug fixes? And we also decided to start reworking the planetary surface system, because before we didn\u2019t have time for this, but now it\u2019s important to start doing it!
