You might be one such person that doesn\u0027t like the \u0027new\u0027 KSP. \u0022So much has changed about it and it\u0027s no fun anymore\u0022 is the common underlying message that I\u0027m seeing from most people that are complaining. My response to that is quite simple - humans don\u0027t like change. Yes KSP has changed; its changed quite a lot, frankly. It is, to some degree, a more difficult game than what it used to be pre 1.0.x. All these changes in KSP, having been on the forum for quite the few years, are actually things that players have REQUESTED for a LONG time to be added into KSP. Well, the developers followed the requests of the community, and have finally added them in with the KSP 1.0.x release. Better aerodynamics? People screamed over it. Proper re-entry heat? Was on many people\u0027s wishlists. Mineable resources? I never came across one person that DIDN\u0027T want that. Ok, so the developers added all this in... and now what? Everyone criticises and complains over these additions that the community wanted to be added in. So, why don\u0027t you stop your complaining? The community as a whole asked for it, so it got implemented. Mind you, the features were probably on the development list for quite some time... my final response - treat the recent updates to KSP as thought you\u0027ve bought an entirely new game. Forget EVERYTHING you used to know about KSP - run through all the training and scenarios again, play around in sandbox getting the hang of things. And, for god sake, stop complaining to the devs about how horrible the game is now, in your eyes. The community asked for the goddamned features - put up with the learning curve if you want those features.\n\nAlso, 1000th post :3"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:41:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And, for god sake, stop complaining to the devs about how horrible the game is now, in your eyes.

A majority of people wanted the features, implementing the features would only induce a slight risk to loose revenue and earnings than if they were to not implement the features that a majority of people are asking for. Sure, it doesn\u0027t exactly make SENSE in a standard frame of mind, but most times the people who are not a part of that majority just put up with the features and work around them. Hence the slight risk I talked about above - its not like hundreds of players are going to riot against the game if they implement one feature that they didn\u0027t want. Squad have actually very gracefully implemented the new aero and thermal models, and with some config the game can be extremely pleasing, friendly and fun for new players and players who just want something a little EASIER, instead of the realistic behemoth of an aero and thermal model that is the stock normal difficulty."},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:50:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E forgive me, I hardly touched 1.0, only its subequent patches so I know not its troubles ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHehe...no, was just kidding around about arbitrary numerical evaluations.

Sure, that\u0027s not ALL their goals, but it marked a significant point in KSP\u0027s development in which all the initial goals were finally complete.

The movement to the 1.0 version for KSP upon the developers reaching their initial goals probably was not of the best decisions created by the team. But in the end, it was their choice - they decided to push forward for their 1.0 version despite the apparent backlash that was prompted by the movement. And, to some degree, I congratulate the handling by SQUAD and the team of that. Another thing to consider when pointing out the flaws and bugs whilst complaining about a game, is the difficulty that is ensured with creating a game (or any program of that matter) to this scale. I myself have a fair amount of experience with moderately large applications, and they are no easy feat. Managing bugs, issues, compatibility, etc. is a tough task, and TBPH I was sort of expecting more bugs than what is currently present due to the amount of completely new features added or overhauled within the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Sochin","CreatedById":78402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:04:46Z","Content":"Sorry I disagree with you, but I am not in the brash brutally bash the developers, QA and experimentals team but I will critices them fairly were its due. \n\nI would like to start by mirroring what has allready been said in this thread, since this is know a 1.0 release (personally this should have been a 0.95) there is no hiding behind Alpha status anymore and the gloves should come off (resonably though).\n\nLets address the big elephant in the room, KSP has surpassed one million in sales on steam so lets assume that all those paid the minimum price of around \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A314 then that is a very healthy turnover for squad. I would of expected better QA and testing prior to the 1.0 launch. We have been told in prior blogs that the QA and Testing teams are far larger than was first created so it is fair to say that the bugs that have been reported post release should really have been picked up. What I will commend Squad with is its very fast turnaround of 1.01 and 1.02, that I openly applaud you with welldone. But if you had taken a littl ebit more time, delayed till after Cinco de Mayo you may have saved yourselves a lot of grief. Which brings me on to my next point.\n\nSquad / Developers need to stop the Hype Train because this builds far too much expectation from your customers which only leads to there dissapointment and stress for the developers all of which could have been averted with a proffesional customer service, public relations and or marketing teams all of which Squad should allready have at there disposal. Patch day for me was hapazad and a little bit more information from Squad would of cut down a lot of questions, \u0027when is 1.0 been released\u0027 and \u0027soon\u0027. Make a plan and stick with it that should be interpreted as decide a release date and time and get your infrastructure and people all set up ready for go on that time.\n\nAs stated by Harvestor on a few devnote tuesdays 1.0 has all the elements that he envisioned having within the release game. I agree and disagree with that statement, yes it has all pieces of the puzzle but for me the image and presentation of parts leaves a little to be decided and I list the following.\n\n1. Aero parts dont match graphically, to many different greys and too much mixing of old and new parts.\n\n2. Fuel tanks are all over the place and they could do with matching. My point is you may have a fair few companies making your kit but when its delevered it looks as you want it finished very similar. A lot of NASA\u0027s kit is all white with deviations for the Delta main fuel tank and Shuttle main tank come to mind but generally Nasa\u0027s parts match fairly well, why cant KSP\u0027s.\n\n3. You are still missing parts from the mk3 Shuttle, naimly\n\na. A matching nose cone (its blue and grey with the mk3 kit being shades of grey). \n\nb. A shuttle Fuel Tank and decoupling system would be a good addition rather than using a radial decoupler which looks a little ugly used in that way.\n\nc. Mk3 Shuttle engine mounts would be good rather than having graphical clipping to get them off the ground.\n\nd. A mk3 set of integrated docking ports and a smaller crew tank (is a 16 capacity really needed). \n\ne. Mk2 nose cones shaped like the mk2 cockpit, I know this has been included in a mod but it should be in core game.\n\nf. Station parts dont match graphically, why you didnt include porkjets habitats is beyond me its not as if you dont have the funds to buy up IP\u0027s?\n\nNote for Squad:\n\nIf community contributers like Kickass Kyle, Winston, Tyberdyne, Helldriver and Carmics to name but a few can create exceptionally nice mods (KW Rocketry, Novapunch, KSOS and AIES that are graphically matching and complete then Squad should be able too aswell but your not doing so. Also I would like to state that 1.0 would have been far more complete with the addition of precedural fairings (for the clam shells rather than exploding fairings because hey if they blow they could damage what they are supposed to protect) and KAS just to be able to link modules together which would of made your very good resource element a lot more interesting for larger bases and would have matched up a little better with the NASA\u0027s Mars projects. And my last hit here is this, if a real world space agency has something our intrepid crash test kerbals should have there version. I think 1.0 was an exceptional good step in the right direction but, for me atleast, it should have been more polished if you are going to state that this is a release version, 8.5/10 from me could have been awesome.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T11:08:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sochin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:13:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One thing I pointed out in another thread, is that KSP is produced by a very small team of developers.

The term of \u0022proper aerodynamics\u0022 could be seen differently by different persons. What the devs thought to be a decent replacement for the previous aerodynamics model has brought out a lot of complaints within the community, and frankly, under a programming standpoint, there is nothing wrong with the aerodynamics model as it stands. It works. Not as perfectly as what would be seen, and the aerodynamics model must clearly be refined to become more, I guess \u0027accepted\u0027 by the community. As it stands, the aero model does work - it just isn\u0027t what the community would like/expect.\n\nEDIT: As seen in previous events, SQUAD opens intakes for Q\u0026A and experimental testers, and only people that have the knowledge to properly report a bug, etc, are accepted into the Q\u0026A and experimentals team. Yes, that should probably change, even if it means another section being made here in the forums purely dedicated to experimental and Q\u0026A releases. It wouldn\u0027t be too hard for SQUAD to implement a beta stream into steam to allow experimentals testing, and on the KSP store and other KSP outlets, once logged in they could just provide the choice of the current \u0027release\u0027 or the experimentals download. This too, I believe, would take out a lot of the hype as well, as @Sochin pointed out above, and allows for plenty more opportunities for experimental testing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T11:25:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 11:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ToTheMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sochin","CreatedById":78402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:27:14Z","Content":"What would have been handy for the Aero changes would have been a written and illustrated peice from the Devs on it.

But did you listen? NooOOOooo\u0022 in regards to releasing 1.0 so fast/not doing more Beta releases. A pretty large part of the community voiced concern over the matter and the devs went ahead with it anyway. Too a degree, I think the community was right; 1.0 would have been a lot cleaner and smoother if the new features had gotten a 0.95 release (flipping capsules and \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCberchutes would certainly have gotten noticed then). On the other hand Squad did a pretty good job of it, considering the circumstances, and I think as long as they keep fixing major issues quickly, it will be water under the bridge before too long."},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:52:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Changes aren\u0027t the problem.

Most of the things that sound like complaints are actually problems people are having. I make parts, and when parts don\u0027t snap anymore, it means the devs changed something, so we have to figure out what that is and fix those parts. \n\nThe problem is that we have an understanding of the way the engine and gameplay works, and when things change we want the correct understanding.\n\nAs for complaints, I have a few.\n\n-What is the point of the BACC rocket now?\n\n-Do the steering winglets actually steer, they sometimes appear to be steering the opposite direction\n\n-SAS does not actually hold a course (whats going on with the SAS). If they can\u0027t tune the SAS properly then I will just UG mechjeb and ignore it, they don\u0027t benefit from the criticism. \n\n-The 0.5 factor reaction wheels don\u0027t appear to do much anymore. \n\nFrom a modders point of view, why all the changes in cfg. Can\u0027t we get a heads up about what the tech tree is going to look like so we don\u0027t have so much \u0027orange\u0027 in the debug window. \n\nThere is plenty of room for complaints, but when you pay 13$ for a game, lol.\n\nComplaints are part of the system. If you don\u0027t want complaints, then game dev is the wrong field of work. I used to play WoW, they really messed up the game badly, IMO, and just quit and a whole bunch of people in my guild quit at the same time, they made the game tedious and boring. Have a whole bunch of Ipad games that just flushed. Most of them are just silly, I never complained about those games, don\u0027t really care enough about them to complain. So complaints are kind of an indicator that people care, if they don\u0027t care it means they\u0027re bored of the product, and that is the most dangerous situation for the developers. \n\nIMO, one of the richness (places is levels above WoW) of this game is modding and part design, that keeps the game interesting, so they do have to keep people at the mod-part dev level interested in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:29:13Z","Content":"I absolutely LOVE the new heating system. there are a few annoyances and bugs, but its not like its a bad system, and i actually like that you can nolonger do any entirely stupid things and get away with it as easily. 0.90 with its complete lack of reentry effects was just fail, ok it allowed you to reenter from any angle, but was this fun? i think not. Now its an actual challenge to pull off successful reentry, but its not impossible.\n\nThat said, im all for a minor reduction to reentry heat effects, perhaps 5-10%, just to make aerobraking a little bit easier, but if not its not like im going to complain, its still a great system even as is.\n\nNow as for the new memory leak i just fail to understand why the heck they rushed a feature into the game (i want a mod to perma disable it until fixed) and didnt even test that it causes mem leaks and crashes? Those heat guages are neat, but common, nuff with the annoying mem leakage!"}]}
