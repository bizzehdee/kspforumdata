C7 agreed - he intended it to swing forwards as it retracts, and he reversed it for the next release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot all aircraft use this, as sometimes landing gear fits much better when it swings backwards as it retracts - nosewheels on light aircraft are most likely to have this arrangement as that means they can be mounted much further forward which is the most stable configuration.
