However, they only require that you TAKE a crew report, not that you transmit or return them. That seems like a incredible oversight. I mean, there is an entire crew report and transmission system, then contracts come along that would be \u003Cstrong\u003Eideal\u003C/strong\u003E to make use of it and yet it is only barely used. Let me explain. This is a contract, right? Someone has asked you to go out and take a picture or make observations about an area. Who knows why. You\u0027d think they\u0027d want you to return with whatever information you\u0027d gathered, right? The same could be said about parachute data, or engine performance. You run the test. You\u0027d think it would add some type of report into your inventory which you could then transmit or recover to complete the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that contract objectives should only be completed when the reports they provide are actually transmitted or recovered. At bare minimum it could be a difficulty option like Kerbals that die or buildings being destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T21:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to also take a \u0022telemetry\u0022 report when activating the device to be tested under the proper conditions.

If you just send the telemetry of the test back, you get partial credit. But if you land (and recover) both the telemetry data and the component used in testing, you get full credit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts system does need some additions though. Hopefully they will be here Soon. Like launch vehicle mass limits, part limits, and DeltaV limits. Along with a required retrieval of mission data...
