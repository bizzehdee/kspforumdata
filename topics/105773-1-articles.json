I guess that they depend on real physics for heatflow. That\u0027s said, IR heat capacity of a body depends on material and Volume, therefore I assume they use the mass of a body for simplification (for tanks I\u0027ve recognized, that fuel is recognized too). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat radiation depends mostly on surface area in reality. And everyone knows that heat flows from hot to cool mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy conclusion: Use parts with high surface area relative to mass eg. solarpanels, airbrakes, structural panels etc. as heatsinks. Mount them near to the heat source. Perhaps even wings could be used as heatsinks, if they aren\u0027t the source eg during supersonic flights.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat works (im assuming ur having LV-N issues), is solars, wings, and the precooler thingy in front of it. The precooler seems to have a massive heat capacity and radiates well, and the solar panels radiate well, VERY well, not to mention they power ur ship. Aside from that, really anything strapped to teh side of a nuke will help, although ur bets off with large things such as wings. Fuel tansk also help, as they have very good heat capacity, but they arent quite as great at radiating it away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gavman420SSJ","CreatedById":128463,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei have a mining rig with a big solar panel and 16 wing sections and it still overheats to like 85%. this mechanic is broken as far as i\u0027m concerned\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill trying to figure out how to build my skylon again without burning up the front mounted AV-R8 winglets! :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do i even know if stuff is about to explode, i mean the visual mach and heat effects don\u0027t seem to have much to do with that? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StainX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022StainX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill trying to figure out how to build my skylon again without burning up the front mounted AV-R8 winglets! :/\u003Cp\u003EHow do i even know if stuff is about to explode, i mean the visual mach and heat effects don\u0027t seem to have much to do with that? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPress alt f12 and turn on thermal debug things under physics section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StainX","CreatedById":57820,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T05:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Radam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Radam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPress alt f12 and turn on thermal debug things under physics section.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure debug, but that looks not like it should be done that way!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about cooling those winglets? is it even possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T09:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gavman420SSJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gavman420SSJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei have a mining rig with a big solar panel and 16 wing sections and it still overheats to like 85%. this mechanic is broken as far as i\u0027m concerned\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels are not always useful for radiating heat... primarily because the system \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E calculates the effects of sun exposure. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your mining rig is powered by solar panels, then during the day, the panels turn themselves to expose as much area to the sun as possible, so they can generate the most power.

Things like wing sections almost always beat solar panels by a wide margin simply because they don\u0027t rotate themselves to face the sun - especially if you can mount them so that they will stay edge-on towards the sun for the entire day (though this requires you landing your vessel in the correct orientation towards the sun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best radiator would be one that actively orients itself edge-on to the sun in the same way that solar panels orient themselves face-on.
