I\u0027m not talking about major issues, like staging errors, but the small oversights.\n\nFor me, it was when I was building a space station, had it mostly finished, so I built a shuttle to move between that one, and an earlier one I built. I had RCS, had plenty of fuel, and fuel lines and all, it was perfect. So I flew it up, and lined up for docking. And, as I thrust forward, I wasn\u0027t getting the pull I expected, so I tilted my camera, and realized I didn\u0027t have a docking port."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:47:19Z","Content":"Reversing the docking port on my first IP mission\n\nArgh"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:56:54Z","Content":"Usual list of suspects when something goes wrong for me:\n\nForgot to attach solar panels.\n\nForgot to deploy solar panels.\n\nForgot to attach a battery.\n\nAdded RCS, but no MonoProp.\n\nAdded MonoProp, but no RCS.\n\nForgot SAS.\n\nToo much SAS.\n\nThe list goes on ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CreatureX","CreatedById":144112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T20:43:21Z","Content":"Batteries and solar panels are the bane of my existance."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T21:07:23Z","Content":"Lately I\u0027ve forgotten minor things a lot more often than I remember doing in the past, most notably:\n\n- Oxidizer for Vernor engines on nuclear rockets (turns out they need it even if the LV-N doesn\u0027t)\n\n- Docking ports on station modules (le derp)\n\n- Enough batteries to keep the ship running through the night (200 units doesn\u0027t cut it any more)\n\n- LIGHTS\n\n- Reaction wheels.
