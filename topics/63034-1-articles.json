The thing is, it depends a lot in the situation. Maybe I can do a space station of about 350 parts, but cant fly a jet with 150\u002B at high speed in the atmosphere (air and re-entry effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy noob head though about that, and I came to a conclusion: The thing that is killing my FPS has to be the physics calculations (the most. part count obviously lower my FPS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current PC is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei7 860 @2.80GHz (one of the firsts i7. dual channel memory)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12GM RAM at 1.666mhz (too much, was not planned, my father computer broke and there was no use for his 4Gb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 7 64bits (playing KSP 0.23 with mods, but happens w/o them too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENVIDIA GeForce GTX 660Ti, 4Gb(DxDiag says 4, but I think it has 2Gb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can play most of the games with all settings in ultra, but these games tend to demand more GPU than CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I correct to think that the hardware limiting my Kerbal performance is the CPU?, Is it logical that my CPU can\u0027t handle all the physicis in time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask this because lowering the graphic settings doesnt seem to affect my FPS a lot (just a little, but I cant go near 400 parts w/o laggin as hell).

If you are concerned with price, you will have to sacrifice some performance. You also have to consider your Motherboard\u0027s form factor and socket size. It looks like you have a LGA1156, which I believe won\u0027t have new CPU\u0027s will be designed for, unlike the LGA1150, which Intel plans on continuing to support. (I can upgrade for the foreseeable future.) Feel free to message me for help if you are going to buy a new CPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
