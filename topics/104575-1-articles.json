I have seen this in quite a few YouTube videos, that rocket engines (or rather more precisely their nozzles) are moving (thrust vectoring) when the ship\u0027s controls are being used. Though my rockets / ships are manouvering just fine, I seem to not have this kind of behaviour where the rocket nozzles (and the exhaust) are swiveling.\n\nI first thought this was due to some bug (though I tried it in a vanilla install and it won\u0027t show either). Any pointers how I could have them nice swivelling rocket engines? ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nSebastian"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T06:52:52Z","Content":"Only some engines gimbal.

In order for the gimbal to work properly you have to stage the engines using the space bar. That is a known bug as far as I know. If you use action groups or right click to activate them for example, they won\u0027t gimbal at all. It might also be a visual option in the options menue but I\u0027m not sure on that one. My engines and also the exhaust gimbal very obvious.
