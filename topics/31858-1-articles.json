All those intakes are useless at high altitudes. You need the blue glowy ones, those work up high. The big scoops, turbines, and nacelles currently serve no useful purpose other than aesthetics. With a 3:1 or 4:1 Intake:Engine ratio and carefully reducing your throttle, you should be able to keep the engines active well into the 30-32km range. Also, you seem a bit over-engined - make the last engine a single rear engine in the center, this should also protect you from flameouts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cranium","CreatedById":69153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T14:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, okay. I was not aware that different intakes have different altitude efficiency ratings. So I could just swap out my front intakes for the \u0027blue glowy ones\u0027, and I can swap out the nacelles for fuel. I currently like my twin engine design in the center, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can cut the drag then, by reducing the amount of intakes I have as well. I think if I get rid of the radial intakes surrounding the body, but leave the wing engine intakes, I should be fine, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-07T14:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do not have any rockets on it?
