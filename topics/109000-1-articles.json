But since the release, it seems like the contracts are asking for impossible things... here is an example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUILD A NEW ORBITAL STATION AROUND KERBIN:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have a facility supporting at least thirteen kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have a research lab at the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have a viewing cupola at the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Have 4,000 units of liquid fuel in your station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the usual orbital station requierements (antenna docking port, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13 kerbals?! 4k of liquid fuel?!?! :confused:Thats a lot! Now, I\u0027m not sure if I can make this contract with multiple launches... but considering how little they pay (190k), I think this contract just doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this requirements wont let you make your stations the way you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo straight to the point, I have 2 questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I achieve this contracts with multiple launches?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan I modify the requirements of this contracts to fulfill my desires?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T14:14:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aristizabal95\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T04:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0027t too far fetched.
