On rocket takeover, you just don\u0027t have enough thrust to offset the gravity losses. There are a couple of different fixes for that. First, you could airhog to higher speeds, either by adding moar intakes, or by throttling down to keep the jets alive (apparently mechjeb 2.0 does that automatically). You could also add more rocket thrust, of course, either by switching the nukes with another kind of engine, or by adding small radials, but that would mean lower isp significantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd last, and this may or may not work, you could just slightly change the flight profile. When you are nearing flameout, but not quite there yet, build up lots of vertical speed. How? Well, light the rockets (without turning off the jets), and throttle down to 2/3rds thrust (so you don\u0027t flame out for a while longer). Then pitch up to raise you apoapsis as high as you can, and give you time when the jets flame out completely to build speed to lower the gravity losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
