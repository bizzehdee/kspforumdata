So I thought why not ask the KSP Community to create some kind of Mod Compilation that expands KSP in a way that the early tech might get some love and to include some late game experimental tech. Everything garnished with some must have tools like MechJeb for example.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would help new players to get started with modding and players that might want to enjoy a new approach at the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you propose a mod for this Compilation always have in mind that it should not be overpowered its\u00A0tech level and not make the game too easy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Goal for this Thread would be that everyone that has an Idea for this Mod Compilation responds to Thread in the following way.
