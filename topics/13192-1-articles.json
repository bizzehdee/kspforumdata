If you try to land a monster rocket, you probably have to get the speed below 0.5m/s without exploding, while a small rocket with say 1 engine and 1 tank you could go closer to 8m/s or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also really need to use landing struts. The more landing struts, the less force each of them has to take, and the harder you can touch down. Overdoing it is a bad idea though, as they do have mass. I like to use 4 placed by the symmetry tool on my small designs, and 12 or so on larger designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you come in for landing it is best to kill horizontal velocity early so you don\\\u0027t have to worry about it on the final descent. Watch the green circle with x retrograde marker on your navball and burn on it until it is exactly vertical. Then, all you have to do is slow down. I am told that RCS thrusters help for this, but I personally think that people only use RCS thrusters because they are wimps, and adding them is just a waste of mass. Personal preference however, they may help for your first landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final tip is to try to choose a landing site near the center of a large crater rather then near the edges, as this area will tend to be much flatter, and easier to land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS Can you post a craft file or screenshots? \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bomb765","CreatedById":25553,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T21:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bomb765","CreatedById":25553,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T22:33:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know this may be a stupid question, but can you use parachutes on the moon?

No atmosphere, no parachutes. For braking, I recommend either the tiny engine (LVT-909, I believe) or a crapload of RCS.

If you try to open a parachute it is not going to open because it lacks the pressure. Try to kill your horizontal speed to land on the mun. As you get close to the surface adjust your vertical velocity so you can touch down safely. I always make a circular orbit around 10km then descent (not fuel efficient but safer).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackBicycle","CreatedById":29657,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-24T23:48:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGd_BFu9e10?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket you will need will differ from the one in the video, as it is one of the previous versions, but the method is perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bomb765","CreatedById":25553,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-25T00:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol, ok thanks.
