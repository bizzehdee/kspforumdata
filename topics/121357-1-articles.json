It\u0027s a simple thing with a comms dish, scanner, themometer, batteries and an excessive amount of solar panels. It\u0027s very light and mounted on a T200 with Spark engine, so it gets around 3,200 dV once place in LKO. Plenty of dV, even for 3.7x, but no so much that I can afford to waste hundreds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI jut successfully put a similar satellite into polar Mun orbit by launching into a polar Kerbin orbit, then setting up the transfer so that I cam in directly over the Mun\u0027s pole, no plane change required. I want to do the same thing for Minmus, but I\u0027m running into an interesting problem. As you can guess from the subject line, when I try to set up a trans-Minmus injection, I hit escape velocity before I reach Minmus orbit because of the 3.7x scale. This puts me in a tough spot, caue I don\u0027t really want to raise my LKO to keep the transfer inside Kerbin SOI, since this will almost certainly cost several hundred dV in doing the maneuver and the loss of Oberth effect. So I\u0027d really like to be able to go on an escape trajectory that intersects Minmus SOI, but the maneuver node and target system do not lend themselves very well to this task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how should I go about plotting the node? You don\u0027t get close approach position estimates unless your orbit crosses the target, so I can\u0027t do my usually method of determining the tranfer time. Minmus SOI is very small too, so I don\u0027t think I can just eyeball it and guess. Anyone done a maneuver like this before?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T15:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NFunky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NFunky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI jut successfully put a similar satellite into polar Mun orbit by launching into a polar Kerbin orbit,\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that\u0027s not the actual question but you don\u0027t have to go to a polar orbit to achieve that.

Time your launch and angle correctly to end up in the same 6degree plane as Minmus. Plan and execute your transfer burn like normal. Perform your plane change as soon as you enter Minmus\u0027 SOI. High above the surface a plane change is incredibly cheap. Circularize at Pe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T17:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess just forget about what I said about polar orbits. The Kerbin polar to Mun polar was for SCANSat, to give me a full Kerbin scan before heading to the Mun to scan it too in the same mission. I got a new scanner from research, so I thought I\u0027d do the same thing for this mission as well. I am definitely willing to forgo the Kerbin scan to make the Minmus mission more feasible though, so I just now launched the sat into 6 degree co-planer LKO. Got a little over 3,300 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still having the exact same problem with planning the intercept though. I hit escape velocity while my apoapsis is still many thousands of km short of Minmus\u0027 orbit. I suppose with the extra 100 or so dV saved from not launching polar, I can just raise my AP on the burn side of Kerbin, but I feel like I\u0027m going to have to raise is to at least 300 km to lower my transfer velocity. Is there a more economical approach? There has to be right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T17:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEither you\u0027re doing something terribly wrong or you\u0027re describing it terribly wrong.
