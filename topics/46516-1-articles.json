This would allow us to start off with certain Gimbals locked, Gear Extended, and Torque disabled for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe should be able to test and toggle action groups in the VAB to see how parts are going to animate. Lights, Gear, and Solar Panels, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny action that can be Toggled should also have \u0022Activate\u0022 and \u0022Deactivate\u0022 entries in the available actions. For example, Gear can be Toggled, Raised and Lowered, but an Engine Gimbal can only be Toggled; there should be Lock and Unlock options for engine Gimbals as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStaging Interface / Screen\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a right-click menu to the Staging Stack icons, that is the same as the part that it is associated with.

This could be another hover / toggle-able panel next to Resources. Alternately, the Flight instrument (altitude, rate of ascent, atmosphere) should be toggle-able between Surface (or Flight) mode, as the current mode, to Orbital mode that displays the basic orbit vitals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENav Ball (Staging, Docking, and Orbital modes)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe throttle should be click-able - allowing the user to set the throttle with a mouse click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCA and SAS buttons should be click-able.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage Light should be a clickable button to allow us to Lock / Unlock staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbit Screen\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Space Center should be a permanent \u0022Flag\u0022 location that\u0027s always an available target from the Orbit screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEVA\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen we are controlling a Kerbal on EVA, give us a simple fuel read-out gauge in one of the corners of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T20:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOne additional suggestion\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
