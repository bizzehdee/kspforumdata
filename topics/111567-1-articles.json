Especially since there\u0027s a similar in-game tutorial contract for rendezvous as well. Also, as far as I know, the first orbital docking attempt was on Gemini 6 - and would have been between two separately launched spacecraft, Gemini and (unmanned) Agena had the Agena not been destroyed at launch. The first successful docking attempt was on Gemin 8 - again with a separately launched Agena docking target.\n\nEdit: I like the mission success text for both contracts. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:04:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure the contract states that two separate vehicles need to be involved, so undocking and redocking one vessel isn\u0027t going to count, sorry."}]}
