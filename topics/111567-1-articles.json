If the game wont allow this, it makes no sense to me since the first docking attempt in real life was done with the empty ascent stage. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Default\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Default\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the game wont allow this, it makes no sense to me since the first docking attempt in real life was done with the empty ascent stage. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does your contractor care about what happened in real life?

Especially since there\u0027s a similar in-game tutorial contract for rendezvous as well. Also, as far as I know, the first orbital docking attempt was on Gemini 6 - and would have been between two separately launched spacecraft, Gemini and (unmanned) Agena had the Agena not been destroyed at launch. The first successful docking attempt was on Gemin 8 - again with a separately launched Agena docking target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I like the mission success text for both contracts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:07:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the contract states that two separate vehicles need to be involved, so undocking and redocking one vessel isn\u0027t going to count, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
