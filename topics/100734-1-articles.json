Now I will say that the general populatation of these forums appears to be somewhat more mature in the way they deal with each other than the average online community I have come accross, but it cannot be denied that there is also a certain amount of negativity whenever a big change comes along or if a decision is made that some do not agree with. Many Devnotes, for example, have replies that are extremely negative towards Squad and other users. Or when a feature is implemented in a way we don\u0027t like (such as the change to new forum software), we have a tendency to speak very unkindly about it. But then there are also some good examples of people disagreeing with each other but being very polite about it. The *Positive Forum Movement* has been around for a while now, and it\u0027s good to see how some people are actively looking for ways to change, not the *opinions*, but the *attitudes* of others.\n\nI\u0027m sure most of us would like the forum to be even more positive, so what can we do about it? Telling negative people not to be negative is unlikely to help, but there is a way that just might. Here are a few simple things we can keep in mind, which - little by little - can make a difference.\n\n- If someone attacks you (or someone else) for your opinion, spelling, design or anything else, don\u0027t tell them off. Instead, make it your goal to cheer them up. Try asking for suggestions on how to improve\n- If someone picks at you for something small and insignificant they don\u0027t like you doing, something that\u0027s not even against the rules; tell them you\u0027re thankful for the suggestion and you will try to think of it next time you post. Be careful not to sound patronizing or sarcastic; it must be sincere.\n- If you feel strongly about something, don\u0027t give others the feeling that you think your opinion is more important than theirs. Instead, calmly explain how you feel and why you feel that way - others will be more likely to take your opinion seriously that way\n- If you see someone \u0022put out a fire\u0022 by replying well to a provocative comment, **click the \u0022Like this\u0022 button for that post** and consider even telling them in a private message why - it will encourage them to do it again\n- Most importantly, no matter how you are treated by someone else, treat them the way you believe they would like to be treated.\n\nNone of this means we should just be quiet and accept things we don\u0027t like. It just means that there is a better way of getting our point across than being negative or writing harsh words about it. Constructive criticism can actually come accross as very positive if we put some thought into it.\n\nTo sum it up, be the person you would like others to be.\n\nWill it work? No doubt about it. Even if a single person does this just one time, it will make a difference."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:32:02Z","Content":"My name is Red and I approve of this post."},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:32:50Z","Content":"My name is not Red, but I approve this post anyways."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:42:01Z","Content":"No one is ever swayed by harsh words, at most all the arguer can gain is the animosity of those around them.\n\nHarshly worded criticism has no more value than unfounded criticism, but if you put forward your points civilly you\u0027ll find others more welcoming to your words.\n\nExpress yourself in regular ways, not confrontational ways, and you\u0027ll find things a lot smoother ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u002Brepped"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:53:40Z","Content":"I was going to jokingly reply \u0022This is dumb and you\u0027re dumb for posting it\u0022 but was worried that you or a future visitor to this thread wouldn\u0027t see it was a joke ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI like this.
