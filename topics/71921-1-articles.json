I am sort of experienced with flight-sims, because I had FSX, Microsoft Flight Simulator for DOS or something like that. Some people called me a noob when I had Flight Simulator X, because I didn\u0027t know how to work the orbit controls when flying Space Shuttles. These are my weaknesses when It comes to working rockets in orbit/take off. Spaceplanes I definitely understand, because the controls are somewhat familiar. I plan on making mods for Kerbal Space Program, like something that, when traveling at Mach 1 or higher, the navball will display Mach [Any Number from 1-4]. Please do not dislike the mods I have up for display, because I am new to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-10T14:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWElcome to the forums and it seems you already have a good basis.
