Regular missions you can. But something I noticed that might happen with Random contracts is that if you take one.. And its a long mission (say to Duna or Jool) and you don\u0027t do the whole mission in one sitting, then the random generator will skip the mission and set up more. (I will work on this problem in next update, most likely will have to lock the mission down until its finished). Its perfectly safe to do it with Custom contracts though. Since those do not reset unless you decide to do it yourself. So in a nutshell.. If its a Regular Mission, and or a Custom contract Mission yes you can leave the vessel and come back (values are saved).. But for now Don\u0027t do it with the Random Contracts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERevert Stock cost nothing. But you risk messing up your Save file.
