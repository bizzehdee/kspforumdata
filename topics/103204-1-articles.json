Did you look? Examples: Propellers that work in all atmospheres. Inflatable ships. Jets that run in non-oxygen atmospheres. There are tons of mods that support gameplay on Eve.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The pressures there are so bad that stock parts blow up and all mods also use the same mechanics.\n\nMany people, self included, have done stock missions just fine on Eve. Eve is one of the hardest places to return from, but it is definitely possible and fun with stock parts.

I think all the planets are fun to land on and return from (excluding Jool - that\u0027s flirting with disaster). But Laythe is somewhat more similar to Kerbin than Duna, and exists in an exotic environment. Plenty to see and do around Jool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T05:15:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 05:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yasmy**"},{"CreatedByName":"lextacy","CreatedById":107955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T06:22:07Z","Content":"Parts are blowing up on vessel reloads after they have landed.

The fact you rely on a mod to reinforce your joints is a good indicator of this. No one should need to post a video here to satisfy you; a quick look at the Eve Rocks Challenge thread and several other sources on this forum will show you that a great many players have landed on Eve with completely stock ships, and not had them blow up even on reloads. A small but significant subset of those players have even managed to get back to orbit. \n\nWhy not post a picture or .craft of your ship? (the non-exploded version) There may be something you\u0027ve missed in the design that your fellow rocket scientists can help you with. \n\nAlternatively, download one of the many .craft files of stock Eve ships available on the forum and see if that one works in your game."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T13:30:08Z","Content":"Are you using the most current version of KJR?"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T15:13:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I dont buy into stock parts performing \u0022fine\u0022 on Eve.

Don\u0027t accuse all of us who have successfully done Eve return with stock parts of cheating, especially when a cursory search will show you lots of [working](forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95642) [examples](forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76153) (you can even download craft files and try them yourself!).

There\u0027s nothing inherently different with Eve than with Kerbin. Just supped up numbers. Their gravity is even similar.
