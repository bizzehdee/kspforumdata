The bug was that the ships were counted as flying low instead of landed and that prevented returning to space center or contract completion. Also kerbals had EVA problems interacting with the planets. I\u0027ve fixed these bugs in the last tester build, where Project Pluto tested one of the new fixed configs and even shown some pictures!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, releasing multiple parts of a simple hotfix seems rather unprofessional and my reputation would crack down to nothing (as it might already happened) so people would no longer like the mod seeing how disscorganised the releases would be. But tehnicaly, there would be no other problem if I would release my part of the hotfix today, but I would be ignorant not waiting for the rest of the team that, remember has irl things to do!
