I had accepted the contract over a week ago(irl) and had nothing near there. No credits or money was rewarded for contract completion. Also all my kerbals disappeared and six or seven newb kerbals showed up in my roster. the nav ball suddenly started showing 270 deg. orientation instead of 90 deg.(270 showing where 90 should be) when sitting at launch pad. If launched it heads true 90 deg. But Nav ball shows heading to 270 deg.(again where the 90 deg mark should be) the rocket just keels over to 90 deg. and plows into the ground. I am using the following mods, Mechjeb, KWS,MKS/OKS, KAS ,TAC-LS, kerbonite and Kerbal clock. I tried restarting and it reappears, hate to start over again....Ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T20:00:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using one of the probe cores? You probably have it rotated upside down or something.

I know MechJeb used to have the problem back in 0.24, maybe earlier, where if you didn\u0027t place the object vertically, the navball would be off kilter.
