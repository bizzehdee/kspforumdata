But you will have to work out the exact values needed. To increase how far the missile travels before the engine start you need to increase the decouple speed.\u00A0 Also you will need to set the drop time. do note that extended drop times on air launched missiles can lead to the missile slowing and falling behind the craft before the missile engine starts which can in turn result in the missile striking your craft.\u00A0 For tube style launchers short drop times to prevent missiles contacting launcher are advised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
