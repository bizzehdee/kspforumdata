You can prevent most of the flipping by merely having a low COM (wide wheelbase) but only downforce will give you traction for more...sporty performance, though cornering you\u0027ll always want to either go slow or have downthrusters. The nice thing is that downthrusters and \u0022more mass\u0022 are one and the same goal, just carry fuel tanks for both ballast and for fueling downthrusters and you\u0027ll find Minmus\u0027s gravity is just a number. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus also has nice natural highways built into it.

This can be a handy thing if you have shipwrecked crew or a craft out of fuel as you can count on being able to reliably cross the flats in really short time spans to save them.
