Now, however, I\u0027m getting better and my little Kerbalnaut is actually surviving some of my test flights. Therein lies my problem. Once you land safely, how do you get back to the hangar to rebuild or start over. The only way I\u0027ve been able to figure it out is to exit the game and restart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for your assistance.

Because I\u0027m sure you can just press Escape when you have landed and click the End Flight Button, you would be able to leave flights there and resume them later but since you got the demo currently you can\u0027t. Try and buy the game eventually it\u0027s great, especially with the recent 0.17 update, adding planets and other moons to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun playing KSP and go blow up some rockets! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maxthrust","CreatedById":54178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T15:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, I bought the simulator after only a couple of hours playing the demo.
