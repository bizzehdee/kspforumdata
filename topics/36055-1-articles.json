Like a lot of startups, we have our challenges but we also have a real passion for the work we\u0027re doing. That sounds all cheesy but it\u0027s true. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve got some similarities to what Copenhagen is doing but we\u0027re more focused on improving life with space technology. I don\u0027t want to take an official stance on what they are working on but personally I think it\u0027s great.

I did not think I would get to talk directly to the person in charge. I do greatly advise you to play KSP if you don\u0027t its a great game. I am very noob at it in many ways still, and it amazes me to see so many peoples of all ages learn the basics of space flight and navigation with a fun game and get so good at planning mission and trajectories. The essence of it is so complicated and alien, yet it will be required if ever we advance to the stage where you can actually say \u0022I am a space pilot and travel the solar system with my own ship\u0022. If it ever gets to this, maybe kids who played a video game will already grasp the fundamentals and excel at them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my question for you would be what are your plans to get us there? Will giving you money really advance this cause?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"troyd","CreatedById":73469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T03:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all for the concepts of KSP and gamification is an excellent way to create interest and learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow will SpaceUnited get us into space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur general plan is to create what are called \u0022minimum viable products\u0022 and test them against the market. Our goal with these products is to create recurring revenue and provide new opportunities for space exploration to the general public. We\u0027re starting small, building on our successes, and doing our best to provide solutions to unmet human needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake for example our SHIM-1 mission. Satellite images are already used on a daily basis to save lives but not everyone has access to them. By pooling organizations together and teaching nonprofits and NGO\u0027s how to make use of existing space technology, we close a gap. We\u0027re working with Digital Globe, the worlds largest satellite image provider, to test a pilot program. If this proves to be useful, we\u0027ll expand on the mission. If not, we\u0027ll learn from the process and adjust accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this creates demand and capital. Only difference with a nonprofit is that instead of that capital going into bonus and big salaries, the money is driven back into our mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can give you other examples of the work that we\u0027re doing but the bottom line is that when people give to SpaceUnited, the money goes towards uniting people through space exploration that helps people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-06T05:31:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a very noble goal troyd. Such initiative is urgently needed to reignite broad interest in space.

One of my friends is working for an NGO based is Cameroun that works on model forests across Africa.

I am not sure what exactly he is doing, but in my mind it can really profit from good satellites images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will also think about making a donation, if I do it will be something small has I am just an humble engineer but I approve of your goals and means and I admire your efforts, god speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
