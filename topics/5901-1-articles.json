So, my thoughts going the way they do, I tried to use the moon to slingshot into a Very High Kerbin Orbit (which I will refer to as VHKO). There\\\u0027s a funny little thing that happens with high apoapsides - the higher they are, the less ? - v they take to make the same change in the altitude of the periapsis. While in Munar orbit, I burned to about 4.5 million meters. About 2 million meters out, I left the Mun\\\u0027s SOI, and was in a VHKO; right on the border between orbiting Kerbol and Kerbin (both the map view and the camera were spazzing out) It may be a bug, but that\\\u0027s a lagrangian point right there. Even with a tiny burn (.1 m/s of ? - v) it stopped.
