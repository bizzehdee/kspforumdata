SSTO works great up until 10,000m at which point it becomes almost entirely unstable whenever I attempt to make the gravity turn. If I wait until past 30,000m it is completely stable as well, but I don\u0027t quite have the fuel differential to wait that long to begin circularizing the orbit. Any ideas why I lose control and how I could fix it? I\u0027ve done everything I can think of - adding wings to every part, removing parts, ect. Fuel drains out of the top first before the bottom orange tanks and finally the nukes. Main engines are all aerospikes which is part of why control is difficult, but it shouldn\u0027t be impossible right? Would SAS or ASAS help? if so, where do I put them? 7 units weren\u0027t enough to make me stable (on top of orange tanks and top of rocket).

Having control surfaces above the CoM will result in exactly the kind of problems you\u0027re describing, though from your description, it sounds like you put them there after you started having problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second thing I thought was \u0022Huh?\u0022 It looks like you\u0027ve got fuel lines going all over the place. You\u0027ve got drills on the radial big orange tanks, which isn\u0027t a problem, but it really looks like you\u0027re trying to asparagus stage engines/tanks that you\u0027re not dropping. The extra fuel lines are probably creating fuel loops, which can cause non-symmetrical fuel usage, and that can cause some of the problems you were seeing. However, that source of problems wouldn\u0027t happen only when you\u0027re doing the gravity turn, so I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the root of the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should have one fuel line running from each of the orange tanks to the center stack (doesn\u0027t matter where you connect to it), and one fuel line running from the center stack to each of the atomic engines (or the fuel tank they\u0027re attached to). Yes, that\u0027s how the Kethane converter works, with fuel lines from the fuel tank to the converter, if that\u0027s why you\u0027ve got so many extra fuel lines. The converter consumes a negative amount of fuel, so the fuel lines transfer a negative amount of fuel from the tank to the converter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, where\u0027s your power to run all those drills and the converter? I see some batteries, but no stock power generation parts. It could be a mod part I\u0027m not recognizing, but I just wanted to check.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just1ChanceFree","CreatedById":60504,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T04:59:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m realizing I may have loaded the wrong image of the rocket I\u0027m currently working on, the current one has 12x giant solar panels and everything else where it should. Good catch though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn fuel lines: It was something weird about the kethane mod and this specific design that when I have a fuel line that goes from outside orange tanks into the center converter, it uses the fuel from the top-part orange tank last and makes the whole craft overly top-heavy. As the fuel is currently set up, it does in fact drain from the top first, then the outer orange tanks, and finally the small tanks near the nuke. Not entirely sure why it does work correctly, but I\u0027ve checked it by right clicking on tanks mid-flight. I think since each of the orange tanks is connected to each other and it won\u0027t drain from the same tank twice it will now finally see the top tank as the furthest away from the engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn winglets: for some reason when I put winglets on the orange tanks at the bottom it will shift my center of lift outside of the center line (to the left). Even if I place them using the symmetry feature. The original design had 2 at the bottom of each tank on either side of the drill. No dice. It still acted like the top was receiving too much drag while the bottom wasn\u0027t experiencing enough air resistance to keep it aligned. My guess is what I\u0027m experiencing is something odd from how the game calculates the drag on parts like the aerospikes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mewp","CreatedById":40351,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T06:55:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a video that might actually help a bit here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_usTekNJ0M?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..but perhaps you already know what\u0027s going on with the COM and COL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, it\u0027s ok to put control surfaces ahead of your COM, it is only the static aerodynamic surfaces (wings, fins, etc..) that should be aft of your COM. That being said, control surfaces ahead of your COM should be strictly controlled using ASAS (or some form of control system) as without that they\u0027re just the same as a static wing (and thus detract from your stability if they\u0027re ahead of the COM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought about your setup is this: you\u0027re using aerospikes, which have no gimbaling ability. As your rocket fly\u0027s through the atmosphere your control surfaces slowly become less and less effective - what I suspect is happening is at 10000m or so you\u0027re hitting a point at which your forward control surfaces can no longer keep you stable (they just can\u0027t grab enough air to keep the rocket stable) and your aerospikes, unlike other engines that can gimbal, aren\u0027t doing anything to help keep your rocket in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy recommendation: get some more control surfaces aft of your COM, and one thing that should help is having RCS for when you reach higher altitudes. For rockets without gimbaling nozzles there is no form of control when you\u0027re in the vacuum of space without RCS and SAS torque (which isn\u0027t a whole lot to begin with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joppiesaus","CreatedById":57698,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T08:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour problem with your SSTO is that the engines have no gimbal.

I\u0027m able to stabilize after spinning laterally about 2160 degrees (6 full revolutions). I still feel like something odd is going on here. Also it is no longer SSTO but that might only be due to steering losses while spinning.
