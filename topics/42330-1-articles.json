After a few seconds they suddenly stopped working and made the flame-out noise which was odd, so i looked at the fuel tanks and it said that only the oxidiser was gone. I then realised that it had used liquid fuel from the planes fuselage \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E. I could make the rockets last longer if i had tanks with only oxidiser in them, it would also be useful in other situations as well.
