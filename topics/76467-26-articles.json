I have a certain \u0027priority\u0027 of mods. First is function, then its parts, then it\u0027s eye candy. EVE is an \u0027eye candy\u0027 mod, and is therefore the very last of my worries. In my view EVE has to be compatible with my function mods and parts before I consider it, and it\u0027s up to EVE (or any eye candy) to be compatible with those. I also don\u0027t feel it\u0027s the function or parts mods responsibility to do that. If eye candy isn\u0027t compatible, it\u0027s not installed, if memory becomes an issue, it\u0027s the first to go. If there can be some reciprocal back scratching between the two, that\u0027s fine, as long as I don\u0027t lose function or parts because of it. Ex. I\u0027m not giving up function x or part y in order to gain eye candy z. Just my 2c. Obviously some other people want things, what I\u0027d call \u0027pretty\u0027, and if it\u0027s not \u0027pretty\u0027 then they won\u0027t play. To each his own. Just a warning to those who are like that, don\u0027t expect \u0027pretty\u0027 out of RO. It may act like a duck and sound like a duck, but it very well could be a very damn ugly duck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetwave","CreatedById":97965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T14:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes installing the actual RO download give anything extra that the required mods do not?

(Personally I\u0027m running all 2048 textures except Earth at this time.)
