They\u0027re mostly an aesthetic choice that may make the rocket a bit more efficient and a bit easier to control. Unless new stock aerodynamics are much less forgiving than FAR, you can always launch the payload unprotected on a bit larger rocket, and start the gravity turn a bit later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T11:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vallius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vallius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs long as procedural fairing\u0027s don\u0027t allow completely ridiculous geometries, I\u0027m all for that.
