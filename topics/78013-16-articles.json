Not that complicated a plane anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Nope, complete rebuild (of the jet, not SSTO) and I\u0027m still barely able to get off the ground, if at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: I\u0027m not sure this is a NEAR issue. I uninstalled it and although the engine was more powerful, it was still weaker than I expected it to be for stock. It\u0027s almost like it\u0027s been nerfed, but to an unusable level. I\u0027m gonna try re downloading the whole game and after that I\u0027ll discuss it in the support forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T23:39:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T23:46:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIssue confirmed, fixed, and a new version has been uploaded to fix the gamebreaking issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T00:08:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIssue confirmed, fixed, and a new version has been uploaded to fix the gamebreaking issue.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh thank you so much, I was beginning to think I was going insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Much better, got all the way to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/36351922973054585/E7A560BA4E75E07062EB1579158F37417E0E1205/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-08T00:25:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2014 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
