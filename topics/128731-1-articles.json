For almost all other games the i7-4720HQ will be fast enough, they are limlited by GPU power, so the 980m would be better...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-27T23:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat does not sound right. The first CPU is only 6 months older than the second one, so two generations sounds a bit off. The second is newer, but the first one has a slightly higher turbo. How much the actual difference is only benchmarks will tell, but I think it is going to be pretty close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease remember to look beyond the specifications. Especially a laptop is much more than just numbers. Pay close attention to things not numerically expressed. How well built is the thing? Is the housing somewhat sturdy? Is the screen of quality? How does it type?
