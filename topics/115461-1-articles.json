Use the shift and ctrl, or right click on your engine to thrust limit it, to fine tune it as you near circular and you should fine it easy to get a near perfect orbit. The trick is to a) have the mid-point of the burn as close as possible to the periapsis \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E burn in exactly the retrograde vector and c) get the burn done as quickly as possible, without overshooting it too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wemb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wemb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m wondering if the OP has mucked up his staging and has managed to deploy his parachute while in orbit - in which case, yes, you\u0027re doomed and the parachute will be destroyed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, nope. Turn the deployment pressure up as far as you can (0.5) and save some fuel to perform a braking burn somewhere around 10,000m (before atmospheric pressure kills your TWR) - maybe 300m/s dV, enough so that at 4000m you\u0027ll be below 250m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, don\u0027t sweat about circular orbits. Keeping the orbit \u003Cem\u003Emostly\u003C/em\u003E circular if it\u0027s a space base or some vehicle that will be the subject of rendezvous (other vessels moving in to meet them) is nice though not necessary. If you\u0027re just passing by though - there\u0027s almost zero benefits of circularizing your orbits. (the benefit is that maneuver nodes are easier to plan as your planned apoapsis doesn\u0027t change as you move the node. The disadvantage is fuel spent on circularizing it. So a volatile benefit of less stress of your wrist on the mouse, for a substantial cost of actual delta-V).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T15:45:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaos_Klaus","CreatedById":140720,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T15:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that by default KSP puts the chutes in the same stage as the last decoupler.
