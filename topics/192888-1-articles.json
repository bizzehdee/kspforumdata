A few years ago, I drifted away from the game, and haven\u0027t really played since 2017. With current events, however, I\u0027ve found myself with a fair few spare hours on my hands, so I\u0027ve decided to come back to the game and see what I can do. I\u0027m hoping to start a mission report for my main career save, which I\u0027ll put a link up to as soon as I\u0027ve started it. With that in mind, I\u0027m hoping to make a first dive into the world of mods (in KSP at least...), so I\u0027ve decided to throw a few questions out and see if anyone\u0027s got any advice:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I\u0027m planning to install \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, but really don\u0027t have a clue as to the basic mechanics of them. Does anyone know of a suitable tutorial that they might be able to link, or whether there\u0027s anything I should particularly know?\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I\u0027m also looking at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, but I\u0027m unsure as to how it handles modules from other mods, specifically stockalike station parts redux. Has anyone tried these together, and do you know if there are any major incompatabilities? Additionally, do you know if the career contracts, fees and payouts adjust for this extra complexity? Generally, budgeting is never a problem but it\u0027d be neat if they adjusted automatically.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n- As mentioned above, I\u0027m looking at the stockalike station parts mod, but I\u0027m also looking for any extra mods to ass more parts - I\u0027m a big fan of the stock aesthetics, and was wondering whether anyone would reccommend any other mods? Mostly looking at modules/engines, but really any new parts would be nice! Some more science and surface stuff would be good, generally I\u0027m just not finding much point in building big stations (but I really want to) because beyond the essentials there\u0027s not a great deal to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve spent many happy hours looking through this forum in the past, so I\u0027m excited to give something back to it!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-03T13:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170594-oatypea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170594\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170594-oatypea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Oatypea\u003C/a\u003E and welcome to the KSP Forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play a lightly modded game, so I don\u0027t have answers to your questions, but hopefully some other knowledgeable users can answer these questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also try asking in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/20-add-on-discussions/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EAdd-on Discussions\u003C/a\u003E subforum if you have no luck here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGlad to have you aboard!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Retro Starship","CreatedById":200667,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-04T13:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EWelcome to the KSP forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170594-oatypea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022170594\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/170594-oatypea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Oatypea\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI see you have been around for a while with KSP but not the forum.
