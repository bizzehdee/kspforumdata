The launch was met with applause from the United States who suggested that the ability to perform in space and have a platform for rockets is good for defending Israel as a country. Israeli President\u00A0Yitzhak Ben-Zvi has stated that the space program of Israel is not meant as an aggressive means towards Israeli neighbors and that it is to explore the cosmos.

It was believed to have been inspired by the Me-163 Komet aircraft and looked to be a remarkably-interesting aircraft. Israeli Space officials said that the aircraft was powered by four small rocket engines that ran off liquid fuels although it is a rather basic design. The rocket plane engines can only be ignited once and throttled up and down respectively making it a trickier-than-usual aircraft with Israel hiring some of the best test pilots in the Western world to help test out the aircraft. They further stated that they could hope a throttable and reignitable rocket engine mounted to the Starbreaker could pave the way towards a reusable space-plane that may take off from airports around the world by private pilots rather than Government agencies. Concept art released by the Israeli Space Agency shows that it could also be mounted onto rockets and released into the upper atmosphere. This would make it function much like some of the X-series aircraft in the United States.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nWhat makes Starbreaker different from the X-series is that it appears to have a Grid-fin attached to the top of the aircraft which makes landing much easier. It also has drogue and main chutes equipped onto the aircraft in the event of an abort sequence. There is also the rumor of a ejection-seat escape also in the event but the ISA refused to comment on this matter for now, although the pilots of the Starbreaker wear the spacesuits seen on the prior Suborbital flight undertaken by the ISA which confirms that a high-ejection could be considered a possibility in the Starbreaker. The next series of launches with the Starbreaker will be testing new engines and other systems that could make it a regular vehicle for the ISA to use in training pilots for its manned outerspace program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EManned Orbital flight achieved by Israel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VMso3tP.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VMso3tP.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228tDbPdZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8tDbPdZ.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nIsrael managed to join the United States and the Soviet Union in establishing orbital dominance with its rockets, launching the second-edition of the Jerusalem Capsule into a orbit of the Earth where it completed a week-long orbit. It was launched on a new launch platform called the \u0022Aviv-I\u0022 platform which has two large stages with very large boosters to propel it through the atmosphere. The platform included advances such as a Launch-Escape System and more safety features as well as better aerodynamic controls in response to the previous issue that prevented the first Jerusalem Capsule from reaching a full orbit. In that event, the main stage after the boosters were jettisoned tumbled wildly until the human-pilot activated an emergency sequence in which the core stage was jettisoned and the second stage was started in emergency settings. However that launch lacked an emergency abort and it is believed that if such an event proceeded to get worse the capsule could only decouple and use its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters to move it from the rocket which was very possible if the human pilot was slower in activating the emergency sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nBut enough about the bad, we noticed that the ISA done away with the prior system with the Jerusalem Capsule, the science module completely removed however the service module staying put. We also saw the truss structure that connected the craft to the Service/science module removed which gave the spacecraft a more sleek and pleasing appearance. It was also noticed that the craft had solar panels albeit small. The Jerusalem Capsule also appeared to make use of one of the rocket engines that were used on the Starbreaker plane which had been described in an official ISA report to be a good choice for the Jerusalem Capsule due to the fuel-efficient ability. The spacecraft also conducted a series of thrusting maneuvers with its engine and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters potentially to help advance the Starbreaker plane and the capsules abilities itself.
