Please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is the appropriate place I noticed a minor yet very bad bug. When a kerbal with inventory items enters a workshop their entire inventory is lost to the ether. I put kerbals with wrenches into a workshop and then moved them out of it and all items were lost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond more minor annoyance then anything, when EVA or transferring kerbals into or out of a workshop the transfer menu does not close when they are moved making it look like it didn\u0027t work when in fact it did transfer them. You must hit esc then reclick the crew hatch (which is annoyingly difficult to find sometimes) also (and this may be related) when EVAing a kerbal out of the workstation the game puts them on the ladder fine but does not transfer to the kerbal making you have to cycle thru the various shops and kerbals out (gets annoying when you\u0027re moving 10 kerbals around a work station on a planet surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for some reason the productivity doesn\u0027t appear to accurately refresh when kerbals are moved into and out of workstations. It really hurts the gameplay when I put a really stupid kerbal (one that actually has a negative productivity...??? Is that SUPPOSED to be allowed???) the negative productivity stays even when I put in smart kerbals that should increase productivity making my ability to build ships impossible. This requires me to save, and then reload to refresh the productivity of the workstations. This also happens when I connect up vehicles with negative productivity kerbals...Just a suggestion (assuming it\u0027s supposed to do this already) but personally I think there should be either 0 productivity or a positive value, negative productivity kerbals really messes up my ability to build stuff making it \u0022generate\u0022 items while I build instead of using them up. Additionally when I connect refueling vehicles or other things. If the production drops below 0 it keeps it even when they\u0027re all disconnected again. It really should just be 0 productivity and not allow a negative number at all. (Use absolute values that might help fix the problem)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA side question, is there any way I can see a kerbal\u0027s productivity before I put them in stuff so I know which kerbals I should keep out of the vehicles and which ones are the best ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need me to post these somewhere specific for tracking please let me know I\u0027ll be happy to do it. If you want to see demonstrations of the problem they are on my twitch stream (please excuse my shameless plug - \u003Ca href=\u0022www.twitch.tv/GokouZWAR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.twitch.tv/GokouZWAR\u003C/a\u003E) you can watch past videos there. I specifically dedicated last night\u0027s stream to figuring out what was going on with EL so you can see what I did. Also the previous night before (near the end of the stream) shows when I discovered the issues outlined. The stream titled \u0022minmus ground base...\u0022 is where I did the work on it. Dated 6/1/2015. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a great mod! I really like it and I hope to see these minor problems fixed soon! I\u0027ve showcased it to several viewers and they like it as well. I originally saw it from 1stghost\u0027s stream and instantly knew it would be a great addition to my mod collection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T14:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GokouZWAR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GokouZWAR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf this is the appropriate place I noticed a minor yet very bad bug.

That does remove one of the more inconvenient bugs. It\u0027s avoidable by making sure their inventories are clear before entering a workshop. The thing that\u0027s odd though is I can set the inventories of those inside the workshop so it\u0027s weird that not having an IVA would cause this. Is this related also to the transferring of kerbals and other things? Wouldn\u0027t it be easier to add a \u0022blank\u0022 IVA to get around this issue?
