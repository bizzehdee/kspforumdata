And even the weight savings for not using nukes will partially counteract the weight penalty of the excess ox and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E that you will need. Using LFOX engines will limit your maximum deltaV in your shuttle, but it shouldn\u0027t be a huge problem if your mothership will take them to orbit before dropping them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks guys! For the payload, all I\u0027m carrying with me are the Kerbals,\u00A0LS supplies for them,\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E gear, some rocket parts and the orbital Launchpad, and finally the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003Elf\u003C/abbr\u003E/ox from the 12-14 (don\u0027t remember the exact number) of the orange tanks. The landers, satellites and any other external vehicles that are required will be built on the Launchpad via EPL in orbit of the planet, then the crew will be transferred to them and landed separately. The plan is to never let the mothership return to Kerbin orbit for long periods of time is for refuels and for crew refuels, since many (if not all \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) of the vehicles will be 1 shot, due to only ever landing on the Mun and Minimus. I do have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E installed, so later today/some time this week I can get you the stats for it if you want/need them, along with the\u00A0WIP craft file (will need hyperedit to get the ship in orbit though unless you have the spacedock mod). I don\u0027t even plan on letting the mothership enter a suborbital trajectory of any planet, moon, or gas giant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
