I\u0027ve had this issue for months now, and it started occurring with a copy I\u0027d already been using for some time\u00A0but has persisted throughout the numerous times I\u0027ve tried to use fresh installations. As I wrote this, I\u00A0downloaded portable copies of\u00A01.8.1, 1.9.1, and 1.10.1 from KSP\u0027s website (because I tended to use the installer and frankly I\u0027m grasping at straws)\u00A0to make sure they still weren\u0027t working, and they all failed in exactly the way I described. For the record, there was no crash log or anything, and while normal logs have (I think) been created they\u0027re pretty much empty, only showing very basic information about my system and the application.\u00A0My computer\u0027s specifications\u00A0(copied from that log) are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Windows 10 \u00A0(10.0.0) 64bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8565U CPU @ 1.80GHz (8)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRAM: 8079\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU: Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 (2147MB)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSM: 50 (Direct3D 11.0 [level 11.1])\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to solve this problem before, and it\u0027s clear that there are other people that have had this problem, but to be honest I don\u0027t understand what the solution is or if there even is one. From what I\u0027ve gathered I think it has to do with my graphics driver, but if that\u0027s the case I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d have to do exactly to resolve the issue. I\u0027ve tried updating the driver, at least, but that didn\u0027t do anything; I\u0027m thinking I might have to just trial-and-error my way through older drivers until I find the one that worked.\u00A0I\u0027ve managed with keeping the game at 1.7.3 for now, but it\u0027d be nice if I didn\u0027t have to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-03T11:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the launcher?\u00A0 If so, don\u0027t.\u00A0\u00A0 It hasn\u0027t worked right for many years.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Try launching directly from the KSP_x64.exe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fancy_Hat","CreatedById":188887,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-05T19:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223863003\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197203\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221601723636\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/3/2020 at 4:13 AM, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the launcher?\u00A0 If so, don\u0027t.\u00A0\u00A0 It hasn\u0027t worked right for many years.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Try launching directly from the KSP_x64.exe.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t remember the last time I used the launcher; it was certainly long before I started having this problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
