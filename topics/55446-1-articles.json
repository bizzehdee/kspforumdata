When you add decouplers or bi/tri/quad-couplers, you add branches to the \u0022tree\u0022, complicating the \u0022flow\u0022 of the staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the ship is just one long cylinder with multiple stages, the progression from root to final stage is (usually) fairly linear, and the game can accurately guess the order in which the components will be staged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart adding branches though, some with parachutes intended for staging BEFORE the decouplers that are located physically below them for example, and the game can get confused about how to arrange things when placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically the last parts placed on a ship are last in the hierarchy, but if they are placed on parts that are, say, in the \u003Cem\u003Emiddle \u003C/em\u003Eof the existing flow, the game will try to insert those new stages near the area where those receiving parts\u0027 stages are located, resulting in some jumbling of \u003Cem\u003Eyour intended\u003C/em\u003E staging progression. In other words, because the game was initially designed to consider simple vertical stacks as a complete ship with a simple 1-2-3-4 progression, adding branches to the main \u0022trunk\u0022 of the tree causes some confusion for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink about it: if you were thinking like the game engine, you\u0027d look at a stack of four stages that started from the command capsule, and know just by looking at it that this ship is supposed to be dropping stages in linear order from the bottom-up. Then the player has the sheer gall to place a bunch of radial decouplers with boosters and chutes on the third (next-to-last) stage. Now your initial assumption would be that because they were placed on the third stage, the player is intending to trigger those somewhere around that stage, so you insert the new stages near there in the chain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, the player \u003Cem\u003Eactually \u003C/em\u003Ewanted to trigger those boosters \u003Cem\u003Efirst\u003C/em\u003E at the launch, and was placing the radials higher up to address balance issues, so you (as the game engine) have basically screwed up the order of things in the player\u0027s eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese staging niggles could probably be overcome by forcing the game to add stages to the chain strictly according to the order in which they were added to the ship (last parts added are first in the staging chain), but then again, I\u0027m sure there\u0027d still be a boatload of conflict and confusion when subassemblies are brought into the mix again, each with their own particular staging order already having been set up before being turned into subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line is that no matter what you try to do to address seemingly weird stage insertions, player creativity is always going to throw a wrench into the works. There\u0027s no possible code method I can think of that would accurately guess a player\u0027s intentions, given how the game currently looks at a craft as a whole, while it\u0027s being built.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T18:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that would be nice is if placing copies or subassemblies would offset the staging in the copy/subassembly stack to compensate for the stage of whatever you\u0027re attaching to.
