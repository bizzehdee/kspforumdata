AND that they include the effects of CME (coronal mass ejections) to satellite communications. It\u0027d be great to analyse the solar activities with equipment and find out what weird long cycle the programmers added to the various solar bodies. Our Sun has an ~11yr cycle between low/high activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be cool to find out that some solar bodies have a pattern of 21 years of \u0022stupid-high\u0022 CMEs that make communication severely degraded around the immediate system. That way it wouldn\u0027t be just the celestial\u00A0bodies (planets / moons) that get all the attention from those plucky Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027fun\u0027 part of all of this is none of the data is documented.
