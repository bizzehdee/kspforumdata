There is so much potential in the plugins that I haven\u0027t had the time to fully explore or utilize (due to modeling time constraints); quite a few features that I built into the plugin that aren\u0027t used at all in SSTU (but could be, given the time to work on them).\n\nI think the main thing standing in the way of more use of KSPWheel/SSTU plugins is the complexity of modding in general, and to a lesser extent the complexity of the feature set in use.  In order to make good use of them you need to be **very** familiar with modeling, configs, physics, and Unity quirks in general, and good knowledge of code/plugin constraints is helpful as well.  Basically its a few steps beyond simple modeling, or simple config creation/editing; combining some of the more advanced concepts of each....  not surprising that there are not too many people jumping at it (its a lot of work, and only some very special minds would find it to be rewarding)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-01T20:56:20Z","Content":"Most modders do not want to use other peoples modules.  \n\nMage, are the ISPC and HUS still needed as separate parts now that we have a MFT MUS?

But \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E is about regular and common part. Modder use external plugin like tweakscale or firespitter all the time, they just do not know SSTU or think it can be used for that purpose.\n\nModding SSTU its not that hard. I did several parts only with my modest config skill and existing mesh from other mod:\n\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026module=system\u0026controller=embed\u0026url=http://imgur.com/Lus3kxD\u0022 style=\u0022height:453px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nOnly the leg and inflatable heat shield at the bottom (not included in the picture) were separated part. It was extremely easy to maneuver around as its aerodynamic property were easy to set, but I felt that using inflatable heatshied for kerbin reentry what a bit cheaty. With recolor option of your last patch it would look fantastic if I ever decide to repair it (last patch also broke it.) I plan to do something different instead, I want to do a reusable upper stage that would reenter horizontally and land verticaly, a bit like spaceX ITS but un-crewed, with a cargo bay and smaller (scale-able would be nice). I did some mockup, It left me unsatisfied but with a clearer picture of what I want. But now I going on a tangent...  \n\nPoint is, its not that hard, I believe that SSTU is not just about less part, it add so many thing that were impossible using stock and modded lego philosophy. Not to mention the unprecedented level of customizability in shape, size, function and now color. Once you understand how it works, adding new section, custom resource or functional sub part is really easy. Pick any part mod, put SSTU under the hood, and its 10 times better.

To equal the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E ship, LH2 ship will be about \u003Cu\u003Etwo times heavier\u003C/u\u003E if it use zero boil off tanks.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E At that point, even top \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E nuclear engines have no use, let alone LH2 chemical engines for anything but the first stage.\n\u003E \n\nAre you examining Hyrolox (LH2\u002BOX), or straight LH2?\n\nBut also, yes, zero-boil-off tanks are not as efficient from a mass perspective.  Also, nobody has ever flown a zero-boil-off setup, so there is no real-world data to work from.\n\nWhen I crunch numbers on fuel types, for an arbitrary input comparing KLOX vs. zero-boil-off LH2/HLOX, these are the numbers I get (using a payload of zero, and a massless engine):\n\nSo no, it does not entirely make sense to use HLOX with zero-boil-off tanks; for the same -volume- you get slightly lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (but much reduced vessel mass).  On LH2 only setups (nukes), zero-boil-off still has an extreme advantage.\n\nLets see what happens when a 20t payload is added...\n\nAnd now, a standard payload of a % of the tanks total weight (25% payload fraction)\n\nAnd a standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E target (5k m/s) from a single stage with a 10t payload:\n\n(Note the \u0027Total\u0027 column, which would represent vessel mass, and how the LH2 and HLOX (to a lesser extent) total vessel/stage mass is less than with KLOX)\n\nFor a given target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and payload, straight LH2 will have a major advantage over KLOX, and HLOX.\n\nHLOX still has a ~20% total mass advantage over KLOX for the same payload and target \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n^^ Those numbers are all using zero-boil-off values (if I\u0027ve calculated everything correctly).\n\nWould you mind posting the stats for the craft that you are having problem(s) with?  As all the math points to LH2 based fuels being quite a bit better, even with the \u0027heavy\u0027 ZBO tanks)"}]}
