It negotiates among each of the ModStats dlls to find the one which should be active. Cool! Now throw the auto-update wrinkle in. Our user has decided to enable it. Where does ModStats write the updated DLL to? One answer is... to where ever the most-current DLL is running itself from. Ok, that works, but if the user uninstalls that mod, we have to update again. Doable, but not elegant, and potentially adds noticeable time to the user\u0027s game loading (unlike the negotiation, which adds nanoseconds). The elegent answer is... to a central location - and hell, if we are doing that, why don\u0027t we move the most-current version there? (And thus, the illusion of \u0027automatically re-installing\u0027 is born). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, ModStats is opt-out. How would you like that opt-out preference to be stored? Well, if KSP was windows-only, we could write it to the registry (which is the preferred \u0027windowsy\u0027 way of doing something like this). Can\u0027t do that on Linux or OSX, and it breaks KSP-mod convention (which is to use .cfg files). Where do we put that .cfg file? Well, the normal place is with the .dll file that reads it. But... ModStats can be in a number of different places, and we want *all possible* versions of ModStats to notice that the user has opted out, because we respect the user\u0027s privacy. The only possible options then, are to either put the cfg in a central location (/GameData/ModStatistics/), or literally scan every single .cfg file in GameData looking for that key. If we took option 2, and stored a cfg with the opt-out alongside some particular instance of ModStats, rather than a central one, the risk is run that the user could unintentionally remove their opt-out status by uninstalling a particular mod which included modstats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E*EDIT*\u003C/strong\u003E - I want to point out that my use of the word \u0027we\u0027 is an ideosyncracy I have about walking through code or program design, it is not intended to imply that I had any role in the design or creation of ModStatistics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ragzilla","CreatedById":115822,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T22:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022enneract\u0022 data-cite=\u0022enneract\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThink this one through for a second, seriously. \u003Cp\u003EFor the sake of arguing this particular point, accept the premise that ModStats *is* opt-out instead of opt-in.
