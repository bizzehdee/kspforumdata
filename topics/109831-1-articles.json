Since 1.0 I\u0027ve noticed the throttle will reduce itself or cut off completely on both vertical rocket launches and in atmospheric flight with spaceplanes. This happens when the rocket gets too far off vertical too quickly (for the game\u0027s taste) and at different pitches in a space plane depending on speed. In a plane I have to drop the nose and can only achieve high speeds while in level flight. Any ideas what is causing this or how to prevent it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T21:56:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wipfel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you by chance using MechJeb?
