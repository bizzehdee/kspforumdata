They are built completely differently (I noticed when I was looking for the inflatable heatshield). I loved FAR and DRE and used then extensively for a time but there were a few instances where they would mess up a long mission and caused fatal crashes so I left them to develop more before using them again... and then Squad come along with something that actually lets me fly planes like they should (still not perfect but a LOT better).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I was thinking of doing was trying to fake out a mix of the inflatable heatshield from DRE and using the code from the game\u0027s built in heatshield... but I never found where the inflatable one went to. Thanks for the heads up regarding the KM pack. I never used that mod (I was overloaded as it was!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and one funny... My neighbours probably wondered what was going on today when one of my first Mun shots return to Kerbol... It was coming through the atmosphere and I thought the capsule had a heatshield built in so when the think went KABOOOOOOOM through my headphones I think I swore for about 3 minutes straight. I had the volume turned up a LEEEEEETLE bit too loud. My ears were still ringing 10 minutes later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T21:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
