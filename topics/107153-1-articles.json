The animation somehow affects the aerodynamics of the heatshield causing you to not slow down at all. Also, 1.0 did not implement FAR at all, ferram wasn\u0027t even asked to help with the project, they are entirely different."},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:46:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E KM special does have inflatable heatshields but they never worked correctly, in stock or far aero.

They are built completely differently (I noticed when I was looking for the inflatable heatshield). I loved FAR and DRE and used then extensively for a time but there were a few instances where they would mess up a long mission and caused fatal crashes so I left them to develop more before using them again... and then Squad come along with something that actually lets me fly planes like they should (still not perfect but a LOT better).\n\nWhat I was thinking of doing was trying to fake out a mix of the inflatable heatshield from DRE and using the code from the game\u0027s built in heatshield... but I never found where the inflatable one went to. Thanks for the heads up regarding the KM pack. I never used that mod (I was overloaded as it was!).\n\nOh and one funny... My neighbours probably wondered what was going on today when one of my first Mun shots return to Kerbol... It was coming through the atmosphere and I thought the capsule had a heatshield built in so when the think went KABOOOOOOOM through my headphones I think I swore for about 3 minutes straight. I had the volume turned up a LEEEEEETLE bit too loud. My ears were still ringing 10 minutes later.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T21:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NeoMorph**"}]}
