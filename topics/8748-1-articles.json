It is a pig to fly! But you can get it up if are very careful about initial throttle setting and steer away from the gantry. I suggest its time to begin steering to orbit at 500m/s but you will be lucky if you make your target vector without corrections, though that is what the second stage is for. Good luck (you\\\u0027ll need it)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T16:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI now name you the stock master.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xazas","CreatedById":7761,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T18:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was realy impressive!
