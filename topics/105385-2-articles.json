If they are mounted near the engine, they will absorb the heat quickly and overheat and explode, since they have only 1000 degrees heat tolerance.\n\nEdit: One last test I ran yesterday before bed is suggesting you can also insulate parts of your craft. The nuke with the spacer (the lower fuel tank was empty, and is there just to attach the fuel line) worked well at first, and you can see on the left, the main fuel tank barely heated up after the burn. The engine was however really really hot, and the system continued to equalize for a very long time(about 3-4 times as long as my conventional radiators) and topped of at 760, which is still 100 degrees less than the control. I think this system could be used if the heat radiators are not an option for some reason, but will not withstand long burns, as the nuke will simply get too hot and explode.\n\n![nuke2_zps4adeeln0.jpg~original](http://i1289.photobucket.com/albums/b514/yes753cac/nuke2_zps4adeeln0.jpg~original)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T07:10:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Torham234**"},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:01:03Z","Content":"That \u0022asteroid 1\u0022 tutorial mission: Halfway through the burn, the nuke engines blow up the fuel tanks, even though its overheat bar is only half full.
