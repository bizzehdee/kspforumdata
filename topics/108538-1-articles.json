Does the fuel tank fall down to Duna after decoupling, or is it pinned to the rocket due to the acceleration? If so, you would still have to accelerate its dry-mass and MechJeb wouldn\u0027t consider this in its calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesn\u0027t fall off: Throttle down to zero before triggering the second stage, trigger the stage and wait for the fuel tank to be out of the vessel\u0027s flightpath before throttleing up again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T09:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am having the same problem with 1.02 mate. Atmosphere feels alot thicker and higher now so don\u0027t think you can get away with a non aerodynamic lander. I just barely took of with my lander that had 3200 dv and barely met with my main ship at orbit. It was so barely that i had 100dv left when i finally docked. And atmosphere seems to go up to 55k now not 41k as it used to be. I had a non aerodynamic lander design just like yours and noticed it pulled me down really hard. Btw if your main craft doesn\u0027t pass 1ton try using monopropellent puff engines. They might suprise you about their thrust to weight ratio. Engines themselves are really lightweight and monopropellent is actually lighter then liquid fuel too. So it kind of gives the same amont of dv as a spark engine yet gives maybe 5 times more thrust since you can use more then 1 engine easily and don\u0027t loose any dv.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dan2600","CreatedById":138534,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T14:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the replies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tired dumping the tank, and got the full 1812m/s without any overhead (which should get me into duna orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt must be something with Duna\u0027s atmosphere in 1.02 needing a LOT more delta-v\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe estimated delta-v is going down about twice to three times as fast as the delta-v I\u0027m gaining.

I would have to guess the problem is your flight path during the ascent. I flew that lander in a fairly shallow ascent path; basically turn to 45 degrees immediately on launch and reduce to 20 or so after the first 10km, made it to orbit using about 1400m/s dV, plus some extra for rendezvous with the transfer stage I brought along. The lander was also capable of launching with both ore tanks full. If it helps, the atmosphere stops at 50km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emay be on idee to get it on a mountain top on duan and refuel there again?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T19:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh believe me man your design is quite aerodynamic compared to mine.
