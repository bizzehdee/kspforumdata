I am wondering if I go to Duna, take science stuff and transmit it back to kerbin, and then later go to duna with a manned mission and bring science back to kerbin, will the values for the manned mission will be lower?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T21:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are specific values you can reach in one science field. If you transmit some, your kerbals will retrieve less when going there. And you cant transmit data above a certain limit. You must send kerbals there to get the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T21:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.
