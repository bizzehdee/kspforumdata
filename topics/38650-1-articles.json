From what people say I really thought it would take me like 2 or 3 days to master the aerodynamics system and the jet engines which I never used before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I started by doing some reverse engineering checking the stock planes and trying to some minor changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the deal. When I tried Aeris 4A I never thought I\u0027d be able to achieve orbit with it. Actually the only thing I\u0027ve changed was to set an action group to shut down the turbo jets at the same time after leaving atmo so the plane wouldn\u0027t spin out of control. Then I went into a perfect 80km orbit and was able to return and (kinda) land. Is this really what everyone calls one of the hardest achievments in KSP?

You can reach orbit with it and dink around a bit, that\u0027s it. I\u0027d recommend a 70x70km orbit as a first goal. It\u0027s exponentially easier to get a spaceplane to minimum orbit rather than shoot for 100x100 right off the runway. At least that\u0027s what I\u0027ve found out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my go-to SSTO. It\u0027s a heavily modified version of the Aeris 4a. Yes there are double wings on the back.

This one also has rover wheels on the front - when the front landing gear is retracted, the rover wheels contact the ground, and you can steer/drive. Lower the front gear again to go to flight mode. I have parachutes on it for vertical landing because I\u0027ve been testing putting vtol engines on it, but that\u0027s still a work in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I like to control things is to have one button switch from atmo flight to space flight. By this I mean when I hit launch, I right click activate on both my turbojets. Then when I hit the point just before flameout (for this plane that\u0027s 27km at 1300m/s roughly - I get entry effects on ascent \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) I hit one button, and it shuts off turbos, closes intakes, and activates the rocket all at the same time. Ease of use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy flight profile for ALL spaceplanes is: Take off, point 45 degrees up. At 13km begin leveling out, finishing leveling at around 18km. Accelerate as much as possible. When it looks like the plane is struggling to gain more speed, pitch to 15-20 degrees. At flameout (you have to test this so you can pin it JUST before the jets cut out) switch to space flight mode. Pitch back to 45 degrees till apoapsis is reached. Coast to apoapsis, then circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can conserve some fuel by feathering the throttle past the flameout point to get more out of the turbos, but honestly my SSTOs arrive to orbit with so much fuel left I really don\u0027t care to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo planes aren\u0027t that hard to do.
