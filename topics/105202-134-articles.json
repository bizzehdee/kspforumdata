It seems as if Kerbals refuse to work as soon as the ship is not loaded anymore. This is problematic because I can not use Science Labs (unless they are on my active vessel, which isnt exactly the purpose of science labs.) \n\nWhen i load the vessel i get the notification that they refuse to work and immediately after that, i get one saying they returned to duty. They do not produce any science in the meantime. \n\nI am not 100% sure thats a bug, maybe i am just missing something. I will attach screenshots and a savefile as soon as i find out how to attach anything in this forum.\n\nScreenshots and Save are in this folder:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ijiomepczi7xs7u/AAC_ss2ME3x1GAhXuzesfIuGa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ijiomepczi7xs7u/AAC_ss2ME3x1GAhXuzesfIuGa?dl=0)\n\nThanks for your help\n\nEdit: I checked whether the station has enough power to maintain life support.
