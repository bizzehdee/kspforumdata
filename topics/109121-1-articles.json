To launch spaceships, the player has to pay for fuel, oxidizer ect. with Resource points. Recovering Ore or ships containing various resources allows the player to gain Resource points with various multipliers for what is recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObjectives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Create a Resource point system identical to the Science/Reputation point system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Create a way to display the Resource point system. A toolbar/window is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Convert all resource costs, as defined in the stock Resources/cfg file, to be read as Resource point costs and not Funds costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Allow the player to edit the initial Resource point budget from within the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Balance resource costs and add compatibility for other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I go about doing this?
