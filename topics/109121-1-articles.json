To launch spaceships, the player has to pay for fuel, oxidizer ect. with Resource points. Recovering Ore or ships containing various resources allows the player to gain Resource points with various multipliers for what is recovered.\n\nObjectives:\n\n1) Create a Resource point system identical to the Science/Reputation point system\n\n2) Create a way to display the Resource point system. A toolbar/window is fine.\n\n3) Convert all resource costs, as defined in the stock Resources/cfg file, to be read as Resource point costs and not Funds costs.\n\n4) Allow the player to edit the initial Resource point budget from within the game. \n\n5) Balance resource costs and add compatibility for other mods.\n\nHow can I go about doing this? I can work .cfg files but have zero knowledge of C# or .dll\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T21:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TruthQuark**\n  \nCYA LATER"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:22:44Z","Content":"Skimming through the forums, I see people have added Reputation cost to their parts somehow. Maybe an interim solution is to rename the \u0027Reputation\u0027 points into @resources, use the same mechanic as the other modders to add a custom cost to the fuels, and then disable the entire reputation-gain mechanics in then game."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:02:08Z","Content":"If anyone has a suggestion...?"},{"CreatedByName":"Overlocker","CreatedById":118850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T21:41:42Z","Content":"Actually a resource system for career mode will be great, but you have the job half done with Kerbal Konstructs fuel tanks, they are resources that can be used on flight.

I already know that the most straightforward solution is collecting some \u0027API documentation\u0027, sitting down, and churning out code. However, since I can\u0027t do that, I\u0027ll have to find tools built by others and try and modify their settings to behave the way I want. \n\nLike you Kerbal Konstructs, if everything works out ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T12:25:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From personal experience of modding for nearly two decades... the project lead needs to have most of the technical skills the project is going to need themselves.
