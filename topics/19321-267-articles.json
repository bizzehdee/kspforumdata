I was designing a drop probe that had a set of fins on it for stability during the fall. However, when I was stacking it up on a rocket for a test on Kerbin, those fins dragged the CL extremely far forward, making the rocket unstable, even when the probe was enclosed in a procedural fairing. The CL was in the usual place with a stock Mk2 cargo bay or Firespitter FS1BB bomb bay. The payload shroud said it was shielding 18 parts (is there a way to tell which parts are shrouded?), the long Mk2 cargo bay and Firespitter bomb bay said they were shielding all 20 parts, and the short Mk2 bay was shielding 9 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an imgur album illustrating the test vehicles with the payload shroud and the long Mk2 cargo bay (which is open to show the probe itself).

I\u0027ve been spending the last few nights trying to figure out a reliable way to reproduce it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI _think_ that it has something to do with a state change (SOI for sure, but also seen in low orbit - atmospheric boundary?) right as KJR is showing the little \u0027stabilizing physics load\u0027 message, because that message gets stuck onscreen until I do something to break the overflow (like hopping to the space center). But I can\u0027t make it happen with *just* KJR installed. To my mind, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean it\u0027s not there, perhaps the presence of FAR just changes the timing just right (or perhaps it\u0027s vice versa?). If I have KJR *and* FAR installed it seems to happen more, for small values of more.

The fact that you\u0027re seeing it in a \u0027static\u0027 95k Kerbin orbit throws out most of my theories, but helps me know where to focus testing. Is it just multi-day warps followed by a stop? Does it happen to you reliably, or intermittently? How do you come out of warp? Manually? Kerbal Alarm Clock?
