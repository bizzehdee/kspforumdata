Heck, the carnivorous ways of these Kerbals makes that they never even heard of Onions, Asparagus and that kind of veggie mumbojumbo. Hence, for an Eve return mission they shall use brute force, and low efficiency systems. This purple rock will look nice on the space program\u0027s managers desk as a presse-papier\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main mission report is in the following albums titles and descriptions. (Split into: - Getting to Eve, -De-orbit and landing, -The ascent and return)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge really lived up to the term challenge. I spent many many hours designing and executing this mission. Just the transfer and landing phase took like 6 real world hours. Totally worth it though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile finding the landing site was relatively easy to do, actually putting the Ascender down proved to be difficult. A tall rocket like this tends to snap into pieces when it hits even the slightest slope on the ground at pretty low speeds. My landing site was about 700 meters higher above sea level than my initial hyperedit trials. While this was great for Delta-V management, it turned out that my parachute configuration would not slow the craft down enough, even with the help of the 8 braking rockets. Pretty fireballs ensued to cleanse the soil. Countless quickloads later I used the help of the main engines to lower the touchdown speed to below 2,5 m/s. Luckily the fuel pods of the original brake rockets contained enough fuel to compensate for the fuel waste. Although the swaying movement after touchdown was still nerve wrecking. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on the tail!

If you rely on gimballing engines for tug control, never put them in a puller configuration it seems. I had to disable all gimballs and waste loads of RCS to get my setup to the place I needed it, and ended up wasting a lot of fuel again.

(File size is just around 4 megs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest challenge design wise is the Eve lander and ascent vehicle. It has to be as light as possible so it can be hoisted into Kerbin orbit, but it also needs to have a delta-v of over 13000. The Kerbin launcher and transit stage is much simpler conceptually, but of course a vehicle that has to shoot almost 2700 tons from the KSC into low Kerbin Orbit and on to a encounter with Eve is going to present some challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus staging makes the whole concept of a stage a bit blurry. As I see it though, I have two main stages, both of which use asparagus staging to toss bits as they go along. Sepratrons were essential to ensure the stacks separated cleanly. All those little fiddly bits led to a migraine-inducing staging sequence, especially if I had to troubleshoot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELower stage\u003C/strong\u003E. Kerbin launch and transit. 28600 tons with delta-v of 6156, 6927 (atmo, vac). Asparagus with 6 branches. 121x S3 KS-25x4 engines. Each engine has a tank stack. The outer layer have taller stacks, maxing out at 3x Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks plus 1x Kerbodyne S3-7200. The short stacks have 2x Kerbodyne S3-14400 on the inner layers. The \u0022central stack group\u0022 of 1\u002B6 have 4x Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks. This central stack forms the transit stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpper stage\u003C/strong\u003E. Eve lander and ascent vehicle. 2690 tons with delta-v of 11242, 14235 (atmo, vac). Asparagus with 6 branches. 18x Kerbodyne KR-2L Advanced engines and 1x Rockomax \u0022Skipper\u0022, each with one Kerbodyne S3-14400 tank. One additional set of 12 tanks without engines as an outer rim. The design is very wide and flat for stability when landing. The outer tanks are lower than the rest of the stack and have landing legs on the outer edge in order to keep the engine bells off the ground. 24 Mk16-XL chutes and 6 Mk25 drogue chutes. This lander could probably do a Duna landing and return mission from the KSP all by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight observations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch was surprisingly stable. Fuel and oxidizer consumption is around 10600 and 13000 per second respectively. No need to worry about terminal velocity, as this monster doesn\u0027t accelerate very quickly. At 10000 meters the speed is only around 137m/s. At 15000 meters more than half the launch weight is already gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to Low Kerbin Orbit takes around 8:30 minutes (including apoapsis burn). Once there, the lower stage has around 1650-1850 delta-v remaining. More than enough to get the lander to Eve if the launch window is favourable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDecelerating at Eve is easy. Just aim for a periapsis of 55-60km and the atmosphere will drag you down. I had no fuel to waste on establishing orbit first anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Eve. Now that is a challenge. My first two landers fell apart on splashdown. The third one almost made it onto solid ground but fell apart on touchdown. Heavy gravity is heavy! For my fourth attempt, I almost tripled the number of struts on the lander, adding many cross-connections between non-adjacent components. I also tripled the number of landing legs from 12 to 36.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrame rate? Not awesome even with all graphics options set to the minimum. Before the first two stagings, I estimate frame rate at 1-2 fps. Every second of game time was around 15 seconds of real time. Game performance improved dramatically as boosters were shed. The lag meant there was no chance of steering manually. The only way to launch this vehicle is with MechJeb, either commanding Smart A.S.S. or autonomously with Ascent Guidance. Two other items which would have been very hard, perhaps even impossible, without MechJeb, were Delta-V calculations during construction and calculations for optimal interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProblems\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKeeping everything organized. If you miss one or two bits and only notice when you\u0027re three layers further out in construction, the poor game performance on large builds makes things... hard... I forgot Sepratrons on the inner layers at first. Adding them was fiddly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI forgot the fuel lines right in the middle of the lower stage but didn\u0027t discover my error until I tested the rocket. It was almost impossible to route them after that. I suppose I should have redone the whole thing from the inside out but I decided to accept the small decrease in delta-v due to the very middle bits not quite staging properly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMy vehicle was so large it filled up the VAB, often including the space \u0022behind\u0022 the staging sequence interface. If that happens when you move a component in the staging sequence you also grab the \u0022real\u0022 item behind it. I learned to scroll and zoom away from the vehicle after the first 500 mistakes or so...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGame performance. Even with all graphics options set to the minimim, once you go north of about 1500 parts things start crawling. One press of undo can take 30 seconds until you can dump the part. Crashes are also very common when going from VAB to the pad. These crashes often corrupt the craft file. I used an increasing number system for the files so that I didn\u0027t keep overwriting the same one. I also always backed the latest craft file up before pressing \u0022launch\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI had one spectacular test failure where at 10000 meters the central core separated from the rest the outer layers. I\u0027m guessing a combination of aerodynamic force and changing loads from the stacks. Spamming more struts fixed it. Systematic and significant cross-bracing is essential to ensure acceptable rigidity in such a complex structure.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOverheating. Limiting the throttle to 97-98% at launch kept temperatures under control. This throttle limit could then gradually be increased as altitude was gained and the rocket shrank.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce the gravity turn started, difficulty in maintaining direction appeared. Winglets on the central stack, as well as locking the gimbals on 24 of the engines, limited this problem but did not eliminate it completely. Increasing rigidity with duct tape helped as well. More rigid vehicle means better directional control but this isn\u0027t really a problem except with large builds..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnce in orbit, control was very slow when not under power. I was also having big issues with electrical power. Adding a bunch of batteries and solar panels fixed the power issue. Tripling the number of vernor engines and relocating them to the ends of the stack made turning much easier. Still slow response though, which led to issues with auto-warp.

If it\u0027s not too late for a late submission, I\u0027ll toss mine in. It definitely satisfies the requirements for levels one and two. Whether it satisfies level three, I will leave up to the judges. It does take the entire lander to sea level and back-- but it does *not* launch from sea level. It must be driven to an altitude of around 6500m before launch. I will accept the decision either way, as it wasn\u0027t designed with this challenge in mind. I do feel that it meets the spirit of the requirement, however, in that it takes the entire lander, the kerbal, and the science equipment to sea level and back even if it does not use rockets to get from sea level to 6500m. Eve\u0027s lower atmosphere is like soup, but solar power is abundant. Using electric wheels for the first few thousand meters of ascent was just more efficient. I suppose an argument could be made that my \u0022ascent\u0022 is actually when the drive from sea level begins... but again, it\u0027s your challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lifter is a straightforward two-stage asparagus-- the only real oddity here is that the center stack feeds forward to the transit stage, so that it can burn its engines during liftoff as well, giving us a substantial efficiency boost. The transit stage has both nukes and ion engines. The Eve lander section is a \u0022reformatted\u0022 asparagus lifter with rover wheels-- literally the entire lander vehicle can be driven around. (And it was-- the lander was manually driven more than 200km on Eve\u0027s surface on this mission.) There is a separate vacuum lander can attached to the transit vehicle that can be used on small airless bodies. A third detachable unit, lifeboat pod with 4000m/s worth of ion dV, is also carried to help bail me out from screwups.

So the pod is dropped on launch to lighten the fuel needed for return, which in turn makes *everything* lighter and easier to pilot. The kerbal is only exposed for the brief period during ascent from Eve, and I\u0027ve verified that the temperature is within a spacesuit\u0027s tolerances during the entire brief flight.

I managed to place a 430t lander on Eve using parachutes, but the only way I could land safely was to burn some of my ascent stage fuel to soften the impact. Parachutes got me to 10.5 m/s which is enough to cause a beautiful explosion. Even a powered landing at 4 m/s blew up the whole ship. Finally got it to less than 2 m/s and came through intact.

I am still fairly new to the game (only a couple months so far) and I found this to be a considerable challenge to complete, so kudos to Laie for the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I\u0027ve had a lot of trouble being able to fly large vessels comprised of smaller docked ships -- they just wobble way too much. For this reason I wanted to see if I could do this all in a single launch because it would allow me to have plenty of sturdy connections and struts for the entire journey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* At some point I decided to avoid refueling in the spirit of \u0022can I do without it?\u0022. This obviously meant I would need a far larger launch vehicle at the Kerbin pad. This snowballed into a test to see if my computer could handle the game and if the game would survive on its limited RAM (I use 32bit version of KSP). I knew that if I could get to LKO, then the rest of the way would be easier on my computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The use of HyperEdit to test landing and ascent to and from Eve was a huge help, thanks to those who offered that up as a tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The biggest mistakes I made were to not test every last part of all my various stages to their fullest. I tested the transfer stage the least and suffered as a result. I mainly made sure that the decouplers worked, but didn\u0027t do many actual flight tests or I would have discovered the need for much more RCS/torque. It took ages to make a simple 90 or 180 degree turn for manuever nodes. I had to assist it some with low thrust engine burns since those at least have gimbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I tested my rovers a bunch and was happy with them on the ground. The only workable place to attach them to my vessel was on the sides, so I used two of them so they would be balanced symmetrically and in case one of them broke down somehow. The first time I tried this one of the rovers got caught up in the landing gear apparatus after decoupling. So I just decided to add a couple sepratrons with reduced fuel to push them away from the lander a little, but not too far. It completely slipped my mind that the speratrons would still be on the rovers afterward so I never tested the rovers after that - I only tested the decoupling to make sure they would fall clear of the lander and make it to the ground safely. As you can see from my images, the rovers ended up being useless due to how I had placed the sepratrons too close to the ladder rails. Of course it\u0027s good to know that in the future this type of design flaw won\u0027t be as catastrophic since Kerbals will be able to climb up on ledges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I had never used MechJeb prior to doing this challenge. I had avoided installing it because I worried that it would do too much of the work for me and dumb down the game too much. But I finally decided to give it a try because I knew that the ascent autopilot in particular would be helpful for getting off Eve. I used it sparingly at the early parts of the trip, but eventually tried out more and more of the features as I went along. When it comes to using mods, I usually prefer a minimalist approach for any game still in early acess or beta and I don\u0027t install many until after a game is released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I had trouble several times with my lander sitting on the ground at Eve wanting to rebalance every time I switched my focus away from it and back (like going back to the Space Center, or exiting the game and coming back). It acted like it had to land all over again and on a few occasions it would start wobbling and tear itself apart. I had to restore from quicksaves a couple of times to help the game remember that I had already achieved a safe and stable landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I had to deal with several game crashes on this project, but they were confined mostly to the work with the entire launch rocket and its 1800\u002B part count. The most common crash was simply trying to load the rocket from the VAB to the launch pad. These were frustrating but did not happen often enough to slow me down in my fervor to complete this challenge. Also, there were never any crashes of the game after I staged the launch base at LKO - even though my ship was still 1300\u002B parts, apparently I was below some magical threshold for causing the game to crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-23T04:19:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2015 04:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelderek\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"parzr","CreatedById":115059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T04:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s AWESOME!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy lander is 1,200 tons and I\u0027m going for jeb level and science level in the same trip.
