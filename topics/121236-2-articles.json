I have the best restults using parent node that moves up and scales down wheelCollider (somehow this takes care of all of the animation). However... this works to some extent so for example when I scale down wheelCollider the whole wheel goes up. So if I want to scale down and move up wheelCollider (in animation) it ends up being too high. Or it is in the right place but wheel collider is to big compared to scaled mesh \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E I\u0027m making/tweaking animations in unity since it\u0027s faster.
