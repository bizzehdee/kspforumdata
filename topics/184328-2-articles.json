From what I see, nobody was asking for part reskins. Shadowzone\u0027s video on technical debt, if I recall correctly, mentions that he never asked for that and the community surrounding his channel seemed to agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in a sense, I feel like Squad reskinned the parts for the sake of it. Whether it\u0027s because they didn\u0027t like the look of them or needed something flashy to get more sales, we\u0027ll never know, but this IS Take Two we\u0027re taking about, and they are not unknown for caring less about the consumer and more about the sales.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... The main problem is their part reskins are a waste of their time. Sure, they added modding support as someone above said, and that\u0027s really good, but they just fell victim to it themselves when Restock came out and nobody really cared about the part reskins anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think what they\u0027re doing here is a step in the right direction but it just isn\u0027t anything substantial enough to warrant paying more for this than I paid for the game. I feel like if there was more depth to this, I would be happier about buying the DLC. Perhaps if the terrain was diggable / removable such as terraforming (which is impossible given how the game engine works, and probably too far convoluted to change so far into development), then I\u0027d buy it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut really? There just isn\u0027t much new to do. Kopernicus already has a feature which allows players to gather science from these terrain scatters... I don\u0027t understand why I\u0027d pay for this DLC if I could just spend a little longer to install the few mods. Maybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m unhappy with squad\u0027s track record? If Squad was still an indie developer and not governed by a money hungry company such as Take Two...

Maybe a storyline or a narrative? And, if I was going to make a DLC just for the planets, I\u0027d add more than just terrain scatters. Every planet should feel unique, so geysers, volcanoes, ravines, organic structures etc (which I do believe should be in the stock game) would make a much better dlc than a few rocks and infernal robotics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Klapaucius","CreatedById":181256,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-07T21:16:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223595188\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221557263503\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133397\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Fearless Son said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 Not because I hate mods, but just because I like what I do to be sharable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.

strategies to go about making money, and those strategies are necessarily different according to circumstances.\u00A0 There are companies that are renowned for customer service and customer

relations-- like the big cable companies in the US, for example.\u00A0 But that doesn\u0027t mean that Amazon \u0022cares\u0022 more about their customers, or that Comcast \u0022cares\u0022 less.\u00A0 They\u0027re both simply out to make money; no more, no less.\u00A0 Amazon provides excellent customer service-- at considerable monetary cost to themselves, I might add-- simply because the nature of their business model is such that they know that all their competitors are just one mouse-click away, so they\u0027d darn well better make the customer super happy or they\u0027ll go elsewhere.\u00A0 Whereas a company like Comcast, which is generally a local monopoly and their victims-- sorry, \u0022customers\u0022-- are absolutely helpless and can\u0027t turn elsewhere, so they treat them like dirt because there\u0027s no financial reason not to, and being nice to customers costs money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m getting at is... please don\u0027t make the mistake of anthropomorphizing corporations, or attaching sentimental value to them.\u00A0 They simply are what they are, and they exist solely to make money.\u00A0 The ones that have a reputation for \u0022closeness to the community\u0022 do so for financial reasons, too-- i.e. they\u0027re making a point of cultivating good relations because they \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewant to get repeat business\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and know that people will take their dollars elsewhere if they\u0027re unhappy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a

I\u0027ll just get it out of the way and it say it now to save time- all of these things can and have been done by mods. EVA suits through TextureReplacer; RoverScience (or whatever it\u0027s called) has you collect and perform science with specific locations and there was a mod that allowed you to deploy remote science modules, and the robotic parts is far from new having been available since alpha (pre 0.25). That said- it\u0027s great that Squad is picking the robotics mod, as it\u0027s been long requested and mod developers (though I appreciate your work greatly) could never keep the mod stable for long. Now that Squad has adopted it, it should hopefully be more stable and less buggy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said- what do I think of the DLC? Is it good or bad? Well I say that it\u0027s a neat offer but I\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0want future DLCs to be like this. Just having us cough up cash for mods. (\u003Cem\u003EBut Zoo, Squad needs money to make content!-\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand to that I say the following-). DLCs should aim to offer something that mods have not done or is not capable of doing. A great example was the Mission Maker from Making History. That is something completely original and not performed by mods.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EBut Zoo, mods have already done so much, there isn\u0027t much for Squad to do that isn\u0027t already a mod-\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ewell that just silly. There\u0027s plenty of concepts and ideas that leave Squad room to tinker and grow without having to copy. Custom engine creator, planet creator, fuel tank painter, space suit designer, etc. There\u0027s certainly things Squad could do that wouldn\u0027t have to involve adopting existing mods. Personally I\u0027m also not a fan of this as it\u0027s just replacing new content. Squad has just been padding new updates with mod content and new textures. There\u0027s occasionally something new in there (idle animations, maneuver node editor, etc). I\u0027m not expecting massive amounts of new content, but I side with the part of the community that thinks that fixes and improvements should take priority for a while. Fixing career and implementing optimization changes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also dislike their choice of additions to the game- while those who can\u0027t afford the DLC are kept out from content that ultimately could aid the very weak career mode. If Squad promised to release some new content for career or some sort of upgrade/improvement, then I\u0027d say it\u0027s fair game but this isn\u0027t the case (that I\u0027m aware of). Squad has locked \u0022full career\u0022 behind a secondary paywall. Not to mention that they\u0027re just monetizing previously free content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate though- I know Squad needs to make money and to do so they\u0027re making new DLCs to fund KSP development. I\u0027m ok with DLCs as I understand that Squad can\u0027t run off of hopes and dreams. So I\u0027m supporting having new DLCs, I just think that this particular one goes about it poorly or doesn\u0027t offer enough to warrant the cash investment. There\u0027s nothing new in this mod pack beyond the content now being fully supported and now maintained by the game developers so it\u0027ll be stable from now on. I wouldn\u0027t mind if these mod inclusions to the DLC were bundled with something fresh and original since there\u0027s plenty of options they could factor in. But instead it\u0027s entirely old content rehashed until a new label for cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I\u0027ve already spent 6\u002B years on this game. I\u0027m too deep to escape it so I probably will eventually end up buying this DLC regardless.

I have spent the time to record a video and verbally explain the good and the bad about this update, as well as discussing a bit about Squad\u0027s update history. I hope you are able to agree with what I\u0027m trying to say in this video. I\u0027m not particularly good at this format since I have never really done it before, so I hope I don\u0027t ramble too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe points I will cover in more detail if you choose to watch the video include the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSquad\u0027s update history and why the part reskins haven\u0027t been a good use of their time considering mods do the same and in the case of Restock, a better job (which IS subjective!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOverview of what the DLC aims to add\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExplanation of the planet surface features and why I don\u0027t like the implementation of the DLC the way it has been done.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI did forget to cover a few points / not go into enough detail about the points in the video, so I will do here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly I want to stress that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ei like what Squad is doing\u003C/strong\u003E, but their execution is what I have a problem with. In short, I don\u0027t think the DLC is worth the price from what we\u0027ve been told about it. Obviously, this is subject to what you as a consumer want to actually pay for the DLC, which is why I explain it a bit better in the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Infernal Robotics-esque features are awesome. I like them. I like the thought of them, the implementation to some extent, and the idea behind them and their uses. However, the actual mod \u0022Infernal Robotics\u0022 already does exactly this, and although there haven\u0027t really been any other screenshots except hinges, I imagine I.R. does more than what Squad intends to add. Each to their own in terms of how detailed you would expect to see something like I.R. be implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy main gripe is the planetary surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock planets are awful in my opinion. I do have very strong feelings about them because I myself am a planet modder, but I will try not to include my work here because it\u0027s not a good idea to include myself when the subject is criticism of someone else\u0027s work. What the DLC intends to add are \u0022terrain scatters\u0022 - essentially the proper name for what Squad is calling rocks, trees, cacti, crystals, meteorites, etc. These can all be added to the game with a\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emod\u003C/strong\u003E, for free, and planet mods such as Galileo\u0027s Planet Pack already do this. Stock Visual Terrain, although as far as I\u0027m aware doesn\u0027t add these scatters, improves the planets\u0027 terrain textures instead. This is all easily achievable for free and without much effort. My main critique in this video is that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe entire terrain scatters are part of this DLC.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The planets are bare and boring and barren and appear unfinished. This is why I suggested making them part of the stock game rather than locking them behind a DLC. The stock planets aren\u0027t even finished, never mind the DLC!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, I mentioned that\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe mechanics that are going to be added to the terrain scatters should stay in the DLC\u003C/strong\u003E, but the models for them should be in the main game. Basically \u0022You can see them and crash into them, but you can get the DLC and interact with them\u0022. I genuinely believe the stock planets, especially their surfaces, need the same attention Squad seems to be putting into their part revamps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, that will sound contradictory and in a way it is - saying Squad should stop the part revamps because a mod can do it, then saying they should do the same for the planets? Yes, in a way. Except the parts didn\u0027t need the revamp so much. The planets, however, are a key part of the exploration aspect of the game and there\u0027s nothing worse than exploring nothing at all. Since Squad has already gone ahead and redone the parts, that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying the planets need the attention too - but\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethey\u0027re in such a bad state, making the improvements to them a DLC is a joke.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like what Squad\u0027s doing, but their execution of it is bad. There was little need for this DLC since 95% of it is done through mods anyway -\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe only real addition we haven\u0027t seen before is the gameplay surrounding the rocks they\u0027re planning to add to the planets.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWhich will be pressing a button and seeing our science rise, give or take a couple of parts to achieve this. Do I think it\u0027s worth the price? No.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I don\u0027t like it, I won\u0027t buy it - that\u0027s the motto people chant for these kinds of threads, and that\u0027s it really. I won\u0027t buy it, because it isn\u0027t worth buying imho. It comes down to you whether to support the developers by buying it or not, but since 95% of it can be done through mods, i\u0027ll stick to my mods, thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUltimate TL:DR:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESquad is re-inventing the wheel by adding things mods already add.
