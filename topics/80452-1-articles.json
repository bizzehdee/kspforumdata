The question is: The biggest one we have (so far) is the one we got with the Nasa update. All cool and dandy, but... vould they be bigger? maybe a REALLY large one to substitute wider initial parts? Although it does not have a throttle control after it is lit, the rocket can be tweaked on assembly. I think this could be quite useful to reduce cost (and steps) to send a lot of stuff upstairs... This is not a suggestion for a part, is a question of its efficiency...
