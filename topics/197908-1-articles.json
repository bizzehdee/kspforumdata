For example, in a Superman game MMO a lot of people may want to play as Luthor, but we cannot have 20 Luthors on an MMO instant scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the servers would need to separate each instance of \u0027Luthor\u0027 so that each MMO instance only had ONE Luthor, Superman etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis prevents players from going too hogwild and makes the worls seem bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
