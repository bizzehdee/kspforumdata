I spawned multiple vessels with vessel mover,\u00A0flew out of, then back into load range of said grounded vessel\u00A0and doing so caused the vessel I was flying\u00A0plus one ground vessel to set the trim settings to maximum\u00A0downward pitch/right roll/right yaw. (pressing alt-x still resets the trim, partial workaround, but my ground vessel still takes damage)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso\u00A0maybe worth a mention, I had reloaded/saved multiples times prior to this bug. At one point I\u00A0ejected a Kerbal, landed with vessel mover, moved the Kerbal with vessel mover back to board my vessel, saved\u00A0and reloaded. The Kerbal\u00A0also despawned upon load.\u00A0I included this as, in doing some research I found multiple players suggesting that the control bindings for Kerbals sometimes\u00A0cause\u00A0conflicts\u00A0resulting in the control of multiple vessels\u00A0and that this may interfere with trim. I have however\u00A0rebound said Kerbal binds and tried reloading the save and have still replicated the bug, whether this would still occur on a fresh save without a reload IDK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had another vessel following my own in-flight which left load range and despawned, however the bug still occurs with the following vessel loaded without having first\u00A0despawned. So I think it\u0027s possible to discount these variables.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill provide logs if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect that one or more of the following mods may be the cause: BDAc wing commander, Vessel mover, Physics range extender (set to 10,000), and Plane mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid a fair bit of research before posting,\u00A0and I\u00A0found some clues but nothing definitive.\u00A0I\u0027m hoping\u00A0forum users can provide me with something more to go on, to discover the exact cause and\u00A0perhaps a uncompromising workaround or at-least be able to inform the relevant mod developer/maintainers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod list:\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022KSP_1.10.1_current_mods.png?width=432\u0026amp;he\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022207.64\u0022 height=\u0022897\u0022 width=\u0022432\u0022 src=\u0022https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/145929930222338048/766141622881746944/KSP_1.10.1_current_mods.png?width=432\u0026amp;height=897\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
