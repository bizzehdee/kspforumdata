Suddenly, you feel hungry; almost two hours earlier than usual. You don\u0027t think much of it, pause the game (you\u0027re in the middle of mission scheduled to take you until your usual dining time, at which you would have closed the game rather than pausing it usually) and prepare a meal. You notice that you\u0027ve run out of an important ingredient and go to the store. About 20 minutes later, you\u0027re back and continue making food, which you then eat. You eat in front of the TV, and you turn it on just as an episode of your favorite TV show starts, leaving you glued to the screen for 40 minutes. After over an hour, you return to see that your cat had unpaused the game, which led to your interplanetary mothership crashing into your huge refueling station (you probably shouldn\u0027t have executed that rendezvous burn quite that precisely...). The excessive physics calculations due to the collision of the two craft, both having over 1500 parts, overheat the CPU, so you Alt\u002BF4 out and let the system cool for a while before starting KSP up again and loading a quicksave. You can finish the rest of the mission without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you don\u0027t know is that the overheated CPU mixed up some calculations for SETI@home (which you always run) and KSP, leading to a false positive in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. A press release is issued while researchers try to confirm what was found by your computer; all media spread the news of \u0022ET talking to us\u0022, the world is excited. A few days later, it is confirmed that, in fact, no signs of extraterrestrial intelligence have been found, and mankind is disappointed. The people of Earth lose trust in science, science funding is cut, technology becomes stagnant and eventually humanity\u0027s knowledge deteriorates, starting another medieval era. The few who still value science and technology are prosecuted, you have to watch helplessly as your greatest heroes are executed most painfully in your city\u0027s central square.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou manage to escape and lead a lonely life in the woods. The guilt and isolation make you lose your sanity, and the smartphone you brought with you to remind you of better times when there was technology starts talking, eternally insulting you. One day, you fall off a tree, onto your back. You notice that you can no longer move. Your phone, permanently blaming you for everything bad that has ever happened, is the last thing you \u0022hear\u0022 before you die of dehydration after days of lying on the forest ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take a physics exam at school.

The visions keep on happening, as if there was a light shining on your face. Trying to be as quick as possible, you run to your bedroom to find your voice recorder and record what is happening. You can\u0027t seem to find it anywhere, until you look under your bed, and there it is. As you start talking, you wander around your room, until you go to a wall filled with alluminati pictures. Blaming your ADHD, you record how an angel dies. Suddenly, an incredibly shiny light turns on in front of your window, and it starts blowing your papers away, some of them covering the alluminati pictures. You try to hide in your bathroom, looking at the mirror and thinking about crying for help, or even killing yourself, and you keep on blaming your ADHD. You fill up a bathtub with water, and hide inside it. Your front door opens, and a green beam starts scanning your entire house and stuff, until it finally reaches the bathtub you were hiding in. You are suddenly being dragged by an unknown force, and you try to hang onto a wall, only to find that your efforts were useless, and you black out. Some time later, you wake up.
