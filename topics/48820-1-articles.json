One of the lowest ISP of all the liquid rockets. Only the tiny probe rockets and the Mark 55 are lower. So it burns fuel like mad... but unlike those weak engines, this thing packs a whopping 1500 Nm/s of thrust. It\u0027s like an 18-wheeler for rockets, it may drink fuel like a man dying of thirst, but it has enough thrust to get just about anything moving in a very short span of time. Short enough that flimsier designs can be ripped apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N has a vacuum ISP of 800. This is the highest ISP of the liquid rockets. Only jet engines(which can\u0027t operate in space) or the ion engine has a better ISP. But it only has 60 thrust. In space, it can slowly thrust and build velocity and use just sips of your limited fuel reserves in deep space. This long burning with low thrust can keep even the most delicate designs from being damaged by the stress of acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the ground, the ISP is different, accounting for a myriad of factors that will go unnamed, for there are way too many. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the launchpad, the Mainsail has an ISP of 280. Fractionally, it\u0027s actually pretty good, not as much loss as most engines. It was pretty much designed to be used as a lifting stage, so the shape of the nozzle was made to be used in atmo, with a shorter, wider nozzle. Look at most other engines, the nozzle is narrower and longer than the Mainsail if they were made the same size, as in space the perfect nozzle has an infinite length (At least for a de Laval style nozzle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-N on the pad is a lousy, inefficient engine with an ISP of 200. It will suck down even more fuel than the Mainsail to make the same amount of thrust, and it will take a long time to make that thrust, as it\u0027s making only 4% of the thrust the Mainsail can. If you look at it, you will see it\u0027s the opposite of the Mainsail, a long, narrow nozzle optimized for deep space use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong and short, the ISP is not the end-all feature to look at, it just gives you a general idea of fuel efficiency. Thrust, weight, TWR (Thrust to weight ratio) are also factors to consider. But the difference between atmo ISP and vacuum ISP will give you a general idea of which engines were meant for lifting off, and which were meant for deep-space maneuvering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CattyNebulart","CreatedById":79428,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T09:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink gas millage, but instead of city and highway you have atmosphere and vaccum.

To get specific impulse, we divide that by mass. We end up with Force divided by the change in mass multiplied by unit time. For rocketry purposes, that is Thrust divided by the mass flow rate of fuel. The units of this come out to be a velocity, which we call effective exhaust velocity. To make this specific impulse value readily understood by any unit system, we divide that specific impulse value by something we can all agree to: standard gravity (surface gravity of Earth).

It was well understood that depending on context \u0022pound\u0022 might mean a measure of weight or a measure of mass. If used in the mass context, the word \u0022pound\u0022 changes its meaning to mean \u0022the amount of mass that would weigh 1 pound at sea level on Earth\u0022.

As I said a few pages ago, strictly from the definition, specific impulse is just impulse per unit [something]. The historical convention that we now have is that [something] is in units of propellant mass times g0. This is a pretty nonsensical choice, that came from dividing thrust in pounds by propellant flow rate in pounds per second, and calling the result specific impulse in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe factor of g0 is hidden when using imperial units, or any other gravitational unit system - we could use kiloponds and fold the conversion factor into the unit choice in the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-22T17:15:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2013 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
