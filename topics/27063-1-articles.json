It was a simple mission. Deploy a satellite and attempt to re-capture it with the manipulator. It took a while but I eventually had a successful capture. THEN IT ALL WENT HORRIBLY WRONG. The satellite began to shake violently and then exploded along with the Buran leaving the crew compartment intact. The debris field was still in LKO and I had no means of de-orbiting the crew compartment so I decided to send a kerbal on EVA for fun before i ended mission and this happened. I took a few screens of multiple Kerbals I sent out at.The screens are captured a few minutes apart at max time warp. Two of the crew are on a Kerbol escape trajectory and one has a stable orbit around Kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NRdIUrY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NRdIUrY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/187CY43.png\u0022 alt=\u0022187CY43.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G59KsmI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022G59KsmI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/f1lUDuJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022f1lUDuJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-16T02:29:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2013 02:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by flyin_ruski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Finnerty","CreatedById":61457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T06:47:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see a rescue mission in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-16T06:49:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI had no means of de-orbiting the crew compartment\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is actually a way for these kind of situations: send someone out and push the crew compartment retrograde with their backpack.
