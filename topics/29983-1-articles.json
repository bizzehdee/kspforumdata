I\u0027m having some trouble getting this to work.

I\u0027ll fly a ship until it goes out of LoS of the space center, then I lose control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe satellites have battery power with solar panels, an engine, and 2 sat dishes activated(open) and a RemoteCommand module thing.

Another thing your doing is using satalite dishes. Dishes work only by pointing to another dish and are in range and LoS. A little tip for setting up a simple constilation. Have a 3 man pod with a remote command module to allow control of the remote tech probe (a probe that has solar panels, an engine, and a 8000 km antenna) as you move it to the orbit you want. For me, I found that putting it from a 100x100 orbit, transfer it to a 100x2000 orbit will allow communications with the mother ship (as long as the mothership has an antenna, dipole recommended) at the 2000km mark to allow you to circulise the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T14:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is you\u0027re using dishes that have to be targeted (and you can\u0027t set the target when the sat is out of contact). For a relay network, you want a hub and spoke architecture. The hubs talk to each other over long-range targeted dish connections, then relay the signal to nearby craft over a shorter-range omnidirectional antenna that connects automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dortmunder","CreatedById":66018,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess I need antenna\u0027s on each one then, that\u0027s probably my problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI set up a fairly nice network last night, which I thought was working because I put a sat in orbit then drove a remote controlled vehicle around.

How do I replace my satellites with another I created(basically just added an antenna to the current craft). It\u0027s sort of cheating, I know.

Get it to the pad and use hyper-edit to rendezvous with the sat you want to replace. You should end up 250m away. Rename the new sat to the old sat\u0027s name.
