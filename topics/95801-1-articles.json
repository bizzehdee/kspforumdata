Why not on Kerbin too? At the KSC alone the coins or whatever treasure marker you decide upon could be arranged along the service roads and stairwells of the buildings, and other locations could have fields of gold around them too. This would encourage rover and EVA exploration. Some could even be midair targets that must be collided or shot down with a spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coins should individually be of low value (1-100\u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1) so that while being a fun diversion they aren\u0027t so valuable they take away form the main game mechanic of accepting contracts.

I honestly would not be too concerned with the actual value of the \u0022koins\u0022 whether be funds or science, I would be more interested in actually going out and recovering them, I suppose very similar to the survey reports but with a little more added game play. In my opinion, this could extend the game play of setting up bases.

What would they do? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther thinking on the idea, perhaps you could have the \u0022hotspots\u0022 be a general location to get you started digging but have two different types. Say dirt and crystal. You have to keep searching for the crystal but end up with more junk you\u0027ll have to sift through. So it\u0027s not just land click take surface sample and leave. You\u0027ll have to maybe take what the kerbal can carry to your vessel process it then clear it out if you failed to find the target sample. Rinse repeat. I admit though if the percentage is far to low it will become rather tedious and too grindy. You could have the regular common dirt be worth for example 1 fund and 1 science so it\u0027s not entirely worthless but raise the values for the \u0022rare\u0022 sample. If you bring a container than can only hold 20 samples maybe have the rare sample take up more space given it\u0027s preciousness. So you choose to bring home 20 m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn dirt or 10 m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn dirt and 1 m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn crystal and have filled the box. Again hope I\u0027m able to convey my idea well enough to make sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
