Launch Clamps are one of the more tricky things to make, second only to landing gear/legs, but not nearly as hard. However, you do have to get a lot of the details right. Positions and orientations of transforms matter a lot, and nothing will work right if you get some of the details wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn excellent starting point is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/68961-fasa-launch-tower-tutorial/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EFASA Launch tower tutorial \u003C/a\u003Eby \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57210-frizzank/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002257210\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/57210-frizzank/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@frizzank\u003C/a\u003E, and in fact that\u0027s where I learned to make them. At the time that I made the launch clamps for SpaceY, I followed that pretty closely and ended up moving things around in Unity to make it work. Today I rearranged it in Blender so that nothing has to be done in Unity afterward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is a \u0022How-To\u0022 using my \u0022new method\u0022, from Blender. There are probably other ways of doing this, and in some minor ways it differs from the FASA setup, slightly. However just like the FASA tutorial, let\u0027s look at the CFG setup first, then what you need to make in Blender afterward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nMODULE\n{\n\tname = LaunchClamp\t// Module name.

The \u0022Cap\u0022 is the top of the tower, the part that connects to the clamp itself. The \u0022Tower\u0022 is a transform that contains all of the stretchy tower meshes. The \u0022Base\u0022 is what sits on the ground, and it will need to contain a collider. The Base\u0027s collider acts like a foot and keeps the clamp from twisting, however the clamp\u0027s \u0022attachment\u0022 to the planet is actually at the Cap\u0027s origin, or close to it. Yes, it\u0027s a hovering object, technically. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first, in Blender, create four (4) empty transforms. You can hit Shift-A and select \u0022add empty\u0022 for each one. Then give them these names:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECap, Base, Tower, Clamp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022Clamp\u0022 transform is really just a place to group your animated and non-animated meshes for the clamp itself. Now we\u0027ll talk about each one, and what goes in it. Each mesh object you make needs to be a child of one of these transforms (though like I said, \u0022Clamp\u0022 is just for organizational use in this case). In Blender, I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re working in the default orientation with \u002BZ going \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E. I do the export as an animated FBX, to import into Unity. Let\u0027s start at the bottom and work up:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(After importing, the Cap, Base, and Tower transforms will need to have a rotation of 0,0,0 or something \u0022close\u0022 to it, either with floating point rounding errors, or some \u0022360\u0022 or \u0022-360\u0022 values. The \u0022X=90\u0022 rotations below are for Blender, so that it gets rotated properly during import to Unity)\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBase\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis transform\u0027s position \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emust stay at\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E0,0,0\u003C/strong\u003E, and it needs a rotation of \u003Cstrong\u003EX=90. \u003C/strong\u003E As children of it, you will need two mesh objects:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOne for the base artwork itself, most of which will extend into the ground, but with the visible \u0022foot\u0022 of the tower included. Usually this mesh should be designed to have several meters worth that extends into the launch pad, so that if you build a large rocket, and the clamp is placed outside of the pad, the length still reaches the ground outside of the launchpad. Extending down to -6m is probably sufficient.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA simple mesh collider that corresponds to only the part of the base/foot that should be above the surface of the launch pad. You can add this later in Unity as a box collider or something if you want, but I use a custom mesh collider here. If you try to make this collider too tall, and encompass the part of the Base that is meant to extend under the launch pad, then the entire thing will \u0022jump\u0022 upward to make sure the entire collider is above the pad when it spawns. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe bottom of the collider should be at a height of \u003Cstrong\u003Eexactly zero\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003Cem\u003E (0)\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind that \u003Cstrong\u003E0,0,0\u003C/strong\u003E is the surface of the launch pad. The visible part of the base/foot needs to be above Z=0, and the rest of the base that\u0027s hidden inside the pad will be below Z=0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note: The Base, Tower, and Cap transforms will never be rotated relative to the launch pad. They do not rotate with your clamp\u0027s deployment orientation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETower\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis transform\u0027s origin position will be at the \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ebottom\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E of the cap\u0027s mesh, and the \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etop\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E of the tower\u0027s mesh, centered over the base, at \u003Cstrong\u003E0,0,Z\u003C/strong\u003E, where Z is a height that you will define. It has a rotation of \u003Cstrong\u003EX=90\u003C/strong\u003E. This transform moves with the Clamp and Cap, but is scaled in height so that it can always reach the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can add the visible mesh directly to this transform, probably, but I make a separate mesh object that is a child of it. The Z coordinate for the Tower transform should be above the origin by some number of meters, with enough height to create a tower mesh object from there toward the ground, extending below 0,0,0 a little bit. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis mesh\u0027s top edge must terminate exactly at the Tower transform\u0027s origin. That is, the top edges must not be above or below the Z height of the Tower transform. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003EThis is very important, since the mesh is being stretched by scaling it from the Tower transform\u0027s origin coordinates, any errors with regard to the top of the mesh will be amplified when the launch clamps are used high off the pad, and will not line up with the Cap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe texture used by the Tower\u0027s mesh needs to be repeating along the Y-axis. As the mesh gets stretched, the texture does not get stretched, but rather \u0022tiled\u0022 vertically. It\u0027s OK to have UVs that use different X positions for different things, but the entire Y-height of the texture needs to be a vertically repeating pattern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note: The Base, Tower, and Cap transforms will never be rotated relative to the launch pad. They do not rotate with your clamp\u0027s deployment orientation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECap\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis transform\u0027s origin needs to be at \u003Cstrong\u003E0,0,Z\u003C/strong\u003E (Rotation is \u003Cstrong\u003EX=90\u003C/strong\u003E), centered over the Tower and Base, with Z at a height that you define. This height should correspond to the attachment point at the front of your clamp, for sanity, since this is where your clamp\u0027s head will pivot. The Cap will have two main things as children of it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nA mesh object that acts as the \u0022cap\u0022 to the Tower stretchy-mesh. It should look like it\u0027s a part of the same object, artwork-wise. The bottom of this mesh should match up with the origin of the Tower transform, and extend high enough that no matter which way the Clamp\u0027s head gets turned around (on any or all three axes) that there\u0027s never a gap or missing or hollow mesh visible. When you attach the launch clamps to a rocket or plane, by default the clamp\u0027s head is rotated to correspond to the part it\u0027s attaching to, even if that means the clamp sits sideways or upside-down.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u003Cstrong\u003ETower\u003C/strong\u003E transform and its children. The Tower transform is a child of the Cap transform.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n(Note: The Base, Tower, and Cap transforms will never be rotated relative to the launch pad. They do not rotate with your clamp\u0027s deployment orientation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EClamp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can contain all of the mesh objects and colliders needed for the actual clamp. All animated parts for the clamp retraction will be in here. The colliders that you will \u0022grab\u0022 in the VAB will be here. This is the easiest part, since it functions just like a normal animated part in KSP. I usually orient the transform/meshes such that the clamp is oriented with the \u002BY direction toward the back of the clamp, and -Y in the direction toward the rocket. \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAs far as I can tell\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E it doesn\u0027t appear as though KSP cares as much about the positions and orientations of anything other than Cap, Tower, and Base, and therefore you can pretty much do what you want with the head/clamp components. This part of the clamp will function like a surface-attached part, with the Cap/Tower/Base hanging down from the clamp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPutting it together\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExport from Blender, import into Unity like you would for any other part.
