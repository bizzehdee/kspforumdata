In 1.0.2 it\u0027s around 10,600 m. It may vary per version, so call it out if it\u0027s different in your version. This is mainly a \u0027meaningful buoyancy\u0027 check.\n        - Be able to return the crew to a stable Eve Orbit.\n        - Call out mass in Low Eve Orbit\n        - Call out Crew on Eve\n        - Call out Eve science payload mass ( exclude fairings, envelopes, etc. )\n\n        [\\*]**Complete Havoc** - You must Despoil Eve and:\n\n        - Launch from Kerbin. You can do multiple launches, orbit refuelling, orbital docking assembly etc.\n        - Return the crew to Kerbin. You can assume Kerbin to orbit facilities are available, so just aero capture them is fine.\n        - Call out total Kerbin \u0027on the pad mass\u0027\n\n        [\\*]**Utter Mayhem** - you must achieve Complete Havoc in Realism Overhaul with Real Solar System\n\n        - Probably impossible - but it\u0027s important to \u0027aim high\u0027\n\n    [\\*]landing is not necessary, but the only way you can save\n\n    [\\*]Kudos for realism: Life Support, Remote Tech, DRE, FAR, (as they become settled for the KSP version you are using)\n\n    [\\*]We\u0027ll use the masses and crew counts for ranking.\n\n( There are a couple of other havocy challenges, but they don\u0027t seem to have got any entries, hopefully the above structure and the kick off entry below will make this one more successful. )\n\nA balloon launched rocket just after lighting up...\n\n![farside.jpg](http://jpaerospace.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/farside.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T06:58:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 06:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T06:23:35Z","Content":"Place holder for entries summary etc\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T07:18:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T08:33:03Z","Content":"A first entry and existence proof.\n\nMission report for my ***Complete Havoc*** *entry* [*http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...-but-Kerbalier*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127710-NASA-HAVOC%21-but-Kerbalier)\n\n- KSP version: 1.0.2\n- Mods:  \n\n    - Hooligan Labs Airships - Cirrus Envelope ( not the \u0027realistic lift\u0027 version )\n    - Firespitter - electric prop motor, .cfg hacked since is would explode within a few minutes running at only 10% throttle - obviously not updated for 1.0.2\n    - Movie Time - some neat camera effects - just for fun really\n    - Procedural Fairings - though I used stock ones also, I couldn\u0027t quite figure them out at first.\n    - TACLS \u002B Soylent - life support\n    - MecJeb, KerbalAlarm, KerbalEngineer - build and flight support.\n\n    [\\*]Scorables\n\n    - Crew - 1 only\n    - Kerbin total Pad mass: 825,346 kg = 584,722 Eve Land/Lift \u002B 240,624 Crew Return\n    - Low Eve Orbit mass: 61,764 kg Eve Land/Lift\n    - Eve science payload mass: 9,540 kg\n    - Eve Lifter: 23,665 kg\n\n![DPXtjNpl.png](http://i.imgur.com/DPXtjNpl.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T07:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 07:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DBowman**\n  \nadded mass details"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:12:36Z","Content":"Okay, I will give this a try after Kolonation/ Dunnily Kolliniy.
