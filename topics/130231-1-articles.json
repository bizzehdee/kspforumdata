I used to play KSP a lot before the big updates (Last Fall really) and so I had mechjeb before the updates and so I realized I needed to update mechjeb as well. Long story short, I have dropped the most recent downloadable version of Mechjeb2 from Curse\u0027s website, and extracted it to the \u0022GameData\u0022 folder inside of KSP when I \u0022Browse local files\u0022 in steam. The very first message that pops up for me is \u0022 \u0027Mechjeb2\u0027 is not supported in 1.0.5\u0022 even though it clearly states otherwise on the mod website. I even uninstalled every aspect of the mod and the game, reinstalled the game, then reinstalled the mod and nothing yet.\u00A0I looked all over and I couldn\u0027t find any help so I need to ask here. Thanks for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tantalus","CreatedById":118982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T22:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi thegoldenfrog,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes MJ really not work in your game or is it just the message at startup?
