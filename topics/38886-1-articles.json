Getting there is obviously harder than it looks. So far, I\u0027ve lost a total of 5 out of 6 probes I sent. All 6 are useless because I got them in the system with the wrong rotation and 5 are dead. Good thing I haven\u0027t sent kerbals! XD I still have not updated. Any help for going to Jool? I can get the phase angle set up but once in the SoI is when things go bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is of help, I\u0027ve been swinging out wide and coming in on the dark side. is this one of my problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T21:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry coming in short of Jool\u0027s orbit. Play around for the best fuel efficient intercept. Halfway there, make a correction burn in order to line up on plane. When in Jool\u0027s sphere of influence, you can fine tune a burn to use its moon to slow down using a retrograde slingshot maneuver, use aerobraking from Lathye to slow into orbit, or even use Jool to areobrake. All will save fuel if done right to get orbital insertion and eventual landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T21:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy latest probe can get all the way there, with multiple correction burns without touching it;s main engine.

While still far out this takes not that much delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also do it with Mechjeb and \u0022Change inclination\u0022, but it works this way as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso to save delta-V, aerobraking is suprisingly easy to do. Again MechJeb is usefull, even if you don\u0027t want to use the autopilots (docking autopilot seems to be broken anyway), because it can give you projected orbit after aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LoneRider","CreatedById":76103,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T17:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy trip to Jool (or Laythe, to be correct) was made using the thermonuclear engines, because you have more than enough time to burn, and they have the best fuel efficiency in space. My ship had a science lander module (just a cone with science modules attached, solar panels, batteries, antennas and a parachute) and a relay satellite (solar panels, batteries, antennas and satellite dishes for long range communication to kerbin, RCS). Not much but enough for a good science mission. The big breaking burns took 4 to 6 minutes full-throttle, but you dont even see the fuel bar move. It worked on the second try, but you have to correct your course at several points. like on 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the way to jool. Just watch and correct on and on with maneuver nodes, so you will get into jools area of infuence as close as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T20:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to get to Laythe, see what I did here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/screenshot1434.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot1434.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo ok, I was pretty lucky.
