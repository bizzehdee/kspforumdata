That could be one of the most menacing/cool/scary things I have ever seen in KSP. I think I would abandon ship if that thing was headed for my space station.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean because you are scared or because of the framerate-drop? :-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zekes\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zekes\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ereplace half the aerospikes with jet engines and intakes, it could go farther....\u003Cp\u003Estill, AMAZING! Its SO BIG!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, but with half the engines being jet engines I had problems taking off before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill try again though, maybe I did it wrong, would be cool if I could land this ship and take off again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGreat design!\u003Cp\u003EThe takeoff problem is solved by moving the wheels forward so the \u003Cstrong\u003Erearmost\u003C/strong\u003E set of wheels are near the center of gravity. That\u0027s why it doesn\u0027t rotate. Also, keep it\u0027s acceleration just below 2g (in the green) until about 50km altitude to maximize your fuel. More than 3gs inside the atmosphere is wasted. I personally might have added a few drop off jet engines and filled the center section of engines with thrust vectoring engines, but at the same time, I really like the all aerospike look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you, will try that out later, I\u0027m at work right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried it? I always had to put wheels in the back because the rear tended to crash into the ground without wheels on a ship in this size (because it\u0027s a little bit wobbly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it seems logic, indeed :-D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will experiment with the design, maybe remove the outter aerospikes and replace them with jet-engines. Maybe VTOL capabilities. My first goal was to get this baby into space and that was quiet hard on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T08:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImage links broken or is it just me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally want to see this thing but at work so can\u0027t just fire up KSP!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T08:46:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImage links are fine, maybe a firewall or a proxy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristavius","CreatedById":60879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T10:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, negative on the firewall or anything local, but I am in the middle east currently and occasionally parts of the internet are just a vacant space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, will download when I get home this evening!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T10:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case it doesn\u0027t work, I zipped the pictures for you and uploaded them to the same hoster which hosts the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.file-upload.net/download-7534713/anubis-pictures.zip.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.file-upload.net/download-7534713/anubis-pictures.zip.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KissSh0t","CreatedById":57142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T11:28:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is madness...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Broco","CreatedById":4320,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T15:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is madness...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMadness?
