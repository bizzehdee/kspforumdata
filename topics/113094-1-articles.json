Rocket assisted Landing ran out of fuel and resulted in some unplanned lithobraking.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I was also lucky enough to be offered a test LV 909 engine, so I took that contract and put a probe called the Stayupnik into orbit with plenty of fuel to spare.\n\nThe cash was used to upgrade the launch pad for larger craft and take on a 10% commitment for more rep (In the hope I can get more lucrative contracts). The science from the temp scans of the Stayupnik was used to unlock stability tech.\n\nI got return from orbit and gather science contracts and sent Jeb into low orbit with the Kersplorinator (The Stayupnik was not equiped with a parachute). On landing Jeb picked up some more science at Kerbins Deserts.\n\nFlyby the Mun and Science from space around the Mun contracts became available so I sent the Stayupnik to the Mun! After getting to the Mun I had fuel left so I took contracts to orbit the Mun and get science from the surface of the Mun. Stayupnik is now on the Mun.... Maybe I will rename it to Munnik now.\n\nPictures!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
