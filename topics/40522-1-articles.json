Parts of the vessel could be associated with a system panel, with green/red lights, or directly on the stage informations on the left. Failures could be shown on it, needing an intervention. Some parts could be more fragile, or robust (understand : the probability of failure could be more or less important).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you remember the ammonia leak that occurred during Chris Hadfield\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mission on ISS, that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s what I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m talking about. Engines, RCS, reaction wheels, or solar panel failures, leaks, that kind of stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could force us to maintain our space stations, for exemple, or add a difficulty level to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the lift-off, a critical failure could just abord the mission (and justify the use of, for exemple, escape systems.
