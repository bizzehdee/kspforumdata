I went into the cfg files and moved the CoM back (basically put it on top of CoL) @ 100% LF/OX \u0026amp; mono. What this does is it lets the CoM move forward to where it should be when all tanks are empty of fuel. The way it was before, the CoM was already in front of CoL @ 100% fuel, so when all the fuel was gone, the CoM was so far forward that it basically had no pitch control during re-entry and approach to runway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe picture shows where the CoM and CoL lift are before I edited the cfg files. As you can see, when fuel = 0% the CoM is so far forward that the shuttle is pretty much a lawn dart at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/BHLRaSU.png\u0022]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BHLRaSU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BHLRaSU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems that FAR is not calculating drag properly.

I will check the cfg file to make sure I got it right. I have been flying with sas which helps it. Also with the rolling on ascent it seems the wings want to lift above the heavy fuel tank.

I havent teated re entry since the update. I assume i havent made sufficient changes to COM. I will now make the fuselage a lifting body to see if it helps and do some actual flight testing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHiw are people finding the update?

I lowered the COM to see if it would help stability and added gimballs to make up for it. I will raise the COM again but I just hope it doesnt cause the top heavy cargobay to spin the orbiter upside down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat specific node us strange.
