I went into the cfg files and moved the CoM back (basically put it on top of CoL) @ 100% LF/OX \u0026 mono. What this does is it lets the CoM move forward to where it should be when all tanks are empty of fuel. The way it was before, the CoM was already in front of CoL @ 100% fuel, so when all the fuel was gone, the CoM was so far forward that it basically had no pitch control during re-entry and approach to runway. \n\nThe picture shows where the CoM and CoL lift are before I edited the cfg files. As you can see, when fuel = 0% the CoM is so far forward that the shuttle is pretty much a lawn dart at that point.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BHLRaSU.png\u0022]![BHLRaSU.png](http://i.imgur.com/BHLRaSU.png)\n\nIt also seems that FAR is not calculating drag properly. After re-entry the vehicle is diving at 40 degrees nose down at close to 300m/s. There is no controlling it at that point and it is not possible to bleed of the speed due to lack of roll, pitch and yaw control. I will have a crack at this issue and post when I find a solution.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:53:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype**"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:47:15Z","Content":"So far, it looks great!

I may have to edit the actual model file. Its something to do with the rescaling. Also I think I did the gimball on the oms engines. If you right click on them it will show. I will check the cfg file to make sure I got it right. I have been flying with sas which helps it. Also with the rolling on ascent it seems the wings want to lift above the heavy fuel tank. I could put the centre of mass of the tank inline with the wings but the main engines will have to point in a new direction which wont look right. I can make the tank a lifting surface and test it out\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n@montyben That would be great. But has anyone heard from dragon?

I almost have to lock the kerbal in the cargo bay in order to get him/her back in. About the part welding thing, I only think the nose, crew cabin, and front rcs parts should be put together, as having three separate parts that really don\u0027t need to be 3 parts. But don\u0027t add ablator to any of the parts as the Shuttle **did not** use an ablative heatshield, it used a thermal soak shield. The most logical way to implement this in KSP would be to simply make all the parts have a high heat tolerance."},{"CreatedByName":"iDisOrder","CreatedById":143952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:44:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E V1.1.2\n\u003E \n\u003E Realism changes, yes!
