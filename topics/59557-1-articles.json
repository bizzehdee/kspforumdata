Maybe it makes sense as smaller tanks have probably smaller intakes but I thought than fun \u0026gt; realism in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top of that, I don\u0027t think it serves any prupose as trying to equally distribute fuel by hand is a nearly impossible task. The whole fuel transfer system should undergo a change allowing for balancing fuel between tanks as soon as possible, as this is, unlike the career mode, a core feature of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T19:11:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 07:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by theend3r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T19:09:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022theend3r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022theend3r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...unlike the career mode, is a core feature of the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eargueable\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think maybe the transfer rate should scale the way it does but there should be some kind of minimun transfer rate so that it doesn\u0027t take so long to refill stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T19:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat could also work.

It would take a little work to get around the too much/too little fuel for what you are requesting - you may end up with unbalanced tanks otherwise.
