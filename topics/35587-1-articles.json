It has a grand total of two mod parts on it and neither of them serve any important purpose to flight - just a dorsal KAS refuelling port and a Chatterer box to simulate radio chatter. Not the biggest, not the prettiest, and not the best SSTO spaceplane out there, but it got the job done with fuel to spare for docking, and for me, that\u0027s a huge milestone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
