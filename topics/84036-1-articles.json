In Linux I\u0027d hold down the \u0027Shift\u0027 Key on the right had side of the keyboard. Now that doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027ve gone through the settings to see what\u0027s changed but I can\u0027t find it.

The wiki mentions the Windows key may also become set as the modifier key. And if you\u0027ve copied a config file from KSP on Windows, Alt will be your modifier key, which tends to cause issues on Linux since Alt-Click usually drags the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-07T22:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat \u0027windows\u0027 key might be \u0027super key\u0027 in a linux system, so if you see that in the bindings...

I actually prefer it this way, and have set up WindowMaker to not intercept any key presses for KSP, but this may not be possible depending on which desktop environment you use. As my PC is a bit underpowered by today\u0027s standards I use a bare-bones WindowMaker setup when playing KSP as it has very low RAM and CPU overheads.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T16:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt can be rebound in the settings screen or the settings.cfg, for some Linux players it gets reset to the Windows LeftAlt key \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
