However, the last three days of the week often showcase nearly the same content: There\u0027s a video (Twitch replay) on Thursday, and there\u0027s often a video on Friday. (There was, for example, a video on both Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week.) I\u0027m not going to discuss Twitch Thursdays, but this does seem like a video overload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps, if there was only one day a week for YouTube videos instead of two, SQUAD would have a better chance to select videos that were \u0022actually well-made, narrated or edited.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis.
