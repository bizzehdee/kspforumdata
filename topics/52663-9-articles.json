I\u0027m not saying we shouldn\u0027t have STL. Just that we also should have FTL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

You don\u0027t seem to understand that the case about stability of binary stars is not black-or-white. All binary stars have \u0022safe-zones\u0022. The problem is that (depending on the specific type of binary star) that safe-zone is either so close that the planet is almost melting, or so far that You can\u0027t even see the star it orbits from planet surface/low orbit (have You seen probes pictures of our sun from beyond Saturn?) or both. And \u0027NO\u0027 - \u0022stable\u0022 orbital ranges are not really stable. They are just stable enough that no significant change will happen in one life-time. Key-word: significant! But those orbits are still changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Jupiter and Saturn moons are affected by our Suns gravity, which You would know if You looked at simulations based on observations of those moons orbits. Gravity doesn\u0027t just end at some point. It keeps on going into infinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. February is very recent. Shock-horror, I know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. I have no idea what was that about lifting 1 ton/1 mountain. Rephrase, pleas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. This is not religious point of view. Yes we have simulations, and yes we use them to make predictions. But if a scientist would find out that You treat predictions as if they were facts, he would correct You. In this case facts would be statistics. And statistics show us that all binary stars, force unstable orbits on surrounding planets, but some of possible orbital ranges might be more stable than others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Your answer to Kogereneku - We only found that one planet because this is the only orbital range in triple star system that would allow for a planet to exist for extended period of time. Extended - but not significant in cosmological terms. There are of course other safe orbital ranges around each of those stars, but very far out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Of course we\u0027ll have STL drives before FTL. Warp drives were never considered in any other way, then as end-of-the-line technology to be added in late development after KSP universe grew too big to be traversed in practical time-scale without FTL travel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast thing, I must write about it, because You did get this right - the idea that we could have a binary system if the second star was very small and orbited Kerbol in a distant orbit. KSP could treat it as just another planet with its own SoI. It would have to be REALLY far out, and Jool would probably have to go, as would Moho or Eve (not sure where barycentre would end up), but it\u0027s possible. Then again, I was under the impression we wanted binary stars because it would be an awesome challenge to try to navigate in such unpredictable environment. If You want a second star around Kerbin just to look at it and orbit it a few times, then be my guest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T19:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo warp drives, anything that lies in either pseudo-science, or things like the Alcubierre drive that are mathematically and physically sound, but need matter that hasn\u0027t been discovered yet to work (which is probably also part of pseudo-science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I am pretty much fine with whatever they want to put in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T19:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said that?

Sure you could hack one in, but here is my idea. Perhaps on the KSP website, you have a section for the player to place a contract request for a given space mission. Other players could then bid to win the contract. The winner, would then be able to login to the original players KSP (exchange a one time key via Email or something) and be able to build and fly the mission. The contract requester would be able to watch in real time, as the whole mission unfolds. The vehicle placed in orbit, would of course have a logo on its side, revealing the player that built and launched the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWild idea I know, but it would allow for a more interesting contracting system in the game. Whether the contract is for REAL money, or game money, or simply the prestige of winning contracts and fulfilling the requirements by demonstrating your skill in KSP. Of course there would be a few players out there that dominate the contract business, but hey, that happens in real life too. Then of course you might have the kamikaze players too, so you would have to select contractors based on their credibility not just the lowest bid. Not sure how you could enforce the payment though, other than to lower someones credibility should they \u0022grief\u0022, or if the contractee doesn\u0027t pay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhatever AngelLestat,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are too self-centered to understand that KSP isn\u0027t made to satisfy your fantasy of a so-called \u0022100% realist\u0022 game I can\u0027t discuss with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything show that KSP isn\u0027t built for \u0022realism\u0022 but for entertainment (faking-realism).
