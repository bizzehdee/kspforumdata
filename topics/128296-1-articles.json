Then I remembered that people like to clip\u00A0engines into one another and thought\u00A0that it might be interesting to be able to design your own engines in KSP instead of using the cheat menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s take the LEGO rockets to the next level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow I see it is you would be able to edit one of already in-game\u00A0engines. Click the \u0022Edit\u0022 button and the engine\u00A0is taken apart so\u00A0you can clearly see all the critical parts like pumps, gimbal nodes, the nozzle and other things. Then you click on\u00A0one of the components you want to replace:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNozzle: length, width (1.25m or 2.5m?), type of the nozzle itself (aerospike or RAPIER-like multi nozzle)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe pump: how much fuel do you want to flow through the pipes per second\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGimbal range: limited by the size and type of the nozzle you chose\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nType of fuel: Mono, LF-only, LF\u002BO or Hybrid?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/SaturnF1EngineDiagram.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESomething else?\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mean procedural parts, btw. More like cycle-through mechanic. All the stats (ISP, Thrust, etc.)\u00A0would update\u00A0as you\u0027d cycle through the components, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think? Would that be any useful? Are there any IRL examples of taking apart engines and creating Frankenrockets?

There are plenty of historic examples of engines being hacked together to work. There are other games (mostly car) that allow details down to this level. The interesting part would be making them work together on the component level.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngine,\u00A0Nozzle,\u00A0Fuel,\u00A0Gimbal Control all these are controlled in the CFG while the thrustTransform is in Unity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the Nozzle would have the ThrustTransform but no thrust. The engine would have the power, but no thrustTransform. The CFG could house the fuel per requirement (or use a nonstock toggle). Gimbal component could be easily done on a part level via CFG.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut...would they work together as one unit would be the main question. I have never tried anything like that. My one engine I created was very basic, lol. May take some C# coding to work right. I am still learning C# lol.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T17:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222332597\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022128296\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450792580\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say it\u0027s not a procedural part, but the description is of a procedural part.
