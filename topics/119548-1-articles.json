At night they looked like a big bright dot with a tiny flame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one night I got really lucky and was in Daytona when one of the last shuttles went up..... that was staggering. Even from what... maybe 100 miles.... less I think... the entire sky lit up a brilliant orange, and it sounded like the air itself was being ripped apart from the force of the engines. It was amazing, and I count myself really lucky to be able to have seen at one night launch up close (relatively speaking) before they stopped the program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"livefree75","CreatedById":111756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T19:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe spacecraft hovered over the dark side of the planet, seemingly called \u0022Earth\u0022 by its inhabitants.
