I posted a challenge, to build a supersonic seaplane (WARNING OLD POST INCOMING)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was looking at some old plane concepts when i came across the Convair F2Y Sea Dart was a supersonic sea plane and to my knowledge it was the only one of its kind. Due to the introduction of larger aircraft carriers there was no need for them. So lets see what you can do. Your goal is to re-create this innovative machine. you can use any mods needed (I recommend B9, and Firespitter) as long as you list the mods you used. also the plane must be able to reach mach 1 (approximately 300 m/s) and be able to land and take off on water. I hope to see your creative ways of getting around the water landing. unlike my previous Re-creation challenge I posted, the F2Y has a lot of data on it and as such you should easily be able to search any pictures and specifications needed to help you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOW THE CHALLENGE!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce this craft is made your goal is to push this craft to its limits include pictures of the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(buzzing the tower)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(flying low to the water/ground)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(landing on water with great speed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edepending on the distance/speed/height from these pictures scores will be combined with the crafts overall resemblance to the actual plane and its ability to meet the speed and water landing requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe best of luck and happy building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-AtomicSnails\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(THIS ENDS OLD POST)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas you can see, this is outdated, however, I want to bring the challenge back again. For far to long, I have been attempting to do this challenge, and each time I fail, or can\u0027t recreate it in the next update. Now that we have a 1.0, now we can try it all again. So here is the challenge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Recreate the Sea dart as close as possible to the actual plane \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Prove it can land AND take off from the water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Show that it can reach mach 1 (around 320 m/s) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Go for bonus points (Buzz the tower, land hard on the water, maybe even make a spaceplane variation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain judging is on realism and accuracy to detail, However don\u0027t forget the bonus points. these could make a huge difference depending on what you do.
