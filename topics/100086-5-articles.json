But eventually the slope steepened, and the rover needed to start doing some switchbacks back and forth to keep making headway. If the rover used the grippier tires, this would not be necessary -- but I also find that the grippier tires make a rover much more prone to flipping. Also, in Duna\u0027s weaker gravity, the turning traction from the wheels is not enough to overcome the torque of the cockpit/cabin when the SAS is activated, so it\u0027s necessary to hold down the \u0022F\u0022 key to temporarily disable the SAS when making turns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224HwBGqj.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4HwBGqj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yF2kHKc.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yF2kHKc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022There\u0027s another outcrop of rock ahead.

Down low I was seeing outcrops of sedimentary rocks that had been exposed by a lot of erosion. Higher up here I\u0027m seeing igneous rocks, but they\u0027re also showing signs of water scouring.

I generally choose a driving angle that allows the rover to move at around 10 m/s (which usually allows it to make vertical headway of at least one m/s). The rover handles well at 2X or 3X time warp...but on steep slopes, the rover slides sideways down the gradient too much to make the high time warp useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022G5oLB4a.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G5oLB4a.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHellou: \u0022Ah! Look at this big bowl feature ahead of us. Looks like a classic caldera feature. Pyroclastic flows from here were probably the source of those outcrops of tuff we found below.
