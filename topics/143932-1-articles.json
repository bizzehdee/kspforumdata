I attached connector ports on both the modules and then used the \u0022link\u0022 feature which linked them instantly with a pipe. But i wasn\u0027t able to transfer any fuel as the two ships were not docked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I tried the winch, I grabbed the winch wire thingy and went up to a connector port. When i selected the \u0022docked\u0022 option to plug in, the winch wire came off the back of the kerbal and said \u0022you had nothing to plug in\u0022 but when I selected the \u0022undocked\u0022 option, the thing attached but it still wasn\u0027t docked and I couldn\u0027t do any transfers. Why is this happening and how can i solve this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
