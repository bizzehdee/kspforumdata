The rocket motor cost ~$20 and the little model of Jeb probably was made for only ~$3. The most expensive part by far was the $500 camera mounted on there. Really, though, the camera was originally purchased for other things, so I don\u0027t know if it even counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket is rather squat and stubby: it was made with a 4\u0022 diameter body tube but it\u0027s only a little over two feet tall. It certainly looks bigger though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flight used a reloadable solid rocket motor, an Aerotech H123W, to be precise. I have a license to fly rockets with up to twice as much impulse, but the rocket site that I launch at won\u0027t allow it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much for the compliments! I would love for this video to grace the Daily Kerbal, though I have a sinking feeling that I\u0027m not worthy. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
