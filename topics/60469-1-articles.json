A pair at the top and bottom of each booster, obviously facing away from the rocket, should be enough to eject them clear of the rocket and avoid any collisions.

The SRBs run out of fuel during the gravity turn, and there\u0027s one SRB that happens to be on the topside of the rocket when it gets jettisoned. So it just goes up and comes back down and explodes on the rocket, destroying the bottom stage. I suppose I could try to circumvent this with some clever rotating during the gravity turn... back to testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
