Not a remotely trivial thing to design build and operate either but it\u0027s a potential workhorse ship for getting everything to Mars on a more flexible timescale than the Cycler ship and/or slowboating colony infrastructure. Sure its maybe a bit over the top for getting infrastructure there but again - you\u0027re only using a single ship, rather than a flotilla of different vessels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo\u00A0vehicles (plus slowboated colony infrastructure). \u00A0The Cycler Ship architecture gets everyone\u00A0to Mars and back with two vehicles- a Cycler and an Interceptor-\u00A0exactly the same number of spacecraft that are needed to transport humans to Mars with the ITSy (the new name commonly being used for the new, downsized vehicle that will only be 9 meters in diameter and thus smaller than the originally-proposed ITS)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Interceptor doesn\u0027t need a dedicated Lander to get to the surface of Mars-\u00A0it can do it on its own (but doesn\u0027t have to- the use of a dedicated lander is still an *option*) just the same as the ITSy. \u00A0Slightly easier in fact, since it\u0027s a smaller spacecraft (due to not containg long-term orbital habitat equipment), and thus likely\u00A0has a lower Ballistic Coefficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNor does thr Interceptor need a dedicated fuel tanker, like the ITSy does. \u00A0Since the Interceptor is substantially smaller than the ITSy (though a very significant fraction of its mass in LEO is still fuel)\u00A0if it launches on a first stage the same size as the ITSy it can\u00A0carry all the fuel it needs for its mission with it in a single launch, without requiring any additional tanker-launches (a reusable upper stage can be used to insert the Interceptor into Low Earth Orbit, ensuring all its fuel tanks are full when the upper stage decouples).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, just like with a dedicated lander, I would argue that while you CAN launch the Interceptor in a single launch with all its fuel from an ITSy-sized booster,\u00A0launching the Interceptor dry (with just enough fuel to reach Low Earth Orbit) and then refueling it in orbit is actually beneficial, mostly because it allows use of a smaller launch-stage (you could even use a Falcon Heavy, if you relied on a small flotilla of Interceptors with a few people in small\u00A0capsules each, instead of a single large one cramming in 40-50 people like sardines in a can...)\u00A0and future-proofs the design against the development of a very low-cost launch architecture with a small maximum payload (so it is cheaper for launching fuel, but can\u0027t possibly lift the Interceptor itself) like a reusable spaceplane (planes don\u0027t scale to larger sizes very easily), a Mass Driver launch system (Mass Drivers need to amortize\u00A0their costs over a lot of launches to beat the costs of rockets to orbit- which means they need to be sized to launch only normal-sized payloads rather than the rare monster-sized one), or anything relying on Microwave Beamed Power (the driving cost of a MBP system is the ground-array, so once again you want to build a smaller array and only launch the most common payloads using BMP alone- although it *is* still capable of powering smaller side-mounted Microwave Thermal\u00A0boosters on larger chemical rockets...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the Cyclers- they\u00A0would probably be launched to orbit in multiple pieces and then assembled together, just like the\u00A0International Space Station (in fact, you could literally\u00A0use *THE*\u00A0International Space Station as one of\u00A0your Cyclers \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E-\u00A0just strap an\u00A0array of electric thrusters and enough propellant to it and push. \u00A0Since electric-thrusters produce *VERY*\u00A0low g-forces, they won\u0027t cause damage to the fragile\u00A0structure of the ISS when active;\u00A0and since the Cycler doesn\u0027t need to have a crew aboard when it establishes itself in its Cycler Orbit, the amount of time it would take to get the ISS to a Cycler Orbit is largely irrelevant...) \u00A0So there\u0027s no reason your Cyclers would need to be refueled in orbit either- just launch the propulsion module (with electric thrusters) as one of the many modules of the Cycler- you can take as many launches as you want to assemble it. \u00A0Since the Cycler\u0027s structure never needs to survive high g-forces (literally the only times it will ever be under Thrust would\u00A0be\u00A0from an electric thruster, if you opt for electric over chemical propulsion)\u00A0and it never needs to land or enter an atmosphere- it\u0027s a craft that will remain almost permanently in microgravity, much like a space station...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause the Interceptor is capable of being launched wet, and the Cycler Ship in multiple pieces, a Cycler Ship mission architecture requires literally only one size of launch vehicle (the Cycler\u00A0can be designed to be launched in Interceptor-sized pieces) in the bare-bones scenario. \u00A0Or two, if you want to minimize the amount of docking and assembly for the Cycler by launching it in larger pieces. \u00A0And the colony infrastructure can be slowboated to Mars using whatever launch vehicles you have available, in as many pieces as necessary- there\u0027s no reason you have to launch it all in one go...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, with only two types of spacecraft and as few as only one ITSy-sized launch vehicle as a minimum requirement,\u00A0the Cycler architecture doesn\u0027t necessarily require any more types of vehicles than the ITSy plan (one launch stage, a manned spacecraft and a tanker.) \u00A0Even colony infrastructure can be included in a cargo-hold on the Interceptor for no more cost than including it in a cargo-hold on the\u00A0ITSy (the ITSy and Interceptor require *almost exactly* the same Delta-V to reach Mars. \u00A0Remember, a 5-month Mars transfer is a 5-month Mars transfer, it doesn\u0027t matter if you meet up with another spacecraft on the way by carefully timing your launch...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T07:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only point of a cycler is living space.

have more human advancement than the one with the later base, though by randomly varying amounts at any given time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can measure the progress lost in a variety of ways- scientific advancement produced by the Mars colony\u00A0(by any of a variety of measures of scientific contribution- papers published by Martian scientists, grant money awarded on Mars, etc.), annual crop yield, population, annual electricity production,\u00A0life expectancy. \u00A0But my favorite is GDP. \u00A0The economic value in DOLLARS\u00A0lost over time is after all the clearest

remain identical in slope up until 2038, after which that line\u0027s slope will start to increase more rapidly than the other due to scientific breakthroughs resulting from the colonization process.

technology provides more people withbthe free time to ask more questions- you\u0027ll end up with the first line gaining more and more ground ahead of the second, in a rubaway effect as humanity pulls

We could as well be fighting over resources in a more and more unfriendly climate in a contaminated world after a nuclear war in Asia, that prediction is worth as much as \u00222040 there is a base on Mars\u0022. Any such predictions are pointless as long as there is no demonstrator of any of the discussed technologies, and there is none right now, not even a ready crew module for a lunar flight (yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T12:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTerraforming Mars is pure fantasy for any reasonable time horizon.
