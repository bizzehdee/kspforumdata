I want to build a single launch rocket capable of landing 3 kerbals to eves surface (sea level or anything close within 300\u002B/- altitude) and take them back to kerbin without using mods besides procedural parts and flight management mods like protractor, mechjeb and sort alike. and only by the use of chemical combustion (no nuclear rockets, ion engines. In my case that means any vessel under 500-600 parts upon launch considering my computer hardware which is quite decent. The last stage on the rocket is occupied by 3 external command seats. Some people argue that\u0027s unrealistic because of atmospheric conditions blasting on the pressure suits during ascent. I say bwah,... that\u0027s just my imagination of 23rd century pressure suits. I basically transformed my ascent module into a rocket stage with 3 seats with 2500m/s delta v excluding any kerbals sitting in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will obviously use a eve rendezvouz aproach where I will leave the Kerbin return vehicle in eve orbit. I said Obvious because any other chemical combustion method is less efficient and I should change the topic title:sticktongue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really taking this \u0022efficiency\u0022 goal quite seriously. So seriously in fact that I have come up with the following question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I wondered what is the best TWR for each region of Eves atmosphere? I\u0027ve come up with a chart of terminal velocities upon ascending from eves surface but don\u0027t know how to calculate The amount of TWR needed to reach that terminal velocity because I want to cut on total engine mass as much as I can. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If you want to share any additional tips on increasing efficiency which I might now know please dont hesitate to reply. By efficiency I mean \u0022Mass\u0022 from Eves surface to orbit (not part count or size) So far I got a 25.8 ton vehicle with 10km/s delta v (2-2.5 km/s short for a sea level ascent)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-12T20:35:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/12/2015 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T20:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t lifted off from Eve yet so take this advice with caution. A short time ago I was planning a manned mission to Eve that I haven\u0027t flown yet. In preparation for that I did some computer simulations to see if I could figure out the best TWR. I used three core stages stacked is series and three pairs of asparagus strap-ons. The following is what I came up with, in graphical form. TWR is based on Eve gravity. The first three peaks represent burnout of the strap-on pairs, while the last three peaks represent burnout of the core stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP_001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that my initial plan was to land at a high elevation somewhere, so the above is based on taking off from an elevation of 3000 meters.

What I did first was to settle on a basic design configuration - in this case it was the three central stages with the three pairs of asparagus strap-ons. I choose this arrangement because it gave me the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV I needed. I then ran a series of simulations in which I could alter two key parameters: (1) the starting TWR of each stage, and (2) the distribution of propellant between the stages. I went through repeated iterations, adjusting one parameter, then the next, and then back to the beginning for another series of iterations. I just kept making adjustments until I could obtain no further improvement in performance. I figured at that point I had pretty much optimized the TWR because any further change I would make would lessen the performance. In the end my basic conclusions were the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropellant should be distributed between the stages in roughly to the following ratios:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Stage 3 = 1 (uppermost stage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Stage 2 = 5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Stage 1 = 14 (core stage onto which the strap-ons are mounted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Strap-ons = 7 x 6 each\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiftoff TWR, all strap-ons \u002B Stage 1: 1.60\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 1 TWR after jettison of the last strap-on pair (propellant tanks full): 1.40\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 2 TWR at ignition: 1.235\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 3 TWR at ignition: 0.80\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this is only theoretical and hasn\u0027t been proven in practice. I should also note that this is based on an ISP of 320 s sea level and 370 s vacuum for all engines. Results may vary with different engines, such as the aerospike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me also specify that my definition of \u0027optimum performance\u0027 is \u0027maximum payload fraction\u0027. For the simulation that I\u0027ve been talking about, the payload fraction is about 0.00565. That\u0027s miniscule, but then Eve is a particularly tough place to launch from. The \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV of the simulated launch was about 10,770 m/s (from 3000 m elevation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I haven\u0027t tested the above recommendations within the game, I have used a the same simulation techniques to try to optimize my Kerbin launch vehicles. I found that when I put those results to the test in gameplay, the launch vehicles performed identical to the simulations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(edit to add)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that during the simulation I assumed that all engines are operating at 100% throttle all the time. I just took a look at my simulation results and I see that toward the end of Stage 1 burn (about 124-149 s elapsed time) the launch vehicle exceeds terminal velocity. In practice the engine should probably be throttle back during this time just enough to keep at or below terminal velocity. This would truncate that first tall peak in the TWR graph. By the time of the second tall peak at Stage 2 burnout, terminal velocity is large enough that there is no need to throttle back. This change should provide a small improvement in performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T01:31:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 01:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
