To find ore, you need to click the arrow on the Kethane resource window so it shows the ore resource instead. Currently the launchpad has an ore detector module built-in, so you don\u0027t need a separate part to detect it. You will need an augur to mine ore, a smelter to turn it into metal, a rocket workshop to build that into rocketparts, and a launchpad to launch your ship from. You will also need storage for these resources if they aren\u0027t all on the same vessel. You will probably also want fuel tanks connected to your launchpad with fuel lines; otherwise you will have to spawn your ships with empty tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boberts314","CreatedById":69216,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T19:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo the three above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well nevermind me then.
