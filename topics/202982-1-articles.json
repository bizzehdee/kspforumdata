In real life how often do we get saved from bad results? Not often....usually quite rare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI read a Tron fanfic that I thought did a better job than the Tron Legacy sequel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a scenario where Quorra failed to save Sam during his lightbike duel with CLU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the story can include a bit too much character thought at times, it shines when it comes to problem resolution. Often characters flat out admit they do not know how to solve the problem at hand. Other times they have an option but are afraid it will make matters worse because it could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end risks are taken and lives are risked, resulting in a version of Tron Legacy that would have earned a PG-13 rating given some bloody injuries Sam sustains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut they succeed, all because they took opportunities as they presented themselves to take.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was virtually no deus ex machina at all to the story\u0027s credit, since even when the bad guy spared lives he did so for reasons that actually fit his character motivations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Want Of a Voxel fanfic\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-11T00:05:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2021 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-11T12:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nwhen they don\u0027t know what to say\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nand have completely given up on the play\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\njust like a finger they lift the machine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\nand the spectators, next slide please, are satisfied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022border:0px;color:#202122;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px 0px 0px 1.6em;text-align:left;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\n\u2014\u2009\u003Ccite style=\u0022border:0px;font-size:17.6px;padding:0px;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EAntiphanes\u003C/cite\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
