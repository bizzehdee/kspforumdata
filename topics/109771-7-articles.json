Thank you.\n\nI have finished up the fuel tank support, sorry I was away from this project for so long.\n\n**For Real Fuels:**\n\nAdded our resources to the tank types that needed them, but in the main Real Fuels was the easiest thing to handle. Service Module tanks are your best bet for ISRU setup.\n\n**For Modular Fuel Tanks:**\n\nAdded our resources and the required CRP resources to Structural, RCS, Xenon, and Service Module tank types.\n\nFor both Real Fuels and Modular Fuel Tanks, Dr. Jet\u0027s Hex Tank system is implemented as Service Modules.\n\n**For Interstellar Fuel Switch and Firespitter Fuel Switch:**\n\nAny part that has ONLY MonoPropellant or Ore as a resource and that is not a command module or docking port will be switchable for our resources. We make one additional copy of the part and configure it for the resources we use. This prevents it our scripts from being used on odd service-module type parts that may contain multiple different resources. I have not extensively tested the interaction between FFS or IFS and our scripts using full installs, but with the core plugins for these mods it works fine.\n\n**For no fuel mods:**\n\nIf you have no fuel mods, we duplicate any part that has ONLY MonoPropellant or Ore as a resource and that is not a command module or docking port, and create a tank for each of our resources. This is the \u0022Tank Spam\u0022 method. This method is the reason you should pick up FFS or IFS or MFT, or just use RealISRU as intended with the Realism Overhaul suite.\n\nNow I need to repair the asteroid mining. I messed up my process and also deleted some of my KSP installs, losing what I had. I have revised my process and should be good for the future no matter what happens in the volatile section of my drive, but that still means I have to duplicate some earlier work. Fortunately, there isn\u0027t much. I am also going to be removing the resource definitions for Kerbol system now that RSS is up and running; CRP should handle anything you need and, if it doesn\u0027t, please consider making a pull request to CRP with the definitions that are missing. Or talk to RoverDude about it in the CRP thread. Either way, it\u0027s not RealISRU\u0027s problem because this mod is intended for Real Solar System.
