So the plan was that I\u0027d dock the furthest out first, fire off some decouplers, then dock the next highest, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I had was during docking. Normally, when docking I select \u0022control from here\u0022 from the port I\u0027d like to use, and then select the port on the target vessel as my target, and so long as I got the navball indicators lined up (my velocity, centre of target), they\u0027d at least hit. But what I was experiencing here was that the ports would slide past each other. I had to do the alignment by eyeball and it took a lot more effort (and didn\u0027t seem to match up with what the navball told me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo - is there some trick to performing off-axis docking I need to learn? Was my previous intuition that setting \u0022control from here\u0022 and targeting a port on the other vessel, and keeping my velocity vector and the target aligned should at least cause a collision between those two parts incorrect? Is it in some way related to the COM not being aligned with the part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(No mods at the time, I\u0027ve just installed FP)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar situation recreated using a deliberately exaggerated vessel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/vxehE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

There are several solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. control target vessel and orient its port towards your original spacecraft. The best way to do this is to use a fixed reference that is common to both craft. You can use prograde/retrograde or radial in/out but these will change over time so if you have to re-align you have to start all over. Scott Manley suggests using the normal/antinormal marker as this will NOT change during your orbit. Then go back to original spacecraft and point in the same but opposite direction. Now your ports will be aligned. The tricky bit is you now have to dock using only translation. Even harder is that your target marker and your prograde marker may be out of the visible portion of the navball. also remember to use this you have to change to orbit mode to see your normal/antinormal then back to target mode. You can rotate if you need to to see target marker but then you have to switch back to orbit mode and re-align to normal/anti-normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. use a mod. FDAI gives the most help, in particular it lets you see prograde and target marker even when your orientation causes them to be off the visible nav ball. I use a simpler one called navball docking alignment indicator that just gives you another, red marker on navball that shows you where to point to be at the right angle. Thus if other markers are off the visible navball you can rotate to see them, correct, then rotate back to the red marker. Eventually you want all 3 (target prograde, prograde, and alignment) to match up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T21:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had this problem before too, I think.
