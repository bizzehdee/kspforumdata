So, the whip says \u0022maxPowerFactor = 8\u0022, which means it will transmit beyond the nominal range until each packet costs eight times the usual amount of power (presumably to stop the satellite from starving itself attempting interplanetary communication). Because transmission range goes by the inverse-square of transmit power, the maximum range is the square root of 8 (that is, 2.828) times the nominal range, and 18.3 Mm x 2.828 = 51.7 Mm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toadicus","CreatedById":67745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smunisto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smunisto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.

One observation that was made was that while AntennaRange assumed that Kerbin was covered with ground stations, RemoteTech didn\u0027t have any ground station apart from the tracking station itself. A suggestion came up that in career mode, at least, it might be possible to restrict the Tracking Station\u0027s area of coverage to the horizon (so it\u0027s effectively covering a hemisphere), and allow the player to pay to build ground stations at different lat-lon locations with more or less the same capability as the Tracking Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, most players would probably start off by covering the equator, probably with downrange stations starting off fairly close to KSP and then getting further apart as the anticipated LOS to the vehicles heading to orbit allows spacecraft to fly above the blind spots. And then you run into potential issues with high-latitude coverage - are you better off setting up tracking stations up there, or orbiting satellites?

I\u0027m not saying no one would like them or that they can\u0027t be fun, but they \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E tedious. Here\u0027s a bit more about why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech has a single ground station: KSC. You then have to build a whole orbital network to get connectivity. This has never been realistic, but it\u0027s their thing and their users like it, so it\u0027s fine. With a cfg file, though, you can add a bunch of them all over the place. There are configs to match old KSC, the KerbinSide locations, and probably a whole lot more. That makes it more interesting, but there\u0027s no cleverness involved: you just downloaded a cfg file and hey presto, you\u0027ve got a much easier time of getting connections done. It\u0027s also arbitrary; I could make a config that for example supported KerbinSide, but you could make a config that just put them at every 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 lat/long intersection. There\u0027s no obvious, stock-compatible logic available for placing \u0022pre play\u0022 ground stations. I don\u0027t particularly like adding features that don\u0027t offer some opportunity for cleverness, because in my opinion exploiting cleverness is the core of what makes KSP fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative would be to require manually-placed stations -- you could drop them off rockets or fly them over with planes or drive them around with rovers, whatever. That\u0027s horribly tedious. That\u0027s most of what was wrong with science pre-0.90 and half of what\u0027s still wrong with contracts today: tooling around your home planet as a tax for playing a game about exploration and cleverness is agreeable so far as it\u0027s educational, but it needs to be something that\u0027s easily sidelined by players who want to get out and explore the cosmos. Again, some people will like it and that\u0027s fine, but at its core it\u0027s just a time sink. I don\u0027t particularly like adding time sinks, because I\u0027m a busy guy myself and I see value in respecting the players\u0027 time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the real problem here (in my opinion) is that there\u0027s no easy middle ground. On the one hand, we can magically add ground stations at arbitrary locations for free. On the other hand, we can manually design, build, and deliver them. In the middle somewhere there\u0027s a \u0022build ground station here\u0022 button that puts a little transmitter on the ground somewhere in exchange for funds or rep. \u003Cem\u003EThat\u003C/em\u003E is a system I could get behind, but I\u0027m pretty sure that\u0027s a system that\u0027s actually very complicated to implement, especially if we want the stations to be physical things that you can interact with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA possible implementation concept that might be within reach of this mod would be hybrid between the RT \u0022config-based\u0022 content and the \u0022build station here\u0022 content -- allow pre-configured stations to be purchased for funds or rep. I could maybe show them in map views, but if you walked up to them there\u0027d be nothing to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I do this, though, I\u0027d like to hear cases for ground stations that address at least two of these three criteria: realism (is the concept grounded in reality? how?), \u0022fun\u0022 (does the concept offer challenging but rewarding gameplay? does it help the player feel clever or successful? how?), or educational (does the concept help teach new players how to play the game? how?). I\u0027m willing to concede realism to some degree, but since I\u0027m guessing the ISS blind spots are the fault of oceans or political gamemanship, and the latter isn\u0027t modeled in KSP, and since real-world space programs managed to negotiate nearly worldwide coverage at the very dawn of space exploration, it feels like a weak argument on its face.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly encourage you and other interested parties to make such cases.

As you observed, anything that can at least get Jool will also get Eeloo at least sometimes, and by default certainly everything else. Therefore, anything that goes out that far is essentially an \u0022I win\u0022 antenna. In my opinion, that\u0027s fine: we use \u0022I win\u0022 antennas in real life. Antennas that use longer ranges (like your 350Gm antenna) are therefore basically quality-of-life improvements: as a reward for unlocking XYZ tech to get the big 350 Gm dish, you\u0027re going to get a bonus on transmission rates for your super-distant probes.
