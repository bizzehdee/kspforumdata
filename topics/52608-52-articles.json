This is exactly how it \u003Cem\u003E(and most other plugins that do anything fun)\u003C/em\u003E treats KSP itself, that\u0027s what amounts for API around here, and it usually works. RPM\u0027s code that does so did not ever change because MechJeb explicitly broke it by removing or renaming those public members, because MechJeb never did such a thing in all the time MechJebRPM existed. MechJeb\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecode\u003C/em\u003E per se is, therefore, not at fault. All that \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be required for MechJebRPM to load is to for MechJeb\u0027s DLL to be available, i.e. for those members to exist, be named the same, and ask for the same number of parameters if they\u0027re a method that needs to be called.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Module-That-Must-Not-Be-Named problem adds one restriction -- MechJeb\u0027s DLL must be loaded first, otherwise KSP\u0027s plugin loader throws things that require it out. That should not make a specific version required either. In C#, there is such a thing as a \u0027strongly named assembly\u0027 which would explicitly prevent calling the wrong version of the DLL, but that requires the latter to be cryptographically signed. As far as I can tell, nobody in the KSP plugin world does this, which means that the requirement for a specific version to be referenced comes from KSP\u0027s plugin loader. Either that, or there\u0027s a compilation option I\u0027m totally not aware of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only option of dealing with it is rewriting lots of code, because I\u0027ll need to use the so-called \u0027reflection\u0027, which in this case will basically amount to telling KSP, \u0022I\u0027m not allowed to call this module, or use it\u0027s data structures or whatever, but here\u0027s a string that contains it\u0027s name. Find me something that has this name, is of this type, has these and these parameters, and give me a pointer so I can finally call it dammit.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERPM does it for things that plug into RPM, and it\u0027s easy enough, because in this case it\u0027s RPM who gets to say \u0022If you want to plug into me, you have to have an object that looks like so and so, and tell me it\u0027s name, I\u0027ll call you if I need anything.\u0022, so it can be done in a more or less generic way, once. It proved so handy \u003Cem\u003E(because it lets monitors be configurable in a generic way regardless of whether a handler is internal to RPM or not)\u003C/em\u003E that RPM even calls it\u0027s own internal components the same way. Doing this to access all the variety of things RPM currently does with MechJeb would be quite a pain, if only because the best way of doing this that I know so far allows me to only communicate objects of types that are already defined, either by C# or by KSP itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, either that or MechJebRPM gets merged into MechJeb, which would avoid the module-that-must-not-be-named problem entirely, but that, I expect, is not practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMihara I don\u0027t see why the change in version number can impact RPM\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut as far as anyone can tell it does.
