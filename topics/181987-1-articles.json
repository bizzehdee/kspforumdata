So I have the normal good visual mods the literally every KSP content creator uses. I use stock visual enchancements and all reccomended mods with it. Anyways, whenever i use these mods, everything works fine but the only problem is that it looks terrabile and not near like the youtubers that i watched. The problems are that i see a black line following my camera everytime i move, The anti aliasing looks horrible even though its on the best settings, i get 20 FPS even though i have a GTX 1080TI and whenever i have at least 10-15 mods my game runs normally at 10 FPS!.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a GTX 1080TI\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni7 7600\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nall the good other specs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Allyen","CreatedById":194647,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-06T12:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have all the regular visual mods such as, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Scatterer, Stock Visual enhancements\u002Ball reccomended mods, and planet shine.
