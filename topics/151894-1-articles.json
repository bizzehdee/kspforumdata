When I double click the KSP executable, it loads but the loading takes ages. I\u0027ve let this go for over 30 minutes and I can see stuff is progressing but nothing is happening. I played this on my computer about a year ago with no issues so I can\u0027t tell if it is a problem with the OS or KSP. Has anyone run into this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T23:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171456-captainchemist/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022171456\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/171456-captainchemist/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Captainchemist\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes this is a known issue with OSX Sierra.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are a number of threads already and you can work around the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically:\u003Cbr\u003E\nOSX Sierra GateKeeper will quarantine any downloaded app. It randomly moves the files to a temp folder when you run it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis causes problems for KSP and Unity apps.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy copying the folder permissions are changed and the quarantine removed. and then moving them back again. You can then execute the app.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame goes for downloaded mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what you do is copy the folder say onto your desktop and then move it back to Applications again - should fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
