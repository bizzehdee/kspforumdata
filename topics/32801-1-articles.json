If your ship has an ASAS on board you can set it to maintain a heading, but that is about the extent of what it can do. The default hotkey for this is T, and should make the SAS indicator on the navball turn white. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost likely you\u0027re looking for the kind of functionality that comes from MechJeb, which adds a great deal of intelligence to the ship\u0027s automation and is capable of guiding the ship through common tasks with only minimal input from you. It\u0027s a great learning tool in this regard, because you can learn how to do it manually by watching how mechjeb does it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bunsen","CreatedById":10598,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-13T17:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in a proper orbit the game will do exactly what you want, no piloting (auto- or otherwise) involved.

An orbit is an elliptical trajectory that circles Kerbin. Getting into orbit simply involves reaching orbital speed (2300m/s) with a periapsis (=the lowest point in your orbit) above the atmosphere (70000m). You should read the tutorials at the top of this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in orbit, you can leave your spacecraft indefinitely, it won\u0027t fall down.

Check your map to see the shape of your orbit. Unless it circles the entire planet, never dropping below 70km at your lowest point(periapsis), you do not have a stable orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as autopilot is concerned, MechJeb can automate certain functions, but that is a mod(check the spaceport). Stock KSP does not have any autopilot. The SAS and ASAS are only stabilizers, SAS will attempt to counteract roll and ASAS will attempt to hold your ship on its current heading, but they will only do this while SAS(to the top right of your NavBall) is activated. To activate or deactivate SAS, press T be default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note; Welcome to Kerbal Space Program! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"airlynx99","CreatedById":70269,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T02:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, I bought the game a week ago and spent just as much time watching videos on how to fly as I did actually flying. The nodes that you create in map view are very helpful, but they do not execute themselves. MechJeb was a great help, but a bit overwhelming at first. Before jumping into MechJeb I\u0027d suggest being able to plot nodes and execute them successfully. Also, if you create a node with a long burn time (over a minute) it sometimes helps to start your burns a bit before your actual node. (something I learned from MechJeb) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, MechJeb is not a perfect autopilot, it requires some babysitting sometimes. My first attempt at leaving Kerbin\u0027s orbit for Moho I relied entirely on MechJeb and it started a 5 minute long retrograde burn on my periapsis, I never did figure out why. Naturally I just started plummeting back to Kerbin, and to fix it I had to burn up more fuel and was left with empty tanks circling the sun. I leave that flight there as a lesson to not trust the autopilot all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-14T02:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps he is in an orbit, but below 70km?
