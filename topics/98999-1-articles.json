And on big crafts (\u0026gt;100tons) ion engines need still awesome much burntime or many engines and even more solar panels.\u003Cp\u003EI really just wanted to know if there are well known designs in the forum I should check out. But by now, the most helpfull answer was indeed the link to google ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you won\u0027t use one engine type because its cheaty and makes it too easy, but you will use another engine type because its cheaty and makes it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can SSTO with just rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never understood the obsession with SSTO beyond LKO. 100% reusable-\u0026gt; sure\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion: Do you mind refueling after reaching LKO? Because to me, that implies a 2nd craft (ie, now 2 elements or stages instead of a single one) to supply fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I do for full reusability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SSTOs to deliver (a) the mission payload/interplanetary stage (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Refuel things in LKO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The laythe SSTO self launches from Kerbin (if it can SSTO from kerbin, it can easily do it on Laythe), and rendevouses (sp?) with the interplanetary stage (fuel is topped off before the SSTO carrier de-orbits)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A reusable tug to push the payload to just under escape velocity (may or may not do multiple perapsis kicks depending on payload size)- it then aerobrakes to LKO again and refuels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* the mission payload, now only needs to PE kick once more for about 1,000 m/s to aerobrake at laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The mission payload first goes into a highly eliptical orbit that is nearly at escape velocity, and leaves a fuel tank/small tug there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The remaining mission payload aerobrakes to Low laythe orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* SSTO descends and lands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* orbital rendevous with the fuel/tug in LLO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* orbital rendevous with the fuel/tug in a high eliptical laythe orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* ~1,000 m/s ejection to aerobrake back at kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything comes back, nothing is discarded, the wings and air breathing engines to lift everything up to LKO aren\u0027t carried along as dead weight, the only wings and airbreathers carried are for the laythe lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe margins for doing it this way are much higher than trying to do a single stage there and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts a lot more complicated, but to me that\u0027s playing the game and part of the fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, the best high bypass turbofans on airliners (which are subsonic) have effective ISPs in the range of about 6,500.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats not because their exhaust velocity is ~8x higher than a NERVA rocket.... but because it is *effective* ISP and they do not count the mass of the air used as reaction mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP does count that mass in their ISP equations... in a 15:1 ratio.... which means they should be using the *real* ISP(ie counting all the reaction mass, not just fuel mass), but 2500 as a value for *real* ISP is ridiculous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-08T11:35:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP does count that mass in their ISP equations... in a 15:1 ratio.... which means they should be using the *real* ISP(ie counting all the reaction mass, not just fuel mass), but 2500 as a value for *real* ISP is ridiculous.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s about right for a turbojet (or a turbofan with afterburner on). The J-58 engine used in the SR-71 had a specific impulse of 1900 s at Mach 3.2, while the Olympus 593 engine used in the Concorde had around 3000 s at Mach 2. The basic jet engine should have higher nominal Isp values than it currently has, but the high-performance engines used for supersonic flight are much less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
