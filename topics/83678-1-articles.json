KSP then launched normally. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it turns out, Spaceplane Plus and Raster Prop Monitor already allow you to link external cameras to the IVS displays. Hullcam VDS includes (of course) cameras that when activated give you a full screen view of the camera field of vision, and these can also be detected as \u0022external cameras\u0022 by the Raster Prop Monitor. Spaceplane Plus may have cameras also - but since I installed all these mods at the same time I\u0027m not sure which cameras came with which add-on. Some of the Hullcam VDS cameras don\u0027t work properly with the internal displays - notably the booster cam - but this is not a big deal. I noticed two anomalies - one was that at one point even when de-activated the LV-909 engine has thrust exhaust coming out; the other was that at some point one of the external cameras no longer provided an image to the internal display - on re-start function was normal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, a much more immersive and \u0027realistic\u0027 experience with these extras, and my hats off to the entire add-on dev community.
