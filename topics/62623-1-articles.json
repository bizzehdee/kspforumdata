Solar panels degrade with time, pumps and plumbing for heat rejection systems fail regularly, and just in general parts wear out from extreme thermal cycling fatigue, constant exposure to sunlight and hard UV exposure, atomic oxygen corrosion and impacts of micrometeorites, vacuum cold welding, Paschen discharging etc. Random failures of propulsion, communication or attitude control parts could make a need for EVAs more regular. And hilarious unexpected failures add to the fun and excitement of a mission. Also on-orbit construction of space stations should need some EVAs, perhaps Kerbonauts can assemble trusses while on EVA (and obviate the need to put those ridiculous fully assembled trusses on launch vehicles).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatcargo","CreatedById":93302,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T13:29:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with above, but for EVAs requiring more complex operations and/or toolsets, players should have available adequate equipement/parts : player should build a small repair-tug from RCS thrusters, RCS fuel, solar panels/ RTGs, reaction wheels, lights etc and it should have a surface attached toolbox part used for manual manipulation/repair and a large magnetic claw-like clamp for capturing and manipulation of large components used to position a component into place before performing component repair or installation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T14:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat about walking around on a planet with a science detector (looks like a metal detector)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T15:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BLUESTREAK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BLUESTREAK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EZero G EVA:\u003Cp\u003ERepairs, repairs, repairs.

Spacewalks are damned dangerous things to do, and whilst it\u0027s very Kerbal to go out just to look at the view, I want there to be a reason to do so. Construction isn\u0027t something I\u0027d considered, but in retrospect it\u0027s obvious. Perhaps some form of Canadaarm that can only be operated on EVA, in the manner of the rover seats - either for moving satellites out of payload bays, or sticking orbital constructions together - something that can only be done from outside the ship. Because otherwise you do one spacewalk in one SoI, get the science points for it... and that\u0027s it. There\u0027s never any need to go EVA there ever again. And frankly, that\u0027s not much fun.
