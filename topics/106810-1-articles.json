But no: the funds and prestige weren\u2019t actually being added to my accounts. The mail hung around after the simulation, but the payment didn\u2019t. I see the same thing happening with Stage Recovery, so this should be chalked up to the way the messaging system works (preserving messages from a reverted flight) and not an error on your part.
