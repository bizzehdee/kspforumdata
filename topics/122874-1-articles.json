Finally saying hello after lurking and learning for a couple of months. Thanks to everyone who is active here --- this is a tremendous resource for people interested in discovering how to get beyond the basics in this game. For the record, I bought the game on Steam at a recent sale (August, maybe?) and have never played a version before 1.0.4. So no bad habits to unlearn, and with the information I\u0027ve gotten here I\u0027ve managed to make a lot of progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus far, I\u0027ve played one main (career mode) game in which I have thoroughly scienced Kerbin and its moons, unlocked the entire tech tree, and I\u0027m currently watching the first wave of unmanned ScanSat all-in-one probes dropping into polar orbits all over the larger system: Moho and Duna/Ike have arrived, Jool (x2) and Eloo are on their way, and the Eve and Dres probes are waiting for transfer windows to open up. The first big manned mission --- A Duna/Ike mission with ISRU and a science hopper --- will be arriving in something like 150 days. I\u0027ve also started a pair of separate games with my kids, who are digging it. Though the 9-year-old mostly likes it when we screw up and things go boom. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be following up this greeting with one or two (hopefully not too stupid) questions in the Gameplay forum in a few minutes. Mostly about spaceplanes and/or vertical air-breathing SSTOs, which I just haven\u0027t grokked yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again to all the contributors here.
