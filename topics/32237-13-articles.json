The part count is \u0026lt;200 (yet) but my system normally can handle crafts with ~600 parts quite well. Would it help to remove the integrated modules (don\u0027t really need RCS/MechJeb/SAS) to reduce the complexity of the Karmony modules (cannot test for myself right now because I\u0027m at work), or would this be pointless? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it seems that every light at the ports (or EVA hatches) stays active even though they are connected to other modules directly/with docking ports. It\u0027s not that tragic that they \u0022glow\u0022 through the connections/hull, but could the amount of illumination cause the performance decrease? IIRC they are manually removable from the \u0022light\u0022-action group, but I don\u0027t know if it would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, need to finish the design today and start to build a rover crane to assemble the base at the mun.
