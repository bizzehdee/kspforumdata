We can get mass out of this explanation by noting that the KE *per ton of vehicle* is just 1/2v^2. (That\u0027s called \u0022specific kinetic energy\u0022, for those who care about such things. It\u0027s got units of energy per mass, or equivalently length-squared divided by time-squared. I\u0027ll be calling it m2/s2 from here on out, though it probably makes more intuitive sense to call it Joules per kilogram.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo. Let\u0027s assume that your vehicle is sitting still (initial v = 0, KE also = 0) and you give it a boost of 100 m/s delta-v. Now your KE per ton of vehicle is 1/2 * (100)^2. 100 squared is 10,000; divide by 2 for 5000 m2/s2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith me so far? Good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for comparison, let\u0027s do the same thing again... but this time let\u0027s do it to an object that\u0027s already moving at 2000 m/s. That means its initial KE is 2,000,000 m2/s2. Now when we give it an additional dv of 100 m/s, its new velocity is 2100 m/s, for a KE of... 2100 squared is 4,410,000, divided by 2 is 2,205,000 m2/s2. Which means we have now ADDED 205,000 m2/s2 of specific kinetic energy. Go look at the first case, now look at this one. We just got FORTY-ONE TIMES as much energy added to our vehicle with THE EXACT SAME FUEL BURN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah.

Going from 1000-1100 m/s, an identical expenditure of delta-V (100 m/s), gives you 105,000 J/kg of specific kinetic energy. Despite costing your rocket an identical amount of delta-V, the second maneuver has given you far more kinetic energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMore effecting in what way?

A Jool transfer manuever node will use a certain amount of delta-V. You will always need to spend a bit more delta-V than displayed, however, because that maneuver node assumes an instantaneous burn, taking 100% advantage of the Oberth effect. Since real rockets cannot change velocity instantaneously, they cannot take 100% advantage of the Oberth effect, and will have to perform a correction maneuver to get them back on course.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-12T21:45:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2014 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GregA","CreatedById":126788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T21:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I were sitting on an asteroid falling towards periapsis, then right at periapsis I pushed myself of of the asteroid, would I pick up kinetic energy greater than my strength in pushing off the asteroid?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I am fundamentally misunderstanding this somehow.
