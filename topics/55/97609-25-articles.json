KSP is an ongoing thing at squad, it\u0027s not going anywhere.

It is, however, flexible when we discuss a videogame. But it\u0027s not going to shift majorly (e.g. no orbital mechanics for 1.0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealpha: usually very buggy, unfinished, Huge sections of content is missing. The project will spend most versions here. (we had tens of public versions of KSP, if not thousands of versions internally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeta: Major milestone, Feature complete. Everything on the roadmap for 1.0 has been completed but it is buggy and needs polish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erelease: Everything is quite shiny, bugs \u003Cstrong\u003Ealways\u003C/strong\u003E get through release. there are no perfect releases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok, so maybe not that close to how KSP has been developed. KSP has been developed iteratively, but still needs an overall project plan for it to work. You cannot have a plan that never ends in the business world. there must be some sort of long term goal for a project. Depending upon the company, that can be 1 year post release (I\u0027m looking at you, ubisoft, EA). Other companies take a much longer term view (hello squad, ccp, uh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned iterative development a moment ago. This is important. Unlike old development styles, not everything is done at the same time. you break everything into smaller chunks (e.g. a set of parts to build a rocket, space plane parts, contracts system, science system... and it goes on). Once you\u0027ve broken everything up, you assign everything a priority. Really important stuff (e.g. space) gets done first, things off the project plan get put to the back of the queue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve organised your big long list of work, you estimate how long each is going to take. You weigh up pros and cons of everything and decide what you can do within a sprint. You also decide what to do for each milestone. You try and make a stable release for each milestone with your headlining features included. However (and this is a big however) things don\u0027t always go to plan. Stuff gets dropped (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E)). stuff also gets added (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) things overrun, deadlines get missed. this is normal. \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou accommodate for human error and unforeseen circumstances in your plan by assigning more than the minimum time required\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd unlike traditional projects, KSP can overrun. it\u0027s got a longer plan than that. However, we still have an original plan and an original set of features that are required. It\u0027s pretty safe to say that once you have reached the goals of your initial scope of the project. the project is \u0022feature complete\u0022. it isn\u0027t, however, done. (this is the beta stage). you then spend a few milestones (can be one, no reason why not) fixing any remaining content. Some projects refuse to add functionality during this stage (feature freeze), some do not. That comes down to risk management (thats a story for another day). \u003Cstrong\u003EAt the end of this stage, if the people who wrote the original requirements are happy, the software is released.
