There\u0027d be a spaceflight history museum where you can view the flight logs of previous crafts, and learn about the Other Space Program\u0027s progress. You lose reputation if you begin failing against the Other Space Program.

The government would also become an agent for contracts, filling some of the roles of the Kerbin World First Record Keeping Society.

The A.I. would need to be complex so it can both succeed and fail. Problem is that if it\u0027s being calculated on your own computer you have to take account for extra parts being loaded while the A.I. is controlling it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T03:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ereally? no response? wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, The museum would also have to be implemented for this to work. it\u0027d be a room where you can place parts and over time people would come and spend money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
