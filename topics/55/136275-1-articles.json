I think both should be implemented to be able to \u0022reprogram\u0022 unmanned probes and satellites - also making probes unable to do this, to make real pilots a bit more special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T13:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I see it, currently there are no special perks for lvls 4 and 5 of any class, although at least engineers and scientists still get a rate boost to drilling/researching respectively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilots:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently we have the ability to oritent the ships axis to point in various directions, but there is nothing to control the rotation along that axis. It would be great if we could have our pilots automatically hold the ship level to the surface of the body of the current SOI... ie, something to keep the wings level on kerbin. I think it would be useful to have buttons to control the roll/bank of the ship... hold 0 (level), 90 (top facing to the right as viewed from behind), hold 180 (upside down), hold 270 (top facing to the left, as viewed from behind. This at least gets us something for lvl 4. It would also be nice to have a \u0022hold attitude\u0022 or \u0022hold AoA\u0022 function... call that a lvl 5 skill\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngineers:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction group editing in flight at lvl 4... this to me sound more like an engineers specialty than a pilot\u0027s specialty, but I\u0027d have it behave like you suggest (with EVAing and part clicking involved)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlvl 5... ummmm ... maybe something like KAS... the ability to attach two parts... maybe just docking ports... like say \u0022reenforce docking port connection\u0022 ... or reconnecting struts nodes... not placing new ones (although the \u0022nubs\u0022 seem ot disappear from 1 part after detachment) so you could have a docking connection reenforced by struts (with struts/their nubs/nodes placed in the VAB), and after undock and redock, you could send an engineer out to reconnect the struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists: When they changed the mobile lab, we lost an ability I liked, the boosted transmission. It seems it was planned that scientists would do this, but they don\u0027t: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Scientist\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Scientist\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose at lvl4, scientists are able to process data in the lab and do a boosted transmission \u0022the old way\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLvl 5... ummm... can\u0027t really think of a new ability... maybe something with allowing a scientist to analyze a surface sample, and give you an even more accurate ore overlay? Or just more science stat boosts: currently 21x speed vs 17x speed is only a 23% increase over the previous level (keeping in mind that lvl 1 is a 500% increase over the previous lvl)... so to fight these \u0022diminishing returns\u0022, a lvl 5 scientist would boost transmission by 100% instead of say 50% for lvl 4 when the option first becomes available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means that things that normally transmit at 50% (ie, temperature scan, atmospheric scans), would transmit at 100%, with no need to physically return the data to max out the science return (you would have to physically get the data to a science lab with a lvl 5 scientist though)... surface samples would transmit at 50% instead of 25%, Mat bays at 70% instead of 35%... etc\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviosuly the transmission value would be capped at 50%, so that a crew report for example doesn\u0027t transmit at 200% instead of 100% for double science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
