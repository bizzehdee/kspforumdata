This could be set up using the tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought. Probably no more memory need for this than already exists and it would not be procedural so to speak. Im not a coder any more so shout out if Its a miss. Now, if KSP was coded in Dataflex, Cobol, or Pascal then I would probably attempt it myself - To bad I gave up my legacy borland compiler suite 20 years ago lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albman","CreatedById":124616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T17:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think it should be inside the game.

But I think that the \u0022builders kit\u0022 approach is kinda limiting, I\u0027m thinking more about making custom parts for very custom designs, something like a part of fuselage that is a uniquely shaped fuel tank (I\u0027m thinking in a Airbus A400, or an airliner), so you would need to know very well what are you doing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother approach could be of procedural of almost every part, there is already procedural wings, and a lot of engines, but it would need something like procedural landing gear, and especially procedural fuselage in which you could adapt custom shaped fuel tanks. The \u0022simulation\u0022 part would be something like a FAR analysis, but more graphical (I don\u0027t know if this is even possible).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T17:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022awsumindyman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022awsumindyman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis would be considered as procedural parts.

Dev doesn\u0027t want procedural parts as a feature for the stock game for said reason, but if they give people a separate tool that, essentially, allow people to mod parts with a little less coding involve, it would just be like how people can always alt \u002B F12 for cheating. Those are tool available that are not intended for normal play, but that is up to player choice in how they want to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t think we would see such a thing anytime soon, considering that it would take away a lot of time from polishing the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albman","CreatedById":124616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T18:52:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found this tool that could be usefull: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/OpenVSP/OpenVSP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/OpenVSP/OpenVSP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
