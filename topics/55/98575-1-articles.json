Little Big Planet, and Mod Nation Racers are two great examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, KSP has some share available, but you have to manually copy craft files and stuff. Sometime soon, after 1.0 I would love to see the following features added to round KSP into a full Play, Create and Share game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Steam Workshop integration. This would allow people to easily share craft files and scenarios. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Scenarios! This would be a bigger feature, but being able to make our own scenarios with an editor would be awesome! Users would make new interesting challenges, and custom tutorials for people to play through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T19:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E should be in the \u003Cem\u003ESuggestions and Development Discussion\u003C/em\u003E forum, just to let you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T19:35:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in favor of a Scenario Builder, but by no means do I expect that to make it into release 1.0.
