The game should be seeing 2880x1800 as a valid resolution, because thats the native resolution of the display, and it apparently isn\u0027t. Why it doesn\u0027t is what I wonder. Potential flaw in how MacOS is reporting its display resolution to games? That games must \u0027support\u0027 retina may actually suggest that, in that the OS reports one resolution, while possessing another, and games must be coded to recognise this fact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-10T00:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2013 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dkonigs","CreatedById":94586,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T20:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the various \u0022hacks\u0022 to make an rMBP run its UI at full 2880x1800 resolution, you can make KSP also run at that resolution. The problem is that when you do, all the non-3D UI elements look microscopic. The whole idea of \u0022retina\u0022 is that you have a very high DPI display at a normal physical size. So you use the resolution normally for things that scale (e.g. 3D), and double/alter the size of any static assets/controls (e.g. everything else in the app). This makes the app look a lot sharper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effect of this is that any \u0022retina supporting\u0022 app looks absolutely fantastic, while every \u0022non-updated\u0022 app looks horrible, blocky, and upscaled.
