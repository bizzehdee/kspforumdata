I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s negative performance impacts, but I\u0027d assume there is in the long run if a part uses AnimationGroup without a linked resource module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo why not break that link? It will still operate exactly as now when there is a resource module present, if resource module is not operating the looping animation stops... but without resource module, it operates like AnimateGeneric, but much more powerful as it handles up to 3 distinct animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot saying get rid of AnimateGeneric, it is still very useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-12T14:55:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2016 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
