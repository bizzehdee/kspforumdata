The last two points are critical to the forum activity over the past few days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has come to light that old part models and textures will inevitably be phased out in the next update or two, and so many players have raised concerns over the parts. Quite frankly, I think the new parts and textures should be welcomed. We\u0027ve probably had a similar event when there was a transition between the plane parts a while back (v0.24?). I can understand the uproar about the phasing of parts, but sometimes it can get out of hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps, one could create a part pack that incorporates all the old parts (and textures) so that anyone could use them (although the recent EULA update may affect that).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I want to focus more on the possibility of texture addition and design for parts in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose that players are able to create their own color schemes in game (based off of the main few templates). However, I do understand that mods for this may already be in development. As I recall, there used to be a mod for KSP that allowed for the player to customize parts by simply changing their color (Kerbpaint, I think). That mod, however, has since gone \u0022extinct,\u0022 for lack of a better term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps that would be a bit difficult to implement into the game, but I\u0027d find it interesting to see the results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that was my proposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR: people are disappointed by the removal of old parts, and I propose an in-game texture creator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027m wondering how I\u0027d even be able to see what the other texture options look like for the parts, or even how I\u0027d add textures for the tanks currently. That\u0027s probably a question for Add-On Development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: the Fairing textures need a bit of improvement, although it\u0027s a neat start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-13T20:01:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2018 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Astrofox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-13T22:18:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI support the idea of stock KerbPaint \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old parts can (at present) be brought back with a little config editing or module manager patching.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I am however not disappointed by the fact the new MK1-2 pod is lighter than the old one, and has the hatch aligned in a way that is somewhat sensible.
