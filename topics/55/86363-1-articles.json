But I like this idea. I imagine I would be pretty simple to setup for the installing. just get the links for all the mods, make a list (possibly a master list on a server that removes the need to update the program when a new mod comes out) of all the mods and when a user clicks install, the program downloads the mod to temp data, extracts the mod than installs it. The MAIN issue I see with this though is that different mods have their install structure different. some have \u0027gamedata\u0027 with their mod inside that, some just have the mod, some have the name of their modding \u0027company\u0027 than another folder in that with their mod, so that would be something that would have to be sorted out. other than that, I like the idea and would love to see it made either by SQUAD or a member(s?) of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T20:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight its way easy.
