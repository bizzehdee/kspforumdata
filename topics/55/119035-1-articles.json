I don;t know why. They\u0027re just fun. I\u0027ve recently discovered that I\u0027m disliking the junkiness of the stock artstyle a bit more than usual.

Anyway, here\u0027s my list of parts that Porkjet should totally remake. Of course, it may not be practical for Porkjet to start on a project as massive as a stock revamp. And how practical it would be for Squad to hire him full-time for this.
