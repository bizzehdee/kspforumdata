My issue is that in later stages of the tech tree, the parts bins become extremely cluttered with parts from various tech tiers.The problem is compounded by adding all the wonderful parts packs and mods done by the community.\u00A0Its tedious to constantly scroll thru and pick the only couple I use at any given phase of the game. Some will never get used again. So my suggestion is a way to label parts as obsolete and have them removed from the VAB/SPH parts bins either by user action or via scripting in the parts config. I can envision right clicking on a part in the parts bin on the left part of the interface\u00A0and labeling the part as obsolete thereby removing from the display. Alternatively this could be done in the R\u0026amp;D building by labeling entire nodes or individual parts as obsolete in the same manner.\u00A0Obviously this would require an an additional \u0022unhide\u0022 button in the user interface. Second, scripting could be used to label parts obsolete. For example how many people still use the Mk1 capsule when they\u0027ve achieved large craft? If the American space history is a guide, when you get the larger capsules the Mk1 (and equivalent parts) would be heading off to the Kerbal Smithsonian. A way to do this could be if there is script to say basically IF this part available THEN label part X as obsolete (hide).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for your time and consideration!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T14:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could delete the obsolete parts from the game, and then go to your recycle bin and put back the parts, or reinstall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunder175","CreatedById":150041,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T14:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222474415\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459001754\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138353\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoloYolo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, HoloYolo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could delete the obsolete parts from the game, and then go to your recycle bin and put back the parts, or reinstall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was hoping for a much more elegant solution than manually delete or moving files via the operating system...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T14:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreate an \u0022Obsolete\u0022 display filter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T11:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222474436\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134980\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459002870\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022106805\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, nli2work said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreate an \u0022Obsolete\u0022 display filter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd leave that filter \u0027on\u0027 by default so obsolete parts get hidden.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA part file can have a reference to its replacement when an obsolete part is being replaced, so the description would read: \u0022Replaced by part XYZ\u0022 or, \u0022Replaces: Part XYZ\u0022 when you are looking at the replacement part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would also mean we need new sets of parts with spiffier specs in the future to replace the obsolete parts, while having the same form factor.

But if it\u0027s like the above I kinda like the idea... Sure I use some parts all the way through the game for some things, but there are also some parts I never use at all or only until I unlock xyz, after which it makes no sense for them, to be something I have to scroll past to get to the part I wanna pick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunder175","CreatedById":150041,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T13:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood discussion. A few of you posted things I didn\u0027t even consider. My original intent was not to delete parts, but rather label parts to be hidden in the VAB/SPH parts bins. I don\u0027t play stock anymore, and with all the parts packs out there the bins get really cluttered especially with mid-tier parts that probably won\u0027t be \u0027in production\u0027 any more at the later levels. In other words, I was thinking of a way for Squad to give us a way to hide parts without the need for additional mods or workarounds. I\u0027d never find the parts I need without QuickSearch most of the time, especially in the Misc bin. Hence the post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few of you mentioned part upgrade. That is a great idea and beyond the scope of my original post. I think that is something that mod creators would be able to take advantage of more than the stock game (where every part seems to have its place). For example, in RLA you get the upgraded probe cores (gold foil versions) which could be scripted to replace the older probe cores in your new builds. I do concede however this would be difficult to implement given the current architecture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, thanks for the replies and feedback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
