I\u0027ve tried these mods and I don\u0027t find them very satisfying. I like the \u003Cem\u003Eidea\u003C/em\u003E of some drama... But most of the time it just makes me frustrated. Especially with probes. Send a probe to Jool and odds are very high that the tank will blow a leak on the way there and the whole mission is a waste. Crewed missions aren\u0027t that big a deal. Pack an engineer, maybe some \u0022spare parts\u0022 type resource, and he can get out and fix the problem. (though, that\u0027s more a dull inconvenience than a fun game mechanic) Probes are just screwed and that\u0027s no fun. I think there\u0027s potential here... But I haven\u0027t seen a mod that tacked it very well yet. Best solution I can think of is that the game tracks how long it\u0027s been since you took control of a craft, and then weights malfunctions by time spent away. And scale it by distance from Kerbin. Not realistic, but more fun that way. I\u0027d prefer if malfunctions only happen on stations, bases, and satellites that have fulfilled their initial purpose. And this is probably easy for the game to figure if it realizes you haven\u0027t done anything with it in a while. Then malfunctions become repair/rescue missions rather than \u0022Wow that\u0027s annoying... okay all better\u0022 or \u0022Are you freaking kidding me?

YES. Even if it\u0027s just a strong wind that makes EVA awkward and landing ships a bit dicey. I\u0027m not sure how I feel about destructive events. I\u0027d be super liquided if a tornado swept through my base and randomly destroyed hours and hours of hard work. That\u0027s not fun. But if its simple environmental effects that\u0027s fun.
