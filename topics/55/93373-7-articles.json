I enjoy modelling and gaming, but in my life I have more opportunity to game than to model simply because it takes less commitment and rewards me faster, even if that reward is 99% gratuitous explosions. Barn-KSP is more convenient to do than NASA-lite-KSP, which makes it more accessible and more cheap thrills-y, but NASA-lite KSP is what the real fans really want to graduate to, myself included. Net-KSP is a confused mess with both ends criticising the middle for having too much of the wrong stuff, yet somehow still succeeds and keeps everybody interested enough to keep playing and define and refine their own experience.

I find the\u00A0extension of that meme all the way through the tech tree (which is what we\u0027ve got at the moment) tiresome. What starts out as being humorous and light hearted just gets tedious at the end of the tech tree. We\u0027ve progressed from basic, somewhat cobbled-together rockets to gigantic SLS sized parts, nuclear engines, near future aerospace parts and fully functional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E gear - those jokes about parts out of warranty and engineers cutting themselves on cutting edge parts start to get more than a bit lame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that said, there\u0027s no reason why the endgame can\u0027t be humorous and light hearted too - it\u0027s just that\u00A0the humour can (and, in my opinion, should)\u00A0be found somewhere other than the part descriptions.
