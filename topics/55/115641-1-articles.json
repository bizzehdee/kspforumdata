If you actually do the math, though, it turns out to be not quite true. In fact, the Dawn engine got way overbuffed over time and is now \u003Cem\u003Eabsurdly\u003C/em\u003E good. It is by far the best vacuum engine in the entire game, performance wise. It makes the LV-N look like a slow child that eats glue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why isn\u0027t everyone using it for everything? Because to be useful, you need TWR. And in order to actually equal a LV-N in TWR, you need a large number of engines, power production pieces, and tanks. The part count will negatively impact your framerate. Squad\u0027s balancing blunder is fortitiously countered by the limitations of the game engine here. Also, the recent changes in the solar power curve did a lot to curb the absurd potential of the Dawn. The majority of the game\u0027s content, in terms of celestial bodies to visit, lies further out from the sun than Kerbin, and solar output drops very rapidly now - much more than it did in older versions. Solar electric propulsion at Jool is so impractical, it\u0027s never worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if you had bigger engines, bigger tanks, and better non-solar power production? Suddenly all the things that keep the Dawn in check are removed, and you get a new class of electric propulsion that\u0027s genuinely, consistently stronger than all other stock choices by a significant margin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to explore how that feels, there\u0027s the aforementioned Near Future suite of mods. It offers high performance nuclear power production and powerful electric engines in all size classes. That\u0027s why it is recommended you play it with the Community Tech Tree, so there is actually a proper tech progression for these parts. They sure don\u0027t properly fit into the stock tree or in sandbox mode (but you can of course play that way, if you wantd to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor implementation into stock KSP, though? That would require a lot of core systems changes in order to accomodate vertical performance progression (and result in a lot of redundant parts in sandbox mode). The other alternative would be to nerf the Dawn to be in line with other endgame vacuum engines, and base bigger electric engines off of that. Which, yes, will result in engines that have quite a lot less thrust and a lot more power hunger than now. That extremely high Isp needs to be countered somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T11:07:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 11:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carmonben","CreatedById":149053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T04:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat if you had xenon rcs nodes ... just sayin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T14:49:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS system would need to be redone from the ground up.
