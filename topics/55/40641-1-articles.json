Especially annoying for the interplanetary courses. It doesn\u0027t help that the slightest misclick de-selects the node and so I need to zoom in to select it again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to add an extra, smallish window which shows the maneuver node close up (so i can easily re-select it and adjust the handles and it\u0027s position on the orbit), and have this window overlaid with the current view (which would show the big picture view of the whole maneuver and target)...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to discuss any other possible solutions, if you, like me, find the maneuvering node to be annoyingly fiddly to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sevant","CreatedById":97597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T01:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022innovine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022innovine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould it be possible to add an extra, smallish window which shows the maneuver node close up (so i can easily re-select it and adjust the handles and it\u0027s position on the orbit), and have this window overlaid with the current view (which would show the big picture view of the whole maneuver and target)...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just logged on to suggest this very thing. I would love such an option, even if it was just popped up a generic list of the maneuver icons on the side of the screen so you could click and drag the icons to adjust the node that way (i.e. instead of having to adjust the node only via the neat but cluttered spherical icon madness that we currently use, add the option to adjust it by sliding a set of the icons which could be individually listed along the edge of the screen). A new icon would have to be added for moving the node itself backwards and forwards along the flight path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInnovine\u0027s idea of having a zoomed in view of the actual maneuver node could be more useful (and you wouldn\u0027t have to memorize what each symbol does), but it would require a mini-camera window which is fully rotatable, and you\u0027d still have to deal with accidentally grabbing the wrong symbol or moving the node every time you slightly miss-click.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweeker","CreatedById":101796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T02:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love this, it would be great if a set of buttons (\u002B/-) popped up at the top of the screen for each axis, and being able to zoom in on an encounter.

Half the time you can\u0027t click one what you want because it overlaps something else, you can\u0027t read text because it displays overtop of other stuff, and depending on camera angle you can\u0027t always click some of the adjustment handles - and sometimes you click the wrong one and ruin the maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA huge overhaul is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dust","CreatedById":96482,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T19:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/a\u003E, which brings up a node editor window.
