Can someone add this to the game? So the KSP will award you with ribbons for performing sertan task or meeting certan requirements will unlock a ribbons for you. That will bring some sort of the goal into the game while carrier mode is still in development. And I beleve it can be implemented fairly easy. KSP modmakers anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T11:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eplanned i think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T18:51:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s planned in ways we don\u0027t fully understand just yet. They\u0027d hinted at a museum type of building that would display our achievements in some way...but there\u0027s also the in-game knowledgebase which acts as an encyclopedia for each planet or moon from the map screen. So we may well see our achievements doing various things throughout our career mode progression. Like, if we send probes to mun, we could discover its chemical composition or something like that...but if we send kerbals, we could probably find out a lot more, completely fill out the knowledgebase for that celestial body, provided we did a bunch of experiments and stuff there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, the ribbons are quite nice but I\u0027m not so sure they should be in the vanilla game or even unlocked via game tracking. Maybe for convenience. I guess it\u0027d be cool if I did things in the game and it uploaded ribbons to my profile or something...then I had the option to use my ribbon list as a signature. That\u0027d actually be really cool, but I have a tendency to start new saves whenever there\u0027s a new patch(especially a big one). So it\u0027d have to know when I do that. Or perhaps, just have an option to manually reset my profile ribbons. Hmm...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I got a bit rambly there. I\u0027m not sure whether someone could do this via a mod \u0027cause I\u0027m not so sure everyone fully understands how the in-game tracking works...and if they do, I\u0027m not sure if the in-game tracking is even completed just yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
