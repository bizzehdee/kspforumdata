Many request are made for mods being transefered into the base game. My suggestion is simply but powerfull ingame User Interface for managing mods from online source. This could hopefully stop those request to occure (may be not :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EThe basics of the interface should include:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BList of modes from an online source which you can filter by some categories or author and then by check button you subsribe to this mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BBasic version compliance - this is what i would realy appreciate as i like some mods but game update usualy results in old mod making the game unstable. the mods published on the list should have a base game version compatibility info. this could be as good that only after all your subscibed mods are compatible to lates available game version you can hit a button which will update the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002Bautomated download and integration of the mods (game restart posible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002BUI and rule set for publishing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I have read the developers plan a backend for the future multiplayer - this could be the online platform for the list itself and UI for the mods developers to publish their works according to the publishing rules.

Wonder if they could borrow dpkg and include a copy with KSP?
