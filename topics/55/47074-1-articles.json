Currently the parts with 2 configurations/modes only show 1 state, deployed or undeployed - for instance the landing legs always show up undeployed, and the ladders always show up deployed. Would it be possible to add a function which toggles between these shown states in the VAB? I have problems with relatively simple things here, like trying to tell if my landing legs will actually touch the ground based on where I\u0027ve placed them - if I want to know for sure, I have to set up supports, deploy the vehicle on the launchpad, test everything live, et cetera. If I could toggle the view in the VAB, I could just do it by eye in about 15 seconds using the floor texture clipping, or what have you. With the extendable ladders, despite being a small part on the ship with fairly minor functionality, they cover up a big strip of whatever I\u0027m working on underneath on the craft, and many times, when I\u0027m trying to move RCS thrusters or other small (but important) things, I pick up the ladder instead and get disrupted. Once I\u0027ve placed the ladder I don\u0027t need to see by eye how far down in goes, I already know it\u0027s okay. So, is this at all possible?
