With the biggest \u0027stone\u0027 or whatever carrying the main tribute as described above, a smaller \u0027stone\u0027 could then be placed for each tragedy listing the mission, the basic details, and names of those lost, it could even recognise\u00A0the \u0027sacrifices\u0027 made by the numerous animals used for test flights etc\u00A0too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could maybe be sited somewhere like Dres or Eeloo, so it\u0027s quite hard, but not \u0027nearly impossible\u0027 to get to. \u00A0To serve, as someone else suggested, as a \u0027place of pilgrimage\u0027 as well as a worthwhile achievement to get to in its own right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts anyone?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T13:25:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds like an easter egg I\u0027d actually want to take the time to visit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T13:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is one of the best easter egg ideas I have ever heard \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peteletroll","CreatedById":144573,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T15:07:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the idea.
