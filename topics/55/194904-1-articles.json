Sadly, I haven\u0027t had a chance to practice this wonderful sport anymore since.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t really done a terrible lot in the game yet. My playstyle is a very slow one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly three of my craft have left the Kerbin system yet, one SENTINEL satellite and two probes to the Eve system (not intended for landing), one of which is a scientific probe, the other one of which is a relay satellite. I have constructed an orbital station around Kerbin with a crew capacity of 38 Kerbals (in truth I docked two stations together after the bigger one could already support 22 Kerbonauts), I also have stations orbiting the Mun and Minmus. I launched orbital survey satellites to both moons which launched four lightweight surface probes each. I set up a surface outpost on the Mun which contains a deployable Science station. Recently I dabbled in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E by setting up a mining outpost conaining a small Convert-O-Tron and some small mining drills on the Mun. I sent some rovers to the Mun on a quadlauncher (just a rocket that conained four identical rovers in one fairing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuring my first few days ingame I stranded Jeb who was flung out on an elliptical orbit with an apoapsis higher than Minmus\u0027, but I decided against loading an old savegame as setting up a rescue mission (actually two rescue missions, because I forgot an adequate antenna on the first craft) provided a nice goal to work towards.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI use Kerbal alarm clock and I couldn\u0027t do without it. I try to always launch some mission and I try never to warp more than a few hours at a time.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love building and testing spaceplanes - although space is the one domain where I haven\u0027t gotten a plane yet. It is surprisingly easy to build amphibian crafts which are capable of not only landing in but taking off from water.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the next things that I will do is subjecting some Kerbals to a training program, so that they will gain some valuable experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
