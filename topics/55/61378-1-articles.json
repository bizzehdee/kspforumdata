It would be nice to be able to have multiple names assigned to a craft -- the class of rocket, the payload, the mission title. Think of it as Saturn I/V:CSM/LM:Columbia/Eagle:Apollo 11, or Titan II:Gemini:Gemini 3:Molly Brown. All of these are different names assigned to the same craft under different circumstances and contexts. Like a warship class, for example a carrier could be referred to as Yorktown class, CV-6, Enterprise, or Big E. All of which tell you specific things about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to be able to separate my ship classes from my mission names too.
