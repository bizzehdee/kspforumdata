Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my thoughts, this is very much a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153would something like this work in game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 as a foundation for a solution, rather than a final solution in itself, as there are undoubtedly many issues which I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t foreseen. Any \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153solution\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 must work for the game, and provide a feeling of being sensibly realistic enough and not result in too much \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153number crunching\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 so as avoid slowing the game down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL we use probes for long distance exploration because we humans are inherently \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153perishable\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and need all sorts of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153extra stuff\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to be sent with us as a result, probes therefore allows us to explore places where we couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t otherwise explore at all. In KSP the only real restriction in stock is mass, and a personal choice of whether or not you want to risk the life of a Kerbal due to piloting errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL we are also increasingly use RC drones for many civilian and military purposes (not without controversy) to save cost, and risk of life to an on board pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat advantage is there to using a pilot IRL? Primarily because we can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t (yet) replicate human senses and responses accurately enough in automated and/or RC systems. Good pilots are very aware of their situation and can react immediately if something changes, for example they will feel a gust of wind when landing and correct it instinctively (as the saying goes - a pilots backside is a very sensitive instrument), not something that is easy to replicate even in a dedicated \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153desktop pc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 flight simulator never mind the more abstract KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn on board pilot gives a greater degree of precision and flexibility than an automated or remote controlled probe can, especially when we are talking about astronomical distances and signal time delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can this be simulated in KSP? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I am not going to go into \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153specific numbers\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 as that is very much a game balance issue which would need trial and error to perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming that \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153signal time delay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 is not an option for stock I will ignore that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially probes need to not provide the same level of precision as an onboard pilot, higher tech probes would naturally have better performance than low tech ones, and only the best core on a vessel has an effect so you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t load up lots of cores and ignore the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible and/or options... (All could possibly have a limited random element to how much or how quickly they have an effect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make probe cores more \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153sluggish\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 or less responsive by limiting the maximum torque they can apply through SAS etc. how quickly the throttle adjusts, and how sharply RCS kicks in. More SAS modules than the core can handle will have no additional effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Introduce a short \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153time delay\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 before control inputs have an effect. Making precise control more difficult without mucking about with physics or fundamentally changing their ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Artificially inaccurate Navball (not sure about this one, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an idea). The Navball could be \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153programmed\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to not quite point in the right direction or respond quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The effect could possibly be linked to distance from KSC, but it is probably better for game play to have it constant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. A pilot in a pod or cockpit within a sensible distance (maybe 2.5km to tie in with render distance) can take control as if on the vessel, this would allow fine control for docking etc. once a close enough rendezvous was achieved.

A pilot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s own skill level would of course be applied when in control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - Make probes less accurate and/or responsive, thereby making a pilot a better option when precision is required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk a few ideas there, open for discussion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers, Pandaman\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T14:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at remotetech.

As it is you don\u0027t need a pilot at all for them, as a probe core is just as good, and nowhere near as heavy, so there is just no point other than RP to send a pilot. It\u0027s certainly not a game breaker, but it would just add a little extra depth to the game IMHO if it could be done without noticeably impacting game balance and performance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
