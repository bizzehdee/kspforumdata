That doesn\u0027t make too much sense and limits too much because I don\u0027t get a selection to choose from. The number of missions offered should be constantly like 5-15 missions independend from how many i can still accept, even if there is no more free slot at all because it might make me free one up to be able to accept an interesting one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
