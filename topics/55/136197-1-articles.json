But the UI and\u00A0font is too small to see. I tried to scale up the UI, but the maximum scale value is only 120%. I think it\u0027s good to increase the max scale to 200% for 4K resolution\u00A0corresponding to the UI size under\u00A01080p.

Scaling to 130 or 140% means the rep is not shown at all and any scaling above 150% removes the bar completely so you cannot see how much Funds / Rep / Science you have when at the K.S.C. \u00A0The Funds display in the V.A.B/S.P.H still work and the\u00A0Toolbar App display of Funds / Rep / Science in the flight scene\u00A0still works fine however. \u00A0I know it\u0027s not ideal\u00A0but you can at least read what\u0027s on the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:- \u00A0I also use Sarbian\u0027s great MakeItSmall mode to adjust the flight UI because 200% scaling makes it ridiculously big. \u00A0The best would be for Squad to make UI and text scaling separate options, but given what they have on their plate already I don\u0027t see that happening any time soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T15:02:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 03:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by A_Burnt_Rodent\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sceaga","CreatedById":141270,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T20:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123884-a_burnt_rodent/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022123884\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/123884-a_burnt_rodent/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@A_Burnt_Rodent\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for this, I will give this a try in the short term to see if I can make it work for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Argelle","CreatedById":95335,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-13T10:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks so much for the tip !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
