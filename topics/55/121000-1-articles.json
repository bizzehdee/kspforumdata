Potentially one could also have a \u0022fuel condenser\u0022 part that used copious amounts of electricity to extract liquid fuel from air gathered through intakes on Eve, to allow craft landed inland on Eve to also extract liquid fuel, although more slowly than craft landed in the ocean and with much steeper power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T09:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor xenon factory to be useful, in first place some uses are needed for large amount of xenon - larger engines and tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing electricity to extract fuel for jet engine is very roundabout.

That\u0027s the only planet I haven\u0027t visited, and that I won\u0027t, because I have little time, while it\u0027s a really uninteresting, black M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. It should definitely be made more useful. Intake air from eve? Not for ocean-less areas, but for diving from orbit! Even if you could extract pure fuel from eve\u0027s oceans, you would have a hard time returning it, and it would be more efficient to bring it from Kerbin. The mentioned jet? Wouldn\u0027t that be nearly as efficient as rocket motors? Suddenly I had a bold idea to make eve\u0027s oceans more remunerative: How about being able to extract a really efficient super-fuel from there, that\u0027s much better than the LFO mix, and wich can\u0027t be found at kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T17:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jwbrase\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jwbrase\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have two interesting ISRU ideas: One for Dres and one for Eve.\u003Cp\u003EThe Dres idea is fairly straightforward: Have a special ISRU resource that Xenon can be extracted from, available only on Dres.
