Use lots of decouplers, and you\u0027ll unlock other decouplers faster. Use more batteries to unlock solar panels faster, use more girders to unlock struts faster, use more inefficient rocket engines to unlock the Mainsail and 48-7S, or more efficient engines to unlock the LV-N and PB-ION. And of course using anything a lot will help unlock variants of that. Usage could include more than just mountng the items: applying thrust with engines and running fuel through them, getting energy from solar panels to replenish batteries (counts as photovoltaic panel AND battery usage), using up RCS fuel to translate ship, using struts/girders in formations that put high amounts of stress on them without breaking them, running up and down ladders, popping parachutes out-more points for re-using them, driving around on wheels, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see a bunch of starter parts added, with lousy values but cheap cost (lor later), and just to give you more options to play with when you haven\u0027t unlocked much yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T15:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally I guess this boils down to the fact that there is still a lot which could be added and tweaked by the devs \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to see a chart more like thereaverofdarkness suggested, something where each line of research is individual and they don\u0027t cross over like they do now, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be a spaceplane research flow, a command pod research chart, a liquid fuelled rocket research chart etc. instead of all jumbled together in sometimes illogical sequence\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T15:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou all want this mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53192-0-22-TreeLoader-Custom-Career-Tech-tree-Loader-1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53192-0-22-TreeLoader-Custom-Career-Tech-tree-Loader-1-0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s you make and load your own custom (or someone else\u0027s) techtree\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T15:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks!
