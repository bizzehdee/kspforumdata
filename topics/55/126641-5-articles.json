You can put 12 km/s dv into a ship and eyeball trajectories and avoid thinking math or physics. But you can not estimate duration of such trips. It may be anything from a year to ten years.

What\u0027s this \u0022realism\u0022, then, some token life support? How about all the material science - proper structural integrity, heat management when all electronic and mechanical parts only work well within some -50 to 85 degrees Celsius range, multibody physics that only allows to predict but not fully calculate distant trajectories, etc? This would probably make most players rage quit before they even got their first rocket into proper suborbital flight (as in, not just straight up and freefall).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI urge everyone to read this first: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://history.nasa.gov/conghand/contents.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://history.nasa.gov/conghand/contents.htm\u003C/a\u003E (and don\u0027t skip the early chapters, it\u0027s really eye-opening how little was known about, say, Mars atmosphere back then)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I don\u0027t really think more \u0022true realism\u0022 is what we want but rather something to spice up things for long time players. That \u0022fog of war\u0022 is interesting approach, especially in context of gathering science that\u0027s already in the game. Though obviosuly some of that is defeated by dV charts and transfer window mods - but then again how would one implement orbital tracking in the game? Building more base structures? Simply spending in-game time to \u0022discover\u0022 the planets and their correct orbits?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have some loose ideas of my own of course, including guidance systems, although some of that can be done already with mods. Problem is, this is usually non-trivial and not because it\u0027s a complicated subject but due to said mods being too simplistic, too buggy, not playing along with other mods, etc. On the other hand I understand one cannot make everybody happy and there has to be some limit as to what can be included in the base game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027d rather list things that are already in the game and that I find lacking:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Service bays are useless, it\u0027s easier to just slap everything onto the spacecraft itself and save mass. Please make the science stuff break very easily (at least during LKO insertion?) so that bays are simply necessary. I don\u0027t know, make them fall off super easily due to air drag or something? Also, add light into all bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The science tree makes no sense. Does anyone even use fuel cells when, by the time we get them, we have access to solar panels and big batteries?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- There is no mono engine that\u0027s stackble, and I would love to make proper mono-only Minmus/Ike ascent module. Two \u003Cspan\u003EO-10 \u0022Puff\u0022 engines work I guess but why not make a stackable one (that can be connected to a decoupler?)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E- Pods are too heavy. We get Mk1 pod faster and cheaper than the lander can, plus it can survive LKO reentry on it\u0027s own so it has some merit. Otherwise you always need a heat shield for those high-V entries so at that point lander can \u002B shield combo is superior (though more expensive). Mk1-2 pod is 4.12t and takes 3 kerbals. Mk2 Lander\u002BPPD-10 combo is 5.16t and takes 6 and you get more mono fuel. A bit less electric charge is easily offset by batteries which you\u0027ll add anyway. I\u0027ve yet find a destination where that 1t would be a deal breaker and I\u0027d revert back to using the pod instead.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Lights, seriously, we need to unlock how much of the tech tree to get a silly lamp? Plus why so bulky. Eh, I guess I could live with it if we had at least one small omni light for self-illumination early...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stayputnik. I used it once in the 100\u002B hrs I\u0027ve clocked in KSP. Either add SAS to it or just remove it entirely. It\u0027s even less usable than service bays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Make antennas stay locked in the open position (toggleable), even after data transfer. It\u0027s a minor issue, I know, but here we are talking about some serious LOS/range overhaul for the radio systems and the antennas retract by default...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User action groups should be enabled by default. Make a limit of 2 at first for example if it\u0027s necessary but it seriously makes zero sense to have to upgrade the VAB to level 3 to get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might think this wishlist has little to do with the topic of realism but I disagree. As I said we can\u0027t have proper realism, but we do have certain immersion, and nothing breaks that more for me than those pesky little problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T16:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI, for one, think life support is pretty crucial. The time limits it sets makes the game vastly more interesting to me. with Minmus 6.4X farther, I need to think in terms of 100 days life support, and if there was a problem (though I cannot imagine having difficulty landing on Minmus), a rescue would need to be en route very quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nREgarding fog of war (for lack of a better term), it would require a game mode that at the very least randomizes elements of the Kerbol system (for repeat play as an option). It could keep the same planets, though perhaps with as many extra planets, then mix them up, and do rescales a la Kopernicus. So you\u0027d elect to play this mode, and it gives you a seed (so you can try again, or share the seed), and you find your new career with the planets all scaled between 1x and maybe 6.4X, with distances scaled as well. Kerbin itself might never scale past 4X or so (6.4X is possible with stock parts, but sort of hard, 3.2X is hardly different at all with stock parts, however). You\u0027d then not be given much about the other worlds. Map view of worlds would be set such that the nearest zoom shows the planet as seen through a telescope on Kerbin (a circle of a color... Dun might show the poles, but there is no zooming in. Map zoom would be scaled to the nearest you\u0027ve been to it with a craft,plus a modifier for the type of camera (some cameras might be telescopes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent science instruments would give you the date they should, and provide useful data.
