For me, the subassemblies tend to be lifters, stages, rovers etc that i want to use across various savegames anyway. Currently, i regularly copy subassemblies from my \u0022Testing\u0022 sandbox game to a career mode savegame. Also, whenever i modify or update a subassembly in one savegame, i need to copy it to my other saves, etc. This could easyly be improved by optional global subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this could be realized as a a simple checkbox for each subassembly that marks that subassembly as \u0022global\u0022, and moves the subassembly from the local savegame folder to another folder that can be accessed from each savegame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T13:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a good suggestion, but I imagine the reason it isn\u0027t like this right now is because of the tech tree in Career Mode. FYI, you can manually copy the subassemblies yourself from save-to-save, they are located in a similar path as this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[PathToTheGame]\\Kerbal Space Program\\saves\\[YourSaveGame]\\Subassemblies\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T14:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Caelib\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Caelib\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a good suggestion, but I imagine the reason it isn\u0027t like this right now is because of the tech tree in Career Mode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont see why that would be a hinderance - the \u0022load craft\u0022 dialog has a \u0022invalid/unresearched part detection\u0022 check as well, same could be used for the subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, i know that its possible to do manual copies.
