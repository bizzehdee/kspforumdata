I\u0027m not sure if subaseembly does this but I\u0027m assuming it does not fully compile it.(or am I mistaken.) This combined with a full suite of basic mehcanicl parts like rods and levers and pullies and wiring even could allow you to build your own body sections and put the wiring/fuel intakes and make your own parts. This would allow a more full design capability in the game. I want to build a rotary engine for instance and use it. This could also use modes where you can take metal sheets and bend them with bending tools that are like fabricator parts(but dont leave out basic old fashioned hand tools, though those should be coverdy by full geometic tool making. Can you say hand crafted wooden plane model!!!). Round objects of different sizes(or allow you to simply increase the size/shape and other parameters) and make your own parts and compile them into single peices or large parts. With the right basic tool they could let the community do most of the work. Even put in P2P shareing and saving of parts to deal with the networking. then a large in game database could be make and people could put their stuff up to share if they wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could leave lots of options. Say you can select which parts become permanent and which don\u0027t in a compiled part. Then you can make a part where you can upgrade the wiring to better wireing and place it in the exace same spot or something. Certain aspects could predetermine what can and cant fit.(I would go with simple realistice means) then you could replace copper with gold or fit a bigger wire. Or maybe recompile the part if it lets you decompile it etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that would fit as an engineers suite adding more detail like more detailed electrical with circuit design and all other mechanicl/engineering based features and possibly for a more realistic game mode for more challange(maybe part of the difficulty settings. realism and uber realism). Maybe they could add more detailed tools and construction in later and enhnace the game. 8) Then they could later do a science/pilot suite. But I can\u0027t think of what those would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould an engineer suite and a potential craftsman suite be any different if you make the tool fabricating part generic or thorough enough? When I say bend metal I mean take basic meterial define the shapes and shape and then even make those items you can subasemble and later use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis adds to another idea. You could allow the easy way and let a person say they want a metal item of 4x4. Or you could add metaleargy work and make them pound it out! 8p Then people could make their own fabricating tools and equipment also. Maybe the engieer sweet is teh top layer and the craftsman the lower layer of metal and wood working. Then people could do all sorts of fun things with the game. Might not be that hard to implement either. Just do it in a way that give the user the tools to do all the work but leave them the tools to do anything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could get a whole ecology of user designes and fabricators making realistic items to put up for download and helping each other out! 8) I just hope not for real money though. That takes away the fun! But this would allow people to really have things like Jebedias engineering emporium or whatever. They could craft in game at very interesting levels and that could be as much of the game as flying. Heck you could build equipment to take into space to do stuff. I won\u0027t go into growing trees and gather metal!! 8D But then again, space exploration for rare or abundance of material is a real potential logically!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took this a little beyond my original idea for basic rods and levers but hey! 8) They could all be done later on! Heck one of those ideas could allow the making of the other without limits!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T20:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T20:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile not exactly what your suggesting- I could see the Dev\u0027s implementing a sort of \u0027Universal Science Tool\u0027 which you could modify with new parts/components for better resource management (less electricity, faster transmit times, increased science...). I think the biggest problem with what you\u0027re suggesting is simply the scale of new parts and animations required, there\u0027s a lot of back end work required- but it\u0027s a cool idea none the less!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T20:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is why I was thinking if they did it very basically with the tools just allowing full geomentry and let the player base build it up might help. If you making the toosl basic enough you can let people develop them so they do what they need. It\u0027s just making the tool so it can ultimately do anything anyone would want and that would be the limit of the tools use. then let the players get to work. Technically when making thorough tools the more work the programmer does the less the user can do. It tends to eliminate function focusing it on something that in the end removes stuff for the user. The only premade things that should be made would be examples put in using the tools for fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is also why I was thinking compilers could be designed and maybe even let the user do most of the work to tell it which way to do it(hint hint again) as to what a compiled part does. Though forcing limits based on resources could be good for playability in a game mode where it matters. Then the precompiled parts could be simplified down for computer resource means and a basic file could be kept like blueprints for use. The blueprints could be even dled seperately than the compiled items. Thought that sort of thing would be more useful with an in game economy in play. and then probably multiplayer for the ultimate use. But those are just options. That would probably be the groundwork for an MMO version of KSP! 8) not just general multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yea any idea on this is pretty much the same thing. Just who does what part of the work. I was thinking very basic(except where absolutely needed) and let the player base do all the fun stuff(hard work) over time to build it up. Save the programmers tons of work and puts more(preferably close to if not everything) into the players side which is the point of a game anyway. That would basically be as full of crafting system before putting in the full phsyics into the crafting proccess possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T20:37:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 08:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T00:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like mods, each one can try hard to become good moder.
