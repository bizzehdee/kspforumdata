Radiation would also be greater near Kerbol. Thus, Kerbals would be shielded more from radiation on, say, the surface of Laythe than on Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERTGs and nuclear rocket engines would also increase the amount of radiation that Kerbals experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain parts, such as structural panels, could reduce the quantity of radiation that Kerbals receive. Each cockpit could also reduce Kerbals\u0027 radiation doses by a certain amount. On EVA, however, Kerbals would receive high doses of radiation. (A few parts could also be created with the specific purpose of reducing radiation exposure.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter exceeding the maximum amount of radiation, a Kerbal could pop or become otherwise incapable of piloting the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation would cumulatively build up in Kerbals as missions passed, and thus, a Kerbal could not partake in too many missions. After a certain time, he would have to be grounded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiation could be measured by an additional scientific instrument, basically a glorified Geiger counter, for moderate amounts of scientific information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, is there a mod for this?

I looked up RTGs and they\u0027re pretty harmless. I still think that nuclear engines should increase radiation levels though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would agree that you should have different amounts of radiation on different parts of planets. For example, you would receive more radiation near the poles and, say, in some crater basins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is shaping up to be an interesting idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
