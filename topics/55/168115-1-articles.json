I suggest that all windows become clear so that it is easier to see inside.

For EVA I suggest that if you put a Kerbal on EVA it\u00A0will stay within 5 meters of of the craft and preform EVA Activites free of charge to EVA Propellant. The reasons I suggest this are that it would make the station seem\u00A0more alive and less dead. Finally I think that lights for habitable modules would be great.

When you do to a station that is on the dark sid elf a celestial body it looks abandoned no lights no nothing. Just a bunch of parts docked. When you go inside all the kerbals are in suits and locked down in seats like a mental asylum, it needs to be more alive. I dont care if you can IVA (although that would be great) I don\u0027t even want kerbals to leave their Part their in I just want them to float around and be kerbals (fly around without reason) Open calisters once in a while just be alive and not a mental asylum with no lights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
