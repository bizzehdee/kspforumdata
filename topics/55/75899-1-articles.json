My suggestion would require two features that would probably be major underatkings, but I don\u0027t know about game programming. First, a more robust Kerbal AI system. Second, a role system that extends into ground crew and mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourage can interact with a system whereby kerbals can actually refuse to do some things.

For example, a low courage, but low stupidity kerbal would make a great mission controller. High courage, medium stupidity would make great pilots\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium courage, low stupidity would make great scientists. Medium-medium would be payload specialists\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, these attributes could be malleable. More time spent doing things EVA or in high-G situations could raise courage. More science done could lower stupidity. On the other hand, staying idle for long periods of time could have an adverse effect on both stats. This would add a new element to the game other than launching things and time warping to maneuver nodes and SOI changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T04:07:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIm 100% squad will touch back on kerbal stats.

There really needs to be more stats in general to create more of a selection process with kerbals. There also needs to be a reason to hire each kerbal for a certain task/ mission.
