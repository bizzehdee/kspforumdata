I\u0027d like you to take a look at it and maybe see something you like to implement yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game \u0022Take on Mars\u0022 is all about probes and rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried the game, and I loved the way they scan, dig and examine the ground and rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, KSP is so much funnier as a game - I only look for a possibilty to improve one aspect of KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I miss in KSP is a deeper Science. My suggestion is that the devs hopefully limit the possibility to zoom close to planet until they have been visited. And all attributes and facts about the planet must be discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx: Zoom out your view until you can see the whole of the Kerbol System. THAT should be the only thing you see at the start of the career - and of course the possibility to a limited \u0022zoom out\u0022 on Kerbin until you ex have visited the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ground on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is not possible to zoom close until you have landed there... and you do not know the gravity or (on other bodies...) atmosphere until you have analyzed it. The effect is that you do not know how much delta V you need to get safely to the ground, or to get of it until a probe has been there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you visit ex Duna, you may find evidence of it\u0027s history, where the anomalies are, and so on by probing, analyzing and examine the ground. (I\u0027m thinking about the information screen in the solar system map - it can be bigger and more informative by science)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you manage to land Kerbals on the body before any probes - all secrets may be unlocked by them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case - instruments has to be unlocked by research in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you haven\u0027t tried the game I refer to - try searching for \u0022Let\u0027s play - gamename- \u0022 on youtube.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jcraft","CreatedById":42471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T16:58:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe not exactly in a way you described this, but \u0022doing sciency stuff on planets and then unlocking more stuff with it\u0022 is a planned feature of KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diche Bach","CreatedById":76097,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T17:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgree that science and discovery will hopefully be a major part of the final game, esp. in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"greengiant","CreatedById":71583,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T07:12:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed; it will be awesome if/when KBS gets a proper career mode with science expeditions etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
