If you\u0027d like to have a look at what the previous discussions have come to (it\u0027s not pretty, trust me), you can use the forum search to dig up those old threads. The devs are the ultimate authority on this, and they\u0027ve generally not really bothered to address it, though I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll sort something out in the fullness of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to rain on the parade, but this topic is a taboo for everyone\u0027s good, really.
