I like the old Mk3 cockpit aesthetically, so I would use a cubic octagonal strut to mount it in such a way that it lined up reasonably well with 2.5m parts. The problem is that the CoM of the cockpit is in line with the offset attachment node, so making it look quasi-realistic also made it unbalanced.
