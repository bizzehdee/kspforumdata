(Heat does need fixed.) Airplanes in lower atmosphere slow down for landing just fine. No problem with the drag, IMO.\n\u003E \n\u003E The problem in 1.02 is the *lift* is too high.

Next I changed liftMultiplier to 0.038 and flew that same airplane. It took off and landed at faster airspeeds, subjectively felt like more of hot rod, and was overall *more fun to fly.* I\u0027ll leave the number crunching to smarter heads, and only say that changing that one lift value while leaving the drag at 1.02\u0027s setting just plain *felt* right; it felt like how a little jet airplane is supposed to fly."},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T01:26:36Z","Content":"The planets are fine.\n\nPersonally I don\u0027t care about the aero, because the focus of my games are everywhere but Kerbin. But that doesn\u0027t mean that how others play the game is any less valid. Spaceplane and SSTO strategies have long been a part of space programs (in terms of goals, as none have yet to actually fly), and with the developers including contracts that require flying about the planet doing surveys, aircraft and glide-recoverable SSTOs have become an essential part of the game, and that in turn means that aerodynamics deserve serious attention.\n\nFerram\u0027s FAR works because he knows his stuff and has had at least a year and a half to fine tune it for KSP (it is currently 0.14.7 IIRC). Mu basically had 6 months to learn the basics and figure out how to implement that in KSP (along with heating and bug fixing), and like FAR, it will take many iterations of messing around before nuStock gets aero right as well (it\u0027s basically FAR 0.2.0 atm, so a ways to go yet).\n\nIMHO Squad could have avoided most of their aero issues (and the resultant growing pains that the community is going through right now) if they had simply contacted all the modders who worked with Ferram on FAR and worked something out so they could have hired Ferram as a consultant or something. Right now we get to go through what the early FAR adopters went through and it will take about 6-8 months before the community has caught up with them in terms of what \u0022normal\u0022 is."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:00:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ll also like to add that the current stock aero system requires special PartModules and handling for special parts such as fairings (top-mounted payload and interstages), cargo bays, boost protective covers etc, which is unfriendly to add-on authors.\n\nThe upcoming version of the FAR add-on uses voxel-based aero drag occlusion, and ferram has noted that his new system would automatically handle all possible fairing/cargo bay systems via inherent emergent behaviour.\n\nI suspect that SQUAD didn\u0027t simply adopt FAR due to both technical and non-technical considerations, which for certain reasons I am unable to elaborate."},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T02:51:46Z","Content":"With the caveat that I don\u0027t think aero is as gamebreaking as some do right now, here are some things that I find a bit strange when playing 1.0.2:\n\n1) Large, heavy craft can land at quite low speeds with rather small wings. \n\n2) (This one\u0027s going to be long). Jet engines have a bit of an odd curve with speed and altitude. Takeoff and low altitude is pretty OK in 1.0.2, and the sound barrier does actually have some \u0022barrier\u0022 to it, which is good. But as you gain a bit more speed and a bit more altitude, your acceleration skyrockets. You can easily build a craft that has trouble getting through mach 1, but a few seconds later is starting to overheat due to the speed at which it is flying. Then just a few seconds after that (and just a few thousand meters higher) your engines run out of thrust because they have exceeded their peak power output and because of what seems like two rather significant steps in air density that seem to happen at ~20,000m - 27000m. Put all of this together and it makes aircraft a bit weird to fly. Now, there may not actually be two significant steps in air density in that altitude range, but that\u0027s kinda the point.... whatever is going on, it just seems odd. \n\nThis impression might be exacerbated by the huge step in technology between the basic jet engines and the turbojets/rapiers. Basic jet engines seem pretty OK, but turbojets will easily push you to speeds that will cook your aircraft. Compare this with real jets, where the limiting factor for your engines is almost never that the aircraft is going to overheat... it\u0027s that the engines just can\u0027t push you any faster. The only aircraft with engines that even come close to the performance of KSP\u0027s turboramjets would be the SR71, and yeah, that thing got really hot and had to be made out of titanium because of it. But check out the engines on that thing! Each of the Pratt \u0026 Whitney J58 engines puts out 35,000 pounds of thrust, and are very specially designed around their bypasses and intakes for super high speed flight. The F100 engines on an an F15 each put out 14000 pounds of thrust at a TWR of about 7 to 1, and the F15 is itself known as an energy fighter (very high power). The General Electric CJ610 engine (used on, eg, a Lear Jet) puts out about 3000 pounds of thrust.\n\nSo if the basic jet engine matches the Lear Jet, and the turboramjet matches an SR71, there\u0027s a pretty huge gap in the middle that represents engines for the kinds of planes that many people want to build. \n\nNow, rapiers work a lot like the turboramjets, except that they have a little less thrust at lower speed, max out thrust at higher speed and have a higher max thrust than the turboramjets. I think rapiers are just about right for spaceplanes in terms of their high altitude, high speed performance. But they do still behave like the turboramjets when climbing: An aircraft that can barely push through mach 1 can easily be burning itself up just a few seconds after pushing through. Odd.\n\n3) Apparently re-entry heat is largely irrelevant, but I can\u0027t comment on this personally because I haven\u0027t played with rockets much yet in 1.0.2.\n\n4) Mach 1 represents a point of very high instability for rockets. 1.0 did this as well, but to a lesser degree which was, in my opinion, right on the money. Whether by design or luck, in 1.0 keeping your navball chevron inside the prograde ring would keep you from flipping. This meant that the interface lined up really nicely with what it meant to fly a craft through a stable launch. In 1.0.2 that\u0027s no longer true, and some rockets (not super crazy ones either) will flip even if the chevron seems, visually, to be right in the middle of the prograde ring.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T07:10:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 07:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran**"},{"CreatedByName":"BmB","CreatedById":42188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:08:50Z","Content":"You could re-enter anything safely in 1.0 using airbrakes.
