The thing is camera mode suitable for landing a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that it would work somewhat like chase camera, just looking from above the ship instead of below. Using it I would be sure that pressing W leans the ship away from the camera, S towards the camera, A to the left and D to the right. That would be extremely useful for hovering with the craft while looking for suitable place for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can be almost achieved with current chase camera - if I pull the camera over the top of the ship, it works exactly how it should - but chase camera has a limit there and I cannot go further than looking horizontally and for landing I also need to look below the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllowing the chase camera to rotate 90 more degrees might suffice, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbocracy","CreatedById":89641,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T20:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be kinda cool - but it would have to be a part you would add, right? The only thing I would worry about is that with all the smoke/exhaust/dust that would be below the craft as it landed it might obscure the view. Didn\u0027t the Apollo guys land via instruments? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking the camera thing further,one possibility would be to have rover views restricted to a camera that they carry. It would be like an IVA but from a rover point of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T20:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty sure you can move the chasing camera 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to have it at the front of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe chasing camera is really just to have the top of the ship at the top of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore camera mode is part of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E.
