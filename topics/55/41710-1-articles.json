In my .18-.20 world, I had well over 100 craft, and while I could have removed unnecessary ones, it still would be nice to have landers, rovers, and station parts in their own locations for easy launch and editing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of .21, I have trouble re-focusing on my craft one I switch my map camera focus on Kerbin. I think it would be great if there was greater clarification with the functions of single, double, and triple clicking, although I do like the new \u0022Set as target\u0022 and \u0022Switch to\u0022 options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf re-entry damage were to be implemented, there could be a damage percent or meter, but I\u0027m just throwing that out on a limb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know we all would love more part and kerbal animations. As a side note, the flag planting animation is really cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much Squad, I love this game and don\u0027t feel in a rush to make another update, the reset on .21 will give me plenty of things to do, and could not have come at a better time, I was running out of things to do in the Kerbin system.
