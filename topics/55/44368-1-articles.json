This could be separate and distinct from Sandbox mode, in that the simulator would only have the parts/technology available that your career has currently gotten up to.

Computer simulations where you punch in weather, gravity and atmospheric parameters or select from planetary presets for testing craft files and/or subassemblies(landers, rovers and so on), simple wind tunnels for aerodynamic testing or even just test courses somewhere around KSC, perhaps behind a rover/lander/payload assembly building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems a rather popular suggestion, one way or another and I\u0027d be down for it I suppose. Though maybe it should require a fair bit of science data to unlock it via the R\u0026amp;D mechanic. That is, if it\u0027s some advanced computer simulation type of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"innovine","CreatedById":76487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T12:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo program lunar lander was never really tested.. it\u0027s flight capabilities were tested in LEO but it\u0027s landing capability wasn\u0027t really tested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly dislike the idea of computer simulations. A wind tunnel would be good, as would some kind of bungie cord from the roof to \u0027simulate\u0027 low gravity, but I think it should be really primitive, rather than a high-fidelity sim. Just more fun isn\u0027t it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get a lot of playtime by lofting my re-entry, land and re-ascend vehicles up to 10km and parachute down, do rover activity and fly up and away again. Its cool to not really know for sure if it will work somewhere other than Kerbin, but still try to come up with a test program on Kerbin. Please don\u0027t remove that challenge by offering me a simulator. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, a good sim is more or less the same as just teleporting to your destination over and over and re-doing the landing until you get it right. If you are instead forced to launch, rendevous, refuel, navigate, arrive and begin a descent EVERY TIME, you sure as hell have a lot more riding on it, making the first time somewhere new very exciting indeed. I think sims would reduce that tension by far too much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T13:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStrictly speaking this is no longer necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust put it on the pad and send it on its way.
