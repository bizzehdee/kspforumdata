Basically contracts that dictate the order in which you should fill the system, maybe with deadline, instead of you doing it in whatever order/timeline you feel like.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd contracts to move the kerbal citizens from one station to another, since now you are guaranteed that kerbals will actually be present on stations instead of them all being empty.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this would make stations feel less \u0027forced\u0027.
