It claims to have longevity by forcing people to grind, this new \u0022bases\u0022 mod merely forces you to grind for longer so Squad can claim that there game is rich and fulfilling. Want to have bases? Try KerbinSide or RealisticEarth, both games give you 20\u002B launch sites and runways that you can buy rather than keeping the same launch site but just making you grind more to get a launch site that the game already gave you in previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETelling us we have bases is a lie, we have A base.
