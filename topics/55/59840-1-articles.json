Like the rocks and samples we\u0027ve collected from moons or planets. Even if it would just say, we\u0027ve collected so and so many kilograms it would ad a lot if you ask me. Then we could exhibit vessels that made it back from orbit or other planets. Imagine if we could look at some old vessels and write a text, like for flags. It would be interesting to read how our space programs have evolved. Maybe make a gallery where we can put screenshots we\u0027ve made on those missions. You could add a \u0022Camera-Function\u0022, basically just a FPS-View to make fotos. The first pictures would be black-and-white maybe, grainy, but as the technology-tree evolves, so does the cameras and the quality of fotos. And to motivate the player to put some stuff into the Museum it could generate money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T13:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T13:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a good idea to me, it would be fun to look back at the history of your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T13:41:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.geciasia.com/na/business_lighting/edison_award/merit/2010/images/image_mineral_museum_view_2_lg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image_mineral_museum_view_2_lg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my yes and all my rep for you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T13:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chellger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Chellger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe need some kind of \u0022Museum\u0022, where we can see our achievements.
