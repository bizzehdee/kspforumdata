As is, the game has a very steep learning curve, and this curve is getting steeper. The tech tree next update is a good step to reduce the initial amount of parts game presents, but added complexity that does not relate to parts continues to grow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to have difficulty levels, a beginner\u0027s mode (or sandbox mode, or experimentation mode, or something) and expert mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginner\u0027s mode will be much like the game is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpert mode should include several more interesting, challenging aspects of space flight that would scare beginning players off. Here is a partial list of ideas which when added, should go under the umbrella of hard mode:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - deadly reentry heat and corresponding heat shields\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - line of communication and time lag to control unmanned probes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - life support systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - only data viewable has to be from point of view of a kerbal, or from camera data that a kerbal has access to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - make reaction wheels no longer part of command pods, and make reaction wheels only work for the axis on which they are placed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheats should definitely be left in hard mode, even if they break the realism. No one has to use cheats if they want to. Maybe cheats should only be available in a \u0022planning mode\u0022. But a non-cheat mode would require disabled editing of config files, which would be hard to implement. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not quite sure how these difficulty levels should relate to career mode and the tech tree. Right now, I\u0027m leaning towards them being a separate category chosen at the initialization of a new campaign. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn sandbox, difficulty should obviously be malleable, since sandbox mode is supposed to be unlimited. Having options (as in \u0022leave reentry heat on but turn off life support\u0022) for sandbox mode would be good as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR difficult aspects of the game should be optional in order to help new players\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatfluffycat","CreatedById":73913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T20:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey said No to other game modes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T00:29:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the subject of reaction wheels I was under the impression that a single SAS module contained all 3 directions for reaction wheels not just the direction it was oriented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"running","CreatedById":82033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T11:21:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor hard mode: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not allow the removal of debris from the command centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not allow revert to launch or VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Auto save and no save/reload (so if you screw up, there is no undo.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T13:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022running\u0022 data-cite=\u0022running\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor hard mode: \u003Cp\u003E- Do not allow the removal of debris from the command centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do not allow revert to launch or VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Auto save and no save/reload (so if you screw up, there is no undo.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECounter points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Lag.
