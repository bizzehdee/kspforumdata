In real life, something like this would generally be considered an extended mission, which would be a separate contract.\n\nIs there anything preventing you from, once you realize you can perform an extended mission on Minmus, going back to KSC and accepting the \u0022explore Minmus\u0022 contract?"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:56:56Z","Content":"I\u0027m not absolutely certain, but I had discarded a few contracts when the flyby contract appeared without the explore, and if memory serves the explore contracts would usually show up right away if they were available at all. I don\u0027t know what all the tweaks made to contracts in 1.0 are, but it seems like the exploration contract just wasn\u0027t available yet. Perhaps the flyby is now a sort of prerequisite, but if that\u0027s the case it seems like it\u0027s punishing the efficient to not allow you to take them both on in one flight."},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:49:24Z","Content":"This is a flaw I\u0027ve seen in many computer games- where the player takes the initative, and does something themselves, the game does not recognise it, and later instructs the player to do the exact same thing.\n\nSquad walked straight into this one, with the way they\u0027ve used the contract system."},{"CreatedByName":"TothAval","CreatedById":142030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:44:18Z","Content":"could be handled by being able to manually request the specific contract on a certain celestial body via the infoscreen in map view or via an additional option in mission control. \n\ni also added this suggestion in the QoL list i am currently making"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:20:22Z","Content":"I agree with the OP - these contracts should be auto-active."}]}
