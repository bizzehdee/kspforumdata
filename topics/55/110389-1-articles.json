I only really wanted this ever since the start - I know this is already in a mod, but it is a bit unfair for some others who play stock, or do not know what mods even are. It just takes a small code change. \n\nAs much as possible, please consider this in a future update, Squad.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T17:44:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Columbia**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:55:17Z","Content":"Yes!!!
