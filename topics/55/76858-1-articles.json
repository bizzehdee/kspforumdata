Something like this: When your capsule splashes down, returning Jeb, Bill, and Bob from their first Mun landing, you click on Recover and it brings up a dialog asking if you want to recycle or preserve your capsule. If you choose to preserve it, it shows up at the Kerbal Air and Space Museum, where it is visible in a large hall with all of your other preserved capsules. You are presented with the opportunity to write a title and description for it, much like for a flag. What does everyone think? Good idea, or am I just overly nostalgic? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T03:12:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m generally in favor of things that make your space program \u003Cem\u003Eyour\u003C/em\u003E space program, keeping track of the history and the like.

Or would the game somehow store a local duplicate copy of the part assets (at the risk of bloating the filesystem)? What if a future update to the add-on changes the shape and geometry of the add-on part - would the museum piece retroactively take on the updated appearance?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T04:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not big on the idea of a Museum in the game. Mainly because it doesn\u0027t really add anything, and if one really wanted to do it it can be already done. Either by litterally going out and getting the capsule directly, or by designing a mock setup and putting it on display somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest issue with a recover to museum mechanic is technically if you \u0022recover it\u0022 its not the same part (obviously) and thus is more of a trophy of achievement, rather than an actual artifact. If you do it the hard and current way it IS the same part, and can be displayed ANYWHERE you wish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple fact there is already display models out in the world (one at the KSC and an old design at the abandon airfield) makes me feel the world is already a museum, so why add one?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T06:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I haven\u0027t seen the \u0022Museum\u0022 suggestion pop-up in a while.
