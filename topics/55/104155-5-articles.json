Well, here things go.\n\nI vote for keeping the Round8 the same. It\u0027s an incredibly useful and distinctive tank and changing it to xenon would minimize my uses for it. Xenon could be useful, but removing the LFO version of the donut altogether is, at least in my opinion, a poor decision. If making the Round8 an inline xenon tank is set in stone, I\u0027d like to see another variant with the original LFO stats and heck, why not make an RCS variant while we\u0027re there?\n\nAdding that many tanks could naturally be problematic, so maybe these variants could start paving the road to a new feature that allows us to select from a set of part variations while grabbing a part from the list (I\u0027ll try to come up with a more solid idea within a month or so). Even a system like Modular Fuel Tanks would be better than completely eliminating the LFO Round8.\n\nWhatever decisions are made in the future, I hope that we can at least hold onto the highly explosive donut/lifesaver for a little longer.

Before SQUAD introduced the gizmos, you had to \u0022cheat\u0022 to clip parts. However, the ROUND8 was one of the few parts that could stick \u0022inside\u0022 (half of it would be outside) other tanks by default. I always thought of that as being a feature of the ROUND8. Considering I did not use neither the \u0022cheat\u0022 nor the gizmos to make this lander, I say it does not use clipping. \n\nHowever, now that you\u0027ve mentioned, I checked again and have to say that the two bottom ROUND8s (the ones near the main engine) were clipped into each other. Even though I didn\u0027t use the gizmos or the cheaty thingy. (I guess the ROUND8 are just prone to clipping, but I like it).\n\nStill, I love this lander and for me is my best design. I can send you the files if you want.
