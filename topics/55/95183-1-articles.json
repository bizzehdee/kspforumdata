Nearly identical (but more functional) Clamp-o-tron docking port of the same size costs 280 and the TT-38k Radial Decoupler is only 600. BZ-52 should probably be repriced lower than the Clampotron, at around 150 or 200. Or the docking port costs should go up dramatically. Currently they\u0027re a better deal than stack separators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small hardpoint is similarly priced too high at 1275. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small version of the BZ-52 would be appreciated as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
