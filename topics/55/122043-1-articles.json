This becomes more noticeable, the higher up you go with both diameter and mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, in SpaceY Lifters and SpaceY Expanded, with 5m and 7.5m parts respectively, it\u0027s hard to stack anything over the thrust plates and probe cores, because they\u0027re so small compared to the mass of anything you\u0027d place above them. It results in very noodly rockets, more-so than with stock rocket diameters, presumably due to mass scaling with the cube of the size, but the joint stiffness NOT scaling at that scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf modders could tweak the stiffness on a part-by-part basis, that might allow us to make things more stock-balanced without constantly telling everyone to use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
