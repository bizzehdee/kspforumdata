It would make rescue missions / tourism missions a bit easier, or at least give you another option besides waiting to unlock the three kerbal pod, going with an automated vessel or kludging together a multi capsule ship. Maybe you could unlock it in the same tier of the tech tree that you get electricity in. So going downs one route through the tree gives you more crewed options, going down another starts you off on un-crewed tech, according to preference.\n\nIf nothing else I would dearly love to be able to launch a pilot and a scientist together for a bit of an early science boost. Or to level a pilot and an engineer together so that by the time I get to running missions where I care about things breaking far from home, I can - with a bit of planning ahead - have an engineer or two levelled up and ready to go."},{"CreatedByName":"BluetoothThePirate","CreatedById":75760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T03:53:41Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to see a two-kerbal pod in the 1.25m size.
