I\u0027ve been mulling over some ideas about what could make KSP something you could be proud to share with others. NASA does this in one of the most engaging ways, Visitor Centers. If you\u0027ve ever had a chance to get to one, they are awesome. Walking through the halls, you are filled with the grandest sense of accomplishment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Visitor Center - Another tiered building. There is both an interior and exterior component. Once multiplayer is added, this would give you a chance to highlight your greatest accomplishments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EInside\u003C/span\u003E - There are a number of things I think would give a sense of longevity to your personal space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWall of Kerbalnauts\u003C/strong\u003E - Portrait, rank, \u0027time in space\u0027.

Create a new \u0027science part\u0027 that if/when we get 1st person EVA that allows you to \u0027add a camera to the EVA suit.\u0027 This could be a one-off right click action that takes a screenshot specifically for the Visitor Center. This could be upgraded later to a video camera to create in-game gifs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EOutside\u003C/span\u003E - A number of places to erect statues and monuments that increases with the tier of the building.
