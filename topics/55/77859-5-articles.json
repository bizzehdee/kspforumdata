This means in programming terms: Out of say 10 variables, one of them is the failure variable, two are partial failure variables and three are slight damage variables. The rest are success variables. The game would randomly pick from one of them. The failure mode would be a complete loss of the stage, without any recovered funds, the partial failure mode would be about a 50% fund recovery alongside the existing distance from KSC variable, and the slight damage variable would be simply about an 85% fund recovery alongside the existing distance from KSC variable. The success variable would be full fund recovery minus the existing distance from KSC variable. This system could also be implemented for a random failure system - parts with a higher failure rate would have less variables in total and/or more failure/partial failure variables. Failures could be displayed via the in-game toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhew!

They are cheap \u0022trash bins full of boom\u0022 and have very little recovery value once empty, especially when compared to the cost of parachutes. By contrast, liquid fuelled stages are worth a great deal more than the fuel they contain and are well worth trying to recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf players want automatic recovery of their empty \u0022trash bins\u0022 I\u0027d say that the game already does it pretty well. The Space Shuttle SRBs were recovered after splash down, but as it turned out, the cost of recovering them wiped out any savings gained from re-using them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomatic recovery of liquid fuelled stages is a different matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a lot of experimenting prior to the 0.24 release to see whether recovery of spent stages was a viable approach. I tried attaching parachutes that activated on separation and focusing on the stage as it re-entered as uncontrolled debris. The trouble with this approach is that most engines and fuel tanks have very low crash tolerances compared to other parts. Even if the stage survived landing (on account of adding a huge number of parachutes), it usually fell over and smashed to pieces. Often, the only parts that survived were the parachutes! I did a lot of experimenting and eventually decided that this approach was unreliable and more trouble than it was worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlan B was to use a kerbal pilot or a probe core to make controlled landings. I found that landing by parachute was still unreliable. Adding the ability to control the stage meant that I could choose where I would land with reasonable accuracy, thus avoiding unsuitable terrain such as mountains, but most designs were still prone to falling over after landing. I eventually took to adding wings and landing gear to each stage so I could return it to the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach I ultimately adopted was to use partially re-useable designs that throw away loads of empty SRBs as a first stage and re-use all subsequent stages by returning them to the runway or refuelling them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that some players want automatic recovery so that they can carry on using asparagus pancakes without worrying about cost. With automatic recovery, an asparagus pancake would become an \u0022I win button\u0022. Simply launch an \u0022efficient\u0022 pancake, pay for the fuel, recover most of the cost of the launch vehicle. Profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutomatic recovery of liquid fuelled rockets is a ticket to playing the game on easy mode. With launch costs effectively eliminated, payloads of virtually unlimited size can be lifted to LKO.
