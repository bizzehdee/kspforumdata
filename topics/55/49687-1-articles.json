I personally think that the other way round would be more logical - sure, it makes sense to want reports from your astronauts as they fly over different parts of the planet, but to they have to get out of the ship every ten minutes to do so? They have windows after all, and surely better instruments on board. I\u0027d have thought an EVA report from Kerbin orbit would be mainly a test on suit function and effects on the Kerbal body, which would be the same regardless of whether the brave kerbonaut sees blue or green when he looks down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that EVA (when not landed on Kerbin) should maybe only be available after researching the \u0027Space Exploration\u0027 tech, but this could very well be planned anyway. Maybe Kerbals could eventually get an older-style spacesuit model until you unlock EVA-capable ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-20T16:59:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2013 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Photonically\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T18:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds good to me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
