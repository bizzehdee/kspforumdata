That is what I pursue, even if I also send unmanned probes everywhere. I have played two games. One before v1.0, and since everything was rendered useless by the v1.0 release, I\u0027ve then started from the beginning again with a new game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe state I reached in v0.xxx was that I had landed everywhere on Mun and Minmus, manned Duna surface missions were routine and I had landed probes on EVE and Laythe. Finally, I eventually also succeeded with a dress rehearsal for a manned mission to Laythe. An unmanned, but crew-capable rocket landed on Laythe and managed to return safely to Kermin. I never had time to repeat it with a crew, because next v1.0 arrived and managed to break everything I had built up to that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe state I have currently reached in my v1.0 game, is that though I\u0027ve made many landings on Mun and Minmus, there\u0027s still a couple of craters left. Manned Duna landings are routine, and I\u0027ve also done a manned landing on Ike (all return, of course). I\u0027ve landed a probe on EVE (non-return). Additionally, I\u0027ve made return probe missions from orbit of every planet in KSP system (and boy, was Moho and Eeloo difficult). Finally, I\u0027ve done the dress rehearsal for the big Laythe mission. It was horrendously more difficult than in v0.xxx, because of the new heat model, aerodynamics, split of fuel systems and lack of suitable tanks for nuclear engines. But in the end, after months of development and testing, I hacked together a rocket that could do it, - and did it -, unmanned. And as we are talking, Jebediah, Bill and Bob are on their way on their biggest adventure yet. The trip will take almost 9 years, and it\u0027s not certain that they will get into orbit position to make a landing (the dress rehearsal may have had a lot of luck with slingshots, as it got into orbit around Laythe; fuel is critical).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - So that is where I am. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENOT\u003C/span\u003E use mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will at some time.

While I agree that proper aero and heat are nice and satisfying, my point ignores how \u0027complete\u0027 the sandbox is. It\u0027s a peripheral consideration. You can have a complete game regardless of the depth of the simulation. And it will never be \u0027complete\u0027. We will, for instance, hopefully not have to spoonfeed our Kerbals or take them to the bathroom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the v1.0 gameplay is less complete. The gameplay is about achieving space exploration goals by designing and building space crafts from parts made available, and then fly them. You have a nuclear engine. You have no tanks. The gameplay does not hang together, and it\u0027s extremely hard to understand why not. To clone existing rocket tanks, paint them black and yellow for distinction, and edit the attributes, is less than an hour of work for one person.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-05T16:18:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2015 04:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vermil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vermil","CreatedById":122726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T16:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m confused.

I leave the design details of the game to the developers. My feedback (or complaint, if you will) concerns the lack of consistency and rationality. A holistic view. I feel the game has to make sense. How they achieve that is up to them. When I\u0027m \u0027forced\u0027 to deploy a spaceplane cockpit as rocket command pod - because of the huge weight savings - and then have to offset a monopropellant tank in an overhanging position, to stop the rocket from crabbing sideways and toppling over during landings, and build ingenious and highly complex swirls of ladders around, taking hours to align properly, in order to have crew being able to reach the ground and board again, then the gameplay rational fails.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I do not specifically ask for any specific part. I ask for the gameplay to make sense. But like a Mk 3 pod, that sort of thing was more in my mind than a rebalancing of the Mk 1 - 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou bring up a point that is worth consideration though. Rebalancing. Again, it\u0027s not something I\u0027ll meddle in, but if the developers feel they need to do anything like that, I suppose I have to accept it.
