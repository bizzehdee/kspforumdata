I can\u0027t argue with that. But from the weekly development logs, I have one key thing to say: stop marketing the game and just build it already. I know Squad is an advertisement company (and judging from its website KSP is the only reason it still exists) first and foremost but this development team needs to get with the program. I know C7 leaving was a major blow to development. And I know the circumstances surrounding that departure were probably a lot darker than was let on. Whatever beef is being ground up behind the scenes needs to get grilled and eaten. This is too good of a thing for you all to be stupid and waste it. Get some direction and get some transparency. You don\u0027t have to go open source, although that would make KSP even better than it ever could be otherwise, but you need to communicate with the community. Not these devblogs that are a chore and superficial in nature, although I do admit that they are far better than what was going on previously, but rather opening up the repositories and commit histories. Let us see the actual progress being made even if you think it\u0027ll just bore us. There are plenty of technically fluent people around here to translate them for the uneducated masses that now dominate the community. The only reason a majority of your paying customers don\u0027t regret their purchase is because of the mod community. I\u0027m glad I bought KSP back at 0.18.

Squad had been announcing the coming of the .19 update. If you followed the update information during the dev information they had announced three things to come in the update. They were rentry, rover wheels, and resources. In the final days before the release the devs announced that resources wouldn\u0027t make it. People not as informed kept on thinking resources were coming. On release many people were outraged at the lack of resource system hope remained high for the release of resources in the next update. The next update came and past people said the devs were driving the game into the ground. The anger in the community grew. Actually, I feel like I should mention that Squad did put out the disclaimer that anything could change. Anyway the issue blew up again shortly after the release of .21.

Although it would be nice to know what exactly they believe falls under that category, I think the biggest issue is that Squad doesn\u0027t really want to deal with the complaints of people wanting their specific features in the game. I suppose it\u0027s far easier to just not tell the community - people can\u0027t complain about features not being considered if they don\u0027t know if they are being considered or not (although, to be fair, they do it anyway. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) Then again, I can see such a list being very handy for modders - Extra EVA not even being considered for future updates? Better make a mod for it then. Although, again, seeing updates being planned for the future may discourage modders from adding features in the vein of \u0022It\u0027s going to be stock anyway, so why bother?\u0022 Or perhaps the exact opposite, I don\u0027t really know. It\u0027s all quite confusing, especially with Squad choosing to reveal certain features, namely multiplayer (I suspect that may have been a way of softening the blow of resources being shelved though). And I\u0027m still not sure how it would affect the marketing side of things. Do people like being randomly given features they weren\u0027t expecting? Or would they prefer to know a long time beforehand?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T04:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill want them resources \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, having a basic roadmap wouldn\u0027t be a terrible idea.
