It is an elegant solution to build \u0022Saturn-V\u0022 heavy lifters class. Other than esthetical, the huge pro is that using that kind of configuration drastically reduces the number of parts in the rocket. And then the game engine and your graphic card handles it more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow why space agencies don\u0027t use such launchers everyday ? Because they are insanely expensive, require heavy infrastructures and then are reserved to manned interplanetary exploration (or mining if you want) missions (which is a point of a space program). It could be the same in KSP. Those parts would be the very costly, and then you would use them only when necessary, like when you want to send a complex (ker)manned mission to Duna or Jool\u0027s moons, with rovers, surface lander, orbital module, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, think that more realistic aerodynamics, if implemented, will probably give a serious blow to those \u0022asparagus\u0022 designs.
