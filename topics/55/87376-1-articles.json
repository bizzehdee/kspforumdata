Here\u0027s what\u0027s been revealed so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Tired of trying to guess which key from WSADQE you should press to rotate some way or another? So are we. The gizmos are but one part of a massive Editor overhaul we are working on for 0.26, and they should make life a LOT easier. Really, there aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t many ways to overstate just how much of an improvement this should be. I think trying to guess part rotations during construction is the most frustrating part of the game at the moment, so finally being able to work on this\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Well it feels good! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m adding both a rotation and a translation gizmo here. Translating parts is going to be something of a new feature actually\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 More on that later, but construction is going to feel like a whole new game if things go as planned here.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022Another big thing I was able to do here, which isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t very visible but should make life much easier going forward, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve merged both the VAB and SPH into one single scene. How? Well, apart from scenery, craft orientation, designated launch site and camera behavior, there isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t anything else the SPH and VAB scenes have different from each other. In fact, about 90% of the scene logic is an exact copy on both of them, so instead of having two scenes with a lot of repeated components, there is now a single Editor scene, and the game moves into it by calling a method where you specify which Facility you want to head into. The options there being SPH or VAB, of course. The implications of such a feature are very far-reaching, but at the moment all we want from it is the added simplicity of working with a single Editor scene (the scenery is loaded on top from separate scenes). Also, this should make it very simple to add a switch to the editor UI to let you simply flick between Mirror (SPH-style) or Radial (VAB-style) symmetry modes. On the same build, on the same vessel.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96849-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-Onward-to-0-26-Edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHarvesteR\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds very good!

This mode also works on unattached parts, and you can also switch to it while attaching too.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERoot Mode: This mode is only available if you have an eligible set of parts selected. Activating root mode will allow you to select another part (from the children of the selected set) to attach by. It will reflow the hierarchy much like docking does, so the selected part becomes the new root of the hierarchy. This one is particularly useful for subassemblies and such.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe last few days were mostly devoted to ironing out issues with the new implementation, and improving the way the editor handles rotating parts and symmetry. It is now possible to switch between Radial and Mirror symmetry modes using the Y key (a UI button will follow shortly), both in the VAB and SPH. This is amazingly useful for building shuttles and hybrid type vessels.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97766-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-KSPumpkin-Edition?p=1494953\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1494953\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHarvesteR\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more details emerged in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99200-Devnote-Tuesdays-The-Building-Buildings-Edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis week\u0027s dev notes\u003C/a\u003E (paraphrased for brevity):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Some symmetry fixes.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Persistent crew assignment.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- More keyboard shortcuts (including ones for the new gizmos) that are rebindable.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Fixed Undo/Redo functionality.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Some reworking of how struts and fuel lines work internally (not clear to me how this will affect players).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E- Elimination of the category tabs, replaced by filters.

Angle-snapping is improved now: holding LeftShift (remappable) will engage extra precision, reducing the angle snap interval from the default 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. This also works with both gizmos. The offset gizmo snaps to a 0.2 unit sized grid, or 0.1 when holding shift.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI added a new edge-highlighting effect. ... this new edge-highlighting effect is now used to highlight valid root candidates when using the root tool, to highlight valid destination parts (in flight) when transferring crew members around, and also to highlight parts when you mouse over their staging icons, both in the editor and in flight.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe improved angle snap granularity is a bit of a letdown to me after using Editor Extensions for so long, let alone the high degree of precision that PartAngleDisplay permits (looks like those mods are not redundant just yet).

This would lead to less wobbly rockets but with the full ability to break up in the way they do now. Maybe keep two versions of a craft in memory and switch between? Might not save memory but would speed up the flight screen with large craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060d like robotic parts like hinges and rotators and motors. Would expand the game no end.
