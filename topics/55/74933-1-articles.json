Everything is fine, except it\u0027s...not fine. First problem. When you dock two ships, stages from both ships will mix together, so you need to recreate proper staging again, which is frustrating. Secondly when i finally finished recreating my staging, i quicksaved the game, because i had to move to the other ship for executing maneuver node. Then i had came back, only to see that my staging was not saved. It appears staging sequence won\u0027t save no matter what, wheter it\u0027s quicksave, moving from ship to ship, or just normal autosave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the first problem, maybe you could add UI with staging and separate substagings[eg. two docked vehicles with two separate substagings]. This way stagings from both vehicles would not interfere with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my english, i\u0027m not a native speaker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T15:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this can indeed be a nuisance and it would be nice if some intuitive solution could be found.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephm","CreatedById":112604,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T09:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompletely agree with you and is the same thing for action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking a vessel with a set of action group and everything it\u0027s mixed, is very annoying too....

But I\u0027d also always activate engines on a built-in-orbit craft with action groups, not staging, as that will avoid any hiccups.
