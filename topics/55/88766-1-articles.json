If a thing is \u0022heavy\u0022 it typically won\u0027t float, sea landings are only suited for small parts (such as a capsule). Even booster rockets will sink/damage while floating. The next generation rockets (ariane) did consider having reusable booster rockets, but those rockets wouldn\u0027t fall in sea - they would actually fly back home autonomously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for recovery cost based on mass: this would make things a bit silly, where cutting parts/leaving things around is cheaper than recovering them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T20:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paul23\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paul23\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for recovery cost based on mass: this would make things a bit silly, where cutting parts/leaving things around is cheaper than recovering them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think designing ships to have the expensive parts detachable could be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AviatorDSB","CreatedById":77941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T23:09:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOops.
