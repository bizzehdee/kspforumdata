I propose either a tooltip popup with the part name when your mouse hovers over a part in the VAB that\u0027s ON your craft, or highlighting the relevant button over in the parts bin panel on the left when you hover the mouse over the part on the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus you can better tell if the part on the ship is THIS solar panel pack, or THAT one.. or if you have THIS engine or THAT one, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy to claim that you should know what parts you put on the ship yourself, but if you save the game and come back to the design later, it could have been many days since you attached the part - plenty of time to forget.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T08:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the tooltip idea would be the most practical. Most easy to use and implement. But it should only be active, when you are not holding any part with your cursor. What data it should display i am not sure: Maybe just the name, maybe more... But the name of the part would definetely be helpful at times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
