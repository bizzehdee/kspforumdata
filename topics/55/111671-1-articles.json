However, in general, I would say that options are more important than balance in a sandbox game. As stated on another thread, I\u0027m quite happy with a game providing easy options and harder options for the player to choose from. \n\nFor the MPL - if players really want to timewarp their way to a completed tech tree then that\u0027s their choice."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T17:05:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I assure you it won\u0027t feel as OP as it is once we get a proper life support in the stock game.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t hold my breath on life support in stock if I were you."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:03:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t hold my breath on life support in stock if I were you.\n\nI have no idea if that was intentional or not but I found it quite funny."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:04:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have no idea if that was intentional or not but I found it quite funny.\n\nUnintentional puns are the best puns."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T02:14:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I wouldn\u0027t hold my breath on life support in stock if I were you.\n\nyeah I just wanted to say that was fantastic."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T05:46:59Z","Content":"I think this is an excellent example of \u0022Make science less grindy\u0022 vs \u0022You\u0027ve made science too un-grindy.\u0022 Automated things like this are notoriously difficult to balance, since time is pretty much meaningless in this game. Anything that happens automatically while \u0022on rails\u0022 will always be prone to OPness (in my opinion).\n\nI wish I knew how best to modify the existing system so that it makes sense and integrates into a holistic career/science mode game. As I posted in another thread, there is no overarching context for this game. It is more of a sandbox rocket game, with some stuff to do overlaid on top. I think this driving sandbox feel will always overAshadow the science system, and attempts to make it less grindy (without a holistic change) will probably always feel cheaty, or not good enough. Turn down the science production in the lab, then you just have to warp longer to get the same amount of return...\n\nJust my rambling thoughts.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T08:17:08Z","Content":"The (perceived) grindyness in this case stems from a) micromanagment ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) the sit-and-wait while data is being transmitted, c) you have to do a lot of clicky-clicky in little real time.\n\nIf you care about calendar time, the lab isn\u0027t unreasonable: between unlocking the lab and the first Duna window, one lab can create 1000-1500 science points. Compares well to a munar survey.\n\nIf you don\u0027t care about time, it is sort of an \u0022I win\u0022 button, but one that has to be pressed many many times. Though \u0022proceed to sandbox\u0022 would be a better name, IMO. Either way, once you accept this mindset, it\u0027s totally reasonable to expect it to work with a single click.\n\nAnd even if you don\u0027t treat it as an insta-win button, it is hard to handle because of the exponential conversion rate, making it difficult to perform calculations off the top of your head (is that even english?). I have surface data from the Mun coming in chunks of 165 points. When will I have the capacity to process that data? Better to sit and watch... and watch... which involves managing timewarp and seeing the lab operate below capacity for quite some time. That is something I\u0027d call negative gameplay exerience.\n\nAll of these issues are, at their core, psychological. Some could be dealt with (larger IO buffers and a more predictable conversion rate would reduce the \u0022need\u0022 for babysitting, for example), others can not.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T08:20:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"}]}
