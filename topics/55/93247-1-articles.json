Something larger, or smoother (though that may not thematically fit) would sure make it easier for me..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The launch seems really bare on ceremony. What if pressing space bar gave you a 3... 2... 1... countdown with a music swell?

This game is senselessly addictive. Another great source if you get stuck (or just want to see mind boggling cool stuff) is to watch some Scott Manley videos on youtube.
