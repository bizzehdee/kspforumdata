The experiments that require kerbals should be much more valuable and have a significant transmit penalty. After all, it would be much harder to transmit a 100 page experimental report than a single number, however a human (or in this case kerbal) is capable of performing much more sophisticated experiments than a machine. The way I see it, surface samples should offer the most valuable, with EVA reports being less valuable and then the simple equipment offering fairly meager research value. I would like to see the Science Jr. and Goo Container offering more science if a kerbal is present to observe the results and/or if the data is returned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be good to have long term experiments as well, for example recording the temperature throughout an entire day or year, or measuring the gravity data across the course of a highly eccentric orbit. The problem is that these suggestions would require a large amount of re-balancing and so are unlikely to be implemented at any point.

The thing that\u0027s always bugged me about the science system is the disconnect between gameplay and what you\u0027d expect. It simply requires too much suspension of disbelief to think that an experiment you conduct in high orbit will be preserved after re-entry and recovery. Each experiment needs a hierarchy of how much science can be gained from it. For example: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Observing mystery goo in high orbit yields the most science if analyzed in a lab module in orbit. Moderate science if the results are transmitted. However, if you leave orbit and/or apply an acceleration impulse to the ship, you\u0027ve destroyed the experiment and it automatically resets, so you cannot return the experiment to kerbin for science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A soil sample gathered from another world yields the most science if returned to kerbin for analysis. Analyzing in a lab module would yield moderate science (like 75%). Transmitting observations about the soil yields some science but not very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A crew report is worth the most if you transmit it, because the report is still fresh in everyone\u0027s mind, but recovering in a lab or at the space center may not necessarily return more science, because why should a report be recovered physically when it is just the subjective views of those on the mission?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EDIT: The thermometer experiment would be worth the most on transmission, but nothing to a lab because you can\u0027t get anything out of it.

Perhaps there\u0027s a limited window in which you can analyze it (I.e. the experiment can only be done when there is no direct sunlight - taking a dark side radiation measurement for example), and if you transmit to recover science before going to a lab and the lab would produce more science then taking it to a lab would recover the difference, since it would likely turn up things that basic observation couldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf stuff like this was implemented, science in my opinion would become much less of a grind, and more like a unique problem to solve for every varied case.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T15:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T15:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022geb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022geb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The temperature data from the Moho probe is in.
