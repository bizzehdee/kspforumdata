Personally, I think payload (including Kerbal payload) deployment is the most important - after all, isn\u0027t that what most real life space programs do? We don\u0027t really need a special part though, it could just be \u0022launch communications satellite with 2 antennas and a power supply\u0022, etc\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T17:41:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t payload the same as science in the end? You strap a mostly useless part to your ship and carry it over to a destination. Ok you can make contracts that require you to launch something like 50 t but I would rather like to have a rly heavy part that has an actual use. The lab is currently the heaviest part. I would like to see a contract that wants me to ship a lab to jool for example. Personally I would prefer that over pure payload but i agree a cargo contract would ad a challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like the rover and ssto ideas. Especially driving a rover to a place with srsly tough terrain could be fun. This would prevent me from just landing there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a contract that wants you to take a sample from a place that is like 2 km away from your lander? \u0022To ensure the surface sample was not affected by the engines\u0022 or something. Would be nice to have a reason to spent some time on a planet and take a rover with you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bandi94","CreatedById":33424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-25T22:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of them are already made.
