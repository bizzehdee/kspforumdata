did give the ion engines much more thrust than real ion engines.\u00A0 But the resulting situation does tend to leave players waiting for an ion burn to complete and that\u00A0makes the game less fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I were a game designer I would be tempted to depart further from reality with the ion-engines\u0027 thrust, but return somewhat to reality with conservation of energy from \u0027electric charge\u0027, so that solar panels cannot support the higher thrust, and battery capacity becomes the limit rather than\u00A0player patience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see you are asking for the 1-body simulation, of a\u00A0rigid craft under constant thrust plus gravity, to be done in time warp.\u00A0 This would\u00A0be much less work for the CPU\u00A0than simulating the multiple interacting parts, which is done only up to 4\u00D7 speed.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hoped for a moment that there might be closed form solutions to that 1-body problem, but a look at the course-notes for MIT 16-522 quickly dashed those hopes.\u00A0 Squad would need to integrate the equations of motion, maybe with a simplified-physics time-warp that can go faster than 4\u00D7, unless someone has a better idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-02T20:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

What allows up to 100x timewarp depends on how parts are strutted so use hyperedit to test various autostrut option, that often works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-06T07:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need an on-rails timewarp propulsion method.
