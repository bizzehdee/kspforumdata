This way if you launch two or more copies of the same craft you\u0027ll be able to tell them apart visually by the serial number printed on the side. Taking the feature a bit farther in the place where normal decals would have a menu in the VAB for selecting the image, the serial number decal could let you choose the color of the text and choose an optional letter postfix (A-Z). This way if you have a craft with two pieces, like an Apollo mission, you can put decals on both parts and add the letter postfix to tell them apart. So on the Apollo mission the orbiter is 012A and the lander is 012B. If I launch another Apollo craft it automatically gets the decals 013A and 013B.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T11:48:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0060d like \u0060KSA\u0060 or \u0060KASA\u0060 to go by the camera during launch and if it was amended to have \u0060A01-A17\u0060 then I would be all the happier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
