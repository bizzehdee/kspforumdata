With the first part of an open-ended Career Mode implemented, KSP will have -gasp- an \u003Cem\u003Eend game\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn end game is a powerful thing that can make or break your game as a whole. It\u0027s something to shoot for. It\u0027s also something to fear. It\u0027s what makes people grind through 85 levels of repetitive WoW quests only to arrive at the summit of their powers, blinking in the cold harsh light and thinking... OK, now what? The game is not over - there\u0027s no final cinematic, no rolling credits, only the vast expanse of well-traveled land behind you and the knowledge that you\u0027re going to have to find something else to do with all that stuff you worked so hard for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.22, end game content will consist of basically anywhere you haven\u0027t been yet and every experiment you haven\u0027t run yet. I\u0027m really impressed by the granularity of \u0022scientific regions\u0022 I\u0027ve seen so far. Flybys, high orbits, low orbits, sub-orbital trajectories and surface landings - as well as the depth of interplanetary space - are all defined, as are biomes on Kerbin and the Mun. With nine different scientific experiments to run (crew report, EVA report, goo container, materials bay, thermometer, barometer, accelerometer, gravioli detector and atmosphere analyzer) that translates into a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of science you can do. Conducting every experiment in every region is going to keep players occupied for a while. The experience will, however, ring a little hollow because there doesn\u0027t seem to be a tangible record of these experiments yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a couple of ideas on making something more out of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1 \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEncyclopedia\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Knowledge Base entries\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA fairly simple idea - include the scientific reports in the celestial body\u0027s \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eencyclopedia\u003C/span\u003E Knowledge Base window. Being able to see your collected body of knowledge grow over time and being able to read back the superb feedback from your crew and instruments should really help in giving players a sense of accomplishment, even when the tech tree is all filled up and excess science is piling up without purpose. Plus it means those neatly written reports don\u0027t go to waste!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2 Scientific programs\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore involved: have specific sets of experiments unlock a new level of understanding of the body in question. Show what research is still needed to unlock the next tier and you\u0027ve got a gameplay driver right there. For example, the fairly simple \u0022Conditions Near the Mun\u0022 program might require a Goo Analysis, Materials Analysis and Instrument Readings (thermometer etc.) from both high and low Munar orbit. Completing all these experiments gives you a text blurb about what you\u0027ve learned about the conditions in the Mun\u0027s SOI. Done! It\u0027s essentially another tech tree but the only rewards are text-based scientific understandings. A program could have various tiers of completion and you could even nest various programs into larger, over-arching programs. For example, completing the \u0022Conditions Near the Mun\u0022, \u0022Conditions Near Minmus\u0022 and \u0022Conditions in Kerbin Orbit\u0022 programs would fulfill the \u0022Conditions in the Kerbin System\u0022 blurb. This idea would lend itself well to modding and (monetary?) rewards could be attached once Career Mode is more fleshed out. It would take a lot of writing but, from what I\u0027ve seen so far of the science system (which already tracks experiments in a great level of detail) not an awful lot of coding. And I, for one, would love to undertake a decades-long program to uncover all the secrets of the Kerbal solar system \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T19:25:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Wayfare\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DevoidLight","CreatedById":60164,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T17:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the first idea of compiling all your collected data into an encyclopedia type thing.
