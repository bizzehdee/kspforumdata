I\u0027d love to see the atmosphere composition from an atmosphere analasys, or the same from a ground sample. I\u0027d love more info than just \u0022sand\u0022 or \u0022dirt\u0022. I sampled the ocean on eve and was dismayed not to find what it was made of, it would be really fantastic. I\u0027d also love to see more info on crew reports, maybe their thoughts on the matter. I\u0027d also like for things liky mystery goo, the materials bay, and crew reports to be different over amounts of time, maybe a probe with a mystery goo container that was left to orbit for a decade or so may have different results due to long term exposure, this way long term installations would be more desireable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see a sr materials bay that has more \u0022science stuff\u0022 to do, but also would be the same width as the mobile processing lab. It would look a bit better for rocket designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like a sample container/arm, something the size of the mystery goo container, with four or five \u0022spots\u0022 that would allow you to place it on a rover, drive somewhere, take a sample, continue on, then return back to your landing vehicle, launch back and bring the samples home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-20T19:33:42Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2014 07:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by XOIIO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
