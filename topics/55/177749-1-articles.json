Basically, when the aircraft\u0027s engine is turned off, it can be self propelled to allow the aircraft to be steered/ parked/ repositioned like rover. When the engine is turned on, the landing gears would act like stock landing gear, steering only (without self propelling capability) for a minor correction adjustment in takeoff. It would make make navigating\u00A0aircraft on the ground far easier and simple (The ability to automatically switch the self-propelling capability based on engine activation trigger only applies on retractable landing gears)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-22T02:32:43Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2018 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ARS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-22T03:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of optional (editor installable?

Can\u0027t imagine a plane the size of a Cessna (let alone bigger ones) moving up a hill using only the self-propelled landing gear. So if that would be made a thing in the game the self-propelled landing gear should be extremely bulky due to its powerful motorization. On top of that,\u00A0any plane with proper design would have its main landing gear close to the CG, which means\u00A0tail draggers could tip over when the brakes are applied while going downhill and\u00A0planes with tricycle gear could slam on their tail when going uphill. And any custom landing gear placement designed for roving would lead to take-offs becoming pretty damn hard. That\u0027s why it\u0027s been so hard to build cars that transform into planes and vice versa, a car has to have its CG between the 2 axles and a plane needs to have its main gear very close to the CG so it can get its tail or nose off the ground during take-off, and why my example craft looks the way it does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-24T12:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t it true that there aren\u0027t such landing gear in real life, mainly because one would require a electric motor in the landing gear which will overheat long before the brake discs turn red when braking?\u003Cbr\u003E\nEver seen the brake disc of a aircraft that just landed? Good luck keeping a direct drive motor cool enough next to it. Any cooling solution is overly heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is a indirect drive it will become unnecessarily heavy and complex especially since landing gear needs to extend and retract. Cool kid that can think of a mechanism involved to make it work. Weight and complexity will be added just to make it work which goes against aero/astronautical logic.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWeight and complexity is bad for aircrafts and rockets alike you know?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile it still would be possible (I guess) using heavy batteries for on surface taxiing on a air worthy craft like a plane goes against most economic concepts since it\u0027s far more economical to have the fuel onboard in exchange for the heaviness of any such batteries or motors just for the purpose of on ground taxiing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat fact holds true for aircraft, it would be worse for rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for KSP, battery weights and units of electricity converted to power really don\u0027t make sense in this game. As long as electricity in this game makes NO SENSE whatsoever nothing else should be electricity driven imo.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf a concept by itself can\u0027t be explained or partially conceptualized to even work or be logical in a game, much less in real life then I think such a idea should be ignored.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I haven\u0027t had a single issue to create self roving aircraft before. Assuming you don\u0027t want to go faster then 20 m/s in all directions and over all terrain (and you don\u0027t need to go faster, thus...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m of the mentality by the way to optimize my craft so that they can land where you intend to land, at worst you would require a couple dozen Delta-Vee fuel to reposition your craft from where it landed to where you wanted it to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf self propelled landing gear were to be introduced then the hardware required to motor the landing gear and store that electricity over the full course of a space mission is not going to save the few dozen amounts of Delta V saved with self propelled landing gear regardless for what destination you need it at (and you don\u0027t need it, which is the biggest point of them all)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to make a U-turn, well, you can. If you build your craft with one condition you \u003Cu\u003Ealways\u003C/u\u003E can. That condition is having 2 outboard engines instead of a single one or cluster of several in the center. I make my spaceplanes that way, in that they usually have at least 2 engines (rapiers or nervas) on the larboard and starboard end. For a proper U-turn to succeed I activate the brakes, if necessary I right click my landing gear and play with the friction as much as required which you can do in flight (which is absolutely ridiculous by the way but cool nonetheless) Then I use any of both engines (which depending on where I want to turn) and fire it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe friction on the wheels should be set so that the engine firing rotates the craft but still having enough friction to stay in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft should turn sharply in any direction you want its nose pointed at. You can do this at the cliff of a crater even if the front gear already plummeted over the edge. Ironically self propelled landing gear would get stuck in this position as they shouldn\u0027t be able to deliver the force to get out of said stuck position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn most worlds a small amount of velocity keeps you rolling for somewhat of a while.\u003Cbr\u003E\nDone right you probably need 2, maybe 3 dozen, perhaps 50 m/s of delta V if your clumsy to U turn your craft and roll another 1-200meters to where you want to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I don\u0027t know about you, maybe there\u0027s some hardcore mentality to keep yourself from quickloading and quicksaving, O heck, I just said it, why don\u0027t you?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m sure if you miss your landing zone by several hundred meters you can reload and try again, right?\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally I explain this behaviour away by argumenting that Kerbal kind has similar autopilots, computers and automative maneuvering functions we humans use to plant our vessels on the ground with sub 1meter precision.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause we lack this in KSP and we have to do everything by hand I use that fact to argument myself to reload everything as long as the piloting wasn\u0027t executed perfectly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWith modern programming a vessel should be able to land at X marks the spot.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTherefore a air or space worthy craft would NEVER, I repeat NEVER require any form of surface powered motorization because there would be no need for it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnly if you desire to drive around then you would, but then you don\u0027t require to haul the air/spacecraft around anyway, so what do we do?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe invent cargo bays and roll out a dedicated roving craft to enable this function for us, in a cooler fashion, at a greater speed with roll cage safety.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
