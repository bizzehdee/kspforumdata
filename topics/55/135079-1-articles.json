I only noticed it flickers, not that it was going from \u0022green\u0022 to yellow. Being color blind, bright green on computer games looks like a slightly dulled yellow. can only tell which color it is when it is next to a fixed color of yellow or bright green. Maybe use red or better yet blue for one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T22:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRed is actually already used - for physics warps where the game time flows faster than real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou probably just want to grab some physics time/fps indicator and shows the actual number. I remember it\u0027s one of the KerbalKatz utilities. I\u0027m also using it to know how exactly slow it becomes, even if I\u0027m not color blinded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-28T10:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not colour blind myself, but I think adding features that address such issues as colour blindness would be a great thing for improving accessibility for all. \u00A0I don\u0027t think it\u0027s as simple as just using a different stock palette, especially for computer screens which can all be set a bit differently anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps a fairly simple \u0027first step\u0027 could be to have a set of selectable \u0027UI colour schemes\u0027 with different mixes of colours etc to cater for different needs and preferences. Balance sliders could possibly be added to each scheme for better control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may even be possible to set up each UI element separately for size and colour etc, but I\u0027ve no idea how feasible or practical that could be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
