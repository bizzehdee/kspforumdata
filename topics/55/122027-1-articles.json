Also we are currently bound to something like 100,000x speedup which is pretty super, but still boring to wait through. In addition we have to deal with the orbit altitude restrictions to apply this kind of speedup, especially as this only applies when there is an active craft rather than anything that would be accepted as \u0027on rails\u0027 as in the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to start with the basics:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I get 60t in to orbit around Kerbin, save a state\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhere orbit is as defined in career mode, possibly quantised (e.g. rounded to 0* equatorial orbit, 45*, -180*) as these take different amounts of dv\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe \u0027payload\u0027 is the remaining vehicle minus the current stage (\u0027launch remnant\u0027)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe save would include the launch remnant parts and resources state\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe save also includes (for career mode) the cost of the launch so far, minus the cost of parts in the payload\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I get 90t in to orbit around Kerbin, save another new state\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf I get 90t in to orbit around Kerbin (where something like the value of the parts discarded minus the value of the current stage) is less than the current 90t Kerbin orbit, update that save state. i.e. if you find a way to build it cheaper, or have a better launch procedure and end up with more fuel onboard in orbit, use this rocket instead!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOf course, some quantisation, possibly non-linear, may be needed here as well e.g. 5-10t, 10-20t, 30-50t etc...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAlternative is, for simplicity, the new 90t save also overwrites the 60t save, but this would mean as you build bigger rockets it becomes very expensive to launch a tiny probe, for example, so I would keep the quantisation.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*]When I go in to the launch window (runway or launchpad) I can pick from a list of unlocked planetary bodies, and from them an orbit and payload.
