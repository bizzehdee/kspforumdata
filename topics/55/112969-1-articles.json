This is why it is a suggestion.\n\nI an bringing up a long-known issue about severe lag in KSP when getting into high part counts. With a CPU running at 100% at 4.6GHz, I still lag around 230 parts.\n\nSpecs:\n\n16GB RAM\n\n2x Nvidia GTX 970 EVGA super clocked (SLI)\n\n4.6GHz Intel i7 processor (over clocked from 4.0)\n\nAnything else, post below\n\nBasically only 1% of my GPU is being used - to load polygons or textures. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t render everything at full detail because of the RAM limit\n\nAnyway, before I start complaining:\n\nI think KSP or Squad should begin to optimize the game for graphical processing units if or when Unity allows it...\n\nThis would:\n\nMake 1000 parts not lag\n\nAllow more accurate physics\n\nBetter performance \n\nBetter control management when running the game\n\nImprove the experience for most people\n\nOverall, I love the game, it\u0027s great, I just think it should be optimised better, thanks!\n\nPlease take this into consideration\n\n-G1\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T22:03:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 10:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gamel0rd1**\n  \nFixed grammar issues, removed some text not relevant"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:54:57Z","Content":"This thread feels more like \u0022I know unity cant do that, but heres my amazing overclocked rig specs, AMA\u0022\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure once Squad gets an opportunity to make KSP run smoother and more optimized they will do that. They always did their best to make things as smooth as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:04:32Z","Content":"Sorry Gamel0rd1, but suggesting Squad do this is completely dependant on Unity supporting it to begin with, and currently the only hardware PhysX acceleration Unity is planning to offer is hair simulation.\n\nAs with DirectX on Windows, OpenGL on OSX and Linux, and eventually Vulkan on Linux and Metal on OSX, all this is abstracted from the developer and PhysX is as well.\n\nIf Unity decides to fully support hardware PhysX in the future that will also be abstracted, it will automatically work on Nvidia hardware if it is present on a machine, and Unity will default to using the CPU in all other cases.\n\nIf you really want hardware PhysX support, you need to ask on the Unity forums, as this won\u0027t be something Squad can optimise.\n\nSorry to do this to your 3rd post but I\u0027m closing this one."}]}
