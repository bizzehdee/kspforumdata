Don\u0027t get me wrong, what Squad has done is amazing work that has kept me entertained for months, but now, in .23.5, older things are starting to become more and more obvious. Every time I boot up KSP now, stuff that (in my opinion) should have been fixed a long time ago stick out like sore thumbs. So I propose a polishing update, where we can tie up all those ugly lose ends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort List of things I think shoud be fixed (No explanation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The entire Aviation end of the game is basically unused (and really broken) for silly reasons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-IVA\u0027s have been unfinished for almost 10 updates (I know this is in the list of thing not to recommend but trust me read the full version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Many older part just don\u0027t stack up to newer ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong Answer (With extra Flavor and Emotion)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so the Aviation parts, now I know everyone knows this already but I\u0027ll say it anyway, their sooo limited. The only part that has been change since they\u0027ve were released in .15 was the simple gear, which got a couple motors for steering. The parts which are just soo old at this point are just getting dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay so I understand that the core idea was to have 3 sized, which was genius, but then it just seems like they just stopped. The Mk. 1 seems at least partially realized, with one jet fuel tank and a cockpit with an IVA in it, but the rest, like the Mk. 2 and the Mk. 3 (Oh god the Mk. 3) have, nothing, really. The Mk. 2 has the broken fuel tank (which weighs less than its Mk. 1 counterpart AND carries more fuel) and some adapters, but that\u0027s really it. I won\u0027t even talk about the Mk 3, because if you can find a use for those parts then all power to you. This combined with the old models, which just look plain ugly compared to the recent parts and the redesigned space center, makes then undesirable. Fixing this and adding just a few parts (Like adapters, LFO tanks and such) would transform the game so much more than a standard update for less work, after all you already have the code for them. (P.S. Take a look at the Spaceplane\u002B mod, that is where i\u0027d like KSP Stock parts to go.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the IVAs, which are right now kinda sad. You added IVAs, then just kinda forgot about them (No offense). Every update I check the Mk. 2 cockpit and yet nothing changes. If you\u0027ve seen some of the nicer Command pod mods (I recommend taking a look at Home Grown Rocket Parts, ALCOR, Kerbin Shuttle Orbiter and B9 for inspiration) They all have modern button click digital panels that display information. I realize that might not be the original vision, but a functioning IVA or any kind would add a whole dimension to KSP. So maybe having the Kerbal Intern run don to Kradio Shack and pick up some screens to bolt into the command pods would be worthwhile, after all it would make the game seem a lot more finished than it currently seems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the part textures. For all of you who don\u0027t think this as an issue, do a quick test, take a Mk. 3 Shuttle pod and bolt on a remote grabbing arm to the front. Now as you can clearly see the hook (new part) looks a hundred times better and realistic. Yes this is a testament to how far the game has come but, I really don\u0027t think it is a \u0027feature\u0027 we need. Many parts, like the Spaceplane Parts, the ugly small gear bay that sick out of the aircraft, and the old intake textures really like like they belong in a different game. It is what consistently drives me away from spaceplanes. I build this super cool looking SSTO, then realize I have to slap on landing gear, and once i do, I sigh. Why can\u0027t the gear be like in B9, with actually bays that go inside the ship, why does it have to stick out and look stupid all the time. I\u0027ve found myself using octagonal struts and flipping parts around inside the ship just to hide the ugly part, which I feel is something I shouldn\u0027t have to do. With a few part modifications, and a couple changes, the game could be brought up to beautiful new graphical constant that it exists at now, and I feel I would enjoy the game so much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it, the reasons I think KSP needs to get a good run over with a buffer. Right now the game just seems too much like an ignored old classic car. You can\u0027t deny it\u0027s beautiful but you also can\u0027t look past it\u0027s flaws. But I think that it\u0027s possible very easily to buy a polisher and some wax and give the game a brand new shine. Together with the best community I\u0027ve ever run across, I believe that we can make a difference to the game\u0027s future, make it better for the next players, make it better for 1.0 as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for sitting through my pusdo-rant, sincerely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHalflife77\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T04:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure they\u0027ll do a lot of polishing when the game gets closer to release.

I\u0027ll use the plane parts for an example. Say you want bigger landing gear. Squad agrees and designs a completely new one to comply.

They have wasted time making that new landing gear only to get rid of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that is a bonkers example but it still illustrates my point.
