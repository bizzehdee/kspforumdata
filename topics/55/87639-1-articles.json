Maybe I\u0027m alone in that but I honestly don\u0027t think so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game I was playing fanatically before I installed KSP was XCOM enemy unknown, so that might explain the following a little bit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like to see some kind of progression in my Kerbonauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to have to think about who I send on the next mission... maybe an experienced pilot and a fresh co pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel the pain when I loose an experienced mission specialist due to an unforeseen explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaining something by taking the effort to bring all my kerbals back from a mission on a far away moon instead of just one with the science reports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already play KSP like that but it would be great to have something that validates it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there have been suggestions along these lines before. have Kerbal skill have an influence on rocket performance, science returns etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not 100% sure how to implement the effects of experience into the missions. I don\u0027t like the idea of random explosions, magical better fuel consumption rates and other things that work better when a computer does the work instead of a lump of biomass. In a lot of cases it\u0027s the player that does the piloting and it\u0027s the player that gains experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the ones that make most sense are the science returns and possibly reputation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA minimum experience level (total of kerbals in the module/rocket) to operate certain modules (the lab, the bigger capsules, instruments etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind this is the one major feature that is still missing in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf squad can\u0027t/won\u0027t implement it... would there be a mod that can provide this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
