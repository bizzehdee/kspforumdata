It has been suggested here already, but it may have been drowned in the off-topic noise: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111978-113-anatid-robotics-mumech-mechjeb-autopilot-258-22-jun-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EMechJeb\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0seems to be pretty much what you want. It is a mod that adds plenty of autopilot features: launch, landing (click on the map where you want to land and it calculates the maneuvers for you), rendezvous, docking. It creates maneuvers, and it also executes them, so you can create your own maneuvers manually and have the autopilot do them for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the released version isn\u0027t ready for KSP 1.2 \u003Cem\u003Eyet\u003C/em\u003E, but there is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/MechJeb2-Dev/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edeveloper\u0027s version\u003C/a\u003E which works (although it may have some problems, being a developer\u0027s version). If your game is career, you will need to unlock the various MechJeb capabilities on your techtree. If you want them from the beginning of the game, you can either play sandbox mode, or install \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/221109-mechjeb-embedded-universal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis configuration\u003C/a\u003E for it, that will enable it in career and science modes from the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
