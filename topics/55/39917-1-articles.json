Being able to copy the height data for my main fuel tank and paste that into the height fields for secondary tanks and the struts/decouplers that hold them in place particularly would be awesome. Maybe have something like a little window in the bottom-left corner under the parts list with text fields containing X, Y and Z coordinates when you click on a part?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T19:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd to this a numerical readout of the center of mass and center of lift \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
