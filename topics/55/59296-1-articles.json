We learn best from mistakes and I\u0027m sure Kerbals pay close attention to explosions, so shouldn\u0027t a rocket which tumbles out of control and explodes give us something more than frustration? It would also stop people (like myself) from spamming \u0027revert\u0027 because we\u0027d have to weigh whether or not the life of the Kerbal (and eventually the cost of the rocket) was worth the science gained from the explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea somewhat related was individual parts unlocking as a bonus for certain things. I don\u0027t know exactly how you\u0027d implement it, but having individual parts unlock on their own when you either accomplished some sort of feat or had a very specific failure would be a great way to vary the career mode experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone else has ideas along these lines I\u0027d love to hear them and hope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T00:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see people crashing rockets on purpose for extra science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T01:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDanny would be happy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:33:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an explosion there are really three solutions 1.
