Ideally they would do just what you said, but their achievements would be constantly updated and there would be one or more to race against \u002Bcould create contracts for others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, you start as a freelancer and once you accumulate enough rep you are able to join one of the agencies. Once you do that you enter the multiplayer. From now on you can see achievements of other players from other agencies and you can compete against them. You see that it\u0027s day 23 and by that time that player achieved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E only.

Daily/monthly budgets and research taking time. Otherwise beating someone in going to the Moon is a matter of hours. Another\u00A0problem is what would happen with the settings. Would players just download presets from others, or something like that?
