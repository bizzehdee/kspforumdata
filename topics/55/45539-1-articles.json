What I\u0027m suggesting is that you can add folders or something so that we can easily categorize the sub assemblies so that all my rovers can go in one file, reliable lifters can go in another, and crazy firework dispensers which blow up everything within loading distance can go in their own folder as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T18:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I saw this exact suggestion yesterday.
