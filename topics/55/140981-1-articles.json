Currently it\u0027s not possible to fill two tanks from four tanks at the same time and it must be done in two separate options with some thumb twiddling in between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T21:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUse ALT on multiple tanks, then click \u0027In\u0027 on the tank you want to fill up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T21:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah but that doesn\u0027t work if you\u0027re simultaneously filling from multiple to multiple. That only work for from single to multiple or from multiple to single. It\u0027s also a chore when you have 10 or more tanks involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T23:34:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTAC Fuel Balancer wouldn\u0027t fix all your problems, but it\u0027s MUCH easier than doing it by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
