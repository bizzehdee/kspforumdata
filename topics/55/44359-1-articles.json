The current docking port selection process of bringing up the Right Click Menu (RCM) of the port in question works quite well for one docking node per part; when the RCM has multiple docking targets without unique RCM identifiers it becomes cumbersome to target the correct docking node, and near impossible to undock the correct node as well!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion, the ability to add/modify/remove unique RCM identifiers to specific docking nodes (e.g. \u0022front\u0022, \u0022back\u0022, \u0022top\u0022, \u0022alpha\u0022, \u0022beta\u0022, \u0022this one\u0022, etc) in much the same way vessels can be given unique identifiers, resulting in the GUI options stating things like \u0022Set Node Front as Target\u0022, \u0022Undock Node Beta\u0022, or \u0022Control from \u0026lt;tag\u0026gt;\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving separate dedicated docking port parts allows greater construction flexibility, the ability to condense multiple docking nodes into a single part in a usable fashion allows for sturdier and less resource intensive construction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
