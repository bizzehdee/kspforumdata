Could a gizmo like the offset/rotation ones be implemented that duplicates a part (and parts attached to it) and allows you to offset them? It would bring up a set of axis markers like the offset tool, and once you pull a marker it copies the related parts and slides them along the selected axis."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T18:38:16Z","Content":"Alt-clicking would still be easier."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:16:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alt-clicking would still be easier.\n\nToo bad the part copy gets confused; and rarely preserves the exact orientation of the part you are copying.

If I used the rotation/offset tool to offset something, this shouldn\u0027t be resetted if I move the part again, in place mode, or I just copy it. But instead of inserting a new mode, the copy mode, where this would work, it would be easier to make it work with Alt-clicking. Of course, I keep seeing people who never never ever use hotkeys. For them, it would still be better, if once you\u0027ve clicked the \u0027copy\u0027 button, your next click will copy a part."}]}
