A sensible and completely optional gameplay option can\u0027t be compared to something that breaks gameplay by making it too easy/too hard/too *insert something it shouldn\u0027t be* even if it is to be optional or not.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is using re-entry heat or kerbal salary any more or less optional than using any part(s) you dont like? That op part doesnt make game too easy/hard/whatever for you if you choose not to use it...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not responsible for Squad\u0027s time management. They\u0027re clearly working on improving the game, and I, as a customer, am telling them about a feature I would like to see, something I consider would be an improvement to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes and I as a customer am telling my opinion that differs from yours. That I dont consider this feature to be an improvement and I think that squad should use its time for other features instead. (I wont start talking about what features I would like. That\u0027s a discussion for another thread).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompression heating for example is in the game and it can be turned off completely. It\u0027s a sensible gameplay option but you are not forced to use it. \u0022If you don\u0027t like it don\u0027t use it\u0022 is not valid reasoning, but it also needn\u0027t be invoked here as this really is no different to heating or money in career mode. And if you\u0027re going to say that heating and aerodynamic effects are an integral part of real life space programs... Well so are astronaut salaries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key difference here is that heating and aerodynamics are important aspects when FLYING AND DESIGNING a spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESalary is important while FINANCIALLY MANAGING SPACEPROGRAM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the flying and designing aspect of the game so I would like to see new features and upgrades on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou obviously also like the financial tycoon type aspect of the game and would like to see improvements there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s ok and understandable BUT dont call me selfish just because I want different features to be implemented in the game. From my point of view you are just as selfish. You want squad to use their time on some salary stuff instead of the upgrades I would like.
