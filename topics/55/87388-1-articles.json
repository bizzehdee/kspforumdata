This allows you to gain science from contracts that normally don\u0027t give any science in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith my example, this would turn into: \u0022Boost science income by 10%. Remove 35 funds per point of science gained\u0022 \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENumbers are an example, and not ballanced\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this would mean is that the ONLY way to gain science is to do science experiments, but after you recover/transmit the data, you get more science than usual, and some funds are taken out of your account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also make for a little more believable outcome, as you need data in the first place to outsource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOffcourse, we\u0027d need to check if this is viable per strategy, as for example the patent licensing would make more sense to take science and turn it into funds (as it does already). So maybe only for the science gain strategies\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
