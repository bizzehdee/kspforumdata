These controls are awful....i played simply rockets app game on ios and that was intuitive although\u00A02d it was derailedand difficult. I. That game a ring was around the ship you used that for control and to see heading vs direction of thrust...i want that! Plus a secondary 3rd dimension ring to represent roll this navball is horrible and too much clutter to even find it useful...i am an ex helicopter mechanic amd i still find it useless...if this is a mod i can get please pointme to it..i tried mapping control to an xbox controller however , if you get into a spin in space breaking out of it is impossible because the game does not enable a heading direction just a thrust direction which means i gotta constantly change direction of thrust to match the opposite of the spin which is a no go...or maybe a mod for the ship to follow my cursor with the wheel being able to add the 3rd dimension of direction? In any case i love the concept of this game and i almost understand the difficulty of implementing controls over all these axis..until i realized my drone can with less buttons than a controller...and ahy don\u0027t lt and rt work on mapping controllers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-23T11:54:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand your complaint, other than there is something that you find hard to understand about the controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rest...

Great choice for a first game btw, but you should definitely believe the stories you hear about the learning wall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTaking a craft with no reaction wheels and no reaction-wheel-capable command module, what you said would probably be right, you\u0027d depend on thrust vectoring to control attitude (meaning the direction you\u0027re pointing in). This is a very inefficient way to steer though unless you are conducting a burn anyway. That\u0027s why the game also has reaction wheels (and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your craft has reaction wheels or a command module module that includes reaction wheels, this will allow you to control orientation without thrust, using only Electric Charge (you can also use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters instead and they\u0027ll need monopropellant as fuel, but they\u0027re heavier and less efficient). If you run out of EC, it will stop working, so use batteries/solar panels/other power sources to make sure you don\u0027t. If you already have reaction wheels on your ship, I guess there\u0027s a chance you haven\u0027t figured out how to steer with them, although I think that\u0027s pretty unlikely.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssuming you\u0027ve got EC and reaction wheels on the ship, if you end up in a spin, shut off the thrust and turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This will stop the rotation as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls and holds orientation for you.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, you can control a spin yourself. Look at the navball and see which way it\u0027s tumbling. Assume that the centre of the navball is always directly ahead of your ship, like a helicopter\u0027s artificial horizon. Steer towards the side that is emerging, and away from the side that is receding. When the navball stops tumbling, you have stopped tumbling too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand ahy don\u0027t lt and rt work on mapping controllers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossibly because they\u0027re not buttons but sliders.
