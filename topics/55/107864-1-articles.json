This is why KSP approximates physics using a 2-body problem within a Sphere-Of-Influence (SOI), so that objects can be put on elliptical \u0022rails\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not implement Lagrange Points with their own SOI? Outside of it, ordinary 2-body physics reins, but inside there is an \u003Cem\u003Eapproximated harmonic potential\u003C/em\u003E also known as \u003Cem\u003Eharmonic oszillator potential\u003C/em\u003E. This is the staight forward way to handle complex potentials in physics. Of course there is an error but in a reasonable small SOI it is neglectable. The advantage is that it has analytical solutions/trajactories in each dimension, e.g. oszillation in the attractive case: x(t) = x\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E * sin(w t). So we have rails again!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow could this look like in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider for example L1: Then between Kerbin and Mun there is a small region, where forces are slighty different. Two cases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou pass the SOI of L1 with \u0022normal\u0022 speed, like when you are going to land on Mun. You will not notice any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou reach L1 at almost zero speed. Then the trajectory within SOI has an oszillating pattern. It can become quite long so KSP may not display it entirely. And it is always leaving SOI, because all Lagrange Points are unstable, but with tiny burns from time to time you can park the vessel there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:57:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Heikman, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually a fairly common suggestion, so much so that it is on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest\u003C/a\u003E list. It\u0027s been discussed several times, and I believe the consensus among the physicist types is that using SoIs to emulate lagrange points creates more problems than it solves (I don\u0027t have the physics background to give more detail, sorry).
