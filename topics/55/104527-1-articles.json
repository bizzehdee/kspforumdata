Though I don\u0027t develop for KSP, I\u0027m reasonably handy with a debugger. On occasion I have the game dump core (Linux version) and I\u0027d like to be able to get these issues resolved. To cut down on the workload for the game devs, I\u0027d like to be able to submit bug reports with possible fixes where practical.\n\nTo that end, would there be a way I could get access to the debugging symbols for the game so I can do this?\n\n- Garrett"}]}
