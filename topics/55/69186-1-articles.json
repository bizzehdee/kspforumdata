I know this is a game and you can just set the resource flow mode to STACK_PRIORITY_SEARCH and transfer to PUMP, but you\u0027d be making it do things that are impossible in real life. I know that most things in KSP are impossible in real life (and vice versa) but at a basic level, it has some degree of realism. Making a solid fuel transferable from a separate fuel tank is not something that\u0027s vaguely realistic. It\u0027s exactly the same if the solid fuel was wood - how would you get the wood from tank A into tank B? It just doesn\u0027t work..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s completely possible with some cfg editing though. As I said, make solid fuel transferable and so that it searches the stack (exactly like liquid fuel) or ALL_VESSEL (like electric charge or the old monoprop) or STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW (like the new monoprop) or whatever you want and make up a few tanks which contain the RESCOURCE - SolidFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T01:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, solid fuel doesn\u0027t floaw at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T01:46:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless you consider solid fuel tanks stacked on top of each other to be one tank.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T02:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t make sense UNLESS inline solid fuel can all count as \u0022one\u0022 rocket.
