I would love to see a feature to the vehicle designers that shows the name of a part when you mouse hover over what you have already assembled. It already highlights the part you\u0027re hovering over, so it can\u0027t be too much work to add a tool tip label right next to the mouse cursor. Maybe add a check box to the settings menu to enable or disable this feature for those who know what parts they are looking at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still new to the game and I\u0027ve been loading the stock crafts and other peoples crafts and wondering what specific parts they used. For example, I can\u0027t yet tell the difference between a \u0022Mainsail\u0022 and \u0022Skipper\u0022 engine just by looks. Especially with parts from mods, it would be helpful to know if a vehicle has a fuel tank or just an empty fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T21:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps some modifier key \u002B click on a part to bring up it\u0027s name, or stats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neamerjell","CreatedById":86054,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T23:03:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would work too!
