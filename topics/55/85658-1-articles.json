A fresh install I plan to load up with mods soon. But for now I\u0027m stock... So here I am staring at my satellite. Unable to open any of the right click menus. It seems to have moods. Some days its fine.. today being the worst this bugs ever been. Hundreds..upon hundreds of clicks later I finally was able to open up a menu. And every click getting madder and madder at the fact that I cannot perform the most simplest of functions to operate my craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tell me. Why does right click not work? Are there any work arounds? A key command that opens up all the menus maybe? Or a way to bind them to action groups? Something.. because this right here is ridiculous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Unity problem, no?
