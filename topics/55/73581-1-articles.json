KSC need some sort of refuel function. Also allowing to transfer crew when already on the launchpad or runway would be nice too. It happened already to often for me to launch a rocket without the required crew. Going back to VAB or SPH brings up a loading screen which is very annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T22:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with this!
