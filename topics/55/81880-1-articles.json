This way, you won\u0027t need to worry about transferring between the two, which is incredibly inconvenient at the moment (build rover in SPH with random extra part as first part, detach main body and put into subassemblies, attach to rocket in VAB, go back to SPH to add whatever part you forgot on the rover, etc.).
