Umm, sure...) finding out the environment from different parts of a body tells you about *the body*, and not just about the rock you landed near. If I land on an animal and it has fur on its back, I would later want to do a fly-by of its belly to see if it has four legs, and land another probe on its feet to see if it has claws or hooves, and then rove to the mouth to inspect the teeth, and the exploration of the parts tells a story about the whole. And for players who don\u0027t use biome maps or lists, maxing a body is a puzzle in itself--hmm, there\u0027s a farside crater I landed in, maybe the other craters are interesting as well!
