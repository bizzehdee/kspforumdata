My main problems with the current maneuver nodes are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Moving a node along the orbit is very hard to do because you often grab one of the handles instead. You have to zoom in (losing sight of the new orbit) and possibly change the camera angle just to be able to hover the mouse over just the right spot so the node circle is illuminated and not one of the handles. Often requires pixel perfect mouse alignment, and the thing is not even standing still so you end up clicking on the wrong part anyway as the handle lit up a fraction of a second before you click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- It\u0027s hard to find a camera angle where you can adjust the node and also see the resulting orbit. For example, to plan a Mun capture, you need to have the Mun and the node in view at the same time, so it\u0027s impossible to precisely change the location of the node. A one pixel change gives a totally different result. So you need to zoom in, make an adjustment, zoom out again, etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I can think of one alternative that might be even more useful and versatile: split screen so you can have two seperate views.

In that case it\u0027s certainly a good idea to include it, but it might be confused with the \u002B/- buttons on the standard maneuver nodes which go to the next and previous orbits. Since it\u0027s changing a setting just like the \u0022orbit mode\u0022 buttons that are directly above, it\u0027s probably better to add a label \u0022Number of conics\u0022 for better visual consistency, or even better \u0022Display 3 conics\u0022 with \u0022\u002B\u0022/\u0022-\u0022 buttons behind it that change the number.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Can you also display the three individual delta-v components instead of just the total delta-v? And maybe to a higher than 0.1 m/s precision. With atomic engines, I often make really tiny adjustments by pressing shift and immediately X again.\u00A0Nice if you want to leave a gravity assist trajectory exactly in the orbital plane, for example. Doesn\u0027t matter much when you\u0027re just going to the Mun, but makes a huge difference when pingponging in the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Stock maneuver nodes are relative to the new path for some reason. When you add a normal burn, the node axes\u00A0twist\u00A0around so that the normal vector is really applying some unwanted retrograde.\u00A0It would\u00A0often be useful to define the node\u00A0relative to the old path. I understand it may take a lot of work to convert between the two, but if it\u0027s at all possible, it would be a great addition if users could switch between \u0022relative to old\u0022 and \u0022relative to new\u0022. (The actual node will probably always be relative to the new path, but your window could display and manipulate a converted set of values)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- An \u0022execute maneuver\u0022 button like the one in Mechjeb would be nice, too.
