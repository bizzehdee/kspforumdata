I don\u0027t mean attatching tanks to tanks either, I mean more along the lines of making huge satellites from the 1x1 and 2x2 panels, and other parts. I\u0027ve made a moon base core hollowed on the inside so kerbals can walk in and through it. I\u0027ve made a huge space station ring hollowed out so it can be moved through. One thing I\u0027d love to see is hinges and pistons. Make huge doors that open to reveal whatever, make entire \u0022foldable\u0022 bases if so desired. Okay maybe not that far, but I\u0027m thinking more along the lines of making a dome (which I have done) and have a large part of it open upand reveal the interior. Maybe even have another item raise up out of it and something else like a large satellite dish open up from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T03:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/37707-0-21-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Parts-Infernal-Robotics-0-7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/a\u003E will allow you to do that and more.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T03:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, what your are describing comes under \u0022Robotics / mechanics\u0022 in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat not to suggest list.\u003C/a\u003E If you don\u0027t mind using mods, you can try Infernal Robotics as sumghai mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E on the what not to suggest list, thread locked.
