Relative to the selected frame (surface/orbit). But neither tells me the inclination of my current trajectory and I\u0027m pretty certain that the horizontal marker would not tell you that either. I am not even sure if there is a way to display your orbital inclination on navball in a non-confusing manner. You may be heading and flying straight to the east while your inclination is 60 degrees - it all depends on your geographic position. Personally I\u0027d just add a small side display telling you the most important numbers - Ap, Pe, and inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
