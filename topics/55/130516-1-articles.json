It has a horizontal slider which is impractical because the mouse must switch between the horizontal and vertical sliders constantly to view the contents of the window fully. The expected outcome is that the window will either resize automatically to allow the contents to be more easily viewed or the user will be able to resize the window manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UPDE1LU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UPDE1LU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
