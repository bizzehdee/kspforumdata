If you can reset materials without EVA then I dont see why you can\u0027t collect the experiment as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO EVA should be reserved for samples gathering and moving and the rest should be easy to do. I think EVA should also be useful ie make and break things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you should be able to dock a science probe to a capsule or lab and move the experiment data to either through one button. So they should both have a collect data button which should attract all data to that capsule or lab. I think the only exception should be samples which should always be treated as physical items to enhance the immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Athanasius","CreatedById":42040,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T23:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just gotten to the stage of putting down an independent lander on Mun, doing basic science (crew report, surface sample, EVA report), then taking off and docking back with my \u0027command module\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I can\u0027t see any way in which to move the data from the lander into the command module.

Other than surface samples, goo reports, and materials bays all experimental data should just go into the capsule automatically once read.

Get them next to the science device and right click it, and you\u0027ll have an option to \u0022take\u0022 the data. Some of the things give you warnings, but in this case (you\u0027re dumping the lander) you can ignore them. Once your guy has taken all the data from the devices, right click on the command pod and you can \u0022take\u0022 all the crew reports and eva reports and surface samples. Then go up to the capsule on the return vehicle and either get in or right click and \u0022store\u0022 the data there.
