I do not know the complexities involved in modding and mod compatibility. What I do know is that modders are a passionate people. I have played with many KSP mods, and each adds a uniqueness to the game, but with each new mod comes the potential to bring compatibility issues.\n\nHere is my suggestion. How about having a modders meeting virtually! Modders can come together and discuss common resources, problems (eg: aerodynamics), and find solutions to things. There can be a Short Summary of the meeting topics afterwards or something.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo what does the KSP Community think? Would it be worth it? Any significant gains, pointless, or already doing something like this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:58:25Z","Content":"Too many issues to overcome.

Then NWN2\u0027s channel turned into a cesspit, the game devs refused to drop by anymore and I swore off ever using an IRC channel with modding again.\n\nA couple of KSP modders recommended the IRC channel to me a few months back and I politely declined.

It helps if you can ask your question and then hang around, even if I am in the channel, quite often I am AFK and will not see your question for quite a bit of time. If you join, ask your question, and then leave 5 minutes later because no one has answered, it almost certain that no one saw your question in that time because they did not have their IRC window open at that exact moment.\n\nD."}]}
