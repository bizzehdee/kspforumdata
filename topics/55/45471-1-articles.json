Maybe you want a shark face on your space plane, or maybe a company logo on your rocket. I was recently watching a series on You-Tube by a man named Macey Dean (Link--\u0026gt; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVNZXXTp6dt81aXAoU5Uj3g\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVNZXXTp6dt81aXAoU5Uj3g\u003C/a\u003E ) Macey does a You-Tube RP type, where there is combat with rival companies, and such, but you could not tell the ships apart, or logo the different factions. So... thats my idea :3 Maybe a bunch of preset patterns that we can arrange to make a decal, that you can sticker to the side of a rocket or pod. Or just that you could upload a image. I wouldn\u0027t see it being that hard to implement, as there is already the ability to place items and customize your ship. Give me some feed back on this. Hopefully some of you like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm new here as well.. and this guy looks cool. -\u0026gt; \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hoagster35","CreatedById":82068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T01:19:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that would be very cool, and possibly make an individual flag for every mission and then when you go to the tracking station the flag will be there.
