With 8 biomes, Minmus now has 8 times the science and really high science multipliers that were set \u003Cem\u003Eprior\u003C/em\u003E to Minmus having biomes. As a result, you can basically hit \u0022Sandbox\u0022 mode in a career game (i.e. unlock the entire tree) without leaving Kerbin\u0027s SoI as the Kaptain pointed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only going to continue with asteroid science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI acknowledge that this is a balance issue, \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E there\u0027s no reason that players shouldn\u0027t be able to start looking for better balance points now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
