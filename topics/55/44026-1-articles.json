I would feel betrayed since people that seem to not care about their privacy actually sell their privacy so that Squad gains profit giving them in-game advantages. Why would i consider that a good idea?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso who would want to do what you just said - people could easily just disable the ads and no one would ever know and Ad-companies would have no information if it is even seen ingame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because something can bring you more money doesnt mean its necessarily a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could for example also start selling premium parts that you pay for with actual money ingame.
