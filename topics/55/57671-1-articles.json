They are a godsend. But I wish the Booster tweakables were different. For Example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mainsail has 1500 thrust, a Skipper has 650 Thrust. 650 is too little, and 1500 is too high.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if instead of the 75% thrust bar, we could have a 750-1500 bar. It could be in increments of 25 or 50. A more precise way of tweaking the engines more to your liking without using a lot of math. Because It would be nice to use a Mainsail with 1000 thrust instead of tweaking the .cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
