There already is a setting that allows the Kerbals to change and move in different pitch angles(you control it by left-clicking and moving the mouse though). It\u0027s better than the stock system already.\n\nJust look in your settings.cfg file and change \n\n    EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = True\n\nto \n\n    EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE = False\n\nThis makes them move independently from the camera angle. But it free\u0027s up orientation control of the Kerbals.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T13:58:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ANWRocketMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:06:56Z","Content":"Left-click and drag, it changes pitch. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nEDIT:\n\nAww, I was beaten to the punch."}]}
