Logically the reason a large portion of the data loss in transmission is that they are doing crude analysis of samples and experiments. Taking them something to a mobile lab before transmitting would allow more data to be recovered from the samples/experiments than just transmitting alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest pairing this with making the more advanced transmitters more efficient(less data lost due to weak signal) so sending samples from the most advanced lab with the best transmitters would get you over 90%(but less than 100) return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T16:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d have to be big, and heavy, but that would be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunJumper","CreatedById":27062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T17:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPossibly include the ability to get extra science from returning samples to the R\u0026amp;D building (clearly transmitting can only happen once per sample, but returning to R\u0026amp;D would allow for extremely in-depth analysis, possibly giving interesting factoids).

My suggested alteration would have loss at 2 points Converting samples/experiments into data(reports are already data) and Data loss/corruption during transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be multiple labs of varying sizes with the more advanced labs being better equipped(adding weight) and the top of tier lab almost as good as the one at RnD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transmitters would vary in power(more powerful signal degrades less). Even with combining the best of both you will still lose potential science by transmitting compared to returning them home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea 3rd option to farther reduce it is adding a data storage moduals that could take all the processed data from the lab and physically return it home while the long term mission continues(world tour as other planets get full enviroment maps)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
