It would allow us to set a time and then show a pop-up at that time with a message we wrote and set timewarp to 1x. I\u0027m building a space station and a launch window comes up every few hundred days and with this I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about when. I know I could just timewarp but doing something else in between those launch windows is not only better for RP but the variety keeps the game more interesting. Should be pretty easy to implement too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T22:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen the idea come up a few times before.
