What I propose is something that looks exactly like what we have now, but instead of being anchored to the orbit, it should be a free floating tool like the navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would create a maneuver node exactly like you do now. Choose a place in the orbit, click it, choose create node. Once it is created, things change a lot. An icon showing the node position is placed on the orbit and a tool appears on screen near the navball allowing you to modify the orbit. But that tool stays on screen regardless of where your camera is focused (it also keeps the same orientation and size, so you never grab the wrong marker). All the current node editing controls apply, but some new ones will need to be added. The center grip will move the maneuver along the orbit (the same as dragging the tool does in the current KSP) and you will need a way to choose which node to edit for multiple nodes. So if you create a node around Kerbin, and then focus on Duna to fine tune the burn, you can still see the tool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIdeas stemming from discussion in this thread\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u002BOrbit and -Orbit buttons were left out of the mock up by mistake, they should be there somewhere.

The current manouver could only be completed 100% accurately, if you could perform your burn under 0 seconds (immadiately). Using the current manouver system, if you start earlier, and finish earlier, with the center of the burn in the node, the center of your burn will eventually move away, because you started accelerating before it. You end up getting shifted. This can be avoided, if the manouver is not a point, but a section with continous burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current manouver correcting itself if you burn the wrong direction, is brilliant, but you\u0027ll have a longer burn that way, and you\u0027ll end up getting even more shifted.
