I have a suggestion replacement.","CreatedByName":"Ncyphe","CreatedById":100847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T04:25:53Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Ncyphe","CreatedById":100847,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T04:25:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, as I play, the way we collect Science just isn\u0027t very good, before and after the latest changes. To me, there is just very little reason to establish a moon base or some other major base as their use for collect Scientific Data is quickly lost after 1 or 2 flights. In the real world, a multi-million dollar space mission would be established to pull as much data as possible . . . look at the ISS, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, I do have a suggested replacement system. Sample analysis with a cargo inventory system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real world goal of space missions is to either build or launch man made orbital objects for the betterment of humanity, or experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, we already have some experiments in the game, but I feel they could be so much more, they could become actual experiment apparatuses to perform experiments on sample objects obtained from Kerbin or extra-Kerbinular objects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, let\u0027s say we have a Kerbin grown potato, and the Kerbins want to do some experimentation on the potato in space. They can launch it and observe it\u0027s weightlessness, they could expose it to radiation, blast it with lasers, attempt to grow it, etc. All science experiments would be interchangeable inside certain spaceship parts. For example, a Science Jr. can only mount one science experiment at a time, but be manually changed out by a Kerbin, assuming another experiment is stored in a cargo spaceship part. Each experiment would take a set amount of time to analyze the sample. (How the time is calculated, and weather the sample is degraded is up for debate. Time-stamp a science experiment so that you can leave the vessel and claim the science another time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sample system also naturally destroys the whole data-mining idea. Each sample would have a life span, and each experiment could damage the sample to a degree until the sample is no longer usable. Also, link over the current \u0022science usefulness\u0022 factor as you can only study one type of sample so many times in a certain situation before it\u0027s useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, you\u0027d find much more gameplay out of these idea. You\u0027d need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Spaceship cargo holds that can hold X-amount of space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-scientific samples, a variety of which can be obtained from the different planets using different tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-parts for extracting samples\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-and the new science study system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlays will find reason to build a planet base or orbital station and to go to orbital bodies to obtain samples study and return with. Incorporate the transmission restrictions to encourage players to get samples to a base with a science lab to get better data results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sharing these ideas because, right now, I feel there is very little reason for me to launch new teams of Kerbals to go man science bases, when all the science is used up. Give me a reason to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStudying different samples would auto unlock items on a separate tech tree. For example, new samples (or compounds) from Kerbin to launch into orbit for study, and even new science experiments to attach to space flights (a reason to return to a space base, swap out experiments and get more science from a previous investment).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-18T07:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, this would actualyl be kinda cool, like in IRL, meaning that a Low Kerbin Orbit Space Station would be useful, because you could swap out the experiments and process it through the lab. I like this. It adds meaning to Logistics Craft. The Devs need to see this......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank420","CreatedById":92185,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T04:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei was just thinking about sci, and the bases. a simple change could be to make the sci labs deployable and anchored, permanently only on the surface. allow them to process the current experiments, clean them, but they only gain 50% of the yield. the sci rover, for example, would then need to go back to the biome, collect data and return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t help with the lack in space, perhaps once the sci lab is deployed in space all engines become disabled and any craft that dock also have their engine disabled while docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keymaster89","CreatedById":100480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T10:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne day, maybe... we have to see what Squad will do with economic and reputation update, then we can revamp science (BTW i\u0027m totally with u Ncyphe ^^)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
