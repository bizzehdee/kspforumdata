I aim for PE at about 40 km which sometimes leads to another orbital turn.\n\nI was very afraid the first time I saw flames around my re-entry capsule since those flames were real for the first time.\n\nBut now... I feel that re-entry heating is underpowered. Really, if there ARE flames around my craft then the temperature should be already at 500-600 degrees, but the thermometer reads ~300. I watch as my heat shield is losing ablator during my descent... At touchdown it was 192/200... Really? I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s normal so either the heat shields are overpowered or re-entry heat is not hot enough.\n\nI know that I can scale the difficulty and the heat in the settings, but in normal settings by default - isn\u0027t it TOO weak?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T09:26:43Z","Content":"There\u0027s an issue - if it\u0027s noticeable and dangerous for capsules, the spaceplanes go BBQ at about 900-1000 m/s at high altitude, so SSTOing becomes quite challenging simply because of heat.

The first unit of ablator burns only below 27 km at ~1.5 km/s.

If a spaceplane can climb up to 30-40 km (on Earth) it\u0027s nearly half-way to orbit. The air density there is so thin that it can then use rocket engines without the risk of losing their performance due to atmospheric pressure. That\u0027s the idea. It\u0027s not that you can seriously hope to get 80-90% of orbital speed still in the atmosphere.

Problem here is that KSPs orbital velocity is very low, so planes at 3x supersonic speed get dangerously close to the reentry temperature of space capsules. Even now M3 is basicaly a hard barrier you won\u0027t get around, and, on the other hand, space capsules have very little trouble during reentry. \n\nMind that\u0027s **only a thing regarding heat shields** being a bit pointless, tho. Everything other than well proportioned capsules still just burns up during reentry.\n\nBtw: No, heat tiles won\u0027t help here. KSPs planes are behaving as if they\u0027d have heat tiles all around the ship, so making heating angular would only make planes more vulnerable. Furthermore, it\u0027s normal planes, straight flying planes getting into dangerous territory. For comparision, I don\u0027t think a MiG-25 was built to survive reentry and it still got up to Mach 3.2.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Failure during reentry is the least fun form of failure.

And it does have an HUGE impact on the game that cannot be understated: You can only reenter capsules (or stacks), not full spaceships anymore, you need to hold your ship stable, and can\u0027t necessarily use every available angle. Sensitive equipment needs to be shielded.\n\nCompared, heat shields on the other hand have a tiny impact on the game: It just makes reentry-capable capsules a bit heavier.

Yes, you can pretty much drop straight down on Kerbin from a Minmus return going 3000\u002B m/sec and not burn up in the atmosphere because you\u0027re blowing through the atmosphere so fast that you never give the parts enough time to heat up. But take a look at your G meter on the way down; I guarantee the needle is at the max the whole way. Thats the problem. Coming in that steep should subject your crew (and capsule) to such high G forces that the crew would basically be crushed and the capsule should collapse in on itself like a beer can. But they (Squad) never really modeled G forces, so you can get away with dropping a manned capsule straight down from a million KM up. One of my pet peeves with this game: why included a G meter if it doesn\u0027t do squat? And its been part of the game for so long; you\u0027d think they would have done something with it by now.\n\nI like to role play a bit with my Kerbals, so I always try to re-enter at an angle that has appropriate G forces for survival of the crew.
