Do you think its good or bad? In my opinion, I think that it was a bad shift. For me, it is a bit harder to navigate than the original spaceport, and also many community driven projects, or projects that were good but currently seem dead (i.e. B9 mod) will be lost in this shift. Anyway, what do you peoples think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T05:03:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027 the right place because there\u0027s a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79011\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E already to discuss that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, this one is closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
