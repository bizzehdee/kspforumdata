Requirements, it takes a HUGE amount of power over a period of time (a minute or so?) to transmit, so you are going to need a boat load of big solar panels and a lot of batteries to do it. So instead of possibly having to send you entire mission all the way back from Duna, Jool, etc, you can just dock with your space station in Duna orbit and transmit from there. Also a requirement to have the research lab staffed by one or more Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther 2.5m parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Life Sciences lab that requires 1 or more (maybe up to 2? Bonus science points for more than 1 Kerbal?) Kerbals in it to perform science. Exercise bike, Zero G treadmill, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe an astronomical observatory as a 2.5m part with an extenable telescope that allows your kerbal to look at distant floaty ball thingies in space as well as a the ball thingie you are orbiting (but it doesn\u0027t work very well, so being parked around different planets gives different science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new probe part for a ground scanning radar to science planetary bodies from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
