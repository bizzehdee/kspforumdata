They imagine it to be a space race. I think it should be cooperation just like Portal 2 and/or role-based like TF2, Evolve and probably many other games.\n\nAnyway, here\u0027s the original post:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I always imagined multiplayer to be role-based. One vessel. One guy controls the pilots, the other engineers/scientist. The pilot flies and can time warp while the other guy welds stuff together/does sience. That way if two people were in the same vessel both wouldn\u0027t want to grief or else they would completely fail the mission.\n\u003E Let\u0027s say both of them choose theur roles at the beginning of the mission. The pilot has types of missions for pilots, like \u0022fly there, make a report/land there take a sample\u0022. The scientist has something like \u0022check the sample/take a science report at X spot, etc.\u0022 The engineer would need KIS/KAS abilities: \u0022weld this with that, connect X and Y with fuel pipes, then pump the fuel.\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E No space race. No multiple space programs. Pure cooperation. No need to figure out the time paradoxes.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: And multiple missions could be ran at the same time that way. Just jump between them with some sort of voting system.\n\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Player X wants to switch focus to vessel Y. Choose YES/NO\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E ...or something.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit2: Scientists could also get some sort of mini-game when entering the lab. \u0022Pour Mystery Goo on Duna surface sample to see how it reacts \\*cool visualization by DanRosas\\* DING! Science!\u0022 \u003C-- that way the scientist guy would have something to do while the other would rove around and gather surface samples for him.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit3: Space races are stupid. Cooperation and friendship is what should be showed in this game. The only way you can succeed is to share the success with someone else. \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s how ISS was built, wasn\u0027t it?\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit4: Now the unmanned flights become problematic with this idea.\n\u003E \n\u003E Remember Telemachus mod?\n\u003E \n\u003E One player controls the unmanned vessel, the other is the mission controls. Mission Control tells you to slow down and tries to overall help you to make the mission not be a failure. You forgot what\u0027s the speed of the reentry? Ask the ground crew! Need assistance with docking? Ask mission control to take over the control of the probe you\u0027re trying to dock to! Not sure how to set up a manouver node to be most efficient? Let someone else do that!\n\u003E \n\u003E TL;DR: THERE\u0027S NO TL;DR! Read the whole post!\n\nIt\u0027s kind of messy, but hopefully clear enough to understand.\n\nFeel free to criticize and ask questions, post your own ideas.\n\nQUICKEDIT: Of course it doesn\u0027t have to be 2-people only.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T21:20:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T21:10:39Z","Content":"I mean, the time paradox thing isn\u0027t really a problem at all.

To quote my post on another thread:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s strange how people fret about timewarp and say that this is some sort of insurmountable or game-breaking issue, when we already have not one, but two mods (KMP and DMP) that add multiplayer. In fact, KMP was the mod that turned stock multiplayer from an impossibility into a reachable goal. 0.24 broke ground for multiplayer (under the hood, not gameplay-wise) and there are now several devs working on multiplayer, according to the devnotes. Point is, SQUAD already has a system for timewarp in a multiplayer scenario, and unless someone can come up with one that somehow places no restrictions on player timewarp while somehow allowing them to interact at any time without creating a hopeless bowl of event-bubble spaghetti (This is probably impossible, but hey, that\u0027s what everybody said about space travel), that system is KMP\u0027s system.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T02:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 02:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hobbes Novakoff**"},{"CreatedByName":"logan2611","CreatedById":148925,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T03:18:16Z","Content":"Alright, so here is how DMP does timewarp in case anyone wants to know(and I think it is a pretty good idea):\n\nPlayer 1 timewarps ahead into the future, he is then selected as the reference frame for the server for time.\n\nOnce Player 1 is done timewarping, players may at will sync with his time, doing this will teleport you to where you would be when you get to the time Player 1 is at."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T08:11:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alright, so here is how DMP does timewarp in case anyone wants to know(and I think it is a pretty good idea):\n\u003E Player 1 timewarps ahead into the future, he is then selected as the reference frame for the server for time.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once Player 1 is done timewarping, players may at will sync with his time, doing this will teleport you to where you would be when you get to the time Player 1 is at.\n\nWhich is a pretty bad system in my opinion.

It\u0027s up to them how they solve it. I think we should have a co-op too, like the one you described. \n\nThe only problem is early-game, where you mostly use 1 simple kerbal. The others would just spectace? \n\nI especially like the idea of doing advanced science in the lab manually, by moving test tubes around and pouring liquids everywhere and making a mess. It would also be better to have more scientific experiments to do, wich for you would have to do something different from clicking a button. Like carrying the materials bay around, and putting it in water to see how X;Y reacts, or making measurements and collecting samples from different landmarks in EVA. Mission control could specify the tasks that with you can earn the most science, also forcing the player with this to explore. For example, get to the bottom of that abyss, there colllect samples from X;Y, take photos of X;Y, or use your plane (they maybe tell you what you might need?) to fly down in that valley, than return to your landing craft before the sun sets. This could be done in that [rts-style](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128722-RTS-like-contracts). Mission control could specify the site to land, guiding you to the most beautiful, interesting site, that you can reach, where the terrain is especially detailed, and there are interesting landmarks, such as a waterfall, or geysers, caves, or just the mountains or the transition of the biomes is awesome. \n\nOf course, first things first. All planets should be more detailed, as there isn\u0027t much more than a large, flat area as your landing site, where there\u0027s nothing special, explorable in your range. They are only interesting from orbit. Maybe some people could be hired to make the planets especially detailed, while keeping their style. Also, making some extra-special places, wich may be your future landing sites, based on your tarjectory, and wether you have the equipment to explore most of it. Of course, your system couldn\u0027t handle such celestials, that\u0027s why it has to be made much more efficient first. May Unity 5 help us. Currently, more than 70% of what the game loads is invisible to you. Than why it has to be loaded? Much more graphical options are also necessary, including much more graphical efficiency, and better textures. Also, about the parts. That\u0027s another weak point. Couldn\u0027t my 8 fuel tanks, stacked on each other, be simulated as one, long, flexible (that\u0027s still stupid. it should be brittle) fuel tank?\n\nAnd to add something to the topic, my idea is to give identical contracts to the players (at least terminating the luck factor), so they will go on identical missions. Solving multiplayer is easier, if your subjects are trying to accomplish the same.

Of the two, sync issues are probably less of a problem than waiting, but it\u0027s not right to say there are no issues at all.\n\nI have no arguments here, my opinion is that there are no physical problems with the time sync method (paradoxes), the only problems are from the interaction of multiple players (not a major problem in my opinion) such as someone syncing forward a station just as someone else is about to dock. I really need to stop saying \u0022no problems\u0022 and instead say \u0022no major problems\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T14:29:41Z","Content":"I have to say that this idea sounds insanely boring.

We have all those kerbal classes (three) and they are kind of useless. The only things they can do now is right-click things and reset the Mystery Goo/ repair wheels. They should be enhanced. For example: The pilot flies (duh), the engineer plots the manouver nodes, welds stuff and monitors life support and the scientist sits back in the lab and cooks things, or whatever a scientist in kerbal universe can do (some sort of lab minigame would have to be included, I guess).\n\nEDIT: OK, let\u0027s say players can switch roles whenever they want. Bam! Now everyone can do the docking!\n\nI have nothing against flying in formation. That is 100% fun, if you ask me, though the space missions should be locked to only one at a time. I know it sounds limiting, but think about it: You send one piece of your station, then you send another. Just like in singleplayer, except with someone who can occasionally switch the control over the two vessels in range and re-align them in case something goes wrong.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E EDIT: Okay, maybe time paradoxes are still a problem.

Other than that they could help each other out. If the scientist needs help he calls for the pilot to make him eat something, or monitor his health.\n\u003E Once the person drops out of timewarp to wait for your rendezvous at Duna, and you go into the same orbit of Duna, rendezvous can happen as normal assuming you were to have timewarp control linked between the vessels (in a mutually agreed upon manner.)\n\nI don\u0027t really get it. So Player 1 fools around the KSC with his jet and sees Player 2 go out of the Kerbin SOI superfast, and then teleports to Duna? Then you go there and agree to sync with him? Can you see him but not interact, or what? How does that differ from DMP? The only different thing I can see here is the fact that you can see Player 2 timewarp.\n\nEDIT: I swear no more editing! :I\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T12:01:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 12:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T05:21:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Oh, reaaaaally?\n\nCall me crazy... but I don\u0027t see how this is a problem.\n\nClearly game time wins the day if I wrap ahead of that it\u0027s at the risk someone will invalidate my time line.\n\nIndeed this to me only adds to the strategy. \n\nSo Player A wraps ahead grabs a window and goes and catches the asteroid.\n\nPlayer B then has a couple of options seeing they hold the game time control.\n\n1) find a faster path to win the race and seeing they control game time make it impossible for player A to win.\n\n2) put something in player A way to invalidate their timeline but in the process hand them control of game time. \n\nThen the situation reverses. \n\nGood clean competitive fun."}]}
