The very few instances of \u0022oxidiser\u0022 should be changed, especially when it is spelled two different ways in the very same item description.

In this context, the scope would be an individual [part description | contract | science report | etc].

It is a word whose meaning is currently in flux, just like the word \u0022data,\u0022 which used to mean the plural of datum exclusively. Nowadays it frequently is used as singular or plural. Likewise \u0022typo\u0022 can refer to any misspelled word. \n\nAs for bad writing style, no one ever said that things not written in American English represent bad writing style. The thing that makes it bad writing style is the mixing of two different spelling conventions ***for no specific reason***. It would be fine writing style to use \u0022oxidiser\u0022 in every instance, as long as all the rest of the writing in the game used the spelling conventions that go along with it, such as \u0022aluminium\u0022 and \u0022colour.\u0022 But elsewhere, KSP consistently uses American English, so it most definitely is bad writing style to suddenly out of nowhere throw in another spelling convention. The only exception would be if the other spelling convention were being used for a specific purpose, like if the part were manufactured by The James Bond Aerospace Company, and the author wanted to play up the Britishness of this particular part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T16:43:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity**"}]}
