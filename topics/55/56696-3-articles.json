As it stands, transmissions seem to only be worth while for places where return missions are very prohibitive, like Eve\u0027s surface, Tylo\u0027s surface and Laythe\u0027s surface and maybe some out of the way places like Moho and Eyloo.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking the mobile lab currently isn\u0027t very useful because after all it\u0027s just 2 Kerbals in a small can, which obviously can\u0027t do much when compared to the big facility back at KSC. But if that\u0027s the case, the traditional Kerbal solution of MOAR should apply. That is, if you hook multiple labs together, you get more science out of it. So like if you have 4 labs docked, that station/base would be able to transmit at 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree, though, that I find it hard to justify the both the loss of data and the transmission cap itself for things like thermometers.
