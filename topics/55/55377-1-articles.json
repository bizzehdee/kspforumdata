If you want a \u0027harder\u0027 KSP with things like life support, go download the mod and make your version of KSP \u0027harder\u0027.. seems straight forward.. Your game mode is what you make it. I play \u0027Stock Mode\u0027 and \u0027Kethane Mode\u0027. In \u0027Stock Mode\u0027 I go for science and complete missions based on how I feel a space program would develop. Probes then manned, etc. The tech tree did take some time also (actually I don\u0027t think it\u0027s 100%) because I chose to not spam science, simple yet effective way to make the tree last longer. In \u0027Kethane Mode\u0027 I only have ships travel with enough fuel to the moon, then they re-fuel and go farther, with the premise being if there was no Kethane my program would only be able to reach the Mun and no farther.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the want for these features to be built in, but I feel that KSP should stay in it\u0027s (trying to word this so it doesn\u0027t sound bad) \u0027bare\u0027 state because it does allow modders to take the game in so many different directions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T17:05:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think hes making a suggestion this for the \u0022final\u0022 V1.0 game. assuming that deadly re-entry (DRE), life support resources (KAS), communication networks (remote tech) etc. will/may all be in the final STOCK V1.0 game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these factors may be a bit much for some players to manage so a difficulty/realism option may be a good idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhile I appreciate there is a mod for everything (which I love), I believe and hope that many of these features provided by these mods are earmarked to become stock in the final release. therefore it should be perfectly reasonable to suggest difficulty/realism settings to help new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI support this suggestion, though it may not be relevant in the current version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T17:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscussed it already\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60207-Difficulty-levels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60207-Difficulty-levels\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T21:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll these factors may be a bit much for some players to manage so a difficulty/realism option may be a good idea.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe devs have said that they don\u0027t want a single difficulty setting, but they have mentioned when discussing most of the topics you mention that they will probably have a setting per \u0022advanced\u0022 feature that you can turn on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
