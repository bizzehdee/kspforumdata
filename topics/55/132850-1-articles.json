I clock in at 1000\u002B hours of game time. This is exactly my kind of game. I love the community, I always stay on top of the devnotes and i love where development is going.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat being said, I seem to remember that, a year or two ago, KSP\u0027s long term plans were being discussed. The eventual \u0027\u0027scope\u0027\u0027 was being outlined, the resource tree was being scrapped, multiplayer development after finishing was being discussed and your were taking a step backwards to make better, more consious, steps forward in the future.The future is partly here and KSP has been out of Beta for months. Perhaps it is just me but i have become totally out of touch with your long-term plans for KSP (other then the next update and that multiplayer will become available eventually). Obviously i am not asking for release dates or guarantees but, as the wiki is quite out of date and fragmented, i would like to request that you go on record and maybe answer some questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWill KSP ever be finished?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr will you keep updating indefinitely? If so, what did the release of 1.0 mean? Will there be a \u0027\u0027definitive\u0027\u0027 version in the (near) future (,only adressing bugs afterwards)?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAre you planning features that you are not yet working on?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI believe this is what you called \u0027\u0027scope completion\u0027\u0027. Or are you just de-bugging, balancing and optimising as of now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPerhaps you would like to remind me/us of said scope?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe you can elaborate or just update our understanding of your long term plans for KSP.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease do not take any of this as critisism. I appologise if this is too much to ask for or i have missed loads of information elsewhere on the forum. Any information will be appreciated and helpfull. I dare say at least some of the community agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKind regards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobje\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Robert","CreatedById":158111,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T21:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch like most games these days, 1.0 is not finished, it is release. It is the version where they say \u0027this is our game, we charge money for this\u0027 (not counting early access. You buy an early access game because you want to support it\u0027s development. You buy a complete game because you are willing to buy that game as it is). And after that comes free DLC (updates). Many games do this. The Witcher 3 did it, Paradox does it all the time (brings out free updates along with their paid DLC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the scope: Squad has never had a public list of their scope, and for good reason. Ideas change. What seems like a great idea now may turn out to be awful in a few months. If you make such a list public, there will always be outcry whenever you change your mind, regardless of the reason. Rather than put up with that, they just don\u0027t tell us.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTake the game as it is.

The inherent issue is that with each release, the initial devnotes get filled up with all the great stuff that\u0027s planned for a particular release. Over time, the juicy\u00A0details start coming out. Eventually though, it gets to the point where the introduction of new elements into a release stops to focus on the necessary bug fixing before it can go on to QA and experimentals. The devnotes start getting thin on \u0022what\u0027s all the fun new stuff\u0022 and gets down to \u0022here\u0027s all the bugs we\u0027re attacking and the side things being implemented.\u0022 People get antsy about what\u0027s going on, but quite frankly bug fixing, balancing,\u00A0and tweaking isn\u0027t particularly exciting to talk about for weeks on end.\u00A0And that\u0027s about where we are in the cycle right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E some\u00A0new things have already been announced such as the multiplayer, probe telemetry, and\u00A0KSPedia\u00A0(all of which I will probably get nitpicked for saying.) Also, as much as I\u0027ve stressed it when I was a moderator, not every feature is going to be universally excitable to everyone. The Space Plane Plus incorporation was a huge one, but there were plenty of people who didn\u0027t care because they thought the rockets needed some love first. I\u0027d rather not get into a debate in here about what updates are the most important because it involves a lot of people\u0027s personal opinions, which are all valid, but don\u0027t always coincide. But I did want to point out that new stuff is coming down the pipe and (as was stated when 1.0 came out) development continues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you:)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jim DiGriz","CreatedById":92465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T19:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoftware development roadmaps are like weather prediction. \u00A0You don\u0027t ask weatherman for predictions of what the weather is going to look like 2 years out, and you shouldn\u0027t really ask software developers either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes sense is to ask what they\u0027re working on now (the 1.1\u00A0stuff they\u0027ve been highly transparent about). \u00A0And how far along they are in it and what they\u0027re currently working on (the devnotes are excellent and highly transparent here).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAsking for anything else is practically like asking them to knowingly lie to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClaiming that there is a \u0022moral case\u0022 that you need to be shown their roadmap is evidence that they should never under any circumstances show you their roadmap, because you\u0027re obviously going to interpret the roadmap as a promise and not as a guess about the future that may be scrapped any time someone comes up with a better idea and/or something that seemed simple turns out to be an epic never ending yak shave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoftware development does NOT look like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MEMS-Banner-2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://nelsonengrco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MEMS-Banner-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt often looks more like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221357968310026.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/22536559/images/1357968310026.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaLVin-K","CreatedById":118452,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T20:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222430559\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456488306\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259415\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn February 26, 2016 at 5:05 AM, John FX said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice to have a single statement of current plans for the near future though.
