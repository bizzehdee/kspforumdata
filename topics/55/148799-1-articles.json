For all I know they never eat, sleep, or drink. Maybe they live on absorbed soil nutrients (a bit\u00A0like too many of the creatures in No Man\u0027s Sky). The oceans\u00A0on Kerbin\u00A0however are\u00A0somewhat suggestive that water\u00A0has at least something to do with their existence, but I suppose they could absorb water moisture from the air in their environment, explaining that one away as well!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
