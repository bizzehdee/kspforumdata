I know some 12yr olds who play this game and if they made it too hard I suspect they wouldn\u0027t be able to play.In my opinion ksp is not too easy for anyone (except Scott Manley and Matt Lowne and a few super advanced players) You can always try new challenges that push your skills to the next level I do agree with your complaints but they are necessary for the default mode if you want a wide rang of skill players playing this game but like I said you can always crank up the difficulty.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
