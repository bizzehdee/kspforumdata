Firstly, the rover wheel power is linked to separate keys, which can be defined by the user. Rather than just the equal of W or S, it instead controls a power gauge, which goes into negative power (reverse) and positive power (forwards). For example, I would probably map my keys to something like P and :. Just because of the way I use my keyboard. Anyhow, with the added control part, you than activate by pressing another key that is mapped to your choice (\u0027). There would obviously be default key mappings too. Press the key, the control module enables. A little window box comes up on screen, and you enter your desired speed in m/s. Once the speed is entered, the control module actively controls your power-gauge, moving it around to maintain the speed as best it can. Just an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
