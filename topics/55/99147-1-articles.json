However they have left me wanting a feature really bad. I would like there to be a feed of upcoming events for the space program and particularly which planned nodes are coming up and how much time room I have between them. Currently I have to highlight each flight in the observatory in turn to check for it manually. It shows the mission elapsed time for each flight but I think time for next burn/planet intersection/reentry would be way more essential.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a big diffference between flying a bunch of unrelated flights and operating a proper space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghimb2000","CreatedById":74996,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T03:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use Kerbal Alarm Clock to alert you on your next burn \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T04:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be great but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible under the current system.
