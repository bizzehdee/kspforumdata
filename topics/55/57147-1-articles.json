You need to be able to define the \u0022toggle\u0022 state based on tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets say I\u0027m building a shuttle. Lets put my outer engines to 30% thrust in a tweakable. Go to the action group pane, hold down a modifier key, and click on action group 1. It will pop up a window asking if you want to make your currently selected object in it\u0027s current state a toggle-able state. Confirm/deny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow continue your build and set up your second thrust level with the outer engines at 85% thrust. Go to the action group with the engine selected and click on action group 1, no modifier key. Have a pop-up to confirm that you want to set this as the second state of the action group. Confirm. You just set up action-groupable tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted additional states at this point, select your part and modifier click on action group 2, confirm selection for state 1 of the toggle for that action group. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERinse and repeat, action group-able tweakables for those with big complicated ships. It also hides the option away behind the modifier key for novice players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would not be sure how to present this new level of complexity to a novice player though. That is a topic for a new thought later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
