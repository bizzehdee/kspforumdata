storms.\u00A0 Its easy to imagine how interesting it could be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut before we can really delve into the suggestion, we need to consider different ways weather could be implemented, and figure out what the best way would be for KSP.\u00A0 But first, lets talk about the elephant in the room:\u00A0 The fact that it can adjust difficulty:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWeather and Difficulty:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I see it, there could be a number of basic settings for weather.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Full disable:\u00A0 Weather is disabled.\u00A0 It is always clear.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Visual only:\u00A0 Weather does not actually effect you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Storms only:\u00A0 Weather only effects you when you are in a \u0022storm\u0022 like scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Full:\u00A0 Weather, winds, etc, will effect you any time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on the level of simulation, there could also be toggles/sliders for things like wing icing, damage from dust storms, or \u0022gustiness\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso interesting would be a Sandbox option to add a weather system of your choice to a location (presumably your current one).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECore Mechanics and Weather Simulation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first question to ask is simple:\u00A0 How do we design the weather with regards to the game?\u00A0 I do not speak of merely how wind works (it would presumably be a form of modifier to the current aerodynamics), but rather where it comes from.\u00A0 KSP is a physics heavy game, and adding some full-blown weather simulator to it would not be very good for gameplay purposes.\u00A0 So what, then, is the best way to add weather?\u00A0 Three options come to my mind, and perhaps you can imagine others.\u00A0 I\u0027ll start with my ideas on the matter:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1.\u00A0 Exceptions to Standard.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 In this setting, the all-clear weather on Kerbin is still the \u0022standard weather\u0022, and any other weather events are things that generate randomly, move across the planet for some time, and then disappear.\u00A0 For other planets, the \u0022standard\u0022 could also be clear, or it could be a set windspeed and direction (i.e. if you wanted to give Jool a saturn-like atmosphere) or just being cloudy instead of clear (i.e. if you want to make Eve a little more Venus-like in appearance).\u00A0 These events would be storms, areas of wind, perhaps even benign weather like partly cloudy and drizzles.\u00A0 Whenever one disappears, a new one would generate at a semi-random location, and would randomly generate its path based on some planet-defined directional preferences.\u00A0 Some weather events could also follow a pre-determined pattern of changes over their path (i.e. a \u0022hurricane\u0022 might have a building phase, an main phase, and then just be a normal storm on the last leg of its path)\u00A0 This results in a reasonably viable set of weather mechanics that shouldn\u0027t require too much processing power to simulate on a global scale.\u00A0 Values worth noting would include the max number of weather events per planet (a value that can change based on the planet), which weather systems can generate on any give planet, and perhaps \u0022seed spots\u0022 which are the only region on a planet that can generate certain weather events (i.e. maybe only weather events that generate in certain sea areas have a chance of being generated as a Hurricane event, and only storms that are generated in northern areas have a chance of generating as snow storms).\u00A0 If two weather events overlap, one of them can simply take priority over the other as they pass through each other for simplicity sake.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1b.\u00A0 Permanent weather events:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 It would be good in this case to have a permanent type of weather event possible.\u00A0 These events would be designed into applicable planets.\u00A0 They would be used for things such as Jool, where you might want to have an equivalent to Jupiter\u0027s Great White Spot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2.\u00A0 Extremely simplistic, low power weather sim.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 The idea here is to split a planet into a set of \u0022cells\u0022 and have the simplest, easiest simulation you can that still causes a reasonable variety of weather, perhaps intermittantly \u0022seeding\u0022 it with an effect to get things moving if need be (or to simulate seasons).\u00A0 One option would be to take the \u0022exceptions to standard\u0022 idea listed in 1, but just replace weather events with randomly generated air masses with semi-random values for speed, humidity, and temperature (semi-random because they could be influenced by the location they are generated).\u00A0 Any time two of these masses meet, they are replaced with some weather event, based on the values of the air masses.\u00A0 By themselves, these air masses would generally just have some wind, temperature, and humidity, and some form of cloud cover ranging from zero to full.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3.\u00A0 Pre-decided weather patterns.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 Rather than worry about dynamic weather in this scenario, the developers simply \u0022design\u0022 the weather on Kerbin (and each other applicable planet) for a set amount of time, such as a period of 1-4 of that planet\u0027s years, and then run it.\u00A0 When it reaches the end, it loops back to the start.\u00A0 The upside is that you can have some good weather variation without actually needing to simulate it.\u00A0 The downside is that the weather is predetermined and thus will repeat.\u00A0 You can get around this somewhat by starting each planet at a random point in its weather \u0022track\u0022 upon starting a new career, so you at least don\u0027t find yourself seeing the same couple days of weather every time you start a new game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat effects can weather have? \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first and most obvious effects are the \u003Cstrong\u003Evisual\u003C/strong\u003E ones.\u00A0 There will be clouds.\u00A0 You can fly through them.\u00A0 They may be simply rendered, but they can still be clouds.\u00A0 Also, there can be rain, snow, and lightning.\u00A0 When you are in space above a storm at night, you might see some occasional flashes from the storm from lightning.\u00A0 There would also be a simplistic fog effect too (perhaps most notably on Duna, where it could be used for sandstorms).\u00A0 If the weather isn\u0027t impressive enough visually, then I imagine mods will help fix that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext we have \u003Cstrong\u003Emechanical\u003C/strong\u003E effects.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Wind can, of course, cause some ruckus during launches and take-offs.\u00A0 It might be a good idea to add another runway to KSP, and to allow you to choose which one to launch aircraft from (and which end of the runway to do it from).\u00A0 You could display this choice while in the aircraft hanger when you click launch, along with the current direction and speed of the wind.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Wind gusts are another potential one.\u00A0 For simplicity sake, I assume that rather than worrying about what causes such turbulence and attempting to model it, that some weather systems or air masses may simply have a value indicating a chance of encountering gusts of somewhere between X and Y strength intermittently, and that when this happens the wind affecting your vessel rapidly changes for a couple seconds. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Icing could be something that occurs in fairly water-heavy worlds such as Kerbin and Laythe.\u00A0 If whatever Eve has can also freeze and snow, you could perhaps have it there too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Being a Mars analogue, Duna could of course have sandstorms.\u00A0 These could be windy, reduce vision, and could be at risk of damaging some equipment if it is not protected or put back into its stored configuration (Engineer astronauts could fix them if you forget).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Planets with active volcanoes could have a permanent weather effect near them with an ash-plume storm, and wind direction matching the plume direction.\u00A0 The priority could be set such that this effect disappears whenever another weather effect is in the region, resulting in the volcano appearing to sometimes be erupting, and sometimes not (when in actuality, not erupting just means another weather effect is overriding it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Given how weird Eve is (its SORT OF a venus analogue, but not really), you could probably imagine some interesting things for it.\u00A0 Dense but slow-moving and harmless fogs (insert Purple Haze joke), small tornado-like storms that look almost more tornado than storm (but which actually only have a small \u0022real\u0022 tornado in the very center).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Weather effects could have their own science equipment associated with them.\u00A0 This equipment would gather science based not on location, but rather what kind of weather they are in (for these instruments, all vacuum areas would be considered the same \u0022weather\u0022 pattern, unlike the current thermometer and barometer).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Some more major weather effects could temporarily override the biome in the region they are affecting for some instruments.\u00A0 These would generally be major things like hurricanes, or permanent weather systems like the \u0022Great Jool Blot\u0022 (has a nice ring to it, actually).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Planets without atmospheres (and maybe those with really, really thin ones) would of course not have weather.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:26px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMisc other thoughts and comments:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-If the SUN is granted some weather, it could have \u0022sunspot\u0022 events, along with rare \u0022eruption\u0022 events.\u00A0 The sunspot events could just act like a biome for purposes of near-sun spacecraft science gathering, but eruption events could have other effects too.\u00A0 If one of these happens to be pointed towards a planet, you could generate an aurora effect around the poles of that planet.\u00A0 It could also cause a notable additional heating effect when a spacecraft near the sun is above its \u0022biome.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Meteor showers are not weather (and should not be considered such mechanically), but could potentially be an interesting visual effect that occurs on planets with atmospheres at set points in their year, independent of weather.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I wonder if Jebediah Kermin has any type of weather he especially enjoys.\u00A0 Knowing him, probably hurricanes.\u00A0 While in an aircraft he designed himself.\u00A0 With an exterior pilots seat.\u00A0 During re-entry.\u00A0 With boosters

either 1 or 3 would be the most reasonable bet for minimizing processing power (since in 1 weather is a bunch of basically invisible moving \u0022biomes\u0022 that generate in a random spot, move in a line across the planet\u0027s surface, then disappear.\u00A0 While in 3 weather is a pre-determined loop that maybe separates a planet into regions and just assigns a given weather type to each region at a given time in said loop, meaning that the weather isn\u0027t actually being simulated, just read).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeck, in 1, each \u0022weather biome\u0022 is itself basically a physics-less, um, thing that just \u0022orbits\u0022 the planet in a straight line, like a moon, except it is basically in the planet\u0027s atmosphere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hardest major part to get in without major processing power hits would really just be, well, wind.\u00A0 It would basically be adding a new vector to deal with when dealing with all manner of drag calculations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can somehow do wind, then gusts is easy as it is just making the wind speed go up and down rapidly for a second or two.\u00A0 Some other concepts like dust storm damage and icing could be a little tricky to do, but technically could be done even without wind (they also aren\u0027t absolutely necessary for a weather mod).\u00A0 And really, you may not even NEED to include them in a stock version of weather.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIcing would probably work in a similar way to how heating works with parts.\u00A0 Surfaces that produce lift or apply maneuvering forces would get less effective at both lift and manuevering as they get icier.\u00A0 A given \u0022weather biome\u0022 would simply specify something like an altitude range (which could even generated semi-randomly upon the system\u0027s creation for variety and just remain the same for that system until it disappears), and a strength level for the icing effect.\u00A0 While in that weather system within the specified altitudes, your wings and similar parts would start to ice up, and possibly gain a simple icy graphical effect (similar to how hot parts start to glow).\u00A0 Parts that generate heat could counteract it, and it could slowly wear off automatically after leaving the dangerous altitude range.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRain would be pretty much a purely visual effect.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThunder could be mostly visual, but have a chance of hitting you if you are in the clouds (strikes could disable your controls for a few seconds unless you put a conducting rod part on your craft).\u00A0 Some parts could be flagged to be actually destroyable by lightning strikes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNaturally, mods can (and probably would) be used to make the weather look a lot better if people want it to look good, so the clouds and other weather can be set up to look fairly simplistic and low-res in the stock version.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yeah.\u00A0 The wind itself is really the hard part.\u00A0 Whether or not it is possible to implement wind without a major performance loss is the real question.\u00A0 You can cut some processing power by having wind only affect the currently selected/controlled vessel/kerbal (maybe have a performance option that also enables it for other loaded-in vessels and kerbals).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor simplicity sake (i.e. not making it even MORE of a potential nightmare), you could even just worry about horizontal winds only.\u00A0 Though if there isn\u0027t much difference between horizontal-only and TECHNICALLY supporting winds from non-horizontal directions, then you could just do it so that you (or modders) can support things like thermals and updrafts/downdrafts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryu

\u0022just\u0022 taking the resulting vector of the vessel and the wind and treating the aerodynamics for the vessel using the resulting vector).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-For purposes of performance, it can be considered to set it up so that wind (and other weather effects) would not be applied to all loaded vessels.\u00A0 Perhaps instead, it would be only the current vessel and any

do one of two things.\u00A0 Either, you set the entire planet to have a \u0022default\u0022 weather, or you set each biome to have a \u0022default\u0022 weather.\u00A0 If you take the biome approach, then you don\u0027t need to worry about the \u00221B\u0022 section of the original post since you can just use a biome to create a permanent weather effect (such as a \u0022Great Jool Blot or some other Great Red Spot analogue).\u00A0 It will also allow science parts that deal with weather to potentially get biome-specific data if you want. \u00A0 Regardless of the approach, the default weather would be unchanging.\u00A0 For Kerbin, it would generally be sunny skies with no clouds.\u00A0 If taking the biome approach, a biome like mountains could have some low level gusting effect if you want to make things interesting, but each biome would generally just be a clear skies, no wind, and a temperature that fits the biome, with no changes of any sort, ever.\u00A0 No processing power would be used for any form of dynamic weather simulation or anything.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 2.\u00A0 Introduce the weather systems.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 These weather systems would generate at a random location on the planet.\u00A0 Upon their generation, they become a random type of weather system, with the odds of each (and which ones are possible) being weighted by where on the planet they generate.\u00A0 At this point, it then randomly generates a direction, speed, and length of time.\u00A0 The random generation for each of these three values could be weighted based on latitude and what type of weather system was generated.\u00A0 At this point, the weather system is generated, and proceeds to move

Basically have a temperature map for Kerbin (and other planets, I guess, but that\u0027s tertiary), which can interact with other cells. Different biomes would add modifiers to the temperature, and it would vary day-night. The cells would interact with their neighbors, attempting to average their temperatures, and random shocks could be added to keep things interesting. The number of cells that are rendered would be a very easy way to change how CPU-intensive the setup is. Farther-off cells could be grouped together, while closer ones (to the active vessel) could be subdivided for more accuracy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interactions could also have a game-of-life system built in, so that they interact with each other, creating a dynamic system. I modeled a very basic (4x4) weather system on a short scale, and very simple algorithms work very well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWays to increase the accuracy (and complexity) of this model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Set the loser to the average of the two temperatures instead of the winner\u0027s temperature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Favor warmer temperatures over the ocean, at the equator, and during the day, and cooler temperatures at the poles, over land, and during the night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Introduce extremes by having large blocks of warm cells spawn a few hot cells, and a large block of cool cells spawn a few cold cells. This would mostly eliminate the need for shocking the system to reintroduce diversity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three of these are also scalable (play into the increased/decreased number of cells), and require comparatively little algorithm to accomplish.

Assign a starting temperature for each cell (the game already does this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.) Randomly pair off each cell with a neighbor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) Give each cell a modifier. This combines factors of likely the cell is going to stay at its current temperature. The cooler cell gets \u002B2 at night, and the warmer one gets \u002B2 during the day. Each cell gets \u002B1 for each neighboring cell with a similar temperature. The cooler cells near the poles get \u002B3, as do the warmer ones near the equator, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) They fight!

This would be extremely easy to implement, as the basis for everything is laid out in step 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWind would be a static force on the craft, which I\u0027m sure somebody who\u0027s actually coded can figure out how to do. The magnitude of the force would be determined by the difference in temperatures between the cell the craft is currently in, and the temperatures of the surrounding cells, and direction would be found in a similar fashion. Sea/ocean breezes and mountains could also be factored in in more advanced versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep three: Cloud Fronts\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFronts form along boundaries between temperatures, much like winds. I don\u0027t imagine that it would be too difficult to render a line of clouds above where temperature gradients were larger than normal. Higher-altitude clouds or some scattered clouds could be added to places where there aren\u0027t fronts to keep things interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep Four:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EPrecipitation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere there are fronts, there is (often) precipitation. Type could be determined by local temperature, and apply a weather filter to obscure vision, and coefficients of friction would be decreased. Adding in to temperatures, precipitation causes local temperatures to drop, so that would be factored in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying that it would be easy, and it sure as heck wouldn\u0027t be simple.

desired).\u00A0 And just from a visual aspect it would be fun to see dynamic weather on gas giants.\u00A0 Then there are\u00A0solar winds and etc.\u00A0all sorts of neat things could be modeled if we had the computer power.\u00A0 But we\u0027ve already come a long way from the 2D lunar lander program I played in 1980.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

program in KSP.\u00A0 But I don\u0027t think we really NEED one if we just want weather conditions in our simulator, and there is likely a way we can get weather that is \u0022good enough\u0022 for being reasonably sensible in the way it works.\u00A0 Hence some of my thoughts on possible ways we might be able to implement weather in a way that is at least more complex than the weather in a typical game that has visual weather effects in it (which basically amounts to \u0022every X minutes, randomly generate a value and set the weather to that type without caring where you actually

2 levels of interaction here, and I think it\u0027s important to separate the two because they really are separate issues programming-wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, we have the large scale, which is how the atmosphere/ground/oceans interact with one another and the sun. \u00A0Using the stratified cells and heat flux is good enough (I think?) to handle this at a planetary level, and the break-even line is determined by the size of the cells. Smaller cells == poorer performance. Events can be randomly generated -\u00A0if not all the time\u00A0then some of the time, maybe not at higher warps? -\u00A0and the generated events (read:storms) would just propagate through the system requiring no other attention\u00A0until eventually they dissipate into the \u0027default\u0027 weather. \u00A0Alternatively, depending on the intricacy of the weather system, storms may spontaneously appear, propagate, and dissipate. Either way, variations from the norm require little extra effort on the simulation. \u00A0Graphically, the natural or RNG storms would have to be blended into the surrounding clouds at a regional or planetary level, which is probably pretty hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we have the small scale, which is how the weather interacts with your craft. \u00A0This, I must say is where the real difficulties begin. \u00A0The flight engine would have to look at the cell that the current craft is in and determine from the available data what sort of weather was going on. Then apply wind, rain, temperature, etc. to make the magic happen. \u00A0Then, it also has to display these graphically. \u00A0The current system is pretty adequate for handling static atmospheric\u00A0conditions and the Microsoft FlightSim\u00A0crew seems insistent that dynamic atmospheric conditions are no problem, but IMO the graphics are going to be the issue. \u00A0The fancy clouds are already performance intensive, and unless some better way to display them is discovered (don\u0027t hold your breath) it is likely that and good-looking weather is going to be somewhat intensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo to me, it seems like the limiting factor for weather is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emaking it look good\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe if I ever get around to learning how to mod KSP I\u0027ll tackle this because it doesn\u0027t seem to be impossible, just pretty difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ILikeMods","CreatedById":202285,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-28T19:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222987844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489720091\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022102132\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kBob\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/16/2017 at 8:08 PM, kBob said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you code to the lowest possible computer you\u0027re going to end up with a crappy program.\u00A0 Try playing with FSX or Prepar3d you\u0027ll see it works FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE with A LARGE VARIETY of hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this thread is 3-4 years old, but I just gotta say, this was a really good point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
