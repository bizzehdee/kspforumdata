It\u0027d be cool to be able to move Kerbals around the cockpit rather than just leaning forward, and perhaps look out a window at another angle. If we could move Kerbals and not just their view angles, we could improve on the visibility of IVA\u0027s, not only giving a wider FOV but also different angles out the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T22:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually a real immersive way of controlling your rocket is currently available.
