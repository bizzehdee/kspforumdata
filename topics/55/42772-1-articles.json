I tried manual docking and well...I sucked at it. The problem I ran into was when I tried to dock, I could not lock on to what port I was going to link with (there were 5 available). And even zoomed out and right on the station the ports were hard to select.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest is the ability to \u0022Target\u0022 individual components (docking ports) that have been named in advance. To do this the player would fist select the port they wish to name and bring up its menu. In the menu would be a \u0022Name Docking Port\u0022 option. Using this option will give the port a unique name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a port is named the user will be able to target that port from another ship. To do this the player will just need a docking capable ship and to right click their target object. This will bring up a menu that offers the current options and one that says \u0022Target Docking Port\u0022. Selecting this option brings up a menu listing the named ports and could even have a small PIP window showing a close up of the port to be targeted (some people are just forgetful...like me). Once the port you want is selected, that port will be the target until changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, aside from the naming part, ORDA does allow you to target ports and use a window to select them. Not exactly what you need, but part of it, maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
