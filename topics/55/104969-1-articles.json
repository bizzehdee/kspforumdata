However, there are very few LF-only tanks in the game, and for example there are no 2.5-meter LF-only tanks. As far as I can see, this problem could be solved one of two ways:\n\n1) add more variety of LF-only tanks\n\n2) Include a tweakable to switch tanks between LF only, Ox only, and LF\u002BOx, much like Porkjet\u0027s nuclear engines mod does.\n\nWhat are people\u0027s thoughts about this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T22:31:30Z","Content":"A long time ago, they hinted that option #2 was going to be one of the uses of tweakables. And no, I don\u0027t think that we need the ability to arbitrarily change them (so no big orange xenon tanks, for example), but having nuclear engines that only use LF and no big LF tanks is going to make me either mod in large LF tanks nor not bother with more ambitious missions, leading me to move on to something else sooner."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T22:32:16Z","Content":"I don\u0027t really mind this at all.
