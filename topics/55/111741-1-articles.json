We have pretty much all that is needed for rockets and some more station related parts would be great.\n\nThe idea of rocket flight is pretty simple compared to winged aircraft. You just go up and grav-turn, while aircraft go up, down, land, take-off, land again and sometimes even orbital. All that with wings and most of the times in one piece. They need more specialized parts because they are simply more complicated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T22:36:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T01:41:42Z","Content":"DO IT, DO IT NOW\n\nI was just working on a MK3 heavy transport ship, simply put I more or less made it an airdrop ship. Since there really is no way to make a movable Ramp in stock without crazy amounts of parts. So once things go out, they can\u0027t really get back in unless we are in space. Since Space is nice and all, but the game does revolve around going places THROUGH space It does help to be able to have a viable option to pick up rovers/cargo from the ground without resorting to Rocket Cranes/ large partcount ramps or other crazy ideas for this simple task.\n\nThere is always the option of turning the MK3 part on its side..... but hey thats ridiculous XD"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T16:45:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just wondering what you\u0027d like to see.

We need more powerful 1.25 m engines, better fairings, and much more.
