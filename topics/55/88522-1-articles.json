These parts would have a total capacity in which you could use tweakables to scale the fuel amounts up and down. For example, a small fuel tank may have a capacity of 100. You may put in 40 liquid fuel points, 50 oxidizer points, and 10 xenon points into it for your hybrid glider. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould this work at all?

For example, a tiny tank of monopropellant contains fifty points, where a similar size xenon tank holds 700. The developers could work around that problem by making different fuels take up different capacities in a total capacity number. There may be crazy decimals so they may round it off to the nearest tenth or something. It may work though.)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T13:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HamShanky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged density to value.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starbuckminsterfullerton","CreatedById":117494,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T21:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97750-Fuel-Tank-Tweakables\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI suggested more or less the same thing not too long ago\u003C/a\u003E, although I think things like Xenon should remain separate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamShanky","CreatedById":127299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T22:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starbuckminsterfullerton\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starbuckminsterfullerton\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97750-Fuel-Tank-Tweakables\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI suggested more or less the same thing not too long ago\u003C/a\u003E, although I think things like Xenon should remain separate.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes but that was only in the LF\u0026amp;O tanks, where there are two fuels.
