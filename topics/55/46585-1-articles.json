However, there is one thing that bothers me - Space Centre becomes cluttered with objects, roads and walkways, which spoils its look a bit in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to move quite low-rise R\u0026amp;D centre to the other side of the runway, and change the default viewing angle so it\u0027d cover it a bit more? Because, you know, Artyom\u0027s wizardy is best enjoyed by crashing into it, not by looking at the details in the Space Centre scene anyway, but we\u0027ll get a much cleaner look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother little and mostly irrelevant thing - we always see great space views on the loading screen, but we all know that getting into space is only a part of the process! I\u0027ve enjoyed the Selection Process video Dan Rosas did for 0.21; why not have e.g. a kerbal leisurely running on the treadmill or just standing near it as a loading screen as well?
