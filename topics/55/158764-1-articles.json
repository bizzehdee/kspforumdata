If it is not, it should.

They were cool in the beginning when the only capsule available was the MK1 (the one that has its own statue by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E). Watching kerbals go crazy during explosions was pretty fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never use the MK3 passanger modules mainly because they (their IVAs, I assume) lag a lot and even more when there\u0027s crew in them. Maybe instead of having one cam per one kerbal there could be one for the entire cockpit?
