However, it doesn\u0027t support four-way symmetry, making building upon it much harder. I suggest that four-way symmetry be implemented onto the four side-facing points of the HubMax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, maybe there could be various variants of the HubMax - you know, five-sided, four-sided.... six-sided....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T23:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m already looking at doing a 6 way one as a mod part but stock would be very cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, that part really should have symmetry. I know there is a force symmetry feature in the .cfg files and that\u0027s how the multi-couplers work but I think there may be a problem with doing that based on the way the nodes are set up on the hubmax to make that doable. I can certainly experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T02:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about the typical four sided hub but in 2 meter size since we have the Clampotron Sr.?
