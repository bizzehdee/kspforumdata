I too am annoyed by the current mode where the menu bar and dock can make an intrusive and unwanted appearance if your mouse strays a pixel or 2 too far. Given the choice, however, of cmd\u002Btab being broken, or having to live with the current behaviour, I\u0027d choose the current behaviour. I.e. correct function of cmd\u002Btab is orders of magnitude more important to me than the irritation here. Ideally, I\u0027d do away with the irritation while keeping cmd\u002Btab functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
