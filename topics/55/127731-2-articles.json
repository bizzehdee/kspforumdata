official MP, and until they are solved, its probably gonna go the way of DMP (not that DMP is that bad, for what its worth it was a very good and successful experiment).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, KSP needs a massive optimization boost if anything more then small scale MP is implemented, and it needs to be extremely well optimized (such that having 100s of flights doesnt put any strain on processor until one of those vessels is actually loaded.\u00A0 The issue is (from DMP experience) is that high part counts become impossible to play online, and crashing is very common with many parts.\u00A0 I dont see how official MP will work unless the bare minimum part count is at least 2000 or so, and that the server is allowed to set a part count cap on all launched vessels (not counting docked together in orbit as thatd ruin stations).\u00A0 Also, i think that many things need to be overhauled when it comes to optimization, resource call spam (10x per frame is a little overkill imo), the very laggy aero/heating (compound the issues that are already pad enough with just physics interactions), ect.\u00A0 Until the game runs well with at least 4x the current part counts, there is no way MP will become very practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo, there needs to be some fair and balanced method of allowing time warp (noone will play without time warp), but not making it unfair or unbalanced.\u00A0 The two major options i think of would be either a sync style system like DMP (with all its issues it does actually work fairly well), or a sort of everyone can warp at will and if any 2 players get within so and so distance of each other they slow down and cant warp until they pass by each other.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sync system is imo the best option, it somewhat lowers the amount of griefing, and you can only interact with someone if synced (and thus it would mean that both sides have to agree to interact with each other or something along those lines).\u00A0 This would work for both combat and peaceful servers, as people couldnt engage in combat unless both sides actually wanted to, stopping cases of that warp in, destroy some poor guy\u0027s station, and warp away, but it isnt the simplest solution.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other option that i feel would work would be allowing everyone to warp at their liesure but slow or disable warp when nearing another player (so that people can interact).\u00A0 This opens up a bit more options for griefers, but i think it could work if done right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other 2 options i thought may work but dismissed would be no warp at all (unless its a purely airplane server), and the whole everyone agrees to warp at the exact same time.\u00A0 For starters, unless its you and a friend, there is no way to get a band of 10 or so players to all agree to warp (unless most are in SPH/VAB).\u00A0 It just wont work, same as mots games that require alot of teamwork devolve into a few people being team players and most running off solo doing whatever they want to and not caring abotu rest.\u00A0 trust me, ive played enough of that style game to say that griefing, solo action, and overall no care for the team is rampant.\u00A0 As for disabling time warp 100%, well you can be sure itll ruin everything but perhaps LKO operations since everything past LKO takes forever and you have to have time warp available to some extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few more things i think are an issue and needs to be adressed, would be stuff like griefing.\u00A0 Every single MP game ive ever player had them to some extent, and while i know good admins can deal with the issue, overall its unavoidable and there will be people who do whatevber they canb to ruin someone else\u0027s day, destroy their hard work (assuming its not a war server where id say it needs to be free-for-all with no rules about attacking others), and overall annoy people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere needs to be a way to lock a certain vessel to a particular player, and i think in this regard the player needs to be able to specify if they allow others to dock to, refuel from, or even use the craft that player launched.\u00A0 Some like to deploy fuel stations, so it cant be just a plain and simple no interacting with other\u0027s work, but i think we should (military servers aside) make it impossible to \u0022pirate\u0022 fuel from another\u0027s craft without their permission.\u00A0 This is especially true of controlling vessels, one annoying aspect of DMP was that you spent all that time making a nice ship, launching it to jool, and circularizing, expecting to return tomorrow, only to find that ship was deorbited or moved into a terrible spot for you (or with fuel gone, bad orbit, ect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel MP would be great, but until the game is heavily optimized and allows part counts in the thousands before any visible lagfest, i feel its better to not even waste time on MP since it just wont work until we get massive part counts available, and arent stuck with subpar performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jm764","CreatedById":99762,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T16:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

I\u0027ve run my server with some fairly old/under powered computers and it runs fine for me and most people involved. Most of the physics is done by the player\u0027s PC for ONLY their currently loaded ship, the server handles the rest. Most lag is caused by multiple people being in the same area with their own ships and the server being unable to process all the commands fast enough for each person. I\u0027ve run my modded ksp game setup just fine on a PC with only an \u003Cstrong\u003EAthlon 64 X2 4600\u002B\u003C/strong\u003E dual core cpu, an on board \u003Cstrong\u003ENvidia GeForce 6150\u003C/strong\u003E gpu and a\u003Cstrong\u003E Geforce GT 210\u003C/strong\u003E gpu card, with \u003Cstrong\u003E4GB of DDR1 RAM, \u003C/strong\u003Ewith out much lag even for large 500\u002B part ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

Ships craft files and assemblies will remain unchanged though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. The same rules apply as warping normally just in reverse. Even if you or someone else turns it off it still functions for everyone including you do to a restriction by the KSP game engine. The only problem is when you make major changes to your ship, kerbal, or someone else\u0027s ship then revert them. This make MAJOR ERRORS in the server save and will make it eventually corrupt beyond repair, thus quick load/save and reverting is almost always banned (but unable to be turned off) or ill advised by the server admins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7.

I expect all clocks to move in lockstep, or I\u0027m entirely uninterested in KSP MP. 2 rockets launch at the same time? There better be 2 launch pads. The simplest statement would be that a 3d person watching a MP session seeing everything at once should be unable to tell it\u0027s MP, past the fact that 2 ships might maneuver at the same time. That\u0027s all I want to see, really.
