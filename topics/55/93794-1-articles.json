So, it\u0027s never too early to start suggesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, the way Kerbals gain EXP is quite generic, and currently repetitive. What if each specific class gained EXP in a different way? Pilots would gain EXP for flight times (Not the afk orbiting time, but only time when you actually burn fuel and turn your rocket), scientists would gain EXP from doing experiments and returning science, and similar. (I\u0027m not sure how to go about Engineers though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could even be EXP as rewards for completing some bigger contracts such as completely exploring a celestial body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, more functions and uses. As of now, only pilots serve a considerably good and somewhat complete role, whereas scientists and especially engineers are quite lacking. Especially on levels 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers for instance, in addition to being able to repair more parts, could even manufacture some simple parts at high levels by breaking apart other parts. Suddenly found yourself in need of an antenna? A good engineer will scrap one of your solar panels, and make one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn experienced engineer in a craft would maximize the efficiency of electricity/fuel usage, reducing total consumption by a percentage. This effect could be stackable for multiple engineers (up to a point, or diminishingly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that glorified day when and if resources come into game, we could have a mining station of sorts on another planet that would produce fuel periodically, whether on a planet or in orbit of a gas giant, but would require one or more level 5 Engineers to operate. The mining facility on the ground would be more efficient, sine you have to actually lift the fuel up from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientists other than granting an extra percentage of science could be used in a similar fashion to engineers on specialized stations on specific places of interest to periodically produce science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a scientist on board would make life support system (if any ever gets added) be more efficient and last longer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain places on some planets that grant huge amounts of prestige and science, and which can only be detected (and researched) by a level 5 scientist surveying the planet in orbit. A level 5 scientist could even detect biomes as someone already suggested somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could lead to science becoming more and more abundant, and there is only so much you can use in the tech tree. So, the game could have some specialized parts that cost science to build every time (Returning the part to Kerbal doesn\u0027t refund the science, but you can use it again), and which would also require a number of high skilled Engineers/scientists/Pilots, or a combination of those. These parts could be anything like more efficient engines and fuel cells, solar panels, wings and fuselages for space-planes, or some brand new parts with completely new functions. Such as the aforementioned mining facilities/satellites. (and for those of you who like that sort of thing, warp engines and stargates, though I doubt that will ever happen. Though, a terraforming device for a planet to make it habitable and thus make it able to host another space center there would be awesome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t given much thought to Pilots, because it would be hard to make them more useful without turning them into MechJeb. I don\u0027t mind people who use it, but I despise it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T02:27:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds pretty cool. The engineers part looks kind of difficult to implement. I also think that with new features in the game, new habilities will pop-up (maybe engineers would give you bonuses when mining up resources, which will be implemented on the next update). I think that they have bigger plans for this, but they just imploemented the platform where to build onto...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T03:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, it does look just like a proof of concept, and I know it will be made into bigger stuff.
