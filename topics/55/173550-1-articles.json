I\u0027ve gotten some ideas and thoughts that I would like to put out there for the community and Squad to consider. I\u0027ll separate my ideas into two categories, patches and future DLC. Alright, so let\u0027s get to it:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst, the patches:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBase game patches/updates:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Spaceplanes and shuttles: I love planes, and I love space shuttles. I know we can make a somewhat shuttle-like craft in KSP Now, but I would like it if Squad added an actual Stock Space Shuttle to the game, maybe even their own version. We have the wings and the fuselage and the engines, but we\u0027re missing the EFT and the SRBs to go with it. These are the main two parts I would like. Further more, I think a stock Dreamchaser or some other tiny shuttle would be nice for crew transportation.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-New Parts and Part revamps: Since 1.4 and making history, I\u0027ve found that the 1m and 3m parts don\u0027t fit into the new style. They\u0027re the old style. I have no doubt that this will be addressed in future patches already, but I would just like to put it out there. As for new parts, I think Squad either forgot or didn\u0027t think of doing a Saturn third stage. The current 3 meter parts are not cutting it visually in my opinion. The full tank is too long, and the half tank is too short. I think we need either a new 3m tank, or I would like to see a 3m to 2m part so we can do that tapered engine mount that the actual third stage has. This part could have some tank attached to the top of it so it makes the half tank longer by extension.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Station parts: We\u0027re lacking in this department severely in my opinion. The last major station part we got was the science lab I believe. Other than that, we have the 4 Kerbal cabin, the cupola, and maybe the plane parts to make habitable parts of space stations. Other parts have to be fuel tanks, or multiple part jerry rigged pieces.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-SLS parts revamp: Now that we have 5m parts, maybe Squad can go back and revamp the SLS, make it actual size. Maybe even add the ability to make the ICPS and the Cargo variant.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaking History patches/updates:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Mercury parts and revamp: Mercury LAS/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E, tiny \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, 1.5 stage part, do I need to say more? Alright, I will to clarify my position. We can make a some what Mercury-Atlas rocket, but we\u0027re missing the 1.5 stageing part. The part with the two engines that falls away? Yeah, that. Also, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters are big on the Mercury, even the solo port one. A tiny \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster would be nice. As for Mercury LAS/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E, I think a new parachute would be in order, a flat inline one, or a revamp of the current tiny parachute. Just the model, not the chute itself. Maybe make it more rounded and add a node on top of it so that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E can go over the chute? Just an idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Gemini and Titan parts: The \u0022Service module\u0022 for the gemini is nothing like the real one, I know why it isn\u0027t tapered, but still. Also, I think the Titan parts might be a little too small, or Gemini is too big. Gemini\u0027s service module is supposed to flare out wide to meet the TItan Rocket isn\u0027t it? Just something that been nagging at me. I\u0027m still loving that we can make Gemini though, don\u0027t get me wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Saturn V missing parts: I mentioned one thing above, but I\u0027ll go ahead and include it here too. Stage III. An actual Stage III part or parts would be great. Also, the S-IVB\u0027s thruster pack, that would be good too. 3m avionics ring/probe core. Saturn V style launch clamps. Saturn V crew module \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E shroud. Speaking of shrouds, textured shrouds with the black and white checker theme, and the stripes. And could we get a way to make shrouds change sizes at the base and or top? So like, if I put a 2m engine on a 3 meter part, the top of the shroud can be set to 3m, and if I attach a 5m decoupler, the bottom can be set to 5m. Just an idea.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Saturn I parts: First stage, fore mentioned S-IVB, and the engines to go with it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDLC/Update Ideas:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaking History Part II - So, we got Saturn V and R7 rocket. Yay! For part II, maybe we could get Mir station parts? Skylab? Soyuz? Please?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaking History Part III - After Part II, I think ISS would be the next step. A whole DLC/Update dedicated to the station, kerablizing all the parts for KSP.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaking History Part IV - SpaceX Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, ULA Vulkan(Probably soon to be name changed due to copyright issues from what I\u0027ve heard), the new Russian Rocket Angara, New Glenn rocket parts\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nForgotten History - A pack dedicated to the brave rockets that never saw the light of day or were abandoned. Saturn Nova, N1, Ares Rocket Family, Jupiter Rocket Family,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace for Rent - A pack dedicated to space station parts and interplanetary habitats\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFarwell Kerbol - An official Squad Planet pack, featuring one or two new solar systems, and interstellar vehicles to get there. And maybe in add a black hole and make it the center of the game, and have Kerbol orbit it as well as the other solar systems?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMultiplayer - I know, I know, I know, stop yelling at your screen. You\u0027re going to wake your neighbors. I know the problems with multiplayer. Time warp. Take it out right? Well, now it takes you actual real world months to get anywhere. Part limit, \u0022I\u0027m giffen \u0027er all she\u0027s got capin, she can\u0027t take no more!\u0022 it a phrase that explains your CPU when you hit 100 parts on screen right? Well, I know these problems exist, and that a new engine would probably be needed in order for them to be overcome, mainly for the part limit, but I still would like to suggest this.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Honey, come meet the neighbors\u0022 - AH! Giant Peach skin men! AH! Blue cat kerbals! AH! These gas prices are too high! Okay, I\u0027ve had my fun. But seriously, different species in KSP. Maybe even make them playable?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAsteroids, comets, and meteors, oh my - An update to interstellar debris basically, while adding say maybe comets? Maybe even a locked in one? Haley\u0027s Comet anyone? By the way, how many drills does it take to get to the center of a comet? Oh! One more thing for this one, asteroid brake up. I know, probably hard, but why not make it procedural break up? Or maybe the asteroid can shrink during reentry and tiny asteroids spawn next to it?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWeather - \u0022Are we tipping over?\u0022 - Jeb \u0022Are they tipping over?\u0022 - Mission Control. Wind, rain, lightning, thunder! Maybe a tornado or two.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n====================================\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s all I can think of for right now. I know it\u0027s a lot, but I had a lot on my mind. Feel free to comment, critique, or even expand on the ideas I have given.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldForest","CreatedById":77770,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-09T04:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m adding this post because I thought of a way to make multiplayer work in KSP I think.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nInstances.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically, two types of instances will exist inside the server:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Server side\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Client Side\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nServer side instance is permanent and can not be time warped in anyway shape or form. It\u0027s static.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nClient side instances are flexible, and there\u0027s an instance per client. So Client A could be in instance number 4 and Client B could be in instance number 6. They will not see each other, not can they interact with each other, unless they sync with Server instance, then the client A and B will be in the same instance. Also, any updates to the client instance effect the Server instance. For example, let\u0027s say there\u0027s a space station in orbit, and Client A adds a module to it. The station is in Server instance, but because it\u0027s being interacted on by the client instance, the server instance will update and pull the new station part into the server instance, and then will update all client instances. Another feature of the client Instance would be Time warp. \u0022But you said there\u0027s no time warp.\u0022 This might get confusing. Okay, let\u0027s say Client A sends a rocket to Duna. Client A will time warp inside Instance 4, and will not effect any other instance, nor the server instance. When he gets to Duna, and comes out of time warp. Let\u0027s say his friend, client B is who he is meeting there. Client B is inside the Server instance, but Client A is not. All client A has to do is sync with Server instance .The Server will detect he is at Duna and pop him in the same spot he was in his own instance into it\u0027s own instance. \u0022What if client A decides to time warp again?\u0022 They will be kicked out of the server instance and back into Instance 4.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s my idea for how Multiplayer could work.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother feature for these would be that Client A could invite Client B into their own instance and they could do stuff in that, but time warp would be controlled by the host client. So Client A time warps for both themselves and Client B.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-09T05:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223346630\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523006864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/6/2018 at 5:27 AM, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to comment, critique, or even expand on the ideas I have given.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell since you asked so nicely, I\u0027ll have a go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223346630\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523006864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/6/2018 at 5:27 AM, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut we\u0027re missing the EFT and the SRBs to go with it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can make those though.

So Client A could be in instance number 4 and Client B could be in instance number 6. They will not see each other, not can they interact with each other, unless they sync with Server instance, then the client A and B will be in the same instance. Also, any updates to the client instance effect the Server instance. For example, let\u0027s say there\u0027s a space station in orbit, and Client A adds a module to it. The station is in Server instance, but because it\u0027s being interacted on by the client instance, the server instance will update and pull the new station part into the server instance, and then will update all client instances. Another feature of the client Instance would be Time warp. \u0022But you said there\u0027s no time warp.\u0022 This might get confusing. Okay, let\u0027s say Client A sends a rocket to Duna. Client A will time warp inside Instance 4, and will not effect any other instance, nor the server instance. When he gets to Duna, and comes out of time warp. Let\u0027s say his friend, client B is who he is meeting there. Client B is inside the Server instance, but Client A is not. All client A has to do is sync with Server instance .The Server will detect he is at Duna and pop him in the same spot he was in his own instance into it\u0027s own instance. \u0022What if client A decides to time warp again?\u0022 They will be kicked out of the server instance and back into Instance 4.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat\u0027s my idea for how Multiplayer could work.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst - for your station module thing. We assume A adds a module to a station in his own instance, call it Universe-A. So in Universe-A, we have the station with a new module. Now, assume B does the same thing in Universe-B, adding a module \u003Cstrong\u003Eto the same docking port\u003C/strong\u003E. Both then sync with the Master universe (lets call it MasterUni). Now, on the server side thing \u003Cstrong\u003Ewe have two modules occupying the same docking port.\u003C/strong\u003E How is this resolved? You have a paradox. Yes shush, I know you say it auto updates once it docks or something, BUT what if B was almost docking and then it suddenly updated, killing his module? You have a problem there then... ALSO, how does timewarp factor into this? Like if B was in his own instance as you say, right? and then comes to the station to dock, but then A docks before hand or afterwards in his own misaligned instance?

They don\u0027t really have a purpose other than for the science labs or refueling or looking pretty. This is also common in the rest of space - not much to do once you\u0027re there. For the time being then I think its okay. I can make a perfectly reasonable space station without complaining too much. But yes, new parts would be nice\u003Cu\u003E if they had a point.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I do agree they had little to no point, but I believe if you make it have a point, then it will have a point. I have a few ideas for stations. In Career mode, they can make it to where a Kerbal earns experience for every day they are in space. And so it can\u0027t be farmed or abused, make them earn less and less experience per day. Then when they return to Kerbin, they get a slight multiplier maybe for how long they were up there, to a certain day or percentage. Another feature for Career mode is that stations generate science per day, again with limitations and restrictions so it can\u0027t be abused. They could\u00A0 add special station parts, say a organic lab or a botany lab that you have to maintain to keep the science going, and if the plants or germ cultures die, then you have to send up new ones aboard a rocket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, qzgy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy though?
