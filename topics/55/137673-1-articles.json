Normally we ignore collisions between parts on the same vessel to avoid this, but this is not possible with Unity 5 wheel colliders for the moment, for some complex reasons that I will not bore you with. The wheel collider itself is not always in the same position as the mesh you see due to suspension, among other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring prerelease we made this clipping check as small as possible without these issues re-surfacing. The size and position of the check are actually configurable in your settings.cfg, just search through there for \u0022clip\u0022 and set the range to zero if you want to disable this feature. The choice is yours, but I highly encourage you not to do this. The best way to avoid this situation is to place your wheels further away from your craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-22T11:56:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2016 11:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arsonide\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zwolff","CreatedById":58616,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T14:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just ran into the same issue.
