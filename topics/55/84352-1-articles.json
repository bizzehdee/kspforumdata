Camera parts would of course be in the science tab and when used on missions, it rewards science points. They\u0027d be most useful in the earlier stages of a career, where you don\u0027t have the necessary resources to send manned missions to other worlds and have to rely on probes/rovers to get to Duna and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T13:00:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums, Tebok. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve moved the thread to the more appropriate Suggestions section.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ximrm","CreatedById":111063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T13:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewe have a few mods that have camera parts and some that reward with science, also telescopes. but implementing it into the stock game for early stages is a really good idea.
