In addition, some suggestions are small and should be easy to implement, while others could require wholesale rewriting of the whole game.

If they could do science tasks on the surface, and instead of the current, land, plant flag, EVA report, surface sample, DONE---in only slightly more time than it took me to type that---then the collection science might take a while. You EVA, and can control a guy, meanwhile the other climbs down and starts setting up experiments, takes samples, etc. Doesn\u0027t have to be fancy, it can be fairly scripted. If there are certain experiments on the side of the lander, the AI goes to them, fiddles, some might be removed, and placed on the ground, etc. New experiments could be added just for something to do for the AI. Set it up such that 2 do work faster, and collect more science. Lower the \u0022instant\u0022 science, and extend it over time.
