Maybe an update could be dedicated to reworking the UI to look more \u0022modern\u0022 and less \u0022placeholder\u0022. Personally, I like flat UIs, so we could have a loading screen like modern video games (ex. Logo of Squad fades in/out, Animated logo of KSP, Loading wheel at bottom right of corner with images of game), then perhaps tweak the UI to be less skeuomorphic and more UI-like. If you want to keep the current \u0022shiny\u0022 UI, then a reworking would still be in order for the UI to make it somewhat more pollished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rainbowtrout","CreatedById":60253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T10:08:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wish there was a \u0022general polish\u0022 update, where small things only would be added.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.
