There have been many times when I\u0027ve tried to left-click on the AP or PE and kept getting the option to make a node instead. (And plenty of times when I\u0027ve tried to make a node, but couldn\u0027t for various reasons, but that\u0027s something for another post I supposed.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Squad, if you could make the right-click on the AP and PE do what the Left-Click does right now, I would be elated and think that was awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
