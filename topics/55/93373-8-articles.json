KSP is not a high-fidelity simulator, but it simulates enough (IMHO) to be a useful tool in teaching concepts of orbital mechanics. Particularly at the \u0022rough feel for\u0022 level. A typical example would be rendezvous, and the fact that to go West in a typical orbit to rendezvous, you\u0027d in fact thrust the other direction so that you\u0027d raise your orbit, and the trailing craft catches up. This is the sort of counterintuitive thing (to lay people) that becomes completely internalized in a KSP player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don;t have a problem with a \u0022tier 0 facility, and honestly, I\u0027d not even mind a barn if the career mode was good enough to have it make sense. I can easily come up with a career that would have that make sense. Raze the tech tree, and science systems and redo everything. Have multiple career start points possible, from national space program to Goddard in a shack in New Mexico, to Blue Origin or SpaceX style facilities, to Jeb in a barn (never to become the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E we see, that\u0027s too NASA for that starting point). Your choice of starting point would select the building styles, and indeed the sorts of tech available. A barn start might be from large model rockets, to sounding rockets, and up from there.

The former make a game for gamers and the latter make what I will call a virtual-model for virtual-modellers. I enjoy modelling and gaming, but in my life I have more opportunity to game than to model simply because it takes less commitment and rewards me faster, even if that reward is 99% gratuitous explosions. Barn-KSP is more convenient to do than NASA-lite-KSP, which makes it more accessible and more cheap thrills-y, but NASA-lite KSP is what the real fans really want to graduate to, myself included. Net-KSP is a confused mess with both ends criticising the middle for having too much of the wrong stuff, yet somehow still succeeds and keeps everybody interested enough to keep playing and define and refine their own experience. Perhaps in future we\u0027ll see expansions that spur off in both directions, and then everyone will be happy (except the people who don\u0027t want paid DLC... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: Wow, I was wondering what my 2000th post would be. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EI\u0027m a little bit proud of this one. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure where to start here. The assertion that amateurish whimsy, trial and error and garden shed contraptions make a\u00A0\u0027game for gamers\u0027 is a sweeping generalisation and a patronising one to boot. On the other hand it clearly marks me as not being a gamer, which I\u0027m not going to lose any sleep over. Then the implication that all that whimsy and trial and error equates to a Barn-KSP, which is therefore more accessible and cheap-thrillsy is, I think flat out wrong. Finally the statement that \u0027real fans\u0027 (which should be a red warning light in any discussion) prefer a NASA-lite KSP manages to be vague (what is NASA-lite?), patronising (implying that you\u0027re not a \u0027real fan\u0027 unless you prefer NASA-lite) and insulting. (gamers can\u0027t be \u0027real fans\u0027 since Barn-KSP - with attendant cheap-thrills - \u00A0is for gamers and only\u00A0NASA-lite KSP is for \u0027real fans\u0027) in a single sentence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime for my own sweeping assertion then. Trial and error is tedious, a waste of gamers\u0027 (\u0027real gamers\u0027 or otherwise) time,\u00A0symptomatic of poor game design, and has no place outside of 5 minute Flash games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDirected\u003C/em\u003E trial and error on the other hand is absolutely fine and strikes a happy medium between trial and error and calculated perfection. I might not care about calculating the precise delta-V for a Munshot down to the last metre per second before I let my professionally specified, precision engineered rocket anywhere near the launch pad. However, if my last\u00A0flight ended in an unplanned crater because I ran out of fuel 2km above the Mun then I\u0027d really quite like to have some in-game\u00A0way of telling that the good ship \u003Cem\u003EWhimsical Trial and Error Mk2\u003C/em\u003E is an actual improvement over the previous version, that might get me a bit closer to my eventual goal of getting to the Mun and back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf KSP did a better job of directed trial and error it would do a perfectly fine job of both taking less commitment and providing increased player rewards. 99% gratuitous explosions are not required or desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-26T18:50:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2017 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-26T19:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223034484\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002293373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493156501\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re basically arguing against a point I never made or implied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seem to have mistaken my commentary and conversation for argument.

And how many gamers simply get stuck\u00A0with the comedy exploding rockets\u00A0- they find KSP too hard and aren\u0027t so invested in it that they want to spend the time digging around on the internet for all the tips, how-to videos and mods that open up the rest of the game for them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s the former, then yeah, regardless of what\u00A0the more serious minded players might think, KSP is probably about right as it is, or at least there\u0027s not such an incentive for Squad to change the core gameplay much. If it\u0027s the latter, then I think it\u0027s a real shame that a handful of Barn-KSP design decisions are blocking players from experiencing all that KSP has to offer, especially when I don\u0027t think it would take a great deal to remove some of those blocks. I\u0027ve said it before and I\u0027ll happily say it again\u00A0- the Map Screen is a fantastic bit of game design - it\u0027s a pity that those same design principles aren\u0027t applied elsewhere in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter all - unless KSP takes a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0violent swerve over to the NASA-KSP side, then quirky rockets are always going to be there for those that want them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223035660\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002293373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493237916\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002270807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 minutes ago, regex said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was apparently going to be an easier task once certain changes had been made to the code that handles the craft overall\u00A0but then NathanKell, the person who had made such comments and was dreading the task of programming said delta-V calculator,\u00A0left the team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I know I\u0027ve made (part of) that argument before and I\u0027d like to point our that it\u0027s not about the difficulty of actual writing a delta-V calculator, it\u0027s about the difficulty of\u00A0debugging the calculator in production code, which is totally different than immediately-releasable mod code.

Now it\u0027s possible players could\u0027ve mistaken this as an upcoming building seeing as career mode was being introduced at the time and new assets were being added such as the new space center. So it\u0027s fair to assume that players may have thought it was a lower tier building. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time players mistook content from a video and thought it meant new content when in reality it did not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving covered my basis of where Jeb\u0027s \u0022barn\u0022 came from; now I\u0027m left with the question of how it fits into the field of view of those who play KSP more seriously than those who intentionally crash their rockets to see the explosions. I\u0027ve been seeing a lot of commotion between the old cartoony, silly style that KSP has had and attempting to get rid of it in place of something else (that\u0027s at least what I read, may be wrong) that\u0027s more serious. However I think that the style should remain, noting that it isn\u0027t the \u003Cem\u003Esole\u003C/em\u003E style of KSP. Thankfully for us, KSP lacks any sort of lore or fixed story so Squad can change the style or feel to KSP at any time. As such, KSP is both a silly explosionfest and a scientifically rich adventure. I see it having all traits all equally. It\u0027s both silly, but yet focused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I frequent Twitch livestreamers, I see a verity of players ranging from those with thousands of ingame hours to those who have less than ten minutes in the game. I find it hard to pin KSP as any one play style. The nature of the game depends on the one who\u0027s flying the crafts. Are they intending to go on a grand tour of all of Kerbol\u0027s planets or are they intending to crash into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E? Is Scott Manley flying? Or Markiplier? It\u0027s hard to watch both of those people play KSP and try to say that between both of them that there\u0027s one style that would work for both as far as realism vs silliness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, the barn aesthetic comes up to it being fitting within the theme of the Kerbals. Seeing as the path in KSP had rockets before wings; wings before wheels, and wheels before electricity- it\u0027s clear that KSP does not follow realistic standards as far as development, however that does not mean that it can\u0027t adjust. As such, I think that starting with the barn is acceptable as it start\u0027s with the silly aesthetic that newer players will know, and then slowly adjust to the serious and realistic style that others would like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother topic I saw discussed was whether or not the barn would be good enough quality to belong with the rest of the game and for this, I must agree with what someone else said earlier in that whatever style or look they go for- it should be one that they put the best effort and quality into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are my 8-bits worth of thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-27T03:48:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2017 03:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-27T04:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172792-benjamin-kerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022172792\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/172792-benjamin-kerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Benjamin Kerman\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0the problem with \u0022found by the side of the road\u0022 style parts is even if you accept them for early game these parts still need to be able to be used late game and there isn\u0027t really any faith that squad would implement a system to upgrade the appearance and description of early game parts as you progress so rocket parts need to be designed with all phases of play in mind, or in other words kerbals don\u0027t fly trash thier passion for space flight is to great to allow themselves to fly substandard equipment even when operating out of trailers tents and barns.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow with facilities there is a bit more wiggle room design wise because squad implemented and bothers to utilize an upgrade system for them so even if you start out of a barn surrounded by a collection of temporary shelters and that isn\u0027t to your taste you can eventually upgrade away from that (though this is no excuse for shoddy art on squads end production quality standards must be upheld in order to make design choices tolerable for those who disagree with those choices)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103726-zoonamedgames/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022103726\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/103726-zoonamedgames/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ZooNamedGames\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0calling it \u0022serious\u0022 is poor phrasing it\u0027s not so much that people want the art to be hyper realistic but instead that people want squad to take making the art seriously.
