The craft uses 4 TVR-1180C MK1 Stack Tri-Couplers to mount 4 clusters of 3 Nerv Atomic Engines, but before it got to the atomic burn stage, the tri-couplers exploded. According to the flight event log, the exhaust from the previous stage engines was heating them, they hit 2000 K, and promptly exploded. This set the rocket into a three-axis spin, and it eventually disintegrated. I reverted back to the assembly building, obviously. I think I\u0027ve managed to fix the problem, by putting radiators as close to the tri-couplers as possible, but you can\u0027t actually attach anything to the upper surface of said couplers. That is a rather inconvenient program decision. You can\u0027t even attach struts to them. This should be amended in the next KSP update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T18:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it\u0027s always very annoying not be able to surface attach stuff on the adapters.

Especially massive structural components like that (fairing base are another big offender in this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can eventually figure out a way to circumvent the problem, but it makes no Kerbal-sense at all that I can\u0027t duct-tape stuff at arbitrary angles on anything that strikes my fancy. That should be my choice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
