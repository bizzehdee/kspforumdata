In the VAB/SPH you have loads of groups and even a customizable folder (favourits) to drop your parts in. For the Tracking station a simple Folder system would be awesome, even just one hierarchy would be awesome. At least the ability to sort flights by name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m aware of the fact that you can hide or show vessels by type (lander, base, station etc.) but I\u0027m now approaching 50 active missions and I find myself wasting a lot of time searching for specific flights or the most recent one that is about to enter a sphere of influence etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried my best to make an example picture of what I mean plz don\u0027t laugh at my awful GIMP-Skills:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ksp-suggestion.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://img5.picload.org/image/rgddallp/ksp-suggestion.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think? Little explanation: I didnt\u0027 add a button to toggle the folder view or a button to add new folders but I hope you still get the idea. Could be a rightclick menu also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow the dotted line would be the missions that are not assigned to any group/folder (whatever you wanna call it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a nice day everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-21T23:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2016 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Broco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EPicture didn\u0026#039;t work\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbalstar","CreatedById":154159,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T23:48:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes and yes.
