I like it. With that in mind - it would be interesting and useful as well as instructive to have the research center in the sandbox mode active where one could click on the technologies one wants and according have those parts available for use in building. One could then build a ship based on the technology/science one has chosen. Perhaps build ships according to different tiers etc. If one has built a rocket/lander/probe that has non selected parts then that ship would not be loadable from the assembling buildings (as it now done). One could then select the different technology advancements and tree line(s) that would allow that ship model to be used/built. Do you think that would be a good use for the research center in the sandbox mode? Perhaps required science points could be listed to achieve that selected line of technology on the technology tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBJQ\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: \u003Cem\u003EAnother idea I am thinking about (career mode): Using the research center to keep track of amount of science points (or percent) obtained from the different areas where points can be obtained from. Perhaps once visited that area wold show up with science points (or % of points) obtained from it. Is the idea viable - usable ??? \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leatherneck","CreatedById":77501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T18:00:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI see no reason at present for the Sandbox mode to not be exactly lake Career mode, only starting with tech tree all open.
