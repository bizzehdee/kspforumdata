My suggestion is that there could be two kinds of contracts: selling \u0026amp; renting out facilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a sales contract, instead of launching a new facility to meet these contracts, a player just needs to select a facility that meets the requirements and assign it to the agency in exchange for one-time cash. After assigning the facility, the player no longer has control over it. After a period of time (5-10 years or so) the owner will self-destruct the facility or perhaps offer to sell it back to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a rental contract, the player can assign the facility to an agency for a recurring rate. There is \u003Cem\u003Eno advance\u003C/em\u003E for rental contracts and they\u0027ll only appear if you already have a desired facility in place. Rental demand depends in part on completing high-profile missions so you can\u0027t just rent out a place and fast-forward 100 years for lots of money -- your tenant will move out if they don\u0027t trust that your program is active. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor balance, the more facilities owned by other agencies near a body reduce rental demand. So you have a choice between building contract facilities for one-time cash infusions or spending your own money to try to develop valuable real estate to draw rent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
