I know that it is simpler to do, but I always put extra liable space on my long-duration ships so that my crew has some recreational space and whatnot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow amount, for long duration missions, Kerbals would require a certain amount of livable space on their ships. The longer the missions, the more space they require. Here are a few examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For Mun missions, each Kerbal would only take up one crew slot. So a Mk1-2 command pod would be enough to send three Kerbals to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As missions get longer, Kerbals gradually require more space, Lets say that for a Minmus mission, each Kerbal takes up 1.5 crew slots, so a MK1-2 pod with a 2 seat lander would be enough for a 3 Kerbal Minmus mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The maximum amount would be where one Kerbal takes up 2 crew slots. This would be on interplanetary missions and other long-duration missions like stations or bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If Kerbals are kept in tight conditions (i.e. 3 Kerbals in a Mk1-2 pod to Jool) they become less effective.

Even if something like kerbal mental health doesn\u0027t become a feature, it would still help with immersion and those more realistic players would have a but more to do if Kerbals had more than just the hitchhiker pod to relax in. One thing that always bugged me about crewable parts until now is that kerbals always seem to need to be sitting down in something. In fact, it always seems like they\u0027re sitting in a command chair, even in cases where a command chair doesn\u0027t make sense!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that bothers me is the lack of horizontally oriented IVA views. If someone wants to make a surface base, pretty much their only option is to land the habitat on its round bottom, which makes it more difficult to integrate into modularly designed bases. You *could* just land the hitchhiker on its side, but then the kerbals would be either sideways or upside down, which really screws with my immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is already a mod for this.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739-1-0-0-WIP-PLUGIN-0-4-1-1-27-04-2015-KeepFit-Kerbal-fitness-degradation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739-1-0-0-WIP-PLUGIN-0-4-1-1-27-04-2015-KeepFit-Kerbal-fitness-degradation\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in Roverdude\u0027s MKS/OKS an industrial effciency depends on workspace and habitat space per head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it\u0027s a great mod, but is it too much to ask to have something like this in stock as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is already a mod for this.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739-1-0-0-WIP-PLUGIN-0-4-1-1-27-04-2015-KeepFit-Kerbal-fitness-degradation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67739-1-0-0-WIP-PLUGIN-0-4-1-1-27-04-2015-KeepFit-Kerbal-fitness-degradation\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, in Roverdude\u0027s MKS/OKS an industrial effciency depends on workspace and habitat space per head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 is not the answer to everything\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Octa","CreatedById":140058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FishInferno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FishInferno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 is not the answer to everything\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, it is, because that\u0027s not a very important scope of the game.

In 0.9 my Eve mission had... 6 Kerbals I think (to be a Remote Tech command module), but the ship was a small lander can (for Gilly), a large lander can, a lab, and two of the 4-Kerbal aircraft parts. My Role Playing was one aircraft part was the sleeping quarters, the other the living quarters and the lab and large lander can were work/engineering/command spaces. Of course it was uncomfortable to IVA in either the living or sleeping quarters because they\u0027re configured like an airline. Exactly the same fundamental problem as the hitchhiker if you want to put it sideways on a ground-station, the IVA does not look very comfortable at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in theory I would love some mechanic to encourage proper living arrangements, if for no other reason to pat myself on the back that I\u0027m doing it \u0022right\u0022. But I can\u0027t imagine it becoming stock (not that I have a good prediction history) for the reasons people have pointed out - basically easy things (Mun trips) would stay easy and it would make hard things (Jool trips) harder without much rewarding game mechanics. Then again, the building upgrade system basically took all the features we were used to and limited them - plus, as has been mentioned other places, it\u0027s a little counter-intuitive that at the beginning of the game when you presumably need the most help plotting courses you get the least assistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m totally on board with the spirit of your suggestion.
