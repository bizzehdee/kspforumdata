It\u0027s up to the player to decide whether the reward is worth the price-- that is, to decide whether taking the contract is worthwhile. That freedom of choice is important, and is what makes contracts fun: the player gets to decide. That\u0027s what KSP is all about: player choice. And for the player to be able to make an informed choice, the contract needs to be fully informative about both the price and the reward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that you get to keep the rescued kerbal is a big part of the reward for rescue contracts. I\u0027d go so far as to call it the biggest and most important part; certainly those contracts don\u0027t pay a lot of cash, nor do they give any science. But a kerbal is only as valuable as the player\u0027s need for a particular profession.
