Vernor engines are already overpowered, as they not only proide a VERY high thrust with an insane efficiency, but they lack the need of a different fuel, meaning no headaches when counting \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV, and no additional micromanagement.

In real life, RCS engines are the only accurate enough engines for orbital rendzevous\u0026amp;attitude control.
