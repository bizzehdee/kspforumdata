We certainly did talk about it, that second link is from last summer. Squads gotta know.\n\nI haven\u0027t seen anything at all from squad about this. Some questions to consider: Where would you put that picture? More importanly: How helpful would this **actually** be, since a) you only go to the Mission Control once to grab a contract, and ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) you can always refer back to the part name in the contracts tab?\n\nSQUADs eventual answer may be/possibly is, \u0022we highlighted the part for you\u0022\n\nEDIT: Looking at the other threads about this, I wonder if what we really want is a brief description of the part. eg, \u0022This is an engine, a structural part, a science part\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T06:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 06:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jlo96**"}]}
