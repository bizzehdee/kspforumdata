However, I think that long-term experiments are still a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, getting science is as simple as going somewhere. If you can make an SRB-powered ship that goes straight up, it will be able to collect ALL of the Kerbin Space biomes, even though it will linger in that area for merely a few minutes to an hour. I think that there should be experiments that don\u0027t require you to be at the helm of the ship to collect the science, and you just have it automatically feed back the data for a constant power drain. The science would, over time, slowly stop being produced, it would taper off. An example might be monitoring a Kerbal\u0027s life-signs in orbit for extended periods, or seeing how a material reacts under space radiation for long amounts of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea is that of mapping and scanning planets. If you bring a satellite with a camera and you take a picture, it\u0027s worth some science. If you have a mapping camera that continually generates a map and each new area of the ground that is scanned gives more science, you can automatically get science, and because you eventually run out of things to look at, the science tapers off. This doubles as a tool for mapping planets. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59042-Painting-the-map%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERead more of painting the map for science here.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T03:00:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment rewarding the player for putting their one science probe in orbit, hitting timewarping, and going to make a sandwich doesn\u0027t seem like a very good idea.
