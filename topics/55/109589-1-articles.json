Just a couple different launch sites besides the KSC, and a few runways or landing sites would be nice. Of course you would have to build the new sites and level them up just like you do now with the KSC, but since it is just a runway or launch site, their costs would be relatively low, and could also make it that you cannot unlock the other launch sites and runways until once you hit a certain rep level."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T11:16:25Z","Content":"I would also like to see this. They\u0027d make good optional objectives for tourism missions - instead of recovering Joe Kerbal\u0027s vessel anywhere on Kerbin, you get paid extra if you land at the New Kerba City runway after reentry after your last task is completed (at which point Joe Kerbal is removed from the ship rather than waiting for the ship to be recovered)."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T11:21:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I would prefer some kind of \u0022recovery site\u0022 on sea, because most of early carrier rockets are going to be multistage.\n\u003E We should have \u0022srb splashdown\u0022 site with 100% refund.

If you can get them to splash down without being destroyed, you currently get a high % recovery for SRBs from a normal KSC eastwards launch. Less than 100% is ok, as you wouldn\u0027t be just filling them back up with solid fuel and slapping them on a new rocket.\n\nI do agree with adding other runways. Groom Lake would be my first choice, it just seems more fun and highly appropriate when we\u0027re dealing with little green men, but would also have a slightly challenging element if topography was similar to the real world, due to surrounding mountains. Vandenberg and Edwards are the other obvious cases, and it might be both interesting and useful to have Vandenberg\u0027s alternate launch site as well. Recovery % from these alternate sites would be much higher than landing on a random bit of grass a similar distance from KSC. It does make sense to me that they should be purchasable and upgradeable sites, similar to the KSC facilities upgrades system.\n\nIn terms of practical implementation, it\u0027s probably much easier if they are fixed, pre-determined locations, rather than arbitrary user-chosen locations. I.e. a standard selection of sites that you can choose to purchase, eliminating the problems with trying to dynamically place a runway on any arbitrary bit of terrain."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T11:43:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is section with suggestions for new features in stock game not mod advertising section ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBOOHOO!\n\nYukon is 100% correct mentioning Kerbinside as it does exactly what the OP asks for.
