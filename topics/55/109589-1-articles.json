If you can get them to splash down without being destroyed, you currently get a high % recovery for SRBs from a normal KSC eastwards launch.

Groom Lake would be my first choice, it just seems more fun and highly appropriate when we\u0027re dealing with little green men, but would also have a slightly challenging element if topography was similar to the real world, due to surrounding mountains. Vandenberg and Edwards are the other obvious cases, and it might be both interesting and useful to have Vandenberg\u0027s alternate launch site as well. Recovery % from these alternate sites would be much higher than landing on a random bit of grass a similar distance from KSC. It does make sense to me that they should be purchasable and upgradeable sites, similar to the KSC facilities upgrades system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of practical implementation, it\u0027s probably much easier if they are fixed, pre-determined locations, rather than arbitrary user-chosen locations.
