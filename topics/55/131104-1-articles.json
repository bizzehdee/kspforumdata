To explore them and gather science must use rovers. Also that adds another good reason to use lights and fuel cells, because there are permanent darkness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make caves nice and interesting for exploring, they should be new mini biomes. Inside caves could be crystals or other objects of interests, maybe eastern eggs.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Since each cave are new biome should bring all science equipment on rover. No real reason to fly in using EVA mono propellant \u00A0or trying to hover in with rocket (very hard thing to do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso they shouldn\u0027t be a lot maybe 10 per planet, but there have to be a way to easy find them.

Someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but I\u0027m pretty sure the surface is created by adjusting values that correspond to the distance from either the center of the planet or the surface of the sphere that is the basis for the planet. Either way, making caves might not be possible because of the difficulties in having more than one point on the line from the center to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T06:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt the current engine would support caves where the \u0022ground\u0022 curves to be basically on top of each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAren\u0027t rovers already useful for Specialized contracts where you need to gather information in a small area all on land?
