Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. There have been a few threads about this but I really do hope the next DLC is about planetary exploration. Part of the trick of it is the scale of these worlds and just how many surface features you\u0027d want to populate them with. It seems like there could be one set of ground scatter\u00A0surface features\u00A0like ice crystals and geological formations that could be spread somewhat thickly in some biomes, perhaps 1-5km apart on average so that no matter where you landed you\u0027d be a quick hop or rover\u0027s drive away. Other\u00A0more valuable sites like geysers, volcanoes, fossils, etc could be much less common, just a few to several per world, and would be more in the category of the anomalies we already have. These would require being mapped and the player executing a precision landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main question for me is how do these actually become a part of the gameplay and not just eye-candy for someone lucky enough to find them. The first part is mapping. I like kerbnet, especially when it comes to landing maneuvers, but Im just not looking at the window\u00A0often enough to spot those question marks consistently. The probes already have a probability of discovery, so I\u0027d love an option to automatically mark rare anomalies and surface features with waypoints when they come into range of an active flight. That way your probe with the survey scanner could slowly map for anomalies in the background. With this and a low-res biome overlay in map mode players would have the tools to plan landing sites ahead of time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe main thing is\u00A0they really need to be worth something--bonuses to science and/or rep--so players are incentivized to seek them out, bring rovers, and precision land. It could be that the more common ground-scatter level surface features could simply yield an additional surface sample worth 50% more or so. Collecting these samples could even be a special experiment that only scientists can perform. The anomaly scale ground-scatter could themselves have small biomes around them that pay out 100% more for all experiments run there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-30T23:17:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2018 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T00:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been a dream for a long time.\u00A0 But now that they have done a DLC, there is\u00A0a bit of\u00A0hope that some of these things might yet appear...along with\u00A0 an upgrade in the graphics so all those new things look their best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T07:10:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223365389\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022174318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221524849479\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164179\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tyko\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/27/2018 at 1:17 PM, Tyko said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5 minute landing to collect science and plant a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are you doing with the other 4 minutes?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-02T00:16:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really don\u0027t know how to make science any more fun and rewarding.
