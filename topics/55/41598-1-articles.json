A small, steerable fin would be useful for rockets launching the Mark 1 pod or similar sized payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA method of \u0022free\u0022 stability enhancement, long used on air to air missiles (AIM 9 Sidewinder, 1956 to present), is the rolleron. It uses no electricity, requires no computer or any sort of active control. How they work is a finned wheel is mounted inside a freely hinged, angled flap on each fin. As the missile flies, the airflow sets the wheels spinning very fast. The flap hinge angles are set so that gyroscopic precession moves the flaps to counteract any roll around the axis and also help damp oscillations induced by maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleron\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolleron\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rollers and flaps wouldn\u0027t need to be modeled and animated in KSP, just the effect of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T10:42:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that smaller once would be nice at times even when I build big stuff.

At first I thought it was working brilliantly, but then realised I hadn\u0027t shut off the reaction wheel in the probe core; after I did that, the surfaces had no effect on course.
