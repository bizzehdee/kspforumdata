(well I\u0027ve recently started in the forum) this idea looks like it would ve nice to do in future updates. IVA looks awesome, you can move the throttle and had the experience as the Kerbal is there. But my idea is to move in the interior of the spaceship, for example. Imaginate a MK1-2 attached to a PPD-10 crew cabin and instead of simply transfer with the right click move the Kerbal in the interior opening the connection between the Xapsule and the crew cabin and then transfer it. Also interact items or with the Kerbal in Zero-G in the interior of the spaceship, so. SQUAD. Did you like that idea? Or someone of the development?

And I say that as somebody who really likes the current cutaway views.

Taking this to its extreme, any inline part would need to be made hollow. Otherwise you\u0027d face the somewhat immersion breaking prospect of opening the\u00A0nose hatch on your Mk1-2 pod and having the exit blocked by\u00A0the battery pack that you installed between the capsule and that nose-mounted shielded docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, Unity does not handle hollow parts well due to the way colliders are implemented. If I recall correctly, the structural fuselage section (only example of a hollow part that springs to mind) needs a patchwork of separate colliders to make it work, which has a noticeable effect on performance. That\u0027s only going to get worse with more hollow parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
