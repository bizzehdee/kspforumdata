There\u0027s a mod for that - From what I understand Squad is not that big, and from what I assume can\u0027t afford to be big. So the amount of Devs available to dedicate to aspects of the game is limited. Because of this I don\u0027t expect them to be able to keep up with player demand for more options, more parts, more features, and all the other creative ideas that the public comes up with. I actually like that mods are allowed to be applied, and that the community creates their own additions to the game. You get to, well, modify the game as you wish. If you want to fully cheat, you can, if you just want a little more information about your craft you can. It creates a level of player involvement with their game, you can choose to have pure stock, just one or two mods, or a plethora of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, sure, I\u0027m not against mods, I use them myself.

The player places his or her own goal there, then sets out to solve the problem with creative engineering and creative flying. What this means is that nearly all of the \u0022game\u0022 part of KSP is derived from problem solving; so, simply, more problems = more game. Reentry heat is an additional problem to engineer a solution to, and what separates it from the whole \u0022random failures\u0022 frame of mind is that it is also a \u003Cem\u003Efair\u003C/em\u003E problem. I don\u0027t see how it could be any less an acceptable manner of challenging players to build better rockets than simply trying to get places. That said, I see no reason why such specifics of realism shouldn\u0027t be optional. As far as aerodynamics are concerned, when it comes to vertically launched systems, its another avenue of challenging players to build better, more aerodynamic rockets. For aircraft, however, the issue is a little more fundamental. Vanilla KSP aerodynamics aren\u0027t even remotely realistic. I was able to push an engine-less craft from the surface to kerbin ejection with nothing but creative control surface placement and without part clipping. Disregarding obvious glitches, even reasonable aircraft preform more like shoddily constructed paper airplanes than aircraft with lifting surfaces. As a real-world aviator I can say with some credibility that Farrem is a decent approximation of how things \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E preform. Imperfect, but reasonably close, especially for an engine allowing you to cobble together your aircraft out of junkyard parts and others found laying on the side of the road. I would be satisfied with an official implementation of an equivalent system. Until then, I shall continue to hold myself over with Farrem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T13:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost importantly, the fact that certain feature is not included does not count as \u0022bad development decision\u0022 because it can be added later.

Cashflow dried up and his company went bust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been named \u0022the Osborne Effect\u0022 and has been a warning towards developers (both hard and software) to be reluctant advertising new versions too much ahead of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the Osborne Effect is not in play with Squad -- KSP has already been paid for by existing customers and there\u0027s no penalty for buying early -- the lesson to learn is that revealing too much in advance can have negative side effects that are hard to predict.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as \u0022questionable design decisions\u0022 go -- Squad is very clear that they are developing a \u003Cem\u003Egame,\u003C/em\u003E not a simulation. The reason the game attracted hard-core simmers at first is because you had to be, to get any enjoyment out of the game. With the mechanics of the game nearly fully developed, focus is now shifting to enhancing \u003Cem\u003Egameplay\u003C/em\u003E, especially for the more casual gamers. So it is fully understandable that development is now going towards career mode, contracts (providing goals, an alien concept for hardcore simmers), good in-game tutorials. All that makes perfect sense in the development of \u003Cem\u003EKSP The Game\u003C/em\u003E but it means that less (or no) resources are spent on \u003Cem\u003EKSP The Simulation\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that a bad thing? Obviously it is, when you are looking for a realistic simulation (which the opening screen will tell you right of the bat KSP is not), but for development as a game it is natural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me personally, atmospheric behavior (both at launch as well as re-entry, but I think re-entry heating is very closely related to good aerodynamic modeling) is the one part that needs improvement and that I \u003Cem\u003Eexpect\u003C/em\u003E improvement since it can only enhance gameplay (it adds an \u0022it\u0027s not over till it\u0027s over\u0022 element to the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I see with most requests for \u0022more realism\u0022 is a desire to make the game more \u0022hardcore.\u0022 N-body physics! Lagrange Points! Random Failures! Which will make the game a miserable experience for all but the most committed players. Running out of fuel in Duna, and quickly sending in a fuel tank while time accelerating because you don\u0027t want to wait half a year? LOLZ u didn\u0027t maintain ur orbit! Fuel arrives, mission has disappeared... That might be ok for some, 95% of the players will not be happy about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, Squad will make decisions that make the game appealing for the majority of the players. And with KSP getting more and more fame, that will be a focus on making the game easier and \u0022fun,\u0022 not harder and radical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElJugador","CreatedById":18783,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T15:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.
