However, it could only collect up to 25% or 50% of the mits that a full crew report could, but a new mechanic would be needed to prevent spamming it for for full value since reports don\u0027t suffer transmission loss. So the player could send a probe with a camera to Duna, get 50% of the \u0022crew report\u0022 science value from high duna orbit, then send a manned mission to get the remaining 50%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this is the best of both worlds, especially given how few few science parts can collect data from space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T21:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the transmission loss, type of experiment, science gained from the experiment and the max percentage from transmission of the experiment are all defined in the CFG of the part file.
