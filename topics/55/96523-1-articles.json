I think its worth acknowledging that there is going to be some fine grain stuff that at some point you\u0027re going to have to go to the wiki for, but it seems like major gameplay components should feel straight forward and understandable from inside the game. Here are some things that feel a little lacking in this regard:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReputation:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that having more of it is good, I get that it makes more \u0027prestigious\u0027 contracts appear, and that it can be traded at the Admin facility, but I still don\u0027t feel like I can clearly see the quid pro quo for how it works. How much reputation do I need to get a Duna contract to appear? How does reputation effect contract payouts? Does it even? Why dont I know that? Its not just the meter, its understanding the way my rating effects contracts. I feel like there needs to be more clarity here so I have a sense of what my objectives and rewards are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperience:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I have to do to level up my dudes? I get that this is a fresh new and clearly incomplete system but even after going to the wiki I\u0027m not super clear on this. It seems like if I take a guy to the moon and plant a flag he only gets points for the top task, and not those under it. So if I want to max my experience of the mun for Jeb I have to fly-by, back to kerbin, orbit, back to kerbin, fly low, back to kerbin, land, back to kerbin, plant flag, back to kerbin. Someone suggested kerbals level-up in-flight, which would be a huge help, but still I feel like there\u0027s no instruction at all on how to level up and Id love to see this addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHighlighting:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a silly long-standing thing but the green highlight is pretty mild. I saw a hint before the last update that we\u0027d be getting a clearer graphic on this but Id love this to be more obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDelta VEEEEEEEEEEEE:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease. Dont make me beg. Make it into an engineer special ability. Im cool with anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhere dem biomes at?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is planned but a mapping system, just for the process of conducting science being able to clearly and easily see what biome Im in would be a huge help. Id further suggest that all the contracts that ask to conduct science experiments at specific locations instead ask to conduct them in particular biomes. Also you can call them Geomes. Im cool either way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDo I have everything?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve been playing this a while and Im a bit ocd on science completionism, and right now the research archive is really hard to understand. I can collect crew reports in some places, eva\u0027s in others, seismometer readings only on land, temperature only close to with no specificity, gravoli readings dont seem to work in-flight sometimes and I dont know why... long story short its just really hard to tell what Ive gathered and what I haven\u0027t and when Im in a zone where Im missing something. Maybe the parts could glow blue when theres uncollected science to be gathered?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAre my engines choking?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one I\u0027ve never seen people mention but Id love if I could see more clearly when engines are about to choke. Ive got a bunch of spaceplanes and hybrids of all sorts and I have to kind of memorize when to open intakes and kill airbreathing engines with different flight profiles. It would just be great if air breathing engines would show an overheat-like indicator to show when they were about to flame out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start there. I may think of others but if people can think of some maybe they\u0027d be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-13T03:59:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2015 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T03:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with just about everything here.

It kind of sucks to stage and discover that your upper stage doesn\u0027t have enough thrust to maintain a steady ascent. Of lower priority: the amount of lift generated would help with spaceplanes; the electrical charge requirement of systems and electric charge generation so we can design accordingly; and finally, acceleration and top speed for rovers (as calculated by the rover proper).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T04:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother few off the bat:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight path after atmo and projected landing site:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may actually become more complicated after the aero overhaul, or maybe this is the best time to do it?
