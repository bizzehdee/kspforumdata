Right now, we have no easy way to tell that any part that is not an engine is overheating. Players should be able to figure out why a part is exploding without having to use the debug menu. The new heat mechanic is fantastice, but right now it can be very frustrating to have parts overheating/exploding but you can\u0027t figure out why.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T21:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chaos_forge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Instresu","CreatedById":119022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean a colour overlay to turn on indicating temperatures?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T13:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA color overlay would work, so would a temp popup over the the part (like how the engines show they\u0027re overloading) but on the actual part itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
