Since you guys are working with NASA why not use real topographical information to render that planets. Even the extra solar ones can be artist rendering of what scientists think it may look like. And the whole extra solar system idea is great! To solve the distance/time problem just reduce the distances to below 1 light year that would allow for use of normal rocketry and maybe include one Electro Plasma magnetic drive being developed for future use.\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket\u003C/a\u003E.
