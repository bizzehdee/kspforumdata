Amount of science left in the biomes could be mostly stored on disk rather than filling RAM with planets worth of biome info, the problem being how to wrap a big 2D grid around a sphere without making it so there\u0027s lots more science at the poles. Though, given the extra difficulty required when transferring to/from polar orbits, that could be desirable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
