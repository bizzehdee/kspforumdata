They would also make hovering atmospheric probes a reality. For runway-to-orbit missions, you could use normal airship balloons, while for interplanetary missions, you could have deployable balloons for post-reentry maneuvers. The deployable balloons would be especially important for missions inside of Jool\u0027s atmosphere. You can\u0027t land on Jool and it\u0027s hard to study the atmosphere while in orbit. Airships are the solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to hovering launch pads and probes, there\u0027s another important advantage of floating platforms, and that\u0027s fuel transportation. Sure, you could make a simple rover that could drive fuel to another vehicle, but you can\u0027t drive across water and there\u0027s a chance that your docking nodes might not be level with each other. With an airship, you could travel anywhere you needed to for fuel delivery and you wouldn\u0027t need to worry about level nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause hovering vehicles are relatively easy to control, docking in mid-air would be fairly simple. This would open up the possibility of floating bases and other gigantic hovering structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s be honest, aesthetics are a HUGE part of Kerbal Space Program. With airships, just imagine launching a rocket from a huge hovering launch platform or walking around catwalks aboard an enormous Hindenburg-style blimp (hopefully without the enormous Hindenburg-style crash).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think? Shall airships rule the skies, or is it just a \u0022meh\u0022 thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decent Weasel","CreatedById":74583,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T01:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wholeheartedly agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn airship is the ideal solution for a place like Laythe, too - a boat can generally only explore the body of water it lands in, a rover can only explore the landmass it touches down on, and while an airplane can reach the entire planet theoretically, it has to be babysat every mile of the way, and it has to have a smooth place to land and refuel. But an airship can go anywhere at all and land on virtually any terrain. While rovers are ideal for airless bodies, airships are ideal for ones with atmospheres and seas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve used Hooligan\u0027s airship mods, I assume?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T01:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven simple weather balloons would be neat, maybe enough to lift a small probe so you could have a floating atmospheric research (or comms relay) station on suitably endowed planets, or Jool (\u002B other future gas giants).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T02:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a lot of Hooligan Labs, but I never used it.
