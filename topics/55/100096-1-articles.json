Basically I wish to read a fresh newspaper \u0027Kerbal Times\u0027 or whatever where the headlines would comment my actions like:\n\nKSC blows another rocket! \n\nKSC sends probe to Jool!\n\nIs upgraded runway waste of money? \n\n13 dead in a week!

Or we can simply get them as a part of mission report that we can read every time something returns home or blow up.
