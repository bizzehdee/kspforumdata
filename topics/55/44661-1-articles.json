I truly hate how hard it is to pinpoint spots and distances when docking ships (recently became a boss at this), and when I\u0027m trying to make a very Specific orbit, it\u0027s also hard....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T02:00:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you clear up a bit, from what I\u0027m understanding you\u0027re making a mod suggestion, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T02:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SeventhArchitect\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo one before me has even thought of coming up with a separate interface on which you can watch your orbit while you pilot your ship.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI promise you\u0027re not some kind of conceptual savant. This is a fairly common suggestion. There are mods out there (e.g. Telemachus) that put some kind of information and/or control into a second window, but I don\u0027t know if any provide full mapping capabilities. If you\u0027re really into this idea, I\u0027d look at similar projects and see if extending one of them is viable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
