But I\u0027m starting to forget what they\u0027ve done - such as who\u0027s landed on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, who was involved in that particularly hairy rescue mission, etc. etc. etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as part of the existing Astronaut Complex, how about each astronaut having a list of missions they\u0027ve flown on, along with mini-medals of particularly notable things they\u0027ve done? The latter would be similar to the signature images on these forums - so at a moment\u0027s glance you could identify that not only has Jeb made it to orbit, he\u0027s also landed on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, orbited Eve and crash-landed on Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional mini-stats could be fun - such as time spent in space, time on EVAs and longest continuous period in space.
