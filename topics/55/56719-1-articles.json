You can, while on EVA, remove the science from an experiment and store the results in the capsule, gaining you a full return value when the capsule is recovered. This means full return value for goo and mat-sci without having to bring the part itself back home. I\u0027m throwing two mat-sci and two goo containers on transfer stages now, using one of each at high orbit at the destination, the other at low orbit, and then stuffing the results into the capsule before I ditch the transfer stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first 0.23 Minmus mission got full return value for six materials science experiments and six goo experiments despite the fact that only the capsule and a parachute actually returned all the way to Kerbin. My first Mun mission is going to have full-return-value temperature/seismic/gravioli readings without having to place a part for every biome on the return craft. Trust me when I say that this can have a profound effect on how much you EVA :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joel Dryden","CreatedById":76304,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T02:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis exactly. Minmus is nice too, as the Kerbal can make it roughly 8-9Km away and back on the EVA fuel, so you can fly back and forth collecting a lot of science from a few biomes, cram it all in and then fly the full ship bunny hopping around, only about 200dV to take off and land from end to end on the decent salt bed, so you could quite easily make it around on something, then go up into orbit, maybe even let that craft run out of fuel and just fly a new one up to pick the Kerbal, or even just get him to move all the science. Also adds alot to the rovers and such, depending on how you use it. Quite happy with it and the fact things have been nerfed a little, still able to get well over 1-2K science per mission after the first one or two, but that\u0027s if you just intentionally go as many places at once, setting missions out seperately and recues and such, allows for a much more progressive career, very keen for Krubal/Kuck/KBuck/Kbuks/Kerbal moneys/Kredits/whatever it\u0027ll be, maybe won\u0027t be allowed to just send up that big science bay to each planet to pretty well harvest the place dry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Too early anyways, not enough money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
