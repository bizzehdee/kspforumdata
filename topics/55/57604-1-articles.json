This is a problem because people wouldn\u0027t know about what planets you\u0027d have in your save, so when you approched them saying you landed on planet \u0027Zog\u0027, they\u0027d have no idea where and what \u0027Zog\u0027 was and how much of an achievement it must be for you. Conversations about how your Duna base was would end, and how Jeb flew and SRB into Dres backwards along with it. Long story short; It would be too different. But don\u0027t fret! I\u0027ve thought of a solution!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What if at the start of your new save, Ksp selected a Solar System from a list of 5 or ten ready made systems. That way, people could say- for example; \u0027\u0027 I landed on planet [X] in system [Y]. I\u0027ve begun development of a base there\u0027\u0027. So the idea is all well and good on paper, but then comes the process of development: 1: ideas for systems. 2:selecting ideas. 3: Modeling and coloring said planets and moons in said system. And finally, 4: implementing them in numerous updates. Step 1 could be solved by looking to the community for help. Step into the suggestions discussions and you\u0027ll find plenty to do with solar systems and planet ideas. step 2 could be done through a competition of some sort. Moderators could judge. Step 3 and 4 will probably be done by devs or modders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now, before you begin to shout hate at this thread, bear in mind it\u0027s only a suggestion. I\u0027m not demanding to see this in update 0.24 or any time soon. It\u0027s just an idea.

I think they should keep the Kerbal system as it is (after all, it\u0027s basically the Earth system, and that\u0027s part of the fun), however, I also think they could add a \u0022random solar system generator\u0022 option when starting a new game to keep things interesting for those of us who have already explored the default system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to make the new solar system\u0027s really interesting, you could shake things up by randomly selecting which planet becomes the Kerbal home world.
