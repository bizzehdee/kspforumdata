The top number rows could be used as shortcuts (I don\u0027t think these are used in the space center) and a building-highlight-on-mouse-over should be possible.\n\nA mod accomplishing such a thing *should* be very simple to setup (too many mod ideas... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif))."}]}
