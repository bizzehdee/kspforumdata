That distance check is currently being performed so the new approach should just not affect the performance, not that much as to be considerable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it is the time for mods to enable/disable or change the way the ships/parts are included in the physic calculation list. I can think of some of these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- high profile gaming pcs can have more physics if they have the power for that, it is their choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- enable physics for vessels on atmosphere (or just parts of them) i.e. those having parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- disable physics (even if within the bubble) on vessels when they are controlled by other player or AI (e.g. multiplayer instances), because physics should only be computed once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a mod could provide AI to fly vessels while the player is focused on other things in the other side of the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
