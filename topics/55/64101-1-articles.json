For example, your first mission, a suborbital flight, could have a grainy-looking cutscene with only a few Kerbals watching and not a lot of fanfare. But as you progress to more difficult missions like interplanetary launches, the cutscene\u0027s video quality could improve, showing the passage of time, and the cutscene could be more dramatic and exciting with more Kerbals watching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just some ideas, and if this could be implemented in any way, even a partial one, that would be great. I just think it would be so cool to set the mood and add just a little bit of a plot to career mode with something like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T20:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Awass\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Awass\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor example, your first mission, a suborbital flight, could have a grainy-looking cutscene with only a few Kerbals watching and not a lot of fanfare.
