Also remember that, IRL, starting up a nuclear reactor takes a lot of time, hours at least. It would not be very responsive. I suppose you could make one that ran off of a slug of plutonium like an RTG, but it would only run for a short while before the plutonium cooled off, then you would have to wait for it to heat back up before you could use it again. Again, not good for an on-demand system like RCS. Overall, not very practical.

(Thank God.) They have a nuclear reactor that heats liquid hydrogen up to a very high temperature and spews that out of the exhaust nozzle. The nuclear material (uranium, not plutonium) stays safely in the reactor core. The life of the reactor core would be measured in years at 100% power, so refueling it would be essentially beyond the scope of the game. Plus, plutonium isn\u0027t a naturally occurring element, it is only created through neutron bombardment of U-238 in nuclear reactors.
