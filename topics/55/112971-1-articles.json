We already have high-thrust LFO Vernor RCS engines. And the cores in NERVA engines don\u0027t decay quick enough to be of relevance in KSP at this point (they wouldn\u0027t use Pu anyhow.) NERVAs use hydrogen as propellant.\n\nI agree that there should be a few more sizes of NERVA engines. Of course the larger engines would need to be proportionally heavier in dry-weight, as you\u0027re flying a nuclear reactor into space."},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:56:41Z","Content":"Well, there are already tons of mods that add larger nuclear engines to the game.

Atomic Age also adds a 0.625m nuclear engine. But I do agree with you, we are way overdue for a stock 2.5m nuclear engine. \n\nI think a nuclear RCS would be woefully overweight. The TWR would be prohibitive. Also remember that, IRL, starting up a nuclear reactor takes a lot of time, hours at least. It would not be very responsive. I suppose you could make one that ran off of a slug of plutonium like an RTG, but it would only run for a short while before the plutonium cooled off, then you would have to wait for it to heat back up before you could use it again. Again, not good for an on-demand system like RCS. Overall, not very practical. But props for thinking outside the box. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAs for mining plutonium: Nuclear engines don\u0027t work the way you think they work. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) They aren\u0027t spewing molten plutonium out of their exhaust nozzles. (Thank God.) They have a nuclear reactor that heats liquid hydrogen up to a very high temperature and spews that out of the exhaust nozzle. The nuclear material (uranium, not plutonium) stays safely in the reactor core. The life of the reactor core would be measured in years at 100% power, so refueling it would be essentially beyond the scope of the game. Plus, plutonium isn\u0027t a naturally occurring element, it is only created through neutron bombardment of U-238 in nuclear reactors. But, uranium would make a great high-value resource if they ever wanted to turn ISRU into a revenue stream.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T23:06:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TheSaint**\n  \nCouple other thoughts"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T23:53:33Z","Content":"At the risk of sounding like a broken record... I\u0027d be happy enough if just the existing nuke would be made stronger and heavier. One large Kerbodyne tank plus one of today\u0027s LV-Ns look very much like the proposed nuclear tugs. What\u0027s lacking is thrust. Give it enough oomph that such a vessel would work is what I\u0027d suggest. Yes, that would probably mean that we\u0027d have a small engine weighting more than a Mammoth -- so what?\n\nThat doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m opposed to even bigger ones.

OMG, WHY?\n\nSeriously though, this game is already unrealistic enough not to add to it free plutonium in asteroids. For your information - Plutonium is very scarce in nature. It doesn\u0027t exist in any free form and you cannot pump it since it\u0027s a metal. All Plutonium we have was synthesized milligram by milligram over the years in special reactors. Even if you are lucky enough to catch an asteroid containing several micrograms of it I doubt it will make any difference in space.
