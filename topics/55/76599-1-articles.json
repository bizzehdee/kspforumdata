At any rate, it seems to me as though 0.24 and perhaps the next couple of updates are still focusing on more core gameplay aspects, at least from what has been said so far.

Here\u0027s the thing. They \u003Cem\u003Eused\u003C/em\u003E to be. Back in the days before 0.14 and 0.15. Around 0.13, they realised that had to change. Why? Because it became apparent that Squad alone could not test the releases thoroughly enough to keep people happy. You can say all you like that people would only have the \u003Cem\u003Eoption\u003C/em\u003E of more shiny, less stable builds, but it has been the case that people simply did not care if the release said \u0022\u003Cstrong\u003EWARNING\u003C/strong\u003E: Testing time was short, so there may be some awful bugs here.\u0022 They figured that they were \u003Cem\u003Eentitled\u003C/em\u003E to properly-tested, stable, working builds -- without respect, of course, to the time it would take to accomplish that. I was there way back then... and it was horrible. People were being quite horrible. Naturally, there were people defending Squad, but there were a lot of people throwing rage around like flower petals at a wedding. It wasn\u0027t \u003Cstrong\u003Enearly\u003C/strong\u003E as pretty. Why did this happen? Simple. An unstable release was pushed forward that had one -- just \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eone\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E -- particularly nasty game-breaking bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrust me when I say... you do \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E want to see those days come back. The forum back then was a very poisonous place, and I shudder to think of what the forum staff had to go through back then; I was not a moderator until much later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad devs do read the forums for ideas, but it seems to be mostly the case that they only really have time to do so in the days following a release, as after that they simply go back to work on the next update. They seem to have fairly concrete plans for what they want to do for now, though, which is likely because they are trying to get the game to what they have been calling \u0022scope complete\u0022. Basically, to get all the basic core features that need to be in the game, into the game. After that will likely come a fair while of adding new content here and there, and I think at that point they will likely take to the forums a fair bit more, whenever they\u0027re lacking in inspiration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPatience. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T02:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel descussions on the suggestions forums aren\u0027t for results, rather they are for ideas, discussions and tinkering.

We want to be, but the devs are all but silent. The dev notes are typically incredibly vague. For this upcoming release, we know it\u0027s going to have contracts and budgets, that\u0027s really about it. We have only the barest notion about how the contracts system will work (procedurally generated contracts that will be roughly tuned to the players achievements in a save). We have one mod comment (not a dev) that says the new release \u0022should be fine\u0022 with old saves. We \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E get the OMS \u0026amp; Vernier engines. and...

It\u0027s their choice not to. This is relevant because if we had some idea about what was coming down the pipe, then it\u0027s possible that the community could \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E where their recommendations are being heard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we don\u0027t get that feed-back from the devs, so we have no idea if we\u0027re being heard or not.
