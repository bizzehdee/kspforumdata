It\u0027s really annoying to have to try to remember all their titles byor quit your flight, visit the staff building, view the title, and then re-control the craft just to find the kerbal with the desired position to perform a job specific action. I have a space station with over 20 kerbals and it\u0027s a chore to try to find an engineer whenever something like a solar panel accidentally breaks. Please add this to the game it would save a lot of headaches and just plain makes sense.\n\nJust make it so the little kerbal IVA window in the lower right would say like:\n\n\u0022Jebediah Kerman\u0022\n\n \u0022Pilot\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T03:41:29Z","Content":"I think you can get your Kerbals job title from the map view.\n\nEdit : yeah, I just fired the game up for the first time in weeks just to confirm. No need for all the mumbo-jumbo. Just press \u0022m\u0022 to enter map view, then click the little picture of a kerbal on the right side.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T03:57:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 03:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Otis**"},{"CreatedByName":"Michaelbak","CreatedById":114471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T04:17:18Z","Content":"Thanks for the tip but I don\u0027t really see any \u0022Mumbo Jumbo\u0022 about simply adding their job title below their name in the HUD.\n\nIt states it in the astronaut complex\n\nIt states it in the map view tab\n\nIt states it in the tracking station\n\nI just don\u0027t understand why it doesn\u0027t in the in game view.

The map view is pretty easy to get to. Could the system be better? Yeah sure. I was simply trying to help the op as he didn\u0027t seem to know the info existed on the map view. Nor was I trying to imply it couldn\u0027t be improved. I guess I should have been clearer on the mumbo-jumbo comment."}]}
