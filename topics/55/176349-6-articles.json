There is one mod, that properly emulates that, and that is ScanSat, which forces you to have satellites in specific orbits, which observe the planet below until they have covered 100% of the surface. Another mod that emulates real science quite well is this telescope mod (forgot the name). But in the real world, we do not do \u0022biome hopping\u0022 or the likes. Again, emulating a real world approach would be to have a satellite in orbit, which would then identifiy \u0022science potential\u0022. This could be quantified for instance by certain geographical features (cliffs, ancient river beds, ...).

A rough atmospheric analysis of a planet, with 1% precision - you do it at a point and you have it all. Mark the whole planet as done for this experiment. There are experiments that work over time, but don\u0027t require movement. Say, a space telescope, it only needs to rotate, but it doesn\u0027t really matter where you put it as long as you put it in space. There are area experiments that don\u0027t care about timing - say, mapping gravitational field of a planet; it won\u0027t change within next several thousand years, but you need to orbit all over the whole planet. There are these, that don\u0027t care about the exact location, but require a specific layout, like eLISA, measure of gravity waves by a constellation of satellites that remain at a constant distance from each other, to within a millimeter, while staying roughly 0.1AU apart. And area experiments that need to cover a large area over a specific time - measurement of various variable fields - so a grid of scattered landers or a swarm of micro-probes will work. Sounding experiments that require a pair of devices on two sides of a body, take a short time, but benefit from motion of at least one (like Rosetta\u002BPhilae).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of that can be implemented and would add a lot of flavor to the game. And they can be added as \u0022science is depletable\u0022, with various kinds of the \u0022science resource\u0022, various area depleted, various time to extract it, and the extraction point not necessarily located at the experimental device - say, that sounding experiment would extract science distributed throughout the volume of the body, over area drawn by the line connecting the transmitter and the receiver; ScanSat would extract surface science over the area covered by cone below it. Your swarm would connect the microprobes that are within range of each other with a surface that sweeps science from the volume of space as it travels. And a long-time space observatory would drip science points over a long time as long as it\u0027s up there and operating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-11T13:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResources like\u00A0BioScience, GeoScience, AstroScience, AtmoScience, SeaScience, PhysScience, ChemScience, ArcheoScience, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nProduced by different parts at\u00A0corresponding labs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven MathScience (a silent habitat for mathematicians, lol).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn AcademyOfScience building or module, converting these science points into integral\u00A0Science points.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe in some required proportions.
