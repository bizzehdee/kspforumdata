With that said, from what I recall of the early plane part\u00A0nodes, they\u0027re a mess.\u00A0The Aviation node for example- if I remember rightly -\u00A0gives you Mk1 fuselage parts combined with Mk 0 (Juno sized) engines and air intakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that working planes are already significantly harder to build than rockets, I would have thought that the first plane part\u00A0node should include the requisite parts to make a simple \u0027inline\u0027 plane with a Wheesley on the back, fuel tanks to suit, an inline cockpit and an air intake on the front. The neophyte plane builder would then still have\u00A0to worry about putting wings and other control surfaces in the right place, contend with unneccessarily fiddly undercarriage parts, get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E balance right and, in all probability deal with a runway that appears to have been freshly bombed. However, they could\u00A0at least reliably put a working fuselage together without having to deal with the added \u0027fun\u0027\u00A0of wedging Juno sized engine parts onto an otherwise Wheesley sized fuselage and\u00A0making sure the off-centre thrust balances nicely so that their lashed together contraption stands a fighting chance of getting down the aforementioned freshly bombed runway without turning donuts, turning turtle or exploding for any number of other \u0027hilarious\u0027 reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a quick review of the remaining aircraft tech nodes, there are a fair few parts in there that I\u0027m not familiar with so I\u0027m not the best person to be commenting on the later nodes.

I need to dig out my old tech tree spreadsheet and update it, but here\u0027s a (relatively) quick overview of the balance I would like to see. Note that in some cases I also advocate for rebalancing some of the parts to make them better fit with everything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. I very much like Unmanned Before Manned, but for the sake of the players who like starting out with Kerbals, have the Mk1 capsule and Stayputnik available from the start. To avoid needing batteries right away, all the probe cores should be rebalanced with much better batteries than they have now. Also, Stayputnik desperately needs \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Starting engine should NOT be an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E that flings the capsule straight up with enough force to crush the occupant, especially since the game doesn\u0027t really communicate how to adjust the thrust limiter. The flea right now is useless after the first flight anyways since it\u0027s completely outclassed by the RT-10, to give it more utility it could be worked into a vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E with high vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E before the other upper stage engines are unlocked. Actually, the starting engine and fuel tank could be the Reliant with the 1.25m long fuel tank so the player doesn\u0027t need to stack excessive numbers of smaller tanks right at the start, and the progression would be in terms of adding an upper stage with an appropriately sized fuel tank and engine. Not to mention that it would actually have much more realistic rocket proportions than a flea plus capsule. The starting node should also have steerable fins (although their cost desperately needs to come down, 4 fins costs a lot more than the starting rocket engine...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Like in the discussion above, larger fuel tanks and clustering adapters should be unlocked before larger engines so the progression would be through adding more engines until better ones become available. Engine costs should be significantly increased, they should be one of the most expensive parts of any rocket. Probe cores and capsules should also be quite expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Electric parts (batteries, solar, probe cores) should be available sooner. Also includes electric rover wheels. The remote guidance system probe cores should be available MUCH sooner, even before the other probe cores past the stayputnik instead of shoved at the end of the tech tree like they are now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Science parts should be available sooner. Nothing should be unlocked past the 300 science cost node. Thermometer and barometer should be available from the start, accelerometer,\u00A0gravimeter and mystery goo should be available relatively soon after. Mystery goo desperately\u00A0needs an inline part model. Materials bay and atmosphere scanner should be available a little later, but not terribly so, about the time the player is expected to land on the mun or send their first interplanetary probe. Experiments that are just data (temperature, pressure, acceleration, gravity, atmosphere scan) should be transmittable with 100% efficiency. EVA and crew reports in low orbit should be swapped, so players don\u0027t have to hop in and out of their capsule\u00A0constantly to get all the biomes. Science lab should be last science part to be unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Basic structural parts should be unlocked fairly early. Also, utility parts like ladders and lights should be available near the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Aircraft should be available right after the start in a series of parallel nodes than can safely be ignored if the player isn\u0027t interested in aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. End-game parts should be things like the Vector, Mammoth, RAPIER, ion engine, nuclear engine, etc since they enable the largest/most advanced craft designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the rambling and not completely organized points, but hopefully you get the idea of what I\u0027m going after.

Though the science container has reduced a great deal of the click-grind we used to have I tend to agree with almost all of your other suggestions. I might only augment by suggesting 100% efficiency \u003Cem\u003Ewith full signal\u003C/em\u003E, as this puts trade-offs on the table in terms of transmitters and weight. The EVA/Crew report thing is another area where theres some grind left, and to my mind the best way to fix it is to make biomes indiscernible on EVA from orbit. So you can still do an EVA and get \u0022EVA report from low over\u00A0Kerbin\u0022 and \u0022- high above Kerbin\u0022 but not \u0022- low over the Mun\u0027s Farside Crater\u0022 For that EVA you should have to land. This does shift the balance though, and to make sample return missions more competitive you\u0027d want to boost the value of samples and surface EVAs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tend to agree with shifting the experiments up, but this will also change the overall pace of the game. I, personally, don\u0027t think its a problem if players can advance through the tech tree faster, but we don\u0027t want it to be possible to unlock everything after the first munlanding. We also don\u0027t want to overwhelm players with lots of parts they don\u0027t quite need yet. It should be tailored around: 1) Getting accustomed to suborbital flight, 2) Getting into orbit, 3) Exploring the Kerbin system, 4) Building space stations, 5) Exploring other planets, and 6) Max out and late game interplanetary missions, bases, etc. I honestly don\u0027t think we\u0027re far off on 1-4, pacing wise. The big problem\u00A0I see is that so few players are going interplanetary, which means they aren\u0027t learning about what goes into it and all of those resources are largely wasted. Most of that is probably a lack of in-game information resources, namely\u00A0delta-v readouts and transfer orbit calculators.

My understanding is it came about as a result of play-testing, in which first time players would almost invariably put a capsule on an RT-10 for their first launch, go straight up, but on the way down the chute would rip off and their first experience with KSP would be Jeb\u0027s fiery\u00A0end.

The RT-10 was definitely overkill as the first booster for the same reasons I mentioned about the Flea crushing the occupant, only to a larger degree. It seems like the Flea is a band-aid to the problem of the game not having a lifter engine between the 0.625m Spark and the 1.25m Swivel, which is quite a large gap. It sounds like they\u0027re adding some new engines to address these issues in the expansion, but it\u0027s annoying to have to pay for DLC to get fixes for problems. Back to my original issue with the Flea, right now it\u0027s a one-trick pony for your first career flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223203906\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509029463\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah this goes to a deeper question about generalized balance and game flow. Though the science container has reduced a great deal of the click-grind we used to have I tend to agree with almost all of your other suggestions. I might only augment by suggesting 100% efficiency \u003Cem\u003Ewith full signal\u003C/em\u003E, as this puts trade-offs on the table in terms of transmitters and weight. The EVA/Crew report thing is another area where theres some grind left, and to my mind the best way to fix it is to make biomes indiscernible on EVA from orbit. So you can still do an EVA and get \u0022EVA report from low over\u00A0Kerbin\u0022 and \u0022- high above Kerbin\u0022 but not \u0022- low over the Mun\u0027s Farside Crater\u0022 For that EVA you should have to land. This does shift the balance though, and to make sample return missions more competitive you\u0027d want to boost the value of samples and surface EVAs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t mention it earlier, but I made a simple mod awhile back to switch those very things so the EVA report was low space only (like the crew report is now) and the Crew report was biome dependent (I haven\u0027t done a good job of keeping it updated though, kind of got burned out on KSP when it went 1.0 with all its problems and unfinished content, and got tired of having to mess around with mods to fix the problems). Sample returns should definitely be worth a lot more due to the extra difficulty involved. Also, we need some sort of camera experiment besides the sentinel that functions similarly to a crew report for probes. High science value, but a LOT of data to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223203906\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509029463\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also tend to agree with shifting the experiments up, but this will also change the overall pace of the game. I, personally, don\u0027t think its a problem if players can advance through the tech tree faster, but we don\u0027t want it to be possible to unlock everything after the first munlanding. We also don\u0027t want to overwhelm players with lots of parts they don\u0027t quite need yet. It should be tailored around: 1) Getting accustomed to suborbital flight, 2) Getting into orbit, 3) Exploring the Kerbin system, 4) Building space stations, 5) Exploring other planets, and 6) Max out and late game interplanetary missions, bases, etc. I honestly don\u0027t think we\u0027re far off on 1-4, pacing wise. The big problem\u00A0I see is that so few players are going interplanetary, which means they aren\u0027t learning about what goes into it and all of those resources are largely wasted. Most of that is probably a lack of in-game information resources, namely\u00A0delta-v readouts and transfer orbit calculators.

Especially with the part about the game not providing enough information. I didn\u0027t really enjoy KSP (other than messing around\u00A0for laughs) until I discovered MechJeb. It\u0027s telling that KerbalEDU has these readouts, but for inexplicable reasons they haven\u0027t made their way into the base game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing I forgot to mention in my earlier post is that to really properly balance the game we need some sort of life support. Kerballed flights have always been much more effective than probes since the extra weight (especially if you\u0027re using the small lander can) is negligible, you get access to some of the best science experiments, your kerbal can reset experiements or repair things depending on their class, not to mention the infinite EVA fuel. The hiring cost isn\u0027t really even an issue with the loads of rescue missions I\u0027m always getting so I never have to actually hire any, and if I wanted to send one on a one-way mission, it wouldn\u0027t even be an issue from a gameplay standpoint since there\u0027s no penalties for stranding or killing kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe com network for probes provides an interesting challenge, but it also ultimately makes probes even less desirable. Life support could provide a proper balance to manned missions versus probes and make the progression you described of going from suborbital to orbital to stations to exploring other planets even more interesting. Just like the com network feature, make it an option that can be enabled on a per-game basis so players who like things the way they are can keep playing, but players who want proper balance can have it. Apologies for getting so far off the tech-tree topic, but like has been mentioned, the tech tree is just one piece of the larger overall balance puzzle and all the pieces need to be fit with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-27T19:48:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223204227\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509056343\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271687\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Lord Aurelius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack to my original issue with the Flea, right now it\u0027s a one-trick pony for your first career flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, two trick pony, really, it\u0027s also insanely handy for those \u0022splashed down\u0022 part tests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough I have to admit, that\u0027s about the biggest point of disagreement I have with you.\u00A0 Every part pack I have that isn\u0027t about functionality is about filling in gaps.\u00A0 1.875m and 0.625 tanks/engines, 2 kerbal command pods, stuff like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with much of your analysis of the tech tree as well, and would like to add one gripe.\u00A0 We shouldn\u0027t be getting 0.625 engines/tanks at the same tech level as\u00A02.5m ones.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think we need to go full on \u0022sounding rockets first, then 1.25m parts\u0022 but I think most of the 0.625m parts should be introduced along side the corresponding 1.25m parts at the latest, except where it could be argued that the part is complex enough that miniaturization could be an issue.\u00A0 So sure, high tech probe cores can come to 1.25m first.\u00A0 But miniaturizing engines and tanks to 0.625m shouldn\u0027t be an issue, and I shouldn\u0027t have to resort to tweakscale to get something as simple as a 0.625m aerodynamic nosecone.\u00A0 Heck, having 0.625 decouplers/seperators come after the 1.25m ones is a royal pain at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T17:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223204986\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166676\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221509133714\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Eric S\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/27/2017 at 12:48 PM, Eric S said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with much of your analysis of the tech tree as well, and would like to add one gripe.\u00A0 We shouldn\u0027t be getting 0.625 engines/tanks at the same tech level as\u00A02.5m ones.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think we need to go full on \u0022sounding rockets first, then 1.25m parts\u0022 but I think most of the 0.625m parts should be introduced along side the corresponding 1.25m parts at the latest, except where it could be argued that the part is complex enough that miniaturization could be an issue.\u00A0 So sure, high tech probe cores can come to 1.25m first.\u00A0 But miniaturizing engines and tanks to 0.625m shouldn\u0027t be an issue, and I shouldn\u0027t have to resort to tweakscale to get something as simple as a 0.625m aerodynamic nosecone.\u00A0 Heck, having 0.625 decouplers/seperators come after the 1.25m ones is a royal pain at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have mixed feelings about this.

Everyone can only play a first career game once, at which point everything is a replay.
