No-one needed to cheese lift in 0.9, a basic wing setup would get you off the runway easily enough. The only time I have seen surfaces used for performance purposes was when people added many control surfaces for acrobatic planes or abusing the infiniglide bug."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T09:51:45Z","Content":"Just wanted to say I saw Regex suggestion coming a while before the new Aerodynamic...\n\nFAR-lover were like : \u0022SQUAD, WE MUST ABSOLUTELY MAKE SHAPE MATTER IN AERODYNAMIC, IT MUST BE REALISTIC !\u0022\n\nAnd I was like : \u0022Remember we want aesthetic stuff possible\u0022\n\nBut they were all : \u0022Make the physic realistic and it will be aesthetic, a pancake rocket shouldn\u0027t fly, only sensible design should.\u0022\n\nNow, when it turn out you CAN\u0027T keep the vessels aerodynamic and aesthetic as well we suddenly remember the benefit of simplified physics and now to build pretty we will need the weight without the (deactivated) lift.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong, it is still worth the new aerodynamic, but be glad if aesthetic can be made easy again through simple tweaks.\n\nFor now we will have these \u0022[Why was adding aerodynamic stability removed?](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118758-Why-was-adding-aerodynamic-stability-removed)\u0022 topic.\n\nSorry if my post seem to bring nothing to the subject,\n\nMyself I don\u0027t mind the idea of selectively deactivate lift without getting (completely) weight/dragless part.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:31:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kegereneku**\n  \nprecision"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:57:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m going to go out on a limb and speculate that Squad figured most players would be content with a new aerodynamic model, a slew of new aircraft parts including undercarriage that actually works, proper cargo bays, larger wings, wet wings, airbrakes etc. etc. Sticking in a kludgy tweakable to ensure backward compatibility with a class of old designs that were largely prompted by the need to cheese as many wings onto a spaceplane as possible to give it sufficient lift... probably wasn\u0027t very high on the list.\n\nWe didn\u0027t add the wing panels to exploit lift.

I just think a proper suggestion thread would serve us all better. Nothing wrong with one person\u0027s aesthetic sense over another\u0027s, but the argument is much better served as a suggestion.\nInterestingly, this also serves my own purposes for space radiators. Wings shed heat fantastically, being able to turn them into structural parts would make launching interplanetary tugs using radiator wings much, much easier. Right now it\u0027s an incredibly fiddly process with all the lift interactions."}]}
