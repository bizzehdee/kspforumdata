That Planning Node would show how any ship leaving that planet would go. You could drag out your retrograde line to touch Eve\u0027s orbit (Or prograde to touch Duna\u0027s) and it would show you the \u0022close approach\u0022 markers you have now when making maneuver nodes for ships. You could then drag the Planning Node itself around Kerbin\u0027s orbit until you got a good encounter with Eve, tweaking prograde and retrograde (and normal/radial) to get a good encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you could launch a ship, wait for Kerbin to be about where that Planning Node was, and then make your maneuver node (by hand) to do the transfer in much the same way we do today, though you could set it up so you can plan your maneuver relative to the planning node (like Target Mode, but if your target was moving exactly how the Planning Node was set up to go).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBam.
