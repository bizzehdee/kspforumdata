If you remember the screenshots form around 0.19, there were over a dozen resources scattered on planets. I thought, what if instead of mining these, they would become individual sources of science. We have budgets and contracts now, and I think it would be a great way to enhance the science system and at the same time allow for lots of contract opportunities if these resources would become different sources of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you might get a contract to find and recover a sample of Blutonium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you would have to send scanning \u003Cstrong\u003Eprobes\u003C/strong\u003E out to find deposits on planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese wouldn\u0027t tell you exactly what it is, only that there is a deposit of \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E in a certain area. You\u0027d actually have to land and analyse samples in a lab to understand what it exactly is. So you might get lucky and get blutonium on the first try, but it might be something else. We\u0027ll need an automatic lab for this, so you wouldn\u0027t need to send manned missions every time, automatic \u003Cstrong\u003Erovers\u003C/strong\u003E could scoop up and analyse it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contract would also state what \u003Cem\u003Epurity\u003C/em\u003E of the material they want. An automatic lab couldn\u0027t tell you the purity, so you would have to send a manned mission with a more advanced lab module to figure that out. Now purity \u003Cem\u003Ewould vary inside the resource zone\u003C/em\u003E, so your team would have to sample many different areas and analyse the samples in the lab to determine what the purity of the material is at that spot. The purity would change along a gradient, so if you keep sampling the area, you could reliably close in on the higher purity zone -which of course wouldn\u0027t necessarily be in the center of the resource zone-. This would be a great use for \u003Cstrong\u003Erovers\u003C/strong\u003E to speed around in a few km diameter area looking for the higher purity samples. The devs could add a sample collection module that would allow you to collect and number a bunch of samples and then take them all back to the lab in one go. Once you find a sample pure enough, you\u0027d have to transport it back to get the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d get little to no science for this, since you were working on a contract and the findings are not yours, but you could also go out and find sources of the different materials for yourself and do science on them. The higher gradient you find, the more science you can get from analysing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERethinking and prioritizing science points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we could make the \u0022\u003Cem\u003Egeneral\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 science points we have now less effectual at unlocking techs, and instead redesign the science advancement system by science \u0022\u003Cem\u003Etypes\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, that could be tied to the type of materials you do science on. To stay with our Blutonium example, if you wanted to unlock nuclear techs like the NERVA or nuclear generator, you\u0027d need to collect blutonium science points for that. Maybe you could also use regular science points to unlock it, but you\u0027d need several times as many of those than blutonium points. This way you could prioritize science and not just any mission to anywhere would yield more or less the same amount of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn \u003Cstrong\u003Espacestations\u003C/strong\u003E: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince spacestations are currently not very useful, I thought this idea could be extended to give stations some love:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more advanced contracts could ask you to combine two or more samples of different materials. Since not every material can be found on every planet, you would often have to ferry a resource from one planet to the other. Instead of taking a sample you found on Dres to Duna to combine it with something else you found there, you could have a lab in orbit around Duna, and only take the Dres sample there, and take the Duna sample to orbit as well to do the experiment, and then you could fly the result back to Kerbin with a lot less fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively: Contracts could ask for different research \u003Cem\u003Eenvironments\u003C/em\u003E, sometimes demanding a zero gravity experiment with the material, which of course could only be done in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent Laboratory Types:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could be different level laboratories, each more expensive and heavier than the last. The more advanced lab module would require more electricity and staff as well, and give you more details about the material being studied. Contracts could ask for certain details that only a larger lab could mesure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETweakable labs\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince tweakables were added you could designate on construction what experiments a lab can do. I\u0027m sure the devs could come up with many funny experiment types. In small labs you could only designate one type of experiment, larger ones could have 3 types, even larger ones 5 types etc. So you could have a lab in orbit but get a contract for an experiment that your lab can\u0027t do. You would now have to build and launch a second lab module for your station that is capable of doing the desired experiment. This would give a point to docking and modular stationbuilding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
