I find that most of what i do is, go to planet, get research rinse and repeat (If i\u0027m not just going for a challenge). Now the fun part is that each planet is different, so figuring out how to get there, and what you want to get there with etc, is the fun part. But you get there essentially and you just do research and you send it back. Hopefully its a return mission so you at least get the joys of reentry. What i\u0027m suggesting is resources, lots of different resources scattered over different planets with different rarities\u00A0and the ability to use those resources in many different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0To help you understand lets assume you can make supply runs to planets by collecting\u00A0ore and sending it home.\u00A0 I make it sound simple but you assume you have to send the parts their to find the ore, then land the parts to mine\u00A0the ore, after store it for transport. Finally safely get it back home. You make some money and a little science along the way. Also you should be able to fabricate land bases on other planets by means of fabrication. Use your resources to build a little base. Launch small rockets from the planet you are on,\u00A0build rovers, do research on strange rocks you found etc. I just think this is a foundation upon which a lot of things can be built upon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmaller things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA color palette (give us red, blue, green, etc for ships.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake it so that the land facilities can calculate interception nodes. Maybe a slow kerba computer that makes calculations that aren\u0027t always the most accurate but can set up maneuvers from home just like in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn in game news paper, while in career mode it would be nice to read about your company in the paper and some other comical stuff that is happening in fictional kerbal society.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA black hole.\u00A0 (O_o) Ok this one is big, but how fun would it be to see how close you can fly to a black hole......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-05T22:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you heard of astroneer?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
