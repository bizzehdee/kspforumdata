That\u0027s not the fairing system\u0027s job to discourage; it\u0027s the aero system\u0027s (and no, a pancake fairing shouldn\u0027t make your rocket particularly aerodynamic). While ultra-wide fairings should probably cost somewhat more (say, multiply your base price by the ratio between fairing max width and rocket max width to the 1.1 power, so pancake rockets cost a lot but you can do them), the issue isn\u0027t actually the width. The thing with infinite-resolution procedural fairings is that there\u0027s no \u0022box\u0022 to fit things into -- shaving 0.1m off the diameter never has a big effect, so there\u0027s much less reason to care about a bit of optimizing. Now, this is how KSP works now; adding a box for fixed fairings changes the game more than pure proc fairings. However, I think it\u0027s an *interesting* change; it means fitting payloads in rockets is more akin to fitting cargo bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as people have pointed out, there\u0027s not all that much fun in totally banning pancake rockets - they should be hard (because they make very little sense physically), but possible, and the fairing system shouldn\u0027t just be for sane designs. The interesting gameplay aspect from my point of view has nothing whatsoever to do with generally limiting diameter, and everything to do with *having* a box that you want to fit it within. And that can be done fairly well if proc fairings *aren\u0027t* infinitely scalable, but rather come in fixed size increments. Want to build a pancake rocket? Fine, but there aren\u0027t fairings of 9.5 m wide -- you\u0027ll have to take the 10m fairing, unless you can get your payload inside 9m, which will bring the cost/mass down somewhat noticeably. That adds the aspect of wanting things to fit, without a penalty of \u0022you can\u0027t use fairings on this craft\u0022 if you can\u0027t make them fit -- just a bit of a price/mass increase, but nothing you can\u0027t put more rocket or funds into.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T09:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI PM\u0027ed Rows a few days ago to ask permission to start a Hinge discussion(since they are on the WNTS list).
