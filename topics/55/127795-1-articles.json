None at all. It helps no one in any way.

Problem is, a\u00A0lot of people like to build their own jet engines or bearings powered by rockets or jets that could be made nice and neat if packed into a fairing. Unfortunately for them, such a thing is impossible due to this mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe absolute worst result\u00A0of it is when you are in a time sensitive mission with an engine cluster. Your staging puts the engines in the same stage as the fairing. The fairing deploys but the engines do\u00A0not activate. You can\u0027t just stop and turn each engine on individually, you\u0027d completely flip out! You revert the flight, and try again, this time putting the rockets on a separate stage from the fairing. Fly up, ready to stage. [Spacebar]. Wait.

Sane: \u0022Darn it, I\u0027ll have to rebuild this part of the rocket.\u0022 Insane Happy: \u0022That\u0027s such a great idea.

[Redacted] all!\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou then try to calm down from whichever reaction you chose, as you try to toggle the engines on. \u0022Can\u0027t activated engines whi--\u0022 At this point your previous response is repeated except an order of magnitude larger. This may involve a decidedly frustrated sigh, temporarily converting your room into a dance party, or breaking one or more limbs. At this point you close the game out of frustration, excitement, or total and complete burning rage, and write\u00A0a post on the forum either complaining to, congratulating and thanking, or murdering whoever it was who wrote that bit of rocket-blocking code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: After having calmed down, I want to just say that some of what I\u0027ve said is unfairly bent due to me still not having been calmed down enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-14T00:04:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2015 12:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-13T23:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/36077-gregroxmun/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002236077\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/36077-gregroxmun/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_3\u0022\u003E@GregroxMun\u003C/a\u003E, can you show me any instances in 1.0.5 where engines or any other occluded part remain stowed when the fairing is staged?\u00A0 As this is meant to be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I totally understand the sentiment against cramping gameplay options, but this was by design and to help change the minds of the ones who designed this we need to present use cases, that can\u0027t be achieved by some other method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do have to argue this point however ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222321469\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127795\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450047972\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002236077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 minutes ago, GregroxMun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents ipsClearfix\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is absolutely no reason why I shouldn\u0027t be able to activate an engine while it is still inside a fairing.

I agree you are not the one to convince but dismissing a valid point as a rant is wrong twice over. It is valid. We use NASA approved parts from the ARM mission and NASA style drop then ignite staging, but that does not mean Soyuz/Russian hot staging is instantly invalid. Many mods model Soyuz parts. Novapunch for example. Dismissing a real world example out of hand is wrong. If anything Sal its proof positive that the mechanic in question needs to be fixed.
