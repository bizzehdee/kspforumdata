We have:\n\nLanding legs of various sizes, types and material\n\nParachutes\n\nWheels\n\nAnd suspensions\n\nBut we need rafts!\n\nBasically:\n\nYou fall too fast into the ocean and die\n\nOr\n\nYou fall close to the ocean, bit inflate your raft which you placed inline and live!\n\nMore detail:\n\nRaft: the equivalent of water landing gear\n\nTexture: toroidal tank\n\nTypes:\n\nToroidal:\n\nComes in various sizes. Place around the craft as a ring. Use the stages to deploy the raft, inflating it and helping land on water. Crash tolerance of 25 maybe?\n\nOr something like that ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nInline:\n\nPlace it as an inline tank. Similar size to the RCS inline tanks. Behaves the same as the radia ones, inflates outwards\n\nWell I hope you liked this! Fly and land safely!\n\n-G1"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T22:48:40Z","Content":"At the moment all parts I am aware of float really good.
