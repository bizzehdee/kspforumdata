To Mun and Minmus, a month, and Kerbin orbit, a week for example.

Two attempts to get to kerbin orbit, a m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn flyby, minmus landing (2 biomes) and return, and a m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn landing (1 biome) and (nearly-botched) return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll but the last tech level is unlocked (but not all purchased). How is this possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Unpaid Research (20%) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Outsourced R\u0026amp;D (30%) and c) a some WAY over-paid contracts (even at 50% setting):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. plant a flag on minmus. I picked up this contract while already landed there, since it hadn\u0027t appeared yet when I launched. Advance $6k, Completion $32k. Strategies translate this to an extra 526 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Test Kerbodyne KR-2L in suborbital trajectory over Kerbin. Advance: $79k Completion $242k plus 3.2k science, plus 4.2k science from strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat last one feels plain old cheaty; 7400 science without getting to a stable Kerbin orbit?! Sure it cost me some funds, but I still took home $180k from this mission alone. The ship itself took 10 minutes to build; cost 48k to launch; went straight up (as a single stage, SRBs and all), (nearly) straight down, was recovered at 96%, and gave enough science to unlock all but the last tech level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow is it that this Kerbodyne test contract gave 173 rep, when rescuing Podnard Kerman gave only 9?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to try this again, with contract payout set at 10%; or stay away from the outsourced R\u0026amp;D, which feels a bit unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T01:37:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, contracts and strategies need a lot of re-balancing. I set the Outsourced R\u0026amp;D strategy to only 15% and managed to unlock nuclear engines and Kerbodyne parts with a bunch of contracts, but as far as classic gameplay goes, only one trip to the Mun!
