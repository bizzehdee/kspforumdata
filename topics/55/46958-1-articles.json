Because Docking on a craft which sits on the surface is pretty hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember a mod Scott Manley used in his Reusable Space Progamm... \u0022Quantum Fuellines\u0022 i guess... But that was just a laser transfering the Fuel and didnt worked all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind I am thinking of Kerbals actually laying hoses over the ground to the empty spacecraft. For Quantum Fuellines you have to add a part in the first place onto the craft that will be stranded to refuel it and thats a little bit awkward to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Revolving Planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It would be cool to have the planets revolve as you move your maneuver node along your flightpath to predict your actual landing Spot. This actually came to my mind as I was driving to work. (KSP never leaves me, maybe I am too addicted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would make it easier to adjust your course while coming in from interplanetary space if you want to land directly at KSC again without going into a stable Orbit first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm.. maybe this sounds a little like nonsense. I am asking for a forecast of my landing site while I am still a Million Km away. Maybe that makes it clearer. Maybe you can redouce the revolving Objects to only 1 by marking them as your target first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Adding Actiongroups after Liftoff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maybe planned, maybe a mod out there. But that should be an implemented Feature at the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Sounds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Right know KSP is only Birds chirping at KSC, Rocketmotors, Decouplers, Atmospheric Effects, REALLY AWESOME MUSIC inside the Hangars and Tracking Station and lots and lots of Explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using Chatterer for breaking the silence in space and I am also thinking of installing the Muffler Mod for some more realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I think the Rocketmotor sounds could use an overhaul. A Mainsail should sound something more like an Apollo Mainstage and I miss the intimidating ramble of the Solid Rocket Boosters which you can whitness at Space Shuttle Takeoffs. Also an LV-N should be seperated soundly from the other engines. Oh oh... by the way: RCS and Ion Engines (a swirling Sound like an electric transformer does would be great because of it\u0027s hunger for electricity) are also mute and I am thinking about a Metal-on-Metal Squeking Sound when Docking ports are mating, maybe a \u0022Pffff\u0022-Sound when they decouple again (That would be great for RCS too). (Sorry my phantasy is outta control now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think thats it for now, thank you for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the devs: I dont want to criticise your game at this Point because I am thinking that KSP is the best game out there right now. I just want to give you cool Ideas to make it even better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for addicting me to this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T07:51:23Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 07:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MalfunctionM1Ke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T06:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Erevolting planets?
