We just need to add one more resource: Water...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can scan bodies for water. And get Water from Laythe oceans, Duna Ice caps or humidity from the Munar soil. In the same way that kethane does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Kerbals are plants they only needs water sun and CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can assume that Kerbals are some kind of Epiphyte and don\u0027t need soil, that is why they don\u0027t have roots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESun is easy to find, so easy that I would leave it out of the resources. They can also have artificial light inside the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe water can be get as I described earlier. you can also combine hydrogen and oxygen from the fuel tank to get water and electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd CO2 can be obtained with a new part: Something like a \u0022Aerobic organisms pack\u0022 that can change the oxygen expelled by the Kerbals into CO2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you need fuel, you can transform water into hydrogen and oxygen using electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you can establish and maintain extra planetary colonies and space stations autonomously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if the kerbals run out of water they will dry as a leaf until you can rehydrate them.(they will not die, they only need a rescue mission).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also cut the water supply and let the kerbals dry during long trips and rehydrate them when they arrive. (if you have a probe to control the ship systems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way Kerbals are much more resilient and they can live long periods of time with few resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will only need to worry about life support if your mission has several months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will introduce new mechanics to the game without making it too much harder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobnova","CreatedById":75385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T06:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been done in mods, here\u0027s one example: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-life-support/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-life-support/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt definitely changes things a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T06:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these things are on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, which I strongly reccomend as reading material before actively posting here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, thread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
