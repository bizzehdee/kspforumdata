KSP isn\u0027t and will never be like Spaceengine which doesn\u0027t have to calculate a complex physics for 400parts spaceship. Plus KSP is using Unity which isn\u0027t optimized for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore reproducing real planet would require a lot of work, and the alternative of pseudo-random procedural generation isn\u0027t necessarily more fun since you have far more chance to generate a system of boring planet than a solar system you would want to play it for hours in Career-mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that answer any question one might ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
