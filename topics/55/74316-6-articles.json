To go along with that, if adaptors could be auto-generated, it\u0027d make it much easier to work with multiple plugins with their own body shapes (in theory, all you have to do is create a part with one shape at each end and interpolate between them... dunno how hard that\u0027d be in practice). Plus, since this would let us lower the parts count, it\u0027d help with\u00A0planes and\u00A0rockets being all floppy, and it\u0027d simplify the physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) (This mostly applies to planes)\u00A0Custom\u00A0control surface response\u00A0curves based on airspeed and/or\u00A0air pressure, so that, say,\u00A0you could have a large control surface\u00A0that moderately responds to\u00A0pitch commands when you\u0027re moving slowly (like on a take-off run),\u00A0then the response tapers off as you gain speed (so that stability control doesn\u0027t tear your plane apart because it can\u0027t figure out that it\u0027s causing the very oscillations that its so frantically trying to dampen), and then responds hugely in\u00A0the upper atmosphere where the air in thin and you need all the control you can get.

Offer low-weight rockets and tanks. Also offer structurally reinforced tanks like the current ones that are suitable for aircraft and other high-lateral-stress applications. Liquidfuel rocket engines should weigh 25% what they do now. Rocket tanks should weigh much less. Real life tanks are around 2.5x lighter, WITH structural support.

I want to have mk0 and mk2 low-bypass turbofans with tvc and afterburners, mk2 medium-bypass turbofans, mk3 high-bypass turbofans. Heavier jet engines with high temperature limits, or ISP for high-bypass engines.

It\u0027s maddening that a 3.75m airliner cabin about 5\u00A0meters long can only transport 16 people (2.5-foot kerbals) to the Island runway, when the real life version common on B-737s or A-320s fits 36 people (6-foot humans)\u00A0in a smaller space, with extra room for fuel and cargo, to boot. Equally maddening is the fact that the same cabin is viable for permanent habitation, when IRL, having a home with 1 square meter of floor space per person would be considered oppressive, and would probably lead to mass suicide and murder and terrible disease, with people not having room to lay down without being in contact with someone else. The most crowded habitation modules I\u0027ve encountered in person are college dorms with 3 people in 13.3 m^2. Disease spreads like wildfire and outside time is essentially required for sanity. You absolutely cannot store 13 people in 13 square meters of floorspace indefinitely without running your reputation into the ground. Even putting 3 in there was controversial, considering that it\u0027s 4 times more crowded than officially \u0022overcrowded\u0022 housing. Also, there\u0027s no bathroom included. That would have to be separate, as it is in college dorms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, we\u0027re at a dilemma and Squad has chosen an unusual and unclear solution. A mk3 passenger module could, in reality, hold 40 humans plus cargo and fuel for a short flight, but only 4 humans, if that, for a multi-month excursion. It holds 16, for some reason. I propose we have multiple different setups, with short-term airliner-style modules having realistically high capacity, but quickly eroding passenger comfort, causing them to eventually go berserk one by one. Likewise, larger low- capacity\u00A0modules allow passengers to live for months. Modules could also be designed for high or microgravity, with microgravity modules being more comfortable in microgravity, but uncomfortable under significant acceleration and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#6. Add more sizes of wings and complete the sizes that exist. I want modular FAT-455\u00A0wings, as well as wings and surfaces that are small and thin like the basic fins are. Additionally, most mk3 planes are big enough to make The current fat-455 airliner wings look downright dinky, and anything bigger makes them more useful as tailplanes. Really, the normal wings are optimized for 1.25m and mk2 craft. The Fat-455 are optimized for 2.5m craft, and nothing really exists for 3.75m\u002B craft, least not airliners or similar tube-\u0026amp;-wing designs. I would suggest several new sets of wings, a true 3.75m-sized wing series, a 5m-sized series, a 6.25m- sized series, a 7.5m-sized series, and a 10m-sized series, for those of us who want to build the biggest plane ever flown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd uh, well, I kinda ended up suggesting a spaceplane overhaul anyway.

With the new gizmos, it really is just a hassle that you have to circumvent in every design. As soon as I unlock the Oscar tank, I can \u0022surface attach\u0022 anything, anywhere(use gizmos on ISRU to make something \u0022look\u0022 attached to the unattachable ISRU sides).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s fine at the start of the tech tree, it limits where parts can be placed and that is great, until tier 3-4(?)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, VTOL engine sounds good.

Basic features (whatever the hell that means and we can debate that for the rest of our natural lives) should be in the basic game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can try to describe it by analogy from fallout 4 and the settlements system there. The basegame allows for you to manually assign every single settler with gear, weapons, armor and to a specific task. Which is fine... til you have to do that 10 times 20 times. Sure, any minute now you can probably find a mod that can automatically equip settlers with specific gear, weapons, armor depending on their task... but I think that kinda functionality kinda belongs in the game itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo offence to modders who do absolutely awesome and amazing things and not just in ksp, but you shouldn\u0027t have to cover for developers or be the unpaid backup (I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case with ksp at all, but I could be a little worried in the case of fo4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0number\u00A04\u00A0thing could probably be construed as a small thing ... but it\u0027s not... it needs to be done in a way that matches the wonderfull style of ksp and i don\u0027t envy anyone with that task and I can understand why a story was cut...
