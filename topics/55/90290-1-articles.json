It\u0027s not which craft. It may just be me, but I would rather prefer a top speed for the engines (preferably roughly mach 3 or a little bit more, as it would be somewhat realistic). I do think that jet engines are a little overpowered but the suggested change seems to me like approaching the problem from the wrong site. But maybe I\u0027m requesting too much realism here\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
