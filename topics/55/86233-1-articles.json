Like say, orbiting the Mun unlocks the docking ports, or landing on Duna unlocks the radial chutes. It could be done in such a way that you either know you have to go to Duna to get the radial chutes or it could be a surprise. Or, integrate it with the Easter Eggs, or Munar/Minmus/other body biomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Looking at the [Easter Egg here], you were suddenly struck with inspiration for a new part.\u0022 When arriving back at KSC, you go to the R \u0026amp; D facility to find out what it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t think this fell under the what not to suggest, because I wasn\u0027t asking for new parts or a re-arranging of the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
