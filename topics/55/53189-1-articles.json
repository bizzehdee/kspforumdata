So its trajectory is slightly asymmetrical. - as it wont interact or collide with any other celestial body it can therefore be put on rails along with all the other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will speed up as it approaches the inner planets and slow down as it travels out in to deep space (not sure if the rails model can account for this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has a decent gravitational well maybe stronger than Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECometry tail optional (something to be added when rings and clouds come in to play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will not have a low resonance with any planets (such as 1:1 or 1:2 etc) but will have predictable close encounters with the other planets (once its orbital duration is worked out I\u0027m pretty sure most experts here will be able to work out when it will come close to such-n-such planet for an orbital transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough getting the delta-v for the comet would take a lot from Kerbal KSON\u0027s gravitational pull will help save some delta-v to get to other planets so it might be a good option to use the comet to hitch-hike to other planets - also getting a permanent base on a comet would be pretty awesome - a fuel depot in low comet orbit passing through the solar system would be pretty sweet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T09:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESticky: \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[Official]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E What not to suggest?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe universe\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew stars, planets, moons and asteroids\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite sure comets fall into that category, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T09:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad has said that they might add a comet at some point, after they\u0027ve added more gas giants and planets.
