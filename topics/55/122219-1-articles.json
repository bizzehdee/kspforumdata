I know it said it was not or shelved but it would allow lots of more things in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part is super complex and in career it is the last thing to unlock, It can have certain parts on the inside lowered and raised for maybe like grass hills and it has a sea level thickness level setting so if you lower the land it could have lakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part would be very fun to have in the game and be very useful for long waits and space stations, the sea level is a separate object in unity and has super complex coding with could be used for the normal Kerben and other liquid oceans/lakes, if the material is grass each pod has a setting for seeds which Kerbals can plant which also comes with new types of powerful lights men\u0027t for lighting up the whole place. The part has 85 crash resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Water could float around if the gravity is lower than 0.05G, turning into multiple entities/objects with distorted models each for 2 pieces for each 1 ton of water, The glass can also be stained and each Kerbal has a right click function called plant seed which only works on that part. On land of Kerben or other planets with plants it would say \u0022This place already has plants and has no need for more.\u0022,(Mainly so it doesn\u0027t have lag issues).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope to see this added sense I needed it a lot for my space stations and other people might want it too for their\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the bad order I am not that good at grammar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T12:25:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t get it, but if you construct a ring, and rotate it, you\u0027ll have artificial gravity.
