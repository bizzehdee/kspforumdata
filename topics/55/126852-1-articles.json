They are, by design, entirely incapable of reentry or landing on Kerbin\u0027s surface, however, to save delta-V on return to Kerbin, I have outfitted them with heatshields to allow them to aerobrake into LKO. However, since ablator is a limited resource, I have had to implement the heatshields with docking ports so that they can be detached, discarded, and replaced when the ablator runs out. My first idea is this: Engineers could have a \u0022Replace heatshield\u0022 ability, wherein you could launch a spaceplane with a heatshield on board to rendezvous with a vessel with a depleted heatshield. The engineer could then use his ability to swap the heatshields with each other (which would probably be implemented in game as just having ablator moved from one to the other). This would allow heatshields for non-landable vessels to be integrated into the vessel, rather than having to be docked to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe motivation for my second idea is as follows: I have an obsolete translunar shuttle that uses parts from several levels down the tech tree from where I currently am and is inadequate to my current needs, delta-V wise. I plan to have it dock in a spaceplane cargo bay, at which point the spaceplane would ferry it back to the KSC. The problem is that launching such vessels tends to require that the back end of the spacecraft be propped up with struts in the spaceplane cargo bay, or else the docking joint bends under the weight of the spacecraft and the back end of the spacecraft clips through the belly of the spaceplane. Therefore, I propose that engineers be given an ability to place a limited number of struts between two docked vessels to support deorbit operations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy third idea is this: With current parts my shuttles have to have their engines and heatshields at opposite ends of the spacecraft. Game-mechanically this is fine, but it bugs me a bit, because I keep thinking of my poor Kerbals having to restow everything between an aerobrake and subsequent circularization burn, lest things secured against acceleration in one direction come loose during acceleration in the other direction. It would be really nice to have a heat shield part with a hole in it that can be covered for aerobraking and then uncovered to serve as an exhaust port for an engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-02T08:06:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your first Idea, I would like a part called a \u0022Part Box\u0022 or something or other. They would hold 3 \u0022parts\u0022. An engineer\u00A0could EVA near one, right click \u0022take part\u0022 and use that 1 part they grabbed\u00A0to either \u0022refill\u0022 400 abalator(this would be imagined as replacing burned out tiles or something), repair a Tire, or fix\u00A0a broken solar panel. You could\u00A0rendezvous in orbit and refill a \u0022part box\u0022 by docking with another part box craft, or have an engineer EVA back and fourth 3 times carrying parts to refill it.
