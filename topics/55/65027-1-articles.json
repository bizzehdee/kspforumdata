It would be great though, if there would be the same logic as for all rocket engines which offer toggle as well as Shutdown and Activate actions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is, when you assemble big entities, lets say space stations, \u0022space trains\u0022, bases on surfaces etc. and you dock rovers you usually want to be sure that all engines are shut off as long as you don\u0027t need them to avoid accidents or them sucking all your power because someone found it funny to have the idle setting for rover wheels in a different position than for all other engines. So to make sure, all engines are off in a situation where multiple rovers are docked to something, it would really be nice to have them two actions added. If you use toggle, then one rover would switch engines off while the others already docked would switch theirs on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
