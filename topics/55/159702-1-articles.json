It is currency to buy parts, and as such so-called \u0022biomes\u0022 (really \u0022geomes\u0022 as there is no biology involved) shouldn\u0027t really buy you new tech.

We\u0027ve talked about this before, but I don\u0027t mind science points at all as an abstraction. Having multiple currencies creates multiple\u00A0strategic avenues. If you only have funds then doing the thing that makes the most money is always the best strategy and all deviation comes at a cost. With science points you have the option to design your missions not just around how lucrative they are, but how much they enable you to tech up. Im not too fussed about how tightly game elements adhere to reality. Castles don\u0027t move in reality, but chess wouldn\u0027t be much fun if rooks couldn\u0027t move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-24T17:02:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2017 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-24T18:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223032912\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159702\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493050161\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally?
