Of course there are other ways to generate electricity, but the matter is that a radioactive core cannot generate anything but heat and radiation and when it is not producing thrust, it\u0027s better to keep it inactive and cool, therefore not generating anything that could be turned to electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course KSP is a game and in games anything is possible but I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a reason for LV-N to act also as an eternal electricity generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat -might- help would be an engine which burns fuel, generates electricity, but produces no thrust.

On a mass basis, at least for Mars missions solar panels make more sense than bimodal NTR. Bimodal NTR uses very low efficiency thermoelectric conversion cells, and requires heavy radiator mechanisms. In reality radiators are prone to breaking down (as we have seen on the ISS), but manual repairs in the immediate vicinity of a nuclear reactor are completely out of the questions for safety reasons. Solid state radiators are even less efficient on a per mass basis than the ammonia cooled ones. For these reasons, among others, the most recent NASA Mars design reference mission uses nuclear thermal for propulsion, and solar to generate electricity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR; Keep the LV-N like NERVA unless there is a waste heat management dynamic added to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat I would like to see is the LV-N running on liquid fuel only, without oxidizer.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconded!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T01:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022architeuthis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022architeuthis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETLDR; Keep the LV-N like NERVA unless there is a waste heat management dynamic added to the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoh...
