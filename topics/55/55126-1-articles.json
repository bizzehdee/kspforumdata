(a kerbal wouldn\u0027t ask for a vacation after a twenty minute aircraft flight, but he\u0027ll certainly need some R\u0026amp;R after a three year interplanetary tour. Perhaps it wouldn\u0027t be required, but if they spend too much time in space, you may find yourself on the receiving end of angry letters from spouses, notices of resignation, and eventually lawsuits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps a kerbal could have some sort of \u0027job satisfaction\u0027 meter that would be affected by that kerbal\u0027s family life (visible before hiring), personality, salary (as if), and time spent in space. doing things that they\u0027ve never done (landing on a new planet, working with new people, etc.) could help, so if you keep him satisfied with novelty, you won\u0027t have too much risk. it could be helped much better by letting the poor guy get a vacation every couple of missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T01:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure this needs to be a attribute/statistic/meter.

As you pointed out, these are differing points-of-view on minor points. Regardless, I don\u0027t think the game would be improved by the addition of the mechanics you described in the response post that I addressed above (kerbals quitting on personality or risk of XXX for using a kerbal too much) and would prefer not to see kerbal fatigue implemented in that fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther, I don\u0027t see disagreement as escalation.
