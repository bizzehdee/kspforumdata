KSP already teaches a lot, but its more concepts rather than the actual math behind the force, drag, lift, trajectories, etc. The features included in KerbalEdu are ones I would like to be in the game, but just inserting them in may be intrusive to those who are not looking for that kind of experience. Since we already have Career, Science, and Sand Box mode, would it be possible to also have a KerbalEdu mode? It just seems like a missed opportunity to have an educational video game thats actually fun become more widespread (here I\u0027m considering KerbalEdu as separate from KSP).\n\n[http://kerbaledu.com](http://kerbaledu.com)"},{"CreatedByName":"CyberDroog","CreatedById":113839,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:56:45Z","Content":"Going even further with basic education would be interesting also, though it would probably take another development team. It occurred to me after I downloaded a program called BigBrainz ([http://www.bigbrainz.com/](http://www.bigbrainz.com/)) for my kids. It teaches basic math skills in a video game environment. Wrapping that same concept up in a Kerbal framework would be awesome. Kerbal Academy might be a good name. Parents might be encouraged to buy KSP if it had such basic education training in an add-on module. Make the kids work on math for a set period and then they get to play KSP in sandbox mode."}]}
