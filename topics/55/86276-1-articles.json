Sure you right clicked the engine, but the button to turn it on drifts further and further away as you chase it down. Finally! You clicked it! But only because the camera doesn\u0027t chase the now destroyed craft...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about, no matter what the camera is doing, when you right click an action part, such as a parachute, engine, etc., that new window freezes in its initial position so its easy to click the button? You should know what part you clicked on, and if you don\u0027t, then how about turning off this function in the settings? Maybe the only time the window should move with the item is: a) when it is toggled off in settings; \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E when you are controlling the camera with right click drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also consider having it so the camera still does its thing, but the rotation is not based on a central point on the craft. Instead, it is now, temporarily, centered on the clicked part. That way, the menu does not move at all, but the camera rotates accordingly until the menu is clicked off/away. Once the center point is back to the craft, the angle of the camera is still where it last was, but the focus point changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-07T01:06:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2014 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Friend Bear\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T00:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yes.
