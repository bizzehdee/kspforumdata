Like if i explore the oceans of Kerban and I find fish i should be able to put them into a canister or payload in this building and then bring it in as a Sub-Assembly and launch it to test. Much like the 0.22 trailer video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quasarrgames","CreatedById":91692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T02:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like that idea. However we would need special equipment in order to collect the samples, and we would probably have to collect them individually and store them. Perhaps fish would be a bit too useless, unless we find out that Laythe has fish and we can clone them. But perhaps rock samples from planets could be used. Either they could be converted into pure science once recovered from Kerbin, or they could be stored in the new building and put into future missions to send to other planets to observe the reaction to create even MOAR science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust idea. never thought about it before. could have lots of potential.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Abomber544","CreatedById":88296,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T02:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks I didn\u0027t think of reusable life on other planets!
