This causes problem for spaceplanes, since they will have their center of mass shift rearwards to the engines when they are empty. To improve realism, improve spaceplane balancing, and to reduce the effectiveness of intake spam, I think air intakes should be made heavier, and jet exhaust ports made correspondingly lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose in a real jet engine, a somewhat bigger portion of the weight should be at the intake? that\u0027s where all the compressor\\shockwave reflector\\precooler is. More weight is probably in the middle at the combustion chamer, with the exhaust port being relatively light as it only contains the servos for the vector thrust system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if stock jet intakes are made heavier and stock jet exhausts made lighter, it simulate the engine\u0027s center of mass being in middle of the engine. This would make the game more realistic, improve balancing for space planes as they run empty, and weaken the intake spamming exploit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T07:29:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 07:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by goduranus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T09:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll aircraft parts (wings, intakes, even landing wheels) are extremely light, I assume the reason was that spaceplanes were refusing to lift off without that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this will get fixed somewhere around the time when more reasonable aerodynamics is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-30T15:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^True, but wouldn\u0027t be an issue if you made the air-breathing engines proportionally lighter.
