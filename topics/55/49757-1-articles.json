IRL, we learn a lot by dropping a probe in a planet\u0027s atmosphere and expecting it to crash/be crushed. That should still count for something in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I love the idea of experiments as a resource. Something to be conveyed to and from a lunar/orbiting base. It helps to push players to create a multiple-launch-and-docking-challenge of a space station, and then gain rewards by ferrying experiments to it. I guess it should, like all science, have a decaying reward value. So after your 10th or 20th experiment (depending on where you are, and how much you gain per experiment), you just don\u0027t learn anything more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd perhaps if you research and unlock a shiny new science part, now you can dock it to your space station for more science-y rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
