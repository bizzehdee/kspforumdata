The icy planes of Minmus would cause craft to slide around, you could have muddy/swampy flats that could absolutely strand a vessel, hard rocky surfaces that could be a bit more rough on gear, etc. Obviously planets could have safer zones (or not), but it could add some fun drama to the landing/exploration process. I have to think it wouldn\u0027t be much of a stretch to adapt the current water code to make this happen- I wonder if even mod-level code could do this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T08:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOmg this would be so cool!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
