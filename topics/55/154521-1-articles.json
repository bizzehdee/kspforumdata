So, here\u0027s my (incomplete) list of things i think would make a more perfect KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBigger, Better main \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I\u0027d really love to see the runway we have now, be a little longer, a touch wider, and better/properly marked and lit. I\u0027d also like to see multiple runways...we have a runway for east/west, why not another for north/south?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMultiple usable KSP bases. Now, i know about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E 2, but it\u0027s kinda crap, let\u0027s face it. Why not have a few bases around Kerbin? Like proper bases, with proper runways, and facilities.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCareer needs an overhaul. While i have not played career yet, i have read about it, and talked to players, and not many of you seem to think stock career is very good. Why not a story-based career? I\u0027ve read that Squad, at one point had a basic lore developed for the game. I think they should take those ideas, and create a story, and then rework the career mode, to incorporate the story, along with suggestions from you folks, to enhance the gameplay experience. I mean, as is, is there actually any real goal in career? is there a point? What is the incentive to complete it?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nACTUAL controller/gamepad support. Sometimes, you just wanna kick back, and fly your creations. It would be really great if there was a controller menu, specifically for gamepads. I know you can assign controls through the keybindings, but they don\u0027t always work correctly, plus, it\u0027s a pain to do. For something like this, simplicity is key. You go to the menu, assign your controls, and then go fly....\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBetter MOD support/implementation/integration. There should be an official Mod Manager... For those of you who are familiar with the Fallout 3 modding community, i\u0027m talking something like NMM....an application that actually manages your mods. Install/uninstall, Update, comparability checks, the works. And it should be integrated with a site that acts as an official repository for mods, like nexusmods is for the NMM. This would make using mods a hell of a lot simpler, and far less easy to screw up. Before you ask, yes, i know about the existence of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, but from what i\u0027ve read, it\u0027s lacking...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMultiplayer. Now, i can already hear the wailing, and gnashing of teeth, at the idea of multiplayer in KSP.....but think about it. Haven\u0027t you ever wished you had another kerbal in the cockpit with you, to delegate tasks to? wouldn\u0027t it be great to have some help building your huge space station, or planetary base? Could be fun....especially with the ability for players to set up a dedicated/private server, and people could pop in and out, and contribute..\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBetter soundtrack. It\u0027s not that i hate royalty-free music, or Kevin MacLeod...but it\u0027s not unique to the game. It would be better, i think, if all of the game\u0027s music was done in-house...or hire Kevin to do a soundtrack just for KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure i\u0027ll come up with more, but i\u0027d also love to hear what you guys think, and if you have anything to add...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, in case there\u0027s a thread like this already, i just want to say, i didn\u0027t see it (i did look), and while i did try to do a search, for whatever reason, the search tool on this forum isn\u0027t so good (doesn\u0027t work most of the time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magzimum","CreatedById":167187,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T13:58:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBigger better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E: Yes.

While i have not played career yet, i have read about it, and talked to players, and not many of you seem to think stock career is very good. Why not a story-based career? I\u0027ve read that Squad, at one point had a basic lore developed for the game. I think they should take those ideas, and create a story, and then rework the career mode, to incorporate the story, along with suggestions from you folks, to enhance the gameplay experience. I mean, as is, is there actually any real goal in career? is there a point? What is the incentive to complete it?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.

Sorry not a native speaker...) generated solar system for every new career (and leave the familiar system as a common ground for everyone to play and compete in sandbox). And then just only showing the basic orbital information about the planets at first. So you would actually have to send probes to the planets to take photos/map the planets to find out more about their size, composition, atmosphere and possible moons and stuff.\u00A0That way it would be infinitely replayable and you would have the same \u0022excitement\u0022 of discovering something new every time.
