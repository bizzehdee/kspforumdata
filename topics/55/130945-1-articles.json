So firstly will rovers be prone to spinning out. Does this mean that steering a lot to a side will spin you out and not do wonky stuff. Does this mean that Infinitraction will be fixed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-29T04:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not that they will be prone to spinning out, it\u0027s that they will be more likely to spin out or \u0022drift\u0022 rather than the whole rover suddenly rolling over like it does now.\u00A0 It should behave more like a real car, not impossible to roll over but not as likely as skidding the tires.\u00A0 Of course this would all depend on how you build it, but if you are building something low to the ground and wider/longer rather than taller it should behave more realistically.\u00A0 It will still be possible to build the SUV of rovers and roll it though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-29T04:59:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2016 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
