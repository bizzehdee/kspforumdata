Space is big and I dont see a lot of meteors being in the same loaded radius around your ship at once unless you are collecting them. I suspect though that they are a single part as far as physics calculations are concerned so it shouldnt be that big a deal. They did say that they wouldnt be \u0027on rails\u0027 so they may be setting it up to process when you are not focused, im interested to see if that translates over to debris from your ships and if they will no longer be on rails when you arnt focused on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for fragments, well i think they can just pulverize on impact and disappear or be indestructible and ricochet off each other in some manner. so there shouldnt be fragments\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T17:53:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMostly man-made, but during the shuttle program there were more than 1900 documented debris impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-19T17:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should only put asteroids and maybe other particles in asteroid belts and planetary rings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deta","CreatedById":100348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T00:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rhoark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rhoark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMostly man-made, but during the shuttle program there were more than 1900 documented debris impacts.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EI remember the paint chip in the window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
