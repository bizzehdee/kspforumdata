Along with that a bi coupler version would also be great. In both instances one may not need or want the weight and length of the current parts, but it looks terrible to attach smaller parts to the ends of MK II parts directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamShanky","CreatedById":127299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T01:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh man.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese ideas are great.
