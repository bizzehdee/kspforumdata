For example, a contract gives you 20 science points. You can then buy into a strategy that would give you up to, say, 50 % more science for a significant cost (i.e. for this contract up to a max of 30 science points), and the cost would increase exponentially for every percent of science you would get extra. Space programs with plenty of money would obviously get a lot more science, but even then only at most 1.5 times that of the original contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.9 i find money the main constraint. Science is easy to get, you get lots from contracts and Minmus / Mun is an easy source, here money is the main constraint as you need upgrades to be able to harvest it fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ctbram","CreatedById":99635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T13:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the other strategies are way under powered to the point of being useless! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.1 funds per 1 rep or 8.1 funds per 1 science is just as horrible as outsourced science but in the opposite direction! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, what orifice are they pulling these ratios out of? 7.1 to 1 for rep and 8.1 to 1 for science? You get rep at a rate of about 1/1000 of science yet they give you a lower ratio for rep then science? Secondly about 7 or 8 to 1 for either is way to low. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have completely the entire tech tree and have barely over 900 rep. That would yield 6390 funds in an entire career run! And then lets look at the investment ratio. Only .1 increase per 5% additional investment!!! So if I put 100% investment of rep I\u0027d go from 7.1 to 9 funds per rep. So for the same 900 rep I\u0027d have gained 8100 funds. That is only a 28% increase for 20 times the investment???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience for funds is just as bad. Lets say you need roughly 20,000 to complete the entire tech tree. at 100% investment that would yield about 200,000 funds. Barely enough for a level 0 to level 1 upgrade of a single building by the time you have completed the entire tech tree!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last two strategies are also pretty useless. Why would I trade funds or science for rep? As far as I can see rep is pretty useless. The last strat the ratio of science or rep you have to give up to reduce launch costs or recovery costs are also just not worth it. Even at 100 percent you get barely a dent on the affect of your entire program. Therefore, outsourced research is the only strat the makes any sense at all and as pointed out that strat is OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I would say to the devs fix the six broken strategies and then focus on the one that is OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T13:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ctbram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T17:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about you guys, but I \u003Cem\u003Ehate\u003C/em\u003E grinding for science.

It requires 160 rep on each launch. It is far easier to farm rep than science and fund. I take good rep missions first, spend some expensive rockets, recover them while on launching pad. I will gain that %40 funds from recovery out of thin air. When I use up my rep, I go to my mission ship and gain rep back easily. This game is on hard setting and I have over 150 million funds.
