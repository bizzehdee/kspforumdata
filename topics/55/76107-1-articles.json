YES, I know automated pilots are on the do not suggest but this is different as you actually have to do the same thing before hand! This could be a thing unlocked late in the tech tree and would be great for people who standardize launch vehicles and, with some work, even a few landers! Actually, it would be very cool if you could add data storage to allow for deep space automated flights and also get the ability to write a program for your probe(as most of the stuff needed for this would already be there). Yea I know flying the craft is half the fun, but for the most part with this system you still get the chance to experience it! You could even fly and record more flights to get the maximum efficiency possible for the launch of your spacecraft! Well, I have no clue where this will go but tell me what you think!!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
