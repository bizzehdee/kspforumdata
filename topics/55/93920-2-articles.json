While that\u0027s probably not enough of a cost, I hope that as things develop a little more the \u0022problem\u0022 is fixed by increasing that cost, not by requiring me to launch a whole new flight back to the same exact place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wish there was a better UI for showing what the requirements of a contract are, both in the contract screen and when in flight. Scrolling up and down a ridiculously narrow text box that is also not tall enough and has teeny little text looking for extremely specific sets of instructions that look a lot like all of the other instructions in the list is horrendous. I will happily \u0022exploit\u0022 the easy contracts as long as the harder ones are harder mostly because of bad UI design instead of difficult gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T07:42:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 07:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T12:34:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that the \u0022science data from space\u0022 contracts problem could be solved by making a couple of adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s important that newer players get to play these \u0022easier\u0022 lucrative contracts as they are just starting out, but I think there should be a set limit to the number of times they can be used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that maybe there could be more restrictive stipulations included in the contracts.
