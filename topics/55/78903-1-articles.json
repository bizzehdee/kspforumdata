His lander, while it has the ability to return to Kerbin eventually, is designed primarily to work in conjunction with an orbital research station some 30km above the surface of Kerbin\u0027s second moon. The lab would further analyse the Science brought up so that the transmission value is very much increased, meaning that multiple landers need not be launched, thus saving our funds. Anyway, Rayke gathers a wealth of Science, proceeds back into orbit, and docks with the station. Expecting his bountiful haul of science to be almost completely transmitted, the crew are quite pleased.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThat is until they realised they\u0027d only get a meager 12% or 15% boost on the transmission values.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat.

It\u0027s not often that I have a problem with KSP; usually I\u0027m yelling at the Kraken to try and get it to go running off with its metaphorical tail between its metaphorical legs, but this... this is annoying me. Why does this state-of-the-art laboratory module not have the ability to boost the transmission values of collected Science to acceptable values? Another 12% on top of what is already 20% or 30% of the potential Science is rather poor. The best value I did see was a 25% boost for a temperature reading, and while halfway decent, it still wasn\u0027t good enough considering the cost of putting this station into orbit around Minmus for a very distinct purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I\u0027d expect \u003Cem\u003Eat the very least\u003C/em\u003E a 45% increase on transmission values, with most being 50% or above. That may seem overpowered, but think about when you\u0027re venturing out to the planets; you don\u0027t want to go back and forth between Kerbin and Duna just to study each of the different biomes of the Red Planet (when such biomes are introduced on Duna and the other planets/moons), but you don\u0027t want to have gone all the way out into deep space only to get a few pitifully small transmission values before heading home having exhausted the Science potential of the planet/moon you spent a lot of cash visiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut simply, I think the Lab is considerably underpowered at the moment. I certainly don\u0027t want the lab to become OP, but I do believe that bumping up the transmission boosts to the values I suggested would be beneficial. Otherwise, in it\u0027s current iteration, it\u0027s a near-useless piece of equipment. I\u0027m not sure if there are plans to rectify this at any point, or if this is just your run-of-the-mill lab and we\u0027ll have shinier super-labs in the future, but whatever it is, this is the only lab we have at the moment and it is unfit for purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may think I\u0027m insane to suggest any of this, but please be civilised with your death threats towards me (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E), and if possible, try to have a decent discussion.
