Since physics have to be calculated for every single part in a ship, it really limits you imagination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei suggest keeping the VAB and SPH, but when you build a ship from 100 parts, they weld in less than 5. You combine multiple parts wi different functions into one. A pod with and engine and fuel tank attached becomes a single part ship with right-clock options like \u0022disable engine\u0022 and fuel transfer. The current masses of each part are combined on welding. This is very simple to achieve and would make the game run 90% faster!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T05:05:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately that would also make them essentially indestructible, removing one of the major challenges from the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T05:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would also kind of ruin the game\u0027s semi-realistic physics.
