Then I thought of an idea for KSP\u0027s career mode. I\u0027m just doing this off the top of my head so the next paragraph/s could be lengthy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start a new game, the \u0027government\u0027 (or whatever you want to call it) will give you some funds in the form of a government grant. This will allow you to build your first rocket to collect some science for Kerbalkind! At the end of the mission, after you get your science report, the government will give you more cash based on something like Basic Grant \u002B Money for Science - Money taken for losing Kerbals. The government will never give you less than a certain amount of money, so that you can always afford to build a small rocket at least. You will gain money for collecting Science, more money for more Science, less money for less Science. When you lose Kerbals, you will get less money for a while (3 missions maybe?), until the loss is \u0027forgotten\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you can get more money by accepting and completing missions, e.g. orbit Kerbin at least once, put a Kerbal on the Mun, send a robotic lander to Duna, etc. If you accept the mission, you will get a small amount of bonus money to help you along in completing the mission, then once you fulfill the objective, you get the rest of the money. I know that the money you get for simply accepting the mission could be abused and used for other things, so if you don\u0027t complete the mission in the next few launches, then the money that you collected for accepting the mission will be deducted on the next few government grant, e.g. I get a bonus of $60K for accepting the mission but I don\u0027t do it, so the next three grants I get have $20K deducted from them to make up for the $60K that I \u0027stole\u0027. The missions should be kind of like real-life missions, e.g. Vostok 1, which put the first human into space; Apollo 11, which put two humans on the moon; Mars Climate Orbiter, which actually crashed but was supposed to orbit around Mars, etc. Maybe there can be a \u0027rival\u0027 space agency (Kerbiets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) that your government is competing against? Maybe?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system isn\u0027t perfect and I haven\u0027t really worked everything out yet, but any thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
