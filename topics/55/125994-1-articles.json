Lets say you want to make a science probe for example, and you want to put the four main science modules on to it (accelerometer, gravioli detector, thermometer, and barometer), and you want to distribute them such that they are symmetrically placed. Currently, you have to place them one by one and try to tell whether or not they\u0026#39;re symmetrical by eye. What if there was some way to quickly select the objects you want and distribute them symmetrically? For example, what if you could press R in the editor to cycle through to \u0022multi-part symmetry (radial)\u0022 or \u0022multi-part symmetry (mirror)\u0022, and then you can select your parts using a modifier key (like holding alt perhaps). In radial symmetry mode, the amount of parts you select will determine your symmetry amount (for example, 3 parts = 3 way symmetry).\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T22:32:52Z","Content":"\nIf you put them on with angle snap, it\u0026#39;s pretty easy to get them symmetrical. Those parts don\u0026#39;t really need to be though, they are \u0022massless\u0022 which means their mass is added to the root part they are attached to and therefore do not offset the center of mass at all. The mystery goo and the Atmosphere scanner are the only exceptions for radial science I believe.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T22:36:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 10:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T23:33:07Z","Content":"\nInteresting idea, and I can see how it may be handy in some cases. Though, for reasons given by Alshain above, probably not enough benefit to be worth the devs time to implement.\n"}]}
