They were going to use a store bought model with the same scientific value as Mysterious Goo Tm. However after putting more thought and effort into it, kerbal engineers were able to release a far more usefull non-storebought version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too feel that the thermometer and barometer should be sooner. This is only because I have spent the last 15 hours or so just exploring kerbin taking various temperature and pressure readings in various biomes at different times of day(not that you get any bonus science for this I just like to RP like in sandbox) . Theres so much to see on Kerbin but i never bothered to look in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T17:14:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 05:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
