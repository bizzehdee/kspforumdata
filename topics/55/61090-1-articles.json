There\u0027s docking, and EVA, and IVA and unmanned flight as well as manned. There\u0027re facial expression animations and algorithms, animations for ground crew in the construction scenes, background animations for those scenes, science and transmitting data, and storing EVA and crew reports along with soil samples and any other scientific report. You can transmit data, or keep it and recover your craft. We\u0027ve got parachutes (also fairly crude) and control surfaces, and wheels for rovers and planes. We\u0027ve got fuel transfer and SABREs (i.e., the RAPIER), along with LFEs, SRBs, and plain ol\u0027 jet engines. There\u0027s distinction for night and day, and fully functioning solar panels, not to mention RTGs, ion engines and fuels and oxidisers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they attempt to transfer the code responsible for all that (plus all I haven\u0027t mentioned yet; there\u0027s lots more, especially behind the scenes stuff that\u0027s unnoticed by still very much necessary) to another engine, they\u0027d basically have to re-code probably somewhere between 40%-80% of it in order to make it compatible with the new engine. That means we\u0027d likely be sitting on our hands for a good six months to a year, or more, while we wait to see whether it was even worth the wait, much less actually making improvements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, to the best of my knowledge, Unity is one of the most comprehensive engines for computer games that exists. If they, for example, switched to the physics engine which I believe is known as Bullet, there are a great many things that would need coding from scratch that originally didn\u0027t need to be coded in the first place, as it was all handled by Unity. \u003Cem\u003EPlus\u003C/em\u003E, there is a good chance that KSP may go up in price in order to pay for some kind of ridiculously expensive licence on the engine; Unity\u0027s pretty lenient on the licencing pricing, last I heard. (But naturally, it depends on the engine and who\u0027s developing it, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you look at the track record of games that switched engines even once -- or even more rarely, more than once -- it really does not bode well at all.
