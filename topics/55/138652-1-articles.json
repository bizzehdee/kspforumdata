There\u0027s been some complaining on these forums and other KSP related forums because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be possible for Squad to make old versions of KSP still available so that Steam customers could choose when to to upgrade to a new version? Europa Universalis does this by making old versions available on Steam via the beta menu options.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch a system would allow players to hold off on updating until they felt it was stable enough, or until their favourite mods were compatible, etc. It would also greatly reduce negative posts from people in the immediate aftermath of new releases and hopefully spare the developers from what I imagine can be very disheartening feedback right after they\u0027ve worked really hard to get a release out of the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
