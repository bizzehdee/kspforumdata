By right clicking them, you can toggle whether they are shown in the tracking station / map view. This will not remove them from the \u0022flights in progress\u0022 number attached to your save, and you cannot hide individual ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for simply removing flags from the tracking station list, it works well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T23:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight clicking the tabs only temporarily hides a catagory. As soon as you come back to the map a second time they\u0027re all visible again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can think of two ways to remove individual flights from the map:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Kill the ship. Remove the flight completely. But doing this there is no turning back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Label the ship as debris. Debris is not displayed by default but can be displayed by clicking the debris tab. When you ever decide you want to use the craft again just label it back to ship, lander, station or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
