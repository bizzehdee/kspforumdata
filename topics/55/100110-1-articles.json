I know the mods want to keep the politics out of things so I will just say some people are not the gender they are born, and may wish to identify as a different gender. That said, KSP is on the cusp of unveiling the new female kerbals. Now I dont know how that will work, or what will happen, but I am assuming there will be gendered name lists when kerbals are recruited in the astronaut center. That is why I feel now is the time to make this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a member of the LGBT community, I was wondering if maybe like 1 out of every 20 or so male kerbals could get a female name, and vice-versa for the females. pre-transition mis-gendered persons like myself would appreciate that. That is all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T14:40:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment there are just a ton of randomly picked names (most of which are male).
