I know the mods want to keep the politics out of things so I will just say some people are not the gender they are born, and may wish to identify as a different gender. That said, KSP is on the cusp of unveiling the new female kerbals. Now I dont know how that will work, or what will happen, but I am assuming there will be gendered name lists when kerbals are recruited in the astronaut center. That is why I feel now is the time to make this suggestion.\n\nAs a member of the LGBT community, I was wondering if maybe like 1 out of every 20 or so male kerbals could get a female name, and vice-versa for the females. pre-transition mis-gendered persons like myself would appreciate that. That is all."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T14:40:28Z","Content":"At the moment there are just a ton of randomly picked names (most of which are male). So occasionally this gives female names to male kerbals.\n\nI assume what will happen is some more female names will be added along with the new models but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the name selector kept just handing out random names."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T14:49:50Z","Content":"I think names should be utterly random for non-unique kerbals. Male names and female names get thrown together into a share pool and every kerbal get one, no matter who they are."},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T15:34:53Z","Content":"Keeping it random is the best policy. Making specific ratios is unnecessary. One pool for everyone is simple and the best solution so you can get any gender with any name."},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T22:00:17Z","Content":"Agreed, randomness is the best way to go. Most randomly generated names are fairly non-gender specific, anyway. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T00:13:37Z","Content":"If specific names or anything are tied to specific biological features it becomes prejudice. I hope the \u0022female kerbals\u0022 thing just means the kerbals are going to have a more varied body type, and it doesn\u0027t affect gameplay whether its about names, skills, or how frequently each body type appears."}]}
