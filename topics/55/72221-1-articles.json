Have you ever wondered what the point of having those two options are? Well, the way I see it, this could be resolved very easily. If you instead have Revert to Launch be Revert to Liftoff, then instead of reverting back to the time when the spacecraft loaded, you would revert back to the time when you pressed the spacebar to liftoff. The game already makes a distinction between landed and not landed, so that\u0027s a trivial matter!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what do you benefit? Well, if you are timing a launch window a certain way, you may have to fast forward for a long time in order to get there. If you then mess up and have to revert back to launch, you\u0027ll need to fast forward all over again! If you made a mistake in fast forwarding, you could revert to VAB then click launch, or add an intermediate option revert to spawn that functions pretty much how revert to launch does now. See how such a simple change would fix two problems at once? You\u0027d fix the silliness of having too respawn options mere seconds apart, and you\u0027d save some players the frustration of having to fast forward to tricky launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re welcome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: If you haven\u0027t launched yet, this revert to liftoff just would not appear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T23:34:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 11:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Echanged the title to satisfy some people.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T04:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eand you\u0027d save some players the frustration of having to fast forward to tricky launch windows.You\u0027re welcome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuicksave 10 seconds before you launch \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T05:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between revert to launch and revert to VAB is pressing that one green button in upper right corner and one substantial delay on scene change.
