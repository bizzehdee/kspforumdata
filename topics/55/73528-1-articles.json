Seriously, are you just joking with me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScaling up RTG\u0027s makes *absolutely no sense whatsoever*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MAIN reason we use RTG\u0027s, rather than nuclear reactors, is that they scale easily to small sizes (although it also helps from a political perspective when it\u0027s not *technically* a nuclear reactor). When the total mass of nuclear fuel becomes large enough, it becomes almost *necessary* to build a proper nuclear reactor- once you reach a thermal pile of sufficient mass, \u0022critical mass\u0022 is achieved and you experience a runaway nuclear reaction. An informal nuclear reactor (or a nuclear explosive, depending on the size/density of the pile) if you will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, this is *precisely* how the first nuclear reactors were built- as simple thermal piles of radioactive materials, to provide proof-of-concept for more advanced reactors...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in short, you would almost never want to scale up an RTG. You\u0027re MUCH better off building a proper reactor (which also produces a LOT more electricity for the mass...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, what he said. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, from a game play perspective bigger RTGs would be a bit cheaty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy question is, what are we doing with all this juice anyway? other than ion engines of course (and possibly that mining thing). what I\u0027m saying is I think they need to add some late game items/parts/functions that have bigger energy demands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eideas? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T22:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt Snuggler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emy question is, what are we doing with all this juice anyway? other than ion engines of course (and possibly that mining thing). what I\u0027m saying is I think they need to add some late game items/parts/functions that have bigger energy demands.\u003Cp\u003Eideas? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife Support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T22:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETwo words:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife Support\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and In-Situ Ressource Utilization, as well as long term science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-03T22:30:12Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2014 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Kaos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
