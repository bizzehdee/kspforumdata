They\u0027re sandbox, science and career modes, respectively. However, it\u0027s been suggested a number of times before that we should instead have a variety of toggle options when creating a new game. Like, if you want science to be a part of your game, check the box for it. If you want funding and contracts, check \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E box and so on. From there, there could potentially be sliders for like...how quickly(or slowly, for challenge) you earn science or funding, whether there\u0027s thermal damage to parts(if they ever add that feature) and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve always been in favor of that, especially after having spent a week or two playing Xcom Enemy Unknown/Within and Xenonauts really intensely.
