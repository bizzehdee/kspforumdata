It will consist in in-line or radial blocks with a moving mass in it to keep the center of gravity of the vessel in the most stable position possible with the center of thrust and the center of lift. It would be very useful for planes and space shuttles, allowing much better control of the craft ( how many times my nice crafts started going insane when the fuel started to be low... ), but also let the game be more gentle with \u0022exotic\u0022 looking creations without adding tons and tons of SAS blocks that weight too much and make the plane a pain to pilot when you want to turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, what do you think about it ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T15:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can pump fuel around the ship to change center of mass.

So it will consume lots of energy, make the plane ridiculously heavy and insanely reactive in every turning attempt. With a center of mass shifting section, it won\u0027t help you craft turning like a reaction wheel ( a 0.18 SAS block ), but it will only help at stabilizing the plane without turning it into a 500t spin machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t talk about those crazy robotic parts that make your craft explode when you time warp...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
