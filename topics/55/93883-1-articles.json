There\u0027s really no need to be rude about it. As for whether or not I mod, not for KSP no, however I am a fairly experienced programmer and am fully aware of what it takes to mod a game. In KSP it\u0027s incredibly easy due in no small part to almost everything having human-readable config files, which incidentally is not great for loading times. For most games, modding requires opening up DLL/SO/executable files in a suitable tool and examining the exported functions, and a hell of a lot of trial and error before releasing the mod as a binary-patched version of the DLL/SO/executable adding/removing/changing whatever. However, that does not make it impossible. Just look at minecraft - that even used obfuscation back in the day!
