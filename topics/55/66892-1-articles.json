Jool is huge so it really needs to hit a moon with darkness when it eclipses the sun. The sun shouldn\u0027t still shine and give you power when in Jool\u0027s shadow. Reminds me of Pitch Black lol but its actually a very similar situation. Actually all planetary bodies needs shadows. Past time for that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2)On that note, I was trying to look straight up on Leythe and couldn\u0027t. You need to be able to look straight up. You can look up sorta high, but not straight up. Should be able to tell noon by seeing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3)Water effects. The water right now is too wobbly and shifty looking and obviously so simple looking it has to be placeholder graphics. It\u0027s hard to even tell if you\u0027re steady right above it or not. It\u0027s badly in need of updating and needs to stay in place so we can reference it better when landing on it. Keep it still, but keep it interesting. Toss in some whitecaps, or even 3d waves if you dare. I\u0027m actually assuming by the time of final release the water will look 100x better, or atleast 10x \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E It makes total sense to me, moon mission is probably the biggest aspect of the game and water landings are a key aspect that needs drastic refinement. From a visual stand point think you just landed in the ocean, click Recover Vessel, compared to Apollo 13 omfg we made it home. Some capsules flooded and sank, how about simulating that?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-27T05:20:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2014 05:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T05:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad definitely needs to fix the part where solid metal plates float perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T06:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI fear that a lot of these placeholder mechanisms/things will not be adjusted anymore, as the focus has shifted towards luxeries as multiplayer and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a thread about adding floatation devices to capsules\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T21:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJool\u0027s shadow would be nice to have. I believe it works when you\u0027re in Jool\u0027s SOI but ceases to work when you get into SOI of any of its moons.

Even a really simple equation for calculating \u0022will it float?\u0022 could be handled similar to drag\u0027s relativity to mass. All you need to do is add a flag to the parts that tells the game whether that part can float. To determine if the vessel will float, compare the combined mass of all the parts that can float to the parts that can\u0027t. That will determine whether or not you\u0027ll have \u0022a sinking ship.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot very realistic, but then neither is drag. To make it more interesting I\u0027d want oceans on different worlds to have unique compositions, which would drastically affect buoyancy. But it doesn\u0027t seem worth the trouble making it that involved, unless sometime down the road, water exploration is given a useful purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of shadows... yes, do it.
