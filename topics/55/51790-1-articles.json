Currently, in order to get new parts, you need science. And to obtain said science, you need to send out missions. This is a good step, since there\u0027s no real big problems. Yes there are some such as the fact that at one point you will completely run out of possible science (so kinda hurts modders), but that\u0027s not the big problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, we as players can speculate three things about the new features in career mode with some evidence. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThere will be missions and/or planning of said missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yj41uIH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yj41uIH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThere will be a price for each part\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThere will be a quantity for each part\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/jK152yU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022jK152yU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s the problem; Quantity and Price. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor quantity, you\u0027ll not be able to play well if they give you a low quantity. New players will find career incredibly hard since they can\u0027t \u0022over make\u0022 their rockets. Also, price makes that harder because if you don\u0027t know how to send a rocket to Jool, and you make this giant rocket which crashes... you may have used a little too many parts. Maybe, you thought about that, so you spend less.. you later found out the rocket doesn\u0027t work and you lose the money. This will hurt new players if they don\u0027t know how to efficiently get to another planet/orbit ect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing this does, is reduce creativity. Players like the feeling of making a rocket they thought up at work or school and having it work, giving them a sense of planning victory. But, if there\u0027s a fault or a negative effect on the player for doing something wrong, some may plan a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E more, which is fun, but I bet you that the majority of players will end up coping a design. Kind of the like toyota corolla rocket (the one Scott used to land on the Mun) . People will just say \u0022Hey, I don\u0027t want to lose money, I\u0027ll just copy this rocket exact, and I\u0027ll get to where ever I have to go.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know some of you will think that they wont do it, so no one will, but think of when KSP is in Beta and you have tons of newbies playing the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only solution I thought of is that if making money, and parts come up often and with a high quantity.

Of course, the general budget could also be used for accomplishing specific objectives and maybe individual budgets would get subsumed into the general budget once the objective is complete. Naturally, you wouldn\u0027t need to actually say you\u0027re going to accomplish something (accept the mission), you could just go and do it on your general budget.

It kind of works that way now, with the points you get for returning ships from various orbits, etc. More of that, and less of the tiresome clicking, PLEASE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I think the science parts are interesting in theory, and having them along on your craft should probably tie in somehow with the RATE or even possibility of technological progress, but I absolutely do not EVER want to personally observe the materials bay and click a button to transmit data ever again. I\u0027ve probably done it close to 1000 times now. It got SO tedious. Rather, give that role to a kerbal and let them do it as part of their job during a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) I know it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a first iteration, but the tech tree itself seems wrong to me on a fundamental level. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d expect to see technology advances allow you to have more efficient/effective parts. For example, perhaps the entry level technology includes a rocket engine with a nominal amount of thrust and rather crummy ISP. Various advanced tiers and paths might give you \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbonuses\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to thrust, ISP or reduced size/mass. Or maybe you can make them cheaper or produce them more quickly once economics is introduced. A fuel tank is a fuel tank and making larger tanks is not really a feat of technological progress. Rather it is an engineering challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I can only guess that it will be coming in some future release, but it would be an awesome addition if the kerbals are actually doing something cool up in space. Even something simple like eat/sleep/work cycles would make a big improvement. And what would be even more interesting is if there was some way to have the individual kerbals develop over time based on what they were doing on missions. What is it about Jeb that makes him a bad dude? Give me a reason to care about these guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Again, I can imagine it will come eventually, but I think the game needs meaningful life support: food, water, air, susceptibility to cosmic rays are huge limiting factors for humans reaching any farther into space than we have already travelled. Better/more efficient life support systems seem like a better candidate for a tech tree than bigger fuel tanks, modules, etc. It would also increase the feeling that you are part of an organic universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love playing with model rockets and I look forward to playing KSP for a long time. But what the game really needs to do if it ever wants to move beyond a niche market is to present some meaningful and fun interaction with the kerbal universe. It needs to explore the \u0022why?\u0022 and the sense of awe and wonder that makes the prospect of giong into space so enticing for kerbals AND humans. I think if the devs can come up with ways to bridge these gaps, they will have something very special on their hands which will hold interest for a much wider audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKurld\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T20:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 08:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kurld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T20:05:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock?? quantity discount?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease.. this is a Space Program!
