Not multi-player, but rather NPC\u0027s. Contracts to put this satellite or that space station in orbit of whichever planet before another agency does. If they do it first, the satellite or station would actually be there around the planet or moon. They would\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Egain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0rep and you\u0027d lose it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you needed to use their satellite, you\u0027d have to pay them to relay your signal. For stations, you\u0027d have to pay for docking, plus fuel or whatever else you need (at a markup, of course). You\u0027d also lose rep for needing help from a competitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an International Space Agency, as well. That would open up a lot of new contracts. \u0022Donate this or that module to the International Space Station\u0022 to gain rep, or \u0022Have this Kerbal join the ISA for a certain period\u0022. You would lose control of the module or Kerbal once docked (the Kerbal you\u0027d get back after his tour was up). You could buy fuel and whatever else at the ISS at cost, and maybe enough rep with ISA opens up new parts? For the Kerbals, maybe they learn new abilities while on board the ISS? A pilot can choose to focus on science or engineering during his stay. A five star pilot now has the abilities of a three star scientist or engineer. The other professions could do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe with your help the ISA discovers new planets or a new solar system close enough to visit? Who knows? I don\u0027t even know if it\u0027s doable (I\u0027m\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a programmer), but I\u0027d really like to see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTrebor","CreatedById":172975,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-20T20:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see this, as the closest we have to this now is Kerbals floating around in crew modules for rescue missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cubfan","CreatedById":174195,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T00:59:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222962032\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156767\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221487621291\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172975\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainTrebor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, CaptainTrebor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see this, as the closest we have to this now is Kerbals floating around in crew modules for rescue missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly. All you ever see are Kerbals in orbit clinging to pieces of debris. I even rescued one on Gilly. She was just standing on the surface. How\u0027d she end up in the middle of nowhere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027d be cool to see other agencies sats, stations, and ships. Just to see what they\u0027d look like. And the fact that you don\u0027t control them. And I really like the idea of new plants/moons having to be discovered through a certain amount of science. Maybe even a comet you could rendezvous with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said, I don\u0027t know where else they could go with it, but I\u0027d really like to see it implemented in some fashion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
