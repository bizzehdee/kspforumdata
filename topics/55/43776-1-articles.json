For me, with a few mods installed, it\u0027s so painful that I\u0027m tempted not to play KSP with any mods. And that detracts so much from the game, having owned it for about a year, that I then don\u0027t want to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods make KSP more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, all parts from all installed mods appear in the SPH/VAB tabs by part type. If, like me, you have several mods installed, your structure and propulsion tabs probably contain several pages of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be handled better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if, when a mod is added that adds parts, the VAB/SPH parts tabs are then augmented with a vertical set of tabs, say on the left side of the parts frame. For instance, if I installed B9, I would see two tabs on the left side: one for stock parts and one for B9 parts. If I selected B9 and then the propulsion parts tab, I would then be presented with only the B9 propulsion parts. If I selected stock, I would then see only the stock propulsion parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine some users would find this unwieldy. Perhaps it would be better suited to power users. And, so, this feature could be toggled on/off with a checkbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not this then something. Building craft, using mods, should be less cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp me, KSP devs, you\u0027re my only hope.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T02:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esure but only one change, there would also be a tab for all parts of one type\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you seen \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/35018-0-21-PartCatalog-2-0-Big-overhaul-get-your-dynamic-subgroups-now!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPartCatalog\u003C/a\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:43:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/34779-0-21-Simple-Part-Organizer-%28v0-250%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESimple Part Organizer\u003C/a\u003E is another option which may suit\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meeware","CreatedById":78778,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T06:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these suffer from the poor discipline of parts naming in MODS.
