Many ideas I\u0027ve seen for filling these places out have seemed impractical from an implementation standpoint (cities etc). I would love to see it, but for all the work and added memory I don\u0027t know what they would actually do. So Im wondering if people had ideas for simple surface features that would not only add to the gameplay but would be relatively easy to implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking is there could be a system of science hotspots. These would be a simple series of models that could be scattered throughout the kerbol system, would be mappable, and would provide big science bonuses when sampled. Examples could include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Geysers/hot springs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Surface ice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crystal outcroppings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fissures/ small volcanoes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pools of primordial goo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stromatolites\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Fossil beds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey should each be relatively rare, setting some tight demands on precision landings. They would also create the incentive to build rovers, as you could land relatively closely to a few formations and then drive around to each. Some could be of purely scientific value (fossil formations and the like) and others could be indicators for resource deposits once ISRU becomes implemented (Ice, geysers, and mineral formations). They could also be integrated with the contract system after being mapped, replacing some of the the random \u0022conduct science at x\u0022 contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like adding even bacterial life outside Kerbin could be controversial, but I personally think it fits the spirit and that fine line between serious science and whimsical fun that makes KSP great. After all, finding life on other planets is a huge part of what space exploration is about.

Each location would be quite small, on the order of a KSC building, and would require only a few models to be made and then scattered about the system. When mapped from space their locations would light up, but readings would require retrieval to Kerbin or analysis by high-level Scientist in a Science Lab to discern what type of formation it is. This way early on players can practice precision landings and just find out what\u0027s there, and later on they can plan landing sites more carefully to daisy-chain complex missions.

I guess like cities I just dont know how hard that would be to model on a large scale. Im mainly thinking high bang-for-buck additions that really evolve the gameplay and make this a real space exploration game rather than putting a lot of modeling time into pretty set pieces.
