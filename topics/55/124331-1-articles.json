I\u0027ve had a couple of missions go south after investing a lot of time/resources only to realize I forgot an antenna or something; this is extremely frustrating and usually reason enough to quit for the day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, I can only blame myself for not reading the requirements thoroughly; however I would argue KSP shouldn\u0027t be about reading requirements and is not the most enjoyable aspect of the game; I think some simple UI changes could be made to make it clearer to the player what they need to do. For example, have a tab to pull up the entire contracts in the VAB and in flight so you can easily pull up all the details of the contract in flight or when your building your ship; there is a dropdown tab right now but it lacks details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think in general the contracts could be worded better and/or more explicitly. KSP is a game about thinking outside the box, and hacking together a unconventional design to meet some crazy objective, it\u0027s hard to do that when your unsure of what exactly the contract requires and you might get there only to realize you missed some random detail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe all that information is already there, but it has been my experience that it is not made very obvious to the player; and usually a successful mission will require several trips to mission control to check, double check, triple check, and then write down the requirements of a contract just to make sure you don\u0027t forget something silly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T01:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greenspan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greenspan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehowever I would argue KSP shouldn\u0027t be about reading requirements\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIt\u0027s obviously not about reading the contracts either, judging by how incoherent they are...\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, \u002B1, the conditions should be much clearer, perhaps in a brighter font color than muted-grey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manaiaK","CreatedById":129599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T04:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greenspan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greenspan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E... usually a successful mission will require several trips to mission control to check, double check, triple check, and then write down the requirements of a contract just to make sure you don\u0027t forget something silly.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EExactly!\u003Cp\u003EGlad I\u0027m not the only one who has to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have two folders on my desk these days: \u0022space flight reference\u0022, which has things like the vis-viva equation and the formula for orbital period with worked examples; and \u0022KSP\u0022, which has my notes for the 3 saves I\u0027m playing alternately.

E.g. put a picture of the desired orbit, that is incredibly more intuitive than the orbital parameters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently moved an existing satellite into a really challenging orbit, since the satellite was from before I accepted the contract it was not valid. How am I supposed to keep track of stuff like that?
