These would take YEARS of game time to unlock, BUT would yield a tremendous amount of science on completion, that high science could be used to finance other long term experiments (that require huge amounts of science themselves).... say the CMBR analysis unlocks the Kubble space telescope or the Terrestrial Planet Finder \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while you work on doing science for rocket parts, your long term project is cooking, then one day, SURPRISE! mega project complete! So whats next? A Kubble telescope? An Exoplanet Finder? or maybe a Kitzer Space Telescope for INFRARED telemetry (infrared cuts through gas and dust, giving data different then that of visible spectrum telescope), or maybe something more challenging... A Space Interferometry Mission... imagine the challenge of building a space telescope array in laser guided formation ....

Once completed they should actively participate in providing the science for the next project by giving science over time. In Example 1% of the total science value of the project over the time it took to complete the project. So if the project cost 100,000 science and 5 years to complete, you get 10,000 science over time every 5 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Extra science can be applied to hasten the completion of Megaprojects: This gives the player an incentive to complete mega projects, AND keep exploring all the biomes of all the worlds available once all the rocketry is researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Placing the Megaprojects in places OTHER then the Kerbin system gives an added bonus (say 1.1% of the total science value of the project over the time it took to complete the project). So, the afore mentioned example around Duna would generate 11,000 science instead of 10,000 (in the Kerbin system) science over 5 years. This may not seem like a lot but as the projects accumulate... the bonus gets significant, AND it gives further incentive to visit the worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A side reward from the project could be in the form of screenshots: Imagery their megaprojects took (I don\u0027t know if displaying this kind of image in game is feasible, but all NASA imagery is public domain as far as I know), either pulled directly from NASA archives or with a KSP twist \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- These time scales may seem long... but a round trip to Jool can take 2 years to complete... so the numbers I gave may be too short (or too long, but I doubt that).
