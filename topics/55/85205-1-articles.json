If you rotate the other modules you can forget about some of the symmetry options for some of the stuff attached, because it\u0027ll either block the ladder on the lower module or be so close to the ladder that you Kerbal\u0027s helmet hits the attached part preventing you from moving on the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T17:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xtoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xtoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree about the location of the hatch door.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027ll disagree, it\u0027s the science module and hitchhiker that should change. Optimal RCS placement pretty much mandates placing them inline with right where you want to move the hatch to, which causes two problems. One is that running ladders through RCS quads just looks wrong. The other is that it increases the chances of obstructing hatches since it places the hatches and the RCS quads on the same vertical line.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
