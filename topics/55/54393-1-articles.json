TL;DR summary:\u003C/strong\u003E Is it possible to have the Kerbin\u0027s use those yellow sticky notes in the pods to transfer some of their reports from pod to pod or from the instrument to a command pod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand it may be an intended mechanic to tie reports to certain parts but, here is the situation I encountered and my suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched a rocket with two pods, a mk1 lander can and a mk1-2 command pod. After I reach orbit and then transfer to the celestial body I want to reach I undock the craft from one another and do a powered landing with the lander can (some eva and docking steps not mentioned). After I reach the surface, plant a flag, and run/drive around having fun for a little while I complete my experiments and hop back in the lander can. All of my science gadgets attached to the lander can and my EVA and surface sample now also associated with the lander can. I reach orbit, dock with my orbiting craft, EVA back to the craft, and head for home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suggestion involves the reaching kerbin. I can choose to have my command pod re-enter Kerbin and splash down in spetacular fashion by itself but, I lose all of the science I performed on the surface of wherever I landed (from science parts, EVA, and surface samples). And as far as I know the only way to keep that data is to bring the lander can back to Kerbin with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can think of ways to keep all this science by modifying the ship and my flight plan but, wouldn\u0027t it be nice if the Kerbin\u0027s could utilize all of those yellow sticky notes in the pods to copy down some of the details of the reports (from pod to pod or from the science parts)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T07:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I understand, this, or something like it, is expected in 0.23.

From what I\u0027ve read they plan to implement a giant part that allows you to transmit back the important data. In this case I\u0027m bringing all of the parts back into orbit and I really just need to transfer the data (or even just some of it to encourage repeat missions) from one pod to another. Sounded like a good idea in my head since I was basically simulating the apollo 11 mission. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T14:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s coming next update\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dart980","CreatedById":64926,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T14:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil 0.23 you can use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54998-FScience-Science-Data-Transfer-v0-1?highlight=Science\u002BTransfer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E.
