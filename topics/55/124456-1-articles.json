Since 1.0.5 will fix that problem, the need to repeatedly decline absurd contracts (\u0022spam-decline\u0022) should be reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would add something to the career mode game if spam-declining contracts had a cost. Declining contracts should cause a reputation hit--you get known to the contractors as a \u0022difficult\u0022 provider--that should increase as you repeatedly decline contracts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first thought was a Fibonacci sequence increase in the penalty: declining one or two doesn\u0027t cost very much, but decline five or more in a row, and it starts to hurt a lot. (Each contract you accept would move you back a step in the sequence.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once your reputation goes negative, part suppliers should be reluctant to deal with you, and charge you extra.

It doesn\u0027t address time-warping removing contracts. It doesn\u0027t address current missions or what the player is concentrating on (e.g. if the player is \u0022colonizing\u0022 Laythe or Duna, or mining Moho, or whatever). It doesn\u0027t address the limited amount of contracts that a player has access to. I doesn\u0027t address contracts that don\u0027t conform to the player\u0027s current goals. In short, it is trying to solve a problem that doesn\u0027t exist by turning the game into a tedious exercise of doing things you may not want to be doing and punishes the player for setting their own goals. If you prefer to do every contract then do every contract; the game already allows you to play in that manner.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manaiaK","CreatedById":129599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T23:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFair enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T23:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I don\u0027t build surface bases or do anything involving ISRU.
