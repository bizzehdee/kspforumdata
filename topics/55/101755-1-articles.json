I\u0027ve become equally disatisfied with the apparent overweight and under-manned nature of some certain stock 2.5m lander cans. (Ahem.)\n\nI think they need a little love. I think we need some more options here. Perhaps a tweak here and there. Two single cans weigh in at 1.32t; the two-man weighs a hefty and bloated 2.66t. Why is this? I get that it has slightly more RCS and battery power, but there isn\u0027t even an RTG or anything like that.\n\nAnd with needing to actually land and plant flags with my entire ship crew, I now need a way to land three Kerbals at a time -- and the stock 3-man pod weighs 4.12t. It\u0027s a lot lighter to use 3 one-man cans, but it\u0027s also a lot uglier and more ungainly.\n\nTwo discussion questions: \n\n1. If you could buff or nerf the lander cans, what would you do?\n\n2. If you were designing a new one, what features would you include, and at what weight?"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T20:27:00Z","Content":"Moving this over to Suggestions and Development Discussion, as it\u0027s more of a \u0022What would you change if you could?\u0022 question than a \u0022How do I use these parts as they are?\u0022 question ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T21:59:18Z","Content":"I\u0027d say that the multi-kerbal cans have to come down in mass.\n\nIt makes no sense to have the mass/capacity increasing with capacity and if the 1 man cans get much bigger, probes will become so much more efficient than kerbals that you\u0027d be crazy not to use them. Maybe 1.2t for 2 man 1.25m pod and 1.7t for a 3 man 1.25-2.5m pod.\n\nConsidering that a 4 man mk2 crew cabin weighs 2 tonnes, and a 16 man mk3 cabin weighs 6.5t I don\u0027t think that\u0027s so unreasonably low."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T22:30:41Z","Content":"My biggest complaint with these lander cans is that they have slightly different diameters than the size they are supposed to be.
