Fix action would probably be to add more mass(slowly lessening while its being burnt off). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-another problem with heatshields is that they\u0027re supposed to be detachable, but when I click the detach button nothing happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-launching a larger, multistage rocket tends to wobble, usually at the point of the fairings( love them, but more on that later). Even decreasing speed and adding many struts don\u0027t eliminate the problem. Its very hard to get accurate and/or efficient when your rocket is oscillating between your maneuver node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-while I love the new fairings in how they break apart into many pieces, how you can see inside them, and how you can make them pretty precise, I have a few words about them. Maybe an option to have it break apart how it does now or break apart into halves/thirds/etc length wise. The ability to add struts to the outside of the fairings themselves and not through them, add a mid stage fairing where you can build on top of them( first example that comes to mind where it\u0027d be used is being able to launch a vehicle, land on a body with an atmosphere and take off while still being able to use a fairing). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-maybe add larger fuel tanks and engines(I was spoiled with the space Y engines in .90)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are it for now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mostly made this so devs can look at one location and see what they can make better, how they can make it better, and additional features they can possibly add. If anyone wishes, they can hijack this thread or start a new one where it gets actively compiled to the first post since I am not as active on this forum as many others are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerry launches to all, and to all a good flight\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boa3532","CreatedById":57325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeatshield issue is known\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a thread showing a quick fix. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117279-How-to-fix-those-heatshields%21-%28get-rid-of-command-pod-flipping-into-the-heat%21%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117279-How-to-fix-those-heatshields%21-%28get-rid-of-command-pod-flipping-into-the-heat%21%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T14:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther minor niggles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Medium landing gear wheels don\u0027t animate when moving; they\u0027re quite noticeably static.
