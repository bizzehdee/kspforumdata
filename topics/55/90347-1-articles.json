I often find myself purchasing a certain science tech just for one of the parts in the set. The others that come with it, I don\u0027t care about so much. And in some cases the part isn\u0027t even usable without researching something else too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s cool that we can get a Science Jr. early on with Science Tech, but adding it to your craft pretty much means you can\u0027t EVA to collect surface samples and return to the vessel unless you research Space Exploration to get a ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Spaceplane parts are mostly available through the middle of the tree, but if I want landing gear for them I need to go down the science part of the tree. Huh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s very difficult to rendezvous and dock without lights, even in sunlight. But the first access to a docking port is in Specialized Construction, while the lights needed to make them effectively usable are way down in Electrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of Clamp-O-Tron docking ports (Specialized Construction), they are only usable if you can put a self-sustaining vessel into orbit. To do that, you also need the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBatteries (Science Tech)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolar panels \u0026amp; lights (Electrics)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial decouplers (Stability)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrut connectors (General Construction)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExternal fuel ducts (Fuel Systems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, you probably want RCS thrusters (Advanced Flight Control) and an advanced SAS (Specialized Control). Not to mention whatever techs are necessary to get engines with enough power and fuel tanks with enough fuel. In short, it only makes sense to have docking ports after you\u0027ve already researched half of the tree! But if you want radial attachment points from Advanced MetalWorks - a useful part that has applications other than on a dock-able vessel - you have to buy the docking ports first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I can tell that a lot of thought went into organizing the science tree as it is, and it couldn\u0027t have been easy. The way it\u0027s organized does make sense for the most part, but I think these problems are unintended side effects that cannot be adequately solved because not all parts fit neatly into a specific category like the tree tries to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose is to allow us to spend science points to research specific parts, instead of categories of parts. Each science purchase would \u0022research\u0022 a certain part and make it available (for building in science mode or for purchase in career mode). Some parts should have their minor counterparts as prerequisites (Clamp-O-Tron Sr. requires Jr. and regular size first, or Gigantor XL requires OX-STAT and OX-4L/W first, etc.), while other parts should be available from the beginning but with a cost that makes you save up a bit for them (struts, fuel ducts, radial attachment points, HubMax multi-point connector, other tangental parts that have no particular category or other upgrades). If one of these parts is considered \u0022too powerful\u0022 to have at the beginning, then either its science cost can be made prohibitively high, or a technology that costs science points, but unlocks no parts directly, could be required to unlock the ability to research the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that would add a lot of customization to our space programs. We could focus only on spaceplanes, stations, or bases, without having to buy virtually every other tech in the tree just to get essential parts for our focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overjay","CreatedById":104131,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T12:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo try engineering-based tech tree.
