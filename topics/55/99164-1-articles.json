Thus leading to accidental grabbing/clicking and destruction. I know it might seem like a small thing, but I can\u0027t help but wonder how many minutes/hours of frustration might be saved if I were able to customize this color for easier visual cues(of my own discern/preference). Considering the current iffy nature of how certain parts fit together in KSP, it might also be nice to have an alternate color highlight the part once its placed in a spot that it can actually connect to, instead of the opacity changing, which again I often strain to see. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise the game is loads of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
