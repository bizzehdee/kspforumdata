They are quite snappy and responsive to the mouse, and the editor is lag free. I suspect you may have some other issue, such as graphics settings too high for your system, or a bad GPU driver, or something about what you are doing. KSP is quite playable on that old system, if I choose appropriate and reasonable graphics settings, giving 50 FPS and green time dilation for simple scenes (e.g. single medium complexity craft in active flight, but many flights on rails).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome more detail on your system, your mods, and just what sort of craft you\u0027re editing is in order, I think, if you want to be taken seriously. Do you have problems with graphics options turned down, no mods installed, editing a small to medium sized craft, with a small payload fairing? If not, which of those factors has to change, and by how much, before you experience problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T06:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not a problem for me, so there is no problem at all.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edisagree with your logic, sir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif there was an option to disable the animations, I would.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T06:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fairings are working fine for me too, without any lag.
