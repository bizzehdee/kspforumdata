They could behave similarly to a Kerbal\u0027s IVA viewing and require power to operate. Not terribly useful science-wise, but having that viewpoint from the surface of the ship is just cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Cargo bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It would be nice to be able to put a satellite into orbit without it precariously balanced on the top of a rocket. The cargo bay would look nice next to the shuttle-based crew module and would function similarly to the real space shuttle. A satellite would be placed inside during assembly, bay doors open in space to launch it. This would be even better with a manipulator arm, which could be its own separate part. The arm would grab and move objects nearby without requiring a docking port. You could add a seat for a Kerbal or an aforesuggested camera on the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) EVA activity: placing reinforcing linkages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is NOT \u0027building ships in space\u0027. This involves reinforcing connections between docking ports, particularly useful for space stations that are sent up in parts. A Kerbal on EVA would be able to place struts between two point on the ship, helping to strengthen the connection over the port. A resource functionality similar to fuel and power could be used to limit how many pieces could be added.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T11:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eagree to all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe camera would be useful for landing large SSTO or any plane from IVA view. in fact it would make flying from IVA view, much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want my MK3 CARGO BAY!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
