But, as many as I\u00B4ve been reading and learning about modding and programming here, I don\u00B4t know if these wishes could be easily added or even possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00B4ve already started a new career on 1.5.1 (which is great!), and my opinions comes from this gameplay as well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n..............\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-You may have notice, but the necessary distance for a scientist to reach a mistery goo or science jr. (for data collecting or\u00A0restoring) seems to be almost twice as far as the distance for data storing or collecting in an experiment container. It would be nice if the ladder one was used for both.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Regarding the parachutes repacking, I\u00B4ve realized no one has been able to make a mod for, somehow, \u0022repack all chutes\u0022 in an action or button from an engineer. Would that be possible in an official upgrade/patch?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Could we create or select some kind of \u0022kerbonauts lance\u0022, whether in astronaut complex or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, so we would not need to reconfigure or re-add the desired crew list, every time, for every ship? No, there is no problem in doing that manually\u00A0but, when your staff goes beyond 100 kerbals and many of your \u0022star-buses\u0022 have place for more than 20 people, things get a little complicated....\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Whether in space station or science archives (R\u0026amp;D), to add some \u0022filter\u0022 button feature, so we could choose to see and select only the information/vessel\u00A0related, lets say, for THAT celestial body.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for your time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n;-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-28T21:38:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2018 09:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cataclism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Espelling correction\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
