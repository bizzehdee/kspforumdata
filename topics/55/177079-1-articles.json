Many players have suggested it before, but the level of difficulty cooperating\u00A0 with other players would be nearly impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m suggesting is a race to the science tree, and other Celestial bodies. The players would _not_ interact with eachother, however. They would only be connected via leaderboard.\u00A0 Each player would have their own save file. Time warp would not be an issue. (See scoring)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t quite though of a scoring value, but I think it would be a ratio of some\u00A0sort. Maybe science per price of missions(efficiency), Reputation per science points(Public\u00A0interest)- still needs to be _thought though thoroughly_\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts\u00A0also\u00A0vulnerable to cheats.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheats = _bad_\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, first post! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbolExplorer","CreatedById":177191,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-30T14:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour idea is very good and it will probably be the only way to have multiplayer in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-31T09:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would this be better than just using a challenge thread like we already do?\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Our challenge threads already allow one user to set up a game (establish a goal), and then select the scoring criteria.\u00A0\u00A0 Then any user on the forums who want to play in this game can, and they post up their scores, usually with screenshots as proof.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from the potential of automated scoring, how is this an improvement?\u00A0 The goals would be limited by the code itself, devs can\u0027t think of everything (just look at every release of KSP ever), and the scoring system would be very strict.\u00A0\u00A0 Also only a limited number of players can join.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you might be on the right path for one version of MP in KSP, but it needs some fleshing out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0something0","CreatedById":182790,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T05:27:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had a similar idea but couldn\u0027t really find the right words to describe it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what if instead of scoring we have world first achievements and leaderboads and whatnot, but they also show when they were achieved in game time. I also had an idea of making vessles public so they can be seen by other players and perhaps transfer ownership to,\u00A0though they would have the same restrictions as timewarp. Outside of that, timewarp and whatnot shouldnt be an issue since vessels are in rails. From there things like launch services and player-made contracts as well as refueling stations owned by other players though compromises will have to be made like using teleport fuel transfer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T09:17:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessels can be shared via kerbalx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0something0","CreatedById":182790,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-12T15:55:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223431175\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533892647\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188222\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xd the great\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/10/2018 at 5:17 AM, Xd the great said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessels can be shared via kerbalx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean sharing in the same save, so players can see a mission that another person is doing in real time, or transfer ownership of satellites between players\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArielleKSP","CreatedById":191197,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-12T19:52:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove this idea.
