So, how about in 0.24 or 0.25 we have some more aerodynamics, but then add them over time. Small increments can lead to big things. So, maybe in 0.24 there could be a focus on something other than aerodynamics, but some small tweaks could be made. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be like just the command pods and probe cores in 0.24, the fuel tanks 0.25, the engines in 0.26, some structural pieces like adapters, decouplers, and separators in 0.27. And others like parachutes and all the science parts in 0.28. So it could be a sub-feature included in a string of updates. But I humbly request, your awesomeness SQUAD, to consider this proposal. Also, in 0.23, it feels like the aerodynamics had a big upgrade! The control surfaces are a lot slower, like they fight against the atmosphere.
