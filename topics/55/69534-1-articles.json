Why difference would that make? Not a lot(of course), but for those who want to keep the victims dead(e.g for role-play), it can be annoying to go to the KSC each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it doesn\u0027t make a big difference but it could be a feature for future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
