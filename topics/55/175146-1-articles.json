Which, is needless to say is designed to emulate the design of the Apollo Lunar Module. Which creates a bit of a dilemma. The Lunar Module was designed with the explicit intention of both crew members \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Estanding\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. This is done so not only ditch the weight of seats, but also cut the need for such large windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo by having larger windows, the crew would need to stand near them, to get the best view, but instead you\u0027re stuck, in a seat, with a tiny window that only allows for an upward POV from the seat. So effectively your stuck with a trait of the original design for the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://spacewalkoffame.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Original-model-of-the-first-lunar-excursion-module-LEM.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EL.E.M.\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003C/strong\u003E(there is difference between the L.E.M. and the LM that I\u0027ll get to later) but in the LM. By standing next to the window, you get a better POV. One significantly better for landing as you can actually see what\u0027s below you, rather than just the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I suggest everyone at Squad take a moment to watch this segment of the TV miniseries, from the Earth To The Moon and ponder what it has to say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DLQeqMaHVYs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022105320767.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.lakecountyspaceport.com/image/105320767.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LM_sim_Joliet_CDR_position600.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022450\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.space1.com/Museum_Exhibits/Spacecraft_Simulators/Lunar_Landing_Sim/LM_sim_Joliet_CDR_position600.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the initial (and likely the much easier option) is to just add a double click point like from the normal stock pods. However I do propose an alternative, that is a bit more arduous, but also more accurate to the vehicle they are depicting. I suggest that Squad create a static 3D model of a standing Kerbal, and just fit the head of a sitting Kerbal to that, with their arms and lower body hidden away in the control panels and as a result, out of view. Allowing for a standing Kerbal with a moving head, but without having to redesign how command pods function entirely. The Kerbal\u0027s body would be part of the pods geometry rather than an animated figure. The second command slot can be an empty suit if a second crew member is not present. The crew wouldn\u0027t move much so having static figures would work fine with the default heads plugged into them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course the easier option is to just add a double click zoom in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E* \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003Esee the spoiler below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, as mentioned earlier, there is a difference between the Lunar Module, and the Lunar Excursion Module.

It varied by having much larger windows, the addition of seats,\u00A0 5 landing legs a round base, rather than an octagonal one seen on the LM, two docking ports (on the top and on the front) whereas the LM only had one on the top, of which, the front was a rounded port rather than square on the LM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the process of development on the LM, it was decided to drop the \u0027Excursion\u0027 part and simply leave the name as the Lunar Module (LM), and so the original LEM only lived on as it\u0027s verbal slang name \u0027lem\u0027.
