I am really loving the new update, but I do have a suggestion I think would improve the game quite a bit. I want to be able to choose how my Kerbals progress through the classes. I want them to all start with no experience in any class (or randomly start with some experience in one or more classes). I want them to gain experience in the classes that they are used for. So if I use Bill to pilot my ships, Bill gains experience as a pilot. If I also use Bill to perform science experiments, Bill gains experience as a scientist. And if I also decide to use Bill to repair a ship, he also will gain experience as an engineer. Same goes with any Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I want Bill to be a jack of all trades, he can be that. If I want Jeb to specialize just as a pilot, he can do that. Etc. I feel this would add more depth to the classes, and especially with career mode, it won\u0027t hurt the player early on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harlikwin","CreatedById":103213,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T22:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI made the same proposal in this earlier post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103963-Kerbal-abilities-and-XP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103963-Kerbal-abilities-and-XP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T22:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harlikwin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022harlikwin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI made the same proposal in this earlier post. \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103963-Kerbal-abilities-and-XP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/103963-Kerbal-abilities-and-XP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, technically your suggestion was a little different and covered a few different things.

I would be happy even if it was capped so a single Kerbal couldn\u0027t get level 5 on all three classes. Maybe make the main class capable of going up to lvl 5 and the off classes max out at lvl 3 or even 2. Or no cap. I\u0027d be fine either way.

How would you handle training scientists and engineers though? Considering scientists currently don\u0027t really have an activity - probes can operate science instruments - and engineers start off completely unable to fix anything. I guess you could put kerbals to work in a science lab to train them as scientists but that\u0027d be quite a bit of work (they need something to process after all)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T02:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like that each kerbal is assigned to a role because this introduces gameplay in the form of having to find out how to carry one of each in a mission.

That leaves engineers which, unless you\u0027re especially prone to crashing very gently, aren\u0027t that useful; at least not yet.
