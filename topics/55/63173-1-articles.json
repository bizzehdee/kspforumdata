(sorry if it was already asked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, instead of a giant leap with tons of new features, perhaps a few bugs, releasing kind of 0.23.xyz which will just include for example 2 small fixes and nothing more. Then 0.23.xyz\u002B1 with another fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit of this could allow people to check the fixes work as expected and make the few people really concerned by those bugs to be happier and enjoy KSP more, instead of perhaps make them just leaving because this small issue, which not occur for everyone, is a great annoyance to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to don\u0027t bother dev team to much, it can be kindda \u0022unofficial release\u0022, not pushed on steam or other game provider, but only on official website, with just the relevant changelog.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DYJ","CreatedById":8636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T11:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly what we used to do back when the game was small and the community manageable, but after a certain point it become more trouble than it was worth and the responsibility of testing experimental releases was instead given to dedicated testing and QA teams.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe teams occasionally switch out people who have left and whatnot, when the next recruitment drive opens it will be well announced on the forum, so keep an eye out for that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T11:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the key tenets that Harv has stuck to is that if each release was the last, is it a completely playable and workable game, in so far as had already been achieved? Because of that, they are highly focussed on providing as stable and complete a release as possible. Unfortunately, whilst your idea has good merit, the QA/Experimentals testing has a very fixed cycle length of around 2 weeks, so even if they were to produce only a small update, it would not come out much faster than what\u0027s currently available. As the game grows, this will become more and more of the case. In this sense, I think it\u0027s better they spend a little more time on getting bigger projects started and followed through than released half-baked stuff which might break.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T14:52:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike DYJ says, I\u0027ve seen announcements on the forums before asking people to be on the beta, \u003Cem\u003Ebeta\u003C/em\u003E testing team (as opposed to the normal beta that we all play).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might even look out for them myself next time it happens. I will warn though, that you might get incredibly frustrated watching the latest nightly release crashing hard on a regular basis. That and I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027d have a list of things to do to test every release, and you\u0027d almost certainly be running totally stock to be useful, so no mods at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the words of (paid) game testers I\u0027ve known, you might get so damned sick of testing and re-testing, that by the time the full game (or next public release) comes out, you\u0027ll be bored to tears with it.
