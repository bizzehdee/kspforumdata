As mentioned in the first sentence that thread was started shortly after life support had been mentioned by the devs as a revived possibility (in a squadcast or devnote, I cant remember which). I started the thread within\u00A0that brief\u00A0window\u00A0with the hopes we could talk\u00A0about how or even whether it would work in stock. I still think its a topic worthy of discussion, but now that it\u0027s off the devs immediate docket for consideration I understand the mod\u0027s position on WNTS threads.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T10:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll replace both existing threads with a new thread called \u0022Commonly Suggested\u0022 which will link to a master thread on each major topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should mean we\u0027d see just the one multiplayer thread or lifesupport thread instead of many \u0022Add feature \u0027commonfeature\u0027\u0022 threads for things already suggested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat should keep discussion going without all of us having to say \u0022It\u0027s been suggested\u0022 to everyone who thinks they are the first to have thought of it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll draft up something soon, it\u0027ll probably be a bit bare to start and I\u0027ll add masterthreads to it as necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill on it, looking for threads and spellchecking and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-04T16:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222347281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129189\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221451854580\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146334\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Glaran K\u0027erman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 hours ago, Glaran K\u0027erman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is it that someone could in theory post all day on a thread for Kerbal Construction Time to be made stock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the sort-of off topic, but was this just an example you thought of or was it something you actually saw?
