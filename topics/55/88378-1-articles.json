I think the latter, at which point the equation is increased with the object\u0027s momentum, adding an extra variable to the equation (speed). At this point to \u0022keep sliding\u0022 you have to find the speed for which this equation holds true (considering a flat surface now to show how the mass falls into the equation):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF||move = d(mv)/dt = mu_dynamic * n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering for our car mass is constant with time (no rockets used for breaking, just sliding along ground), n is the normal force (= m * g for horizontal, or m * g * cos(theta) )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em * a = mu_dynamic * m * g =\u0026gt; a = mu_dynamic * g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as you can see for the whole equation the breaking acceleration (for sliding) is only dependent on the mu_dynamic - this is a break which would normally be called \u0022locked breaks, abs malfunctioning\u0022. To calculate the maximum breaking (AND acceleration!!!) force before you start sliding (note that mu_dynamic is always a lot higher than mu_static so you really dont\u0027 wish to go over that):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF \u0026lt;= mu_static * n \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E m * a \u0026lt;= mu_static * m * g\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea \u0026lt;= mu_static * g\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words the mass will once again divide out, and increasing the mass has no effect on how fast something will slide. The influence is the acceleration (so don\u0027t try to speed up too fast/break too fast) and most importantly the mu of the moon. Now I think there\u0027s a mistake in this mu_static as it seems on the moon you immediatelly start sliding, so this would mean that mu_static is 0?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-25T15:52:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2014 03:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by paul23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-30T20:39:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy not make mu (dimensionless coefficient of friction) upgradable as you unlock new parts/rover-wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefault should be about 1.
