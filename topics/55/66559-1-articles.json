Maybe a button next to the speed on the navball, similar to how we can cycle through orbital, target and surface speed. Or even have the left hand side of the speed display (where it shows numbers) cycle through orbit/surface/target and the right hand side (where it shows the units) between m/s, kph and mph. I think this would be most intuitive, actually. I can\u0027t remember if the tutorials explain that, but it\u0027s easy enough to add that info in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it hard to gauge speed on a celestial body\u0027s surface thanks to a relatively non-bumpy and sparse (even with ground scatter) landscape so 20 m/s doesn\u0027t seem that fast when it\u0027s actually 44 mph.

If you ask an aeronautic engineer to change speed units on-the-fly, i guess he will reply that you will get a lot of errors, because it\u0027s more difficult to think in different units quickly. The main error you\u0027ll get is believing you\u0027re slow at 20km/h, but the ship is falling 20 m/s, when a device gives you this kind of information, you need to know exactly what it means, despite the units, or you will forget to look units. I am not involved in aeronautics, but in anaesthesia, our protocoles are stolen from aeronautic, because they know how to lower human errors rate. You can change units, but you never do it. EtCO2 is given in standard mmHg, but you can use cmH2O or even % of total gas. You have to know how to convert exactly, but you only use one unit, and everyone use the same so you won\u0027t make a mistake if you need to take control over someone else working with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd seeing how much car crashes vs plane crashes, sorry, but i believe more aeronautics engineers than anyone who got a driving license....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T19:50:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...or get an intuitive feel for how fast you\u0027re moving past obstacles *at the moment*.
