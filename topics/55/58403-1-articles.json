You could have the lights be green for fresh experiments, yellow for stored experiments and red for experiments that have been used and need to be cleaned for reuse. It would look better and make more sense than re-entry with an open science bay\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hashbrown66","CreatedById":65106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T23:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s been bugging me recently.
