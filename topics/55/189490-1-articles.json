Until KSP2 comes out, though, there are a few things that I\u0027d like to see in the current game that would make a big difference without requiring a massive amount of work. I work in a software development team so I know something that seems \u0027easy\u0027 rarely is, but I\u0027ve kept the list to fairly small changes or additions which are based on existing features to keep things reasonably simple.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Improved fuel tank paints.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe standard 1.25m tanks have four different colour schemes, but one of those is plain white and the others don\u0027t match up particularly well (especially the little FL100 tank and its strange black stripes). The 2.5m Rockomax tanks only have two colour schemes to pick from- a black and white style that for the second-largest means white with a big corrugated stripe in the middle, or orange which does the corrugated thing to the second smallest tank instead. The Kerbodyne 3.75m and MH-specific 5m tanks have one colour scheme- ONE!- and it\u0027s a bit boring. The little 0.625m Oscar-B tank is likewise stuck with one boring grey paint job, and the surface-mounted orange tanks also have one colour scheme to share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Making History 1.875m tanks are another story altogether- they don\u0027t even match each other! The A150 0.625m-1.875m adapter seems to use the same orange as the Rockomax tanks for some reason, which is a different shade to the other 1.875m tanks which is different to the 1.25m tank orange; the \u0027white\u0027 patterns aren\u0027t white (in some cases there\u0027s more black in the white pattern than the black and white one!) and some of the black and white patterns are visibly more grey than white compared to others,\u00A0and don\u0027t match the other stock parts at all and what is with the A151 fuel tank having a thick black vertical stripe when none of the other tanks do?\u00A0In addition, several of the 1.875m engines such as the cheetah or bobcat have bases that work fine with the \u0027white\u0027 versions of the two smallest tanks but are terrible with the other colours and tanks, especially orange! Clearly a lot of the tank designs are meant to look like old NASA rockets such as\u00A0Mercury, Delta and Saturn\u00A0or the Space Shuttle launch system, but this leaves very little scope for building anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of this mishmash of paint schemes, I\u0027d like to see a custom paint system that would let you pick from a range of different patterns including vertical and horizontal stripes of varying sizes, new patterns based on real rockets (there are a lot to choose from- Russia/USSR have plenty of rockets to pick from and India, China, UK and Europe- no political statements intended, I just like the Black Arrow\u0027s spiral paint- all have options too)\u00A0as well as textures like the corrugated or tile-like patterns that already exist or even something totally new like polka dots or geometric dazzle camouflage, then choose the frequency of that pattern (how many stripes do you want? etc.) and then the colours using RGB sliders- I\u0027d say stick to two or at most three options or the whole thing could get too complicated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApplying the pattern consistently across different sizes and shapes of parts might be tricky, but the result would be great to look at, especially on the Steam workshop and sharing ship designs/screenshots on the forums. Serial creators could use their own individual patterns to make all their stuff look the same rather than everything being white, you could use different paint patterns to mark specific vessels depending on what they\u0027re for/where they\u0027re going etc. and for pure creativity it would be a massive bonus. Being able to save a particular pattern and apply it to multiple parts on the same vessel at once and on new vessels would be required to make this feature useful- doing each tank individually would take so long that it wouldn\u0027t be worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis system could also be applied\u00A0to the payload fairings which are similarly lacking in aesthetic appeal and which would also benefit from custom painting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a quick fix, how about making the grey and orange patterns for all the different tanks use the same grey and the same orange? This is particularly applicable to the making history parts where there are several different shades of orange in use on different parts that don\u0027t match each other or the stock 1.25m and 2.5m tanks. I actually prefer the MH-style white with black highlights pattern to the \u0027dark\u0027 theme for 1.25m tanks, but they should all use the same white and the patterns should match up more closely. The \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027black and white\u0027 names for those tanks should probably be reversed as in most cases the black and white version is mostly white with a few small black bits whereas the white version often has large black patterns on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Docking alignment indicator in docking mode.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m surprised this isn\u0027t a stock feature as docking is a pretty important part of building anything in space and is also quite hard to do (trying to keep the two ships aligned using target tracking will in some cases inexplicably target the wrong part so the ports keep moving away at close range, and target tracking isn\u0027t available in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E without a highly skilled pilot or a later-game probe core/part in Career mode). A simple docking alignment mod is out there and is incredibly useful so a stock implementation that ties in with \u0022docking mode\u0022 and shows where both docking ports are pointing and your direction of movement\u00A0seems like a quick win. Another related beneficial feature would be\u00A0the option of locking docking ports to set angles e.g. 90 degrees of roll relative to each other, or the ability to rotate sections once they\u0027ve docked; either one would make building larger structures in space considerably easier.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Tracking station upgrades.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m sure most people have done it: launch a mission to one planet/moon/whatever, go and do something else while it\u0027s on its way, then realise you\u0027ve missed the planned insertion burn and your mission has been launched out of the target body\u0027s sphere of influence and potentially right out of the solar system itself, with no way to get it back without loading a previous save which could potentially undo several hours of gameplay. A warning of some kind in the tracking station, or even better when time warping anywhere including on other vessels, when something is getting close to a maneuver node would make it much harder to miss an important burn to put a probe into orbit, correct course or just pay attention to a ship as it\u0027s about to re-enter on Kerbin. Sure, there\u0027s a mod that can do something similar but you still have to set the alerts manually so if you forget or get it wrong, you\u0027re still going to miss that node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso in the tracking station, I\u0027d like the ability to rename a vessel and change its type without having to load it up. That could prove useful for something that has a shroud on it (I usually keep the shroud on for missions to Eve/Jool to better protect the rover/lander inside when aerobraking into orbit or to the surface) and save time if you\u0027ve launched a load of missions with sequential names only to notice that there are two 3s or you\u0027ve missed 11 and need to change a lot of names to correct the problem. Another useful feature would be to show remaining delta-V in the tracking station which would be useful for seeing if those \u0027move this vessel to a new orbit\u0027 missions are feasible. It would also be helpful to see the total required delta-V for all planned maneuvers in the tracking station and on the map as you\u0027re flying, so you know if the set of precise orbital maneuvers you have planned out will run out of fuel half way through (we\u0027ve all done it, right? ...right?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Aircraft improvements.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Mk2 cargo bay feels very cramped and doesn\u0027t work particularly well as a rocket-launching plane because you can\u0027t fit anything in except a 1.25m fuel tank and possibly some of the cheapy fins if you shift them inwards a bit and put them only on the sides. If the Mk2 parts were slightly bigger (maybe 10-20%) then there would be much more room to fit more useful parts inside and make using a plane as an alternative to a first stage more feasible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s an obvious gap in the array of wing options too- there\u0027s no square Big-S wing, only a triangular one which isn\u0027t nearly big enough when used with the other Mk3 Space Shuttle-style parts. A square wing would make large aircraft fly, and look, much better than using the much smaller square/rectangular wing pieces. There\u0027s also an opening for a Mk3 inline docking module with the option of a regular or large Clamp-O-Tron docking port and possibly a Mk2 rear-loading cargo ramp to match its Mk3 counterpart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that could prove particularly useful on planets other than Kerbin is an electric-powered aircraft engine. It doesn\u0027t have to be massively powerful- something a similar size and power to the Juno jet engine would be sufficient- but being able to run on electricity would allow aircraft to operate where the atmosphere doesn\u0027t allow conventional engines to work. It would also have the benefit of being able to refuel using solar panels, fuel cells or RTGs meaning it could operate for much longer than a traditionally-fueled aircraft could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Expanded deployable science options (for Breaking Ground)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI only recently downloaded the Breaking Ground expansion but the deployed science array seems rather limited. There aren\u0027t that many experiments to use- mystery goo, weather, ionography and seismic- and they only work half the time because there are no batteries to store charge from the solar panels (the RTGs are at the very far end of the career tech tree). They also require a crewed mission to deploy them in the first place and generate science very slowly even when deployed by a 2-star scientist, which is the best you can do without venturing beyond Kerbin\u0027s orbit. I\u0027d like to see more experiments such as a ground sample analyser with its own little sample collection rover, a telescope/observatory of some kind (better results with no atmosphere) and some kind of particle collector that catches and analyses dust (better results in atmosphere because wind will carry the dust but still functional without an atmosphere because dust gets thrown up by impacts). There\u0027s a lot of scope for expansion here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the option of having a larger unmanned experiment control core that can deploy the modules by itself, much like the InSight lander deployed a set of experiment pods on Mars. This would obviously have a limited capacity and limited range of deployment meaning there wouldn\u0027t be much space to deploy the modules around the core and lower science generation rates than modules deployed by a Scientist, but the central core would have some power generation (enough to power at least 2 deployed modules should do) and communication (similar to the HG-48 module) abilities of its own and would be ideal as an advance mission which could then be expanded by a crewed mission adding extra modules later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing- when trying to move maneuver nodes I keep ending up accidentally changing the radial in/out values instead because it can be hard to click on the central hub of the node, so moving the adjustment handles out a little bit more or making it one click to move, click again to adjust would be a simple but useful change. It would also be nice to have the ability to have the nodes\u00A0snap and lock to the apoapsis/periapsis or ascending/descending nodes of an orbit rather than trying to make fine adjustments as the viewpoint constantly changes due to the movement of the vessel and/or planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-01T19:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-01T20:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572637498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Improved fuel tank paints\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES!!!!!!\u00A0 Especially the 1.875m - at least make them match each other!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572637498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n44 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Tracking station upgrades\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad just needs to add functions of the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod to the stock game, which is pretty much what you are asking for.\u00A0 IMO, that is needed even more than a stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E indication was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572637498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Expanded deployable science options (for Breaking Ground)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with the battery idea, to be able to transmit in the dark.\u00A0\u00A0 I like the dust experiment idea too, but I\u0027m not crazy about the probe deployment idea.\u00A0 The whole reason behind them is to give kerbals something to do other than plant a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EnderKid2","CreatedById":145622,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T00:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReStock mostly solves your first problem, and looks great in any case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T01:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223698520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189490\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572637498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like the ability to rename a vessel and change its type without having to load it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1 unknown KSP feature, you can actually do this.
