Thanks for that!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have installed 1.0.5 and started a new career.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe new milestones are nice, but: \u003Cbr\u003E\n-the litte 2 lines in the milestones message, doesn\u0026#39;t give you the feeling, that you have achieved a milestone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-deleting the message deletes all milestones\u003Cbr\u003E\n-if you don\u0026#39;t delete it, it\u0026#39;s hard to have an overview in this litte Window\u003Cbr\u003E\n-you can\u0026#39;t see, what milestones exist\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Milestones don\u0026#39;t just overlap with \u0022world firsts records\u0022 contracts. to me they are the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-world firsts records give you the feeling, that milestones should give you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-but it\u0026#39;s hard to get all world first records. If you do to much at once, you break the order and will never see some of them. And it\u0026#39;s very frustrating, if you don\u0026#39;t get historical contracts like land on mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-getting rewards for world firsts and milestones at the same time, makes the game way to easy. You just get to much rewards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I have a suggestion, which would make the contract system more clear, less frustrating for beginners, and more flexible for pros: \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nA clear separation of milestones and contracts. And the uniting of milestones and world\u0026#39;s first.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn one side you will have the Milestones: \u003Cbr\u003E\nthey are the big steps in your space Programm, like launching first vessel, landing on mun etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so they should be displayed and listed like big steps.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey are the progress of your space program.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the other side you will have contracts: \u003Cbr\u003E\nDoing things for other organizations, to get some extra money / fun / challenges.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe contract system should stay like it is, but without the world fists contracts. It should really just be contracts, and nothing that overlaps with milestones.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn detail I would do it like this: \u003Cbr\u003E\n-In mission control, there are two main tabs: milestones and contracts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-contracts stays like it\u0026#39;s now ( available, active, archives) \u003Cbr\u003E\n-milestones has just an \u0022open\u0022 and \u0022achives\u0022 tab\u003Cbr\u003E\n-in the \u0022open\u0022 tab (name may be changed) you see all existing milestones, that you haven\u0026#39;t achieved jet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-the \u0022open\u0022 milestones should be listed in an order that makes sense (launch first vessel, achieve heigt of x, escape atmosphere, ..... Land on mun , and so on) \u003Cbr\u003E\n-this order does give the beginner something like a red line to follow (most of my friends, lose the interest for the game, because they don\u0026#39;t clearly see, what would make sense to do next) \u003Cbr\u003E\n-but this order does just exist in the list, you can achive any milestone at any time in any order, just like it is now. So experienced players can do wat ever they want.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-milestones should be displayed more like the world firsts, just to make them feel more like milestones\u003Cbr\u003E\n-all world firsts contracts should be transferred to milestones and should be deleted under the contracts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know the \u0022open\u0022 list will be long, but a using a good order, will make it easy to use. (or maybe with filters, like in the science archives) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what you will get is: \u003Cbr\u003E\n-a clear red line for beginners, what they could do next\u003Cbr\u003E\n-an untouched flexibility of what you really do next\u003Cbr\u003E\n-a clear overview of what you have achieved and what you can achive\u003Cbr\u003E\n-a clear and realistic separation of: \u003Cbr\u003E\nA: your space program progress (milestones, financed by the government) \u003Cbr\u003E\nB: contracts (doing things for other companies, to boost your space program) \u003Cbr\u003E\n-Less frustration, because nobody will ever miss a world firsts contract (because they are all milestones now) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s just my idea, but I think it would make the game more accessible and playable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKindly\u003Cbr\u003E\nKergarin\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T16:41:16Z","Content":"\nGood thoughts here Kergarin. I have to say I really like the new milestones system especially the breadth of opportunities; I\u0026#39;m always disappointed when I miss a World\u0026#39;s First contract. It also really gives more flexibility to your space program and returns to the sandbox feel of KSP which is why I got into it in the first place - every save can be whatever you want. Overall I agree and would like to see the World\u0026#39;s First contracts merged into milestones; however, the milestones should absolutely be more visible as suggested here and in a couple other threads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt makes me think back to when the World\u0026#39;s Firsts contracts were first introduced alongside the \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts. So, for example, you could have the 4-part \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract and alongside you get a series of World\u0026#39;s Firsts to flyby, orbit, return, land, etc. It felt really redundant to me because you were essentially getting paid twice, which is very similar to the milestones and World\u0026#39;s Firsts now. (Side note: Are the \u0022Explore\u0022 contracts still in 1.0.5? I haven\u0026#39;t upgraded my career save.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow that I think about it more, however, the World\u0026#39;s First contracts do give more of a targeted progression while milestones are more in the background (currently). Standard contracts are generally stand-alone (this is less of the case now with contextual contracts), but the World\u0026#39;s First give more long term objectives to guide the player. Maybe an expanded version of the \u0022Explore\u0022 contract with all of the corresponding milestones grouped together...hmm this almost sounds like a 180 from what I said in the first paragraph. (Maybe just having the milestones more visible will satisfy this role of long-term progress.)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T17:08:03Z","Content":"\nSome milestones should remain hidden.
