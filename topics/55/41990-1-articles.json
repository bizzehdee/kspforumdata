KSP doesn\u0027t make huge demands on today\u0027s video cards, so if Unity allows for two render passes on separate cameras, this would be fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UI could be kept at screen depth, the player\u0027s ship would be centered on screen depth (poking into and out of the screen), or sitting just in front of the screen. There would need to be some simple how-far-apart-are-the-stereoscopic-cameras algorithm that would need to adjust to the scene and player\u0027s zoom level -- in space if you used the same eye separation that you do near the surface on the planet, you\u0027d lose a lot of the 3D effect. Throw in an easily-accessable setting for tweaking the camera separation distance (the right setting is going to vary depending on the player\u0027s distance from their television) and you\u0027d really add to the experience of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
