See image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must say I already staged prematurely several times due to that because in complex designs there\u0027s not always good view at flames coming out of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as the indicator shows liquid fuel amount, it may also happen that the engine won\u0027t run even though there is still liquid fuel available - simply because there\u0027s not enough oxidizer available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I suggest to add color coding to engines, similar to how parachutes are color coded. Two colors would be enough - white, meaning normal conditions, and red, meaning zero thrust because of lack of required resource.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C4ZjpPP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C4ZjpPP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saberus","CreatedById":56124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T14:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second this, simple and intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might also suggest that the bar show which fuel source is lacking, be it LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, IntakeAir, ElectricCharge, or XenonGas (Or Kethane if you use the mod.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
