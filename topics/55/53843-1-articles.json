A mapping project should give you a high resolution (as opposed to the current low res 3d map currently available in flight) 3d map that you can zoom in on so close you can see the anomalies (if you know where to look) but also find perfect base placement amongst several bio-mes.

I know I would probably do it too. Yes photos are clearly scientific in nature from plain visible light photos to radio wave photo representations they provide a wealth of scientific knowledge. Photos should have two uses game play wise. One is purely about gaining scientific knowledge. The other is to bring our community together by sharing our missions with each other. The same is true about the real world, these photos bring humanity together in triumph and tragedy.
