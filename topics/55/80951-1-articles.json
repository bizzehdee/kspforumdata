If I have screenshots 1, 2, 3, and go and delete screenshot 2, the next screenshot created should have number 4, not 2. I.e. the game should find highest used number and create a screenshot one higher, instead of looking for first unused number. Reason is simple: I may want to delete screenshots that did not end up well, but I still want related screenshots to stay together. The way it is made it may end up as a huge mess if I go and delete some screenshots I don\u0027t want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T19:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHrm...
