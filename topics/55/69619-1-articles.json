Mostly useful for low and high orbits, but landings may also profit from this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Have surface samples from Kerbin only have science value when processed in the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdds a reason to have planes (to collect samples and return them to KSC) and space planes (presumably the easiest way to get the samples from the survey plane into capsule capable of reaching orbit, apart from a smaller rocket with a lot of ladders at least) while simulating our own habit of shooting up stuff from earth to examin it in microgravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Let the lab actually return all data when below 90km at Kerbin/above the \u003Cem\u003EBooster Bay biome\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make full use of the labs ability to hold the same report multiple times - I do not know if/think that these multiples can than be \u003Cem\u003Eall \u003C/em\u003Emoved to a pod to be dropped back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If this is not a design glitch, I am yet unsure if I think it should be seen as one.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Switch EVA and crew report: EVA being the \u0022we got here\u0022, and the crew report being \u0022this is what we saw\u0022 - especially in regards to orbiting above different biomes it makes more sense to have different reports for each biome from the pod using its instruments (e.g. cameras) then \u0022I am in space in a suit next to my spaceship and I see trees ... now water ... mountains ... trees again ...\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make pure data experiments (sensors and reports) movable by the right click menu like fuels.
