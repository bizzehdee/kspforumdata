It\u0027s nice to get a meaningful update after the last three or so versions were a little (or a lot) meager. But of course we are always wanting more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst some feedback. I dislike the current tech tree setup; I don\u0027t think it makes a whole lot of sense. Even discussions of tech tree positions of probe cores and such aside, there\u0027s some parts that are inexplicably deep and others that aren\u0027t. Personally I\u0027m of the opinion that it should start you off with aerospace flight and rovers, and you travel around Kerbin a bit and gather rocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat aside, I also think it\u0027s a bit too easy to gather science itself. I think the current system lends itself too easily to min/maxing. I can sit in space and run an experiment and transmit it nine times in a row? I think it would be better if you had severe diminishing returns on a per-flight basis. Some things give you tons of science inexplicably as well, such as sample gathering from the spaceport... doesn\u0027t make too much sense there. I was messing around and making slow progress when I did my first return trip to and from the mun... and with the 500 some science I got I was able to unlock like half the tree. On top of that, doing constant experiments mid-ascent for some easy bonus points just seems ridiculous. Why don\u0027t experiments take time to perform, or disable ship controls if you have just one guy (since he needs to run the experiment). More types of labs would also be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you added different labs it would be neat to add more scientific research types. For example, propulsion and fuel researches could require a lot of work with goo and cryonics, while structural researches would need a materials lab and engineering station. You could then use multiple kerbals and assign them to run experiments... and now you\u0027ve created a demand for space stations at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, we always want more... I wanted to make this post earlier but wanted to wait until after .22.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I am super-excited for resources, I somewhat doubt we\u0027ll be getting them for at least two more updates. I\u0027m of the opinion that the next version of KSP needs to focus on a content injection. We\u0027ve had the same planets forever. We stopped getting new and meaningful parts a long time ago. I for one am getting burned out with the same planets and places. I skipped 0.21 and most of 0.20 because I\u0027ve been playing this for years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the time has come to give us new places to see and new things to explore. Even if the choice was resources over comets, asteroids, and new planets or interplanetary anomalies, I\u0027d take planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bekiekutmoar","CreatedById":23500,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T15:18:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I find the current update the least appealing so far. But that\u0027s mostly on my end; I\u0027m not interested in careermode as it feels somewhat \u0027restrictive\u0027 and am a real sucker for planets, moons, their landscapes, atmospheres and the likes. Squad aims the 0.22 update mostly at those who are new to KSP, and that\u0027s a good thing. The Tech Tree gives new players some sort of overview of how KSP has evolved since july 2011, although its logic can be argued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to see is a geographical update for Eeloo, Bop, Vall, Tylo and Laythe. While planets like Moho, Duna and Eve now presents a fascinating landscape, the \u0027Joolian\u0027 moons (except for Pol) and Eeloo can come across as a little boring. Vall, Laythe and Bop still have the same form as when they were introduced in the game in version 0.17. New celestial bodies? Dunno of its achievable without the new discovery system proposed by the devs. Gotta admit I haven\u0027t even landed on Tylo, Bop, Pol and Eelo yet ...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSuperintendnt","CreatedById":47102,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T16:34:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EResources and their collection/processing/usage.
