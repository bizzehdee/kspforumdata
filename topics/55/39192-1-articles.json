I have a decent computer, and as soon as I try to make something a little bit more complicated (say, 500-1000 parts), the performance drops to levels where I use MechJeb, simply because a launch to orbit can take an hour or more. Suggestions for improved performance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Don\u0027t treat all parts as structural. For example, I want to add lights, antennas, navlights and other mostly aesthetic stuff, but, as they increase the part count, perfomance drops to a slow slideshow. So, my suggestion is to treat those \u0022decorative\u0022 parts as just decorations, and not include them in the physics calculations for structural failure et cetera. That would reduce the number of performance sucking components a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Add something like Procedural Fairings, but, when the payload is hidden under the fairings, it\u0027s replaced by a \u0022dead mass\u0022, with the same center of gravity, angular momentum and so on, but it\u0027s one single part. That way, even a complex payload (like my current 600 part permanent Eve base) would run smooth as grease. It would also encourage the use of fairings, which means nicer looking, more realistic rockets, instead of the usual bird\u0027s nests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Allow some parts to make a permanent bond, in effect making them a single part for the physics engine. Example: Tanks. If you use a stack of two orange tanks or four half size grey tanks shouldn\u0027t matter. Either way, they should, for the physics engine, become one big tank, totally rigid. Less parts, better performance. Would also reduce the wobble problem a lot, as well as making \u0022realism sense\u0022 (for a real rocket, they would make one tank as large as needed, not stack a bunch of small tanks). Other positive side effects are less need for struts (once again, fewer parts) and less different parts needed (why need several lengths of tanks if you can just stack smaller tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Larger VAB and SPH. I frequently build craft that don\u0027t fit well in them, especially the height of the VAB is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Landing pad. Precision landings are fun, but the launch pad is usually cluttered by launch supports, and has some nasty slopes. So, just a circular concrete pad with some markings to land on would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Autoexec action group. I\u0027d like to be able to set up an \u0022autoexec action group\u0022, where I could add actions that should be performed automatically even before the craft is put on the launch pad. Typical examples: lower gear (for testing landers and stuff, it\u0027s often useful to start in the \u0022landed\u0022 position), disabling gimbaling, disable fuel cross-feed, activate lights/nav lights and so on. Basically, a way to put the vessel on the launchpad, ready for start without fiddling around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* View controls in the SPH. For larger craft, they quickly become very awkward and pressing the correct key almost becomes guesswork. I\u0027d like some more intuitive, first-person-shooter-like controls. Move with the arrows, look with the mouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Trusses. I often put stuff on other places than the ends of the trusses, and it\u0027s fiddly, very fiddly. I\u0027d like some more attachment points, such as on each side, half a truss width from the end (for nice 90 degrees joints) and halfway along the length on each side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Realism. I know there are a lot of people who wants hardcore realism, but I\u0027d want a mode left that\u0027s something like what we have today. Frankly, I have no interest in the next to impossible logistics of realistic manned interplanetary flight. Too much realism would also create a too high threshold for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* VAB and SPH, aligning parts. A common situation is that I\u0027ve, finally, after fiddling around with pixel precision mouse movements, manage to get the part where I want it. Problem is, it\u0027s not pointing perfectly in the direction I prefer. So, I\u0027ll have to click the part and try to align it properly without it popping lose and me having to start over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is some modifier key, say, Ctrl, which, when pressed when clicking a part, leaves the part connected in its current position, but still allows me to rotate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Building \u0022rings\u0022. As far as I can see, with the exception of struts, no components can be connected so that a loop is formed. or, in other words, they will only connect on one node when you place them. Example: Take four four-way connectors and four habitat modules (or tanks). Try to make a square using those parts. When you try to put the last part in, it will only connect to one node, making the construction wobbly. Sure, I can use some mod, such as quantum struts, to stiffen it, but then I get more parts and require a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is a biggie to fix, as it probably would require changing the internal data structure as well as the VAB/SPH logic, but it would be very nice if it could be fixed, as it would allow some very sturdy constructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Stronger parts. Seriously, vessels over a certain weight is next to impossible, as tanks start to collapse simply because of the weight of the stuff stacked on top of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Clearer part descriptions. The main thing I miss is clear information about if a part is 1.25m, 2.5m et cetera. Shouldn\u0027t be too complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Mod compatibility. I know it\u0027s under development, and one can\u0027t do a lot of work to not break mods. That said, try to avoid unnecessary changes that will break mods, and try to announce in advance what mod makers will need to do to keep their stuff working, to minimize their downtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFace it, KSP is, for many players, a very mod driven game, and breaking mods slows adaptation of new versions and causes unnecessary annoyance. I\u0027m not saying that you should go out of your way to preserve mod compatibility in all cases, but keep it on the agenda.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Modders. Seriously, there are some really, really good modders and mods out there. I know you\u0027ve hired one modder. If economy permits, consider hiring more, or negotiate with some of the modders to give some mods an \u0022official\u0022 status as part of the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it may look like I\u0027m just whining, but the truth is that I really love this game (I wouldn\u0027t do a two hour slide-show speed launch with choppy sound if I didn\u0027t really, really love the game). That\u0027s why I bothered to write this long post with suggestions about some details that bothers me. I hope some of them will be found useful. Either way, excellent work, keep it up!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T20:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, that\u0027s a whole lot of suggestions, I\u0027ll try to go point by point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerformance: The performance upgrades are limited for now. By what? Mainly by Unity, the game\u0027s engine. Changing engines at this stage is completely out of question, and since Unity does not support 64bit and multithreading, what you can do with it is very, very limited. Hopefully, support for both of those things will be added soon. Now for the specific points:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) That\u0027s already being done. Parts whose\u0027s mass is low enough are being treated as completely massless and are ignored by the physic engine at some extent.

Also, your idea of removing the structures below, as good as it is, would mean loading all the objects upon fairing separation, which could be extremely demanding to the game depending how much stuff is under. Try to think about your big crafts loading on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) That is also on the do not suggest list. There\u0027s a mod for it in the meanwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarger VAB/SPH: The lasted updated sort of nerfed this in my opinion. There was a mod who made the VAB/SPH larger, but they removed that feature now because the new ones are much larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding pad: Could be useful. I see this further down the development road though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuto action groups: Most definitely will be useful, I agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControls in SPH: I have no idea what you mean there. Really, controls are the same at all time and don\u0027t change from a craft to another, so I don\u0027t really understand what you mean here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETruss attachment nodes: A few more attachment nodes would be useful, but it wouldn\u0027t be really adaptable to any situation, and it could cause some attachment node clustering which could be hard to manage in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism: An insane amount of realism is not planned, and it\u0027s even being rejected by the devs. They want this to stay a cartoonish and fun simulator game, not a realistic simulator. This is partly why they left the game moddable though, so everyone could have it the way they like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAligning parts: I agree on this one too, would be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERings: This would be insanely complicated for the editor to recognize two simultaneous attachments on a part. That would likely require a complete rehandling of the parts in the VAB and SPH, and if it is to happen, it\u0027s probably far on the development priorities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStronger parts: That comes from the way the parts are handled together and from how they are attached to each other. Currently, the game considers a single attahcement point between parts, and that causes a lot of weird things. Stabilizing the parts will most probably come sometime relatively Soon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClearer information: Usually it\u0027s given, and after the first time you test it out you\u0027ll realize what size it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod compatibility: I\u0027m forced to completely disagree here.

The best they can do is announce beforehand what is planned for the next update, and they already do it. This way you can get an overview of what might break.
