One big thing that has been bothering me is how vessel recovery works. When you land your ship safely on Kerbin, you click the big recover vessel button and you get some money for the parts. However, i think it would be much more fun if instead of only having those parts in money, you had the parts themselves (maybe stored somewhere around the KSC?). These are my suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nHave a sort of inventory for parts at the KSC (a \u0027part hangar\u0027, or something like that).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen recovering a rocket, send all the used, but safely recovered parts to this part hangar. You don\u0027t get money for the parts (maybe just for fuel?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen building new rocket choose between old, used parts (which may be not so stable anymore, adds an extra dimension of difficulty to the game) or new parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe able to sell old parts for money.
