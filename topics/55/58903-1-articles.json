Since there would only ideally be at the most 10 people per server, SQUAD could set up 10 predetermined locations for space center construction which players joining a server for the first time could pick from, and then do all of their launches from the site. This would also take away the need for a \u0022network bubble\u0022 around the space center like KMP does it, as different players\u0027 rockets would launch from different areas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox Arcana","CreatedById":70823,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T02:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer is on the what NOT to suggest list.
