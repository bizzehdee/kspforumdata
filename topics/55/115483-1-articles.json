(2.5m NERVA, 2.5m LF tanks, 2.5m Intakes, and 2.5m atmospheric engines.) (A 2.5m NERVA would be pretty insane though, it\u0027ll be the size of an X32 tank (the 1/2 2.5m orange tank, and about as massive with an 80% load of fuel.))\n\n2.5m for me is a comfortable size for some of the largest crafts; anything bigger, and Unity has a problem with large and massive parts (playing around the Orion mod showed me that.) We are missing a lot of the *other* side of the part catalog, LF-Only 2.5m parts and engines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T10:45:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 10:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KrazyKrl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T20:15:55Z","Content":"Keep the Wesley the same, nerf the whiplash, add propeller."},{"CreatedByName":"Mutex","CreatedById":106937,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T01:01:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I feel that there\u0027s a big gap between the current Turbofan and Turbojet engines, one intended for small, Mk1 planes, and the other for supersonic, high-speed jets - What about an engine that\u0027s about between that?

Something like an \u0022APU\u0022 tweakable in-VAB/SPH for the jet engines; which would disable their thrust, but turn it into massive power generation (and the thrust limiter could still be used to reduce the power generation and fuel drain.) The turbopumps in the SSME produced something like 71,140hp (53,049 KW) for fuel compression, and APUs are used on major jet aircraft."},{"CreatedByName":"hazard-ish","CreatedById":115844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:04:26Z","Content":"The idea of a new jet engine has my support, 2.5m or not.
