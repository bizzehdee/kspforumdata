As long as I get the 64bit version, I\u0027m not complaining. I even tried to use the 64bit on Linux. It works somewhat and KSP runs up to 8GB w/o crashing, but the performance is really ....ty to the point I just give up and went back to windows and running KSP with openGL. As long as they\u0027re working on the 64bit, I can wait. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
