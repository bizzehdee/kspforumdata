In RemoteTech you have directional antennas and conical spread which solve this issue of being able to use one dish to rule them all. I can\u0027t just use the biggest dish for everything because the cone of that dish wouldn\u0027t expand out far enough to reach Eve or Duna. Likewise, these dishes can only be aimed in the direction of one planet (unless those planets happen to be close to alignment, but blocking each other) which means you need at least one dish per planet, one for the Mun, and one for Minmus (though the tracking station will cover the Mun and Minmus everywhere except the opposite side of Kerbin from KSC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe seemingly inferior stock system they are planning won\u0027t have antenna direction and doesn\u0027t sound like they will have proper conical spread either, so there seems to be nothing but range (and perhaps cost and mass) preventing you from talking to it. Meaning you only need the biggest dish for everywhere. Now, I have no insights as to the actual system so they may have something else in place or planning I am not aware of, this is always a possibility. The OP\u0027s suggestion, though even more unrealistic, could impose limits to what the are planning to do so that it forces antenna diversity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow we have to talk about \u0027realism\u0027. Real antennas behave more like RemoteTech. From a technical standpoint, satellites and probes do not maintain constant connection to the base station. Their transmissions are in short bursts. These transmissions are scheduled and since we can predict how long it takes for these messages to travel from the distance they are and the frequency they are, we can have our base stations ready to listen. While it is true only one can talk at a time, that typically isn\u0027t an issue. As long as the dish is pointed in a direction where it\u0027s conical reception range is in effect it could talk to any of them at any given time, as long as it is only one at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-02T22:15:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2015 10:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T15:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite option for comms will be disable the system.
