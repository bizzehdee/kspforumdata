Ain\u0027t that cool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then you launch a whackjobian contraption that dumps 36 first stage boosters in the first 2000m of your ascent. Frame rates crawl to a halt...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait! It gets worse! Two of those boosters crash into each other, causing an explosion which spawns off 60 parts splattering all over in all directions, and of course crashing into \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E spent boosters. A chain reaction follows and \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E there are 684 parts flying around that the game has to keep track off, each in their own little physics bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Well don\u0027t put them in different bubbles\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would you merge the bubbles? How much calculation time is allowed to be spent on that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Simply increase bubble size\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo what? 100km? Whatever the size is, it\u0027s always going to be \u003Cem\u003Enot enough\u003C/em\u003E and it\u0027s quickly going to be too big for your computer to handle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with most suggestions is not that they\u0027re bad; they work very well for the intended scenario. The problem the developers are facing is that \u003Cem\u003Ethey\u003C/em\u003E have to make their code work for \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E scenario we, as users, can come up with. And we come up with a lot... As a result we end up with a lot of limitations that seem arbritary, yes even silly.

Keep in mind that you\u0027re stuck in Physics Acceleration until \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of those spawned off units have been resolved. And since you\u0027re running a handful of them (or more), Physics Acceleration at maximum speed probably means realtime. \u003Cem\u003EAt best\u003C/em\u003E. More likely your simulation will be running at half-speed. Or quarter speed. \u0022So what?\u0022 Well, you\u0027re going to be stuck with that for the full 500m those items are floating down on their chutes at a leisurely 7.5 m/s - That\u0027s about 1m gametime, and if you\u0027re running at quarter speed that\u0027s 4m of real world time. And that assumes you can keep track of them until they land and hit \u0022recover\u0022 to speed things up.

But it involves adding a lot of features to make it happen, possibly dramatically impacting framerate performance. It\u0027s a lot easier to say \u0022design wisely. Boosters spent are boosters spent and won\u0027t be recovered. If you don\u0027t like that, start working on those SSTO skills\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E suspect in future versions is that some boosters will have some auto-recover flag. After all, the KD25K description already states \u0022\u003Cem\u003EThis super heavy booster is designed to be recovered after jettisoning. Once recovered, it is refurbished and refueled for another launch.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
