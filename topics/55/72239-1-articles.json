No, it doesn\u0027t. They may not be able to play it smoothly, but they should be able to play it.

Tell people that their information about performance doesn\u0027t matter because their computer isn\u0027t the best in the world. That\u0027s definitely how development is done right?

That will take Unity 5 and the PhysX 3.3 SDK that comes with it to fix. As it stands, KSP requires a fair number of physics calculations, but that is handled in an anachronistic way. All of that is done on a single thread, meaning only one CPU core gets used at any time. In these conditions, a quad-core CPU has little-to-no advantage over a dual-core CPU. This will only be fixed with a software update, and until then, the only way to \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E leverage an appreciable amount of extra performance from KSP\u0027s physics is to overclock your CPU. To do so substantially requires a custom liquid-cooling loop (more esoteric cooling would use liquid nitrogen or liquid helium for cooling of the CPU, but it\u0027s safe to say this is far out-of-reach of most if not all KSP players). You might cry \u0022but what about a dedicated discrete GPU\u0022, but nVidia GPUs (the only ones that support off-loading PhysX to them ever since nVidia bought PhysX) are massively \u003Cstrong\u003Eparallel\u003C/strong\u003E computers. A single-threaded PhysX process can\u0027t be pushed through that with any appreciable increase in performance, and even the most recent versions get little to nothing out of it. CPUs are actually better.

The people who matter are the majority with mid-range hardware, not the minority with top-of-the-line stuff. To develop strictly for the latter is just bad business. It\u0027s for this very same reasoning that one sees so little support in games for multi-monitor setups.
