However the new antennas seem randomly placed, especially the relays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first antenna is already sufficient to cover all of the Kerbin local planets at L2 of the tracking station, so there is no need to ever build a relay except for situations where planetary bodies block communication. Since relays are not available at that point the player is \u0022taught\u0022 to play the game without relays, and essentially you never need them if you don\u0027t want to. But if you do want to play the game this way, you sadly soon realize that relays are (more of less) pointless, because with the strategies you were forced to use on Minmus/Mun you can work your way through the other planets. I think it would be better to allow the player to develop alternate strategies earlier in the game, for example having relays setup prior to planetary missions, if someone likes to play the game that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest to add a RA-1 relay antenna with 500Mm range to the \u0022Flight Control\u0022 research node. This solves two issues: for once you now have a way to do a early, Kerbin local relay net if you want to. Also that research node gets a bit more attention, as currently it is rather useless for career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T23:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, yes. How I love being \u0022taught\u0022 and held by the hand every time I start a career game. Isn\u0027t that great? Thanks to that I don\u0027t even need to look at the tutorials (who does? Heh!).\u00A0It\u0027s really nice having a proper tutorial mode. I don\u0027t need to worry about wheels or landing legs, or even ladders! Jeez, aren\u0027t they confusing?

It means that players are guided towards a certain goal, and in this case to solve flying around without having a relay net. The consequence is that players afterwards realize that the relay net is basically useless, because it is so easy to circumvent. Now the next time the player is playing he/she will not say \u0022Hey let\u0027s try it with a relay net this time\u0022 because it has been memorized as useless (at the time it was available). It should however be memorized as an alternate way to play the game, which can be done i.E. by making it available earlier, causing the player to think \u0022How would the game have been if I had gone this path instead of that path?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T18:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwoThe is right here. It\u0027s a sort of training that people internalize without thinking about---the same is true of reward systems in games.
