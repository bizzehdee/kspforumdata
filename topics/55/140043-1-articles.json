Is there a way that we could somehow show which parts are non-stock so that I can install the mod, remove the parts, and then uninstall the mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr if anyone has other suggestions, I would dearly love them.

I\u0027m super psyched that KerbalX lists out the mods as well as which parts are from which mod.
