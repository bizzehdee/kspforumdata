The amount of new features being added almost certainly mean that there will be new bugs and issues that will require one or more additional beta releases to work out, but that\u0027s not even the biggest issue in my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger issue is that there\u0027s not much actual game here. I love KSP (with hundreds of hours logged on steam) but it\u0027s more of an entertaining building/flight simulator than an actual game. There is no real goal to the game, nothing to strive for other than goals I set myself. The tech tree provides a modest progression framework, but it seems like the end of the tech tree should provide some advanced parts to accomplish some grand goal that just isn\u0027t there. Even minecraft at least added the ender dragon final boss when it went 1.0 so there was a way to complete the game, but KSP has nothing like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a game to be complete there has to be some goal to strive for, it\u0027s a relatively niche audience that enjoys completely open-ended games with no direction. Minecraft is something of an exception since it had a social multiplayer aspect from the beginning, completely free-form construction and procedural worlds that game essentially unlimited content, but it still added an \u0022end\u0022 for players to strive for if they so desired. KSP doesn\u0027t really have any of these (craft construction is the closest, but still relies on a decent selection of parts instead of being able to build directly from voxels) and doesn\u0027t have anything to really strive for. How do you win career mode? Unlock the full tech tree? Upgrade all the buildings? Plant a flag on every body (that is a fairly large goal, but it\u0027s still something I have to set myself, I don\u0027t actually get anything from it)? These are stepping stones for a grand goal that just isn\u0027t there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that IRL the space program is an ongoing mission that won\u0027t ever really be finished, but in a finite game there should at least be some kind of end goal (that could possibly be expanded later via expansion packs). One possibility is ancient ruins scattered throughout the solar system randomly for each new game so you have to find all of them which unlocks some kind of grand final mission, and possibly reward the player with something akin to a warp drive so they can explore the solar system at will, and would serve as a nice end to a traditional space program since now kerbals have gone interstellar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this game and I want to see it succeed, but at the moment this game is really still in alpha (don\u0027t tell me that ISRU and a new aero system are small features), this game isn\u0027t really even in a beta state yet if such major features are still being added, and obviously broken systems like the stock parachutes and water physics still exist. Once the main feature base is stable and the KSP community has had a chance to demonstrate they still work outside of the squad testing team, then we can start talking about a release, but we\u0027re not at that point yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T18:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Robotengineer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey are still the same company, but different divisions IIRC.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think they said they actually split, like into two corporations (possibly one owned by the other, not sure).
