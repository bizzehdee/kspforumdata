Given that the kethane miner also needs engines, fuel tanks, and kethane tanks, and you already have those in the tanker/transfer stage, it\u0027s better to add landing struts to that ship, instead of using a separate lander with a lot of duplicate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy making my kethane infrastructure simpler, I also made it more efficient and faster to use, until I had combined everything into a single class of ships.
