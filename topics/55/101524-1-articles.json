I would like to detach the LES and then fire the parachute underneath ! Same goes with docking ports : you have to choose between radial parachutes or radial docking ports ! How about both ? From top to bottom you would have a docking port, a decoupler, the chute, and your capsule. Once you are done with docking, jettison the docking port for re-entry and expose the parachute !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about that ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T18:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also second getting a stock inline chute, but I believe RealChute has several, if you aren\u0027t adverse to mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
