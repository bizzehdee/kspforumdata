Okay a one off payment upgrades a facility presumably increasing the energy requirement (especially \u00A0R\u0026amp;D)\u00A0but it remains a once only expense. How about each facility having an energy requirement that has to be met? Like comnet this would only be turned on if wanted. The requirement would scale up along with the building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInitially this could take the form of a bill that must be paid at a set interval, penalties for non payment could perhaps be reduced capability or some facilities unavailable until payment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the flip side there could be researchable techs giving sub-upgrades such as solar power, improved building insulation or even a receiver for beamed power.

I really think there should be a way to mine xenon\u00A0from certain, far away places (like the Jool system, even though it doesn\u0027t make much sense\u00A0but what does in KSP?). It doesn\u0027t really fix the lack of the ukpeep costs, but that\u0027s something I\u0027d like to talk in the second part of my post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem: the abundance of funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution: monthly capped budget (based on reputation) \u002B tech needing money instead of science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play my career that way^^^ (thanks to a few mods) and it\u0027s very nicely balanced. I have to watch my funds, wait for them to accumulate (a nice way to introduce the time-passing mechanic) and carefuly decide if I can afford new tech, a failed launch\u00A0or a facility\u00A0upgrade.
