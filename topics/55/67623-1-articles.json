(Although that can mess struts / fuel lines)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also save the same launcher, and copy the .craft file directly from the VAB folder to the subassembly one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to reuse an existing launcher, on which the \u0027root part\u0027 is in the payload : disconnect the rocket just below the payload decoupler,, and put it in non connected waiting state in the vab - then pick the root part, and erase the payload \u002B the decoupler. Now, pick the decoupler you just erased in the part list, and it becomes the new root part - and you just need to reconnect the disconnected launcher to the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards, Sgt_flyer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T13:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that a subassembly is not just a craft file. It\u0027s a craft file with at least one empty node on the root part. And most often you won\u0027t have that. This is why you can\u0027t just load a craft as a subassembly, because you won\u0027t be able to attach it. Of course it could set the system to detect it and allow/disallow, but that quickly goes on the heavy side, and you end up realizing the current system is much, much more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T13:11:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just save the craft you want to deliver as a normal craft, and the lifter as a subassembly?
