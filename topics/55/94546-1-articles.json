A bit of gravitational mass for the hard to reach space stations so it could draw you in if your smaller or visa versa (0.000054 gravitational force for example) as for asteroids, i have sent very small probes to land on some but they always slowly fall off no matter what u do, and hooks and anchors are way too heavy and big!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etell me what you think\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps. i know about a mod but it doesn\u0027t spawn the asteroids with gravity (its only asteroids any way)\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T03:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this would be cool to see, I think adding gravity to \u003Cstrong\u003Eships and stations\u003C/strong\u003E would be both nonsensical and a huge performance hit since you\u0027d probably want it to be a per-part thing (so big heavy parts have more gravity than, say, a girder). For asteroids, all you really need to do is make them (a lot) bigger for the gravity to be worthwhile... though then you wouldn\u0027t really be able to move them (see Scott Manley\u0027s old video on why you can\u0027t deorbit Gilly - and its gravity is almost non-existent).
