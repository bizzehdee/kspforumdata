Not even with mods like station sciences, only the launch was really exciting doing the science was like im just clicking a few buttons thats it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like being able to move around in a station (Like be able to \u0022be\u0022 a kerbal and walk around inside a station) would be nice. Instead of being stuck in one seat with limited views.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing that felt really dumb to me was that shouldnt most experiments be inside the craft not outside like those on the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the above was implemented modules can have an \u0022inventory\u0022 system to carry science experiments (and life support if its ever added). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these experiments can be done in IVA Mode with sorta some minigame inside or something to watch it do rather then just click a menu and it opens and bam you got science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will make things like having a station/base more exciting rather than just for fuel or to make tons of science with the new science lab\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T10:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoving around \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecompletely\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E free in IVA would be nigh impossible without restricting the way people can build ships, if you see what I mean here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BL9WOi3.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/BL9WOi3.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebeing able to move experiment results to the command pod without having to EVA would be great though.

Minigames would quickly get boring and repetitive and interior of a station, too.
