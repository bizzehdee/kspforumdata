If your rocket is designed to have the same drag at the same speed for a given air density (and Isp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E increase proportionately), then the force of drag goes up by 2^2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my intution is that 3x has roughly 3x the aero losses, 6.4x has roughly 6.4x the aero losses (but going to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E will change that relative to stock). Orbital velocity increases by root(3) or root(6.4)... thus the total change in velocity needed (which is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, after all) goes up by that much, but you have more losses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of that, if you aren\u0027t playing with some mods that increase part performance (most stock KSP parts are underpowered), you will probably end up packing on more fuel, and having a lower \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (more gravity losses)... and if you try to get around that, due to limited thrust to cross section ratios (although vectors are by far the best), your cross section and thus drag goes up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, its complicated, and it depends a lot on your flight profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts even worse for spaceplanes when considering the \u003Cstrong\u003E*closed cycle*\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E needed. In 1x, suppose you get to 1,800 m/s orbital on airbreathers... you\u0027re now about 550 m/s away from orbital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 3x, you\u0027ll have a bit more ground speed,\u00A0(but also a heavier plane that won\u0027t get as high), lets be generous and say that you reach 2,000 m/s orbital... thats still 2100 m/s shy of orbit... a roughly 4x increase in \u003Cstrong\u003Eclosed-cycle\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. And that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E is a lot harder to come by at 305-340 Isp, than from airbreathers at 3200-4000 Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing so much farther below orbital velocity, you now also need much more lift to maintain altitude, and much more lift for all that extra closed cycle fuel you need to carry, this means a lot more drag\u00A0at the same speed, and then you\u0027ll need to accelerate faster to get up higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I switched to high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E airbreathers that do a 30 degree or so zoom-climb/parabolic trajectory after hitting their power band... climb up and out of the soup, go closed cycle and keep pushing, get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E up, and then release the 2nd stage. 2nd stage gets into a stable orbit, and one can switch back to the 1st stage before it falls back into the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFully reusable with a better payload fraction than an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, much faster time to orbit, and much higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E -

talking incodence from nosing up during flight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNegative lift is *very easily* generated at pretty modest levels of control input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your Angle of Attack is 5-7 degrees (about what it should be in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E for a supersonic spaceplane, at least) and your pitch control input is 50% upwards, with default Control Authority (20 degrees in KSP!!), you\u0027ll get\u00A0*negative* 3-5 degrees angle of attack for control surfaces mounted behind the Center of Mass at 100% Pitch Control Authority (you SHOULD be creating separate surfaces for Yaw, Pitch, and Roll- and disabling the other 2 axes for each...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s more, even if the rear control surfaces are at completely neutral (0 degree) incidence, such as 50% pitch-up\u00A0input at 10 degree angle of attack, the control surface is still bringing down your Lift:Drag ratio- as it is still generating Drag for MUCH less than optimal (5-7 degrees \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, more like 7-12\u00A0degrees Stock) Angle of Attack...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy contrast, if you have LARGE canards (I don\u0027t think your canards were what I\u0027d consider \u0022large\u0022- also keep in mind that on the stock winglets only a SMALL PORTION of the lifting surface actually acts as a control surface and deflects- the rest just provides Lift like a normal wing with a much smaller control surface attached...) and are flying at 5 degrees \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E at 50% pitch-up, with control authority limited to just 10 degrees (what I would suggest- sometimes even less) then your canards are only at 10 degrees incidence- which has a better Lift/Drag ratio than the same control surface at 0 degree incidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s more, on many designs with rear-mounted engines the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E is well BEHIND the midpoint of the plane- which means nose mounted Canards have a much longer lever-arm with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E than do rear-mounted control surfaces.\u00A0 This means less force is required to generate the same torque and turn the plane.\u00A0 For instance, to maintain level flight at a certain altitude\u00A0you might only need 6 square meters of\u00A0frontal control surface deflected at 5 degrees from the rest of the wing (10 degree incidence), generating 2 kN of\u00A0extra Drag, with Canards 20 meters from your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E; whereas you might need 10\u00A0square meters of rear-mounted control surface, deflected at 6 degrees (negative 1 degree incidence) generating 2 kN of Drag directly and forcing the rest of the wing to generate an additional 2 kN of Drag (through either increased \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0or larger wing-area of the design) to make up for the loss of Lift from the Elevators\u00A0at this deflection (whereas the Canards generate MORE Lift when they deflect the nose up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese differences are *particularly* pronounced in KSP with spaceplanes (vs. regular planes), because spaceplanes end up with higher wing-loading and greater demand for Lift due to all the rockets/fuel\u00A0they need to get to orbit, their payload, the poor mass-ratios of fuel tanks in KSP, and the need for spaceplanes to cruise at higher altitudes and speeds (with jets optimized accordingly, and often producing reduced Thrust at high speed/altitude- necessitating use of more/larger jet engines...) than normal planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP jet engines also have all their mass in the nozzles- unlike REAL jets, which are embedded in the fuselage: meaning the Center of Mass tends to end up further back in KSP than in real life, and rear-mounted control surfaces become even LESS effective (and act more similarly to Spoilers and less like Elevators) as a result of their shorter lever-arms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get back to the *topic* of this thread, though: the higher wing-loading and reduced effectiveness of Elevators (due to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E too far back, thanks to unrealistic engine Center of Mass- which SHOULD be offset forward of the nozzle)\u00A0in KSP spaceplanes mean that you need to fight against even more Drag, and thus require larger jet engines than Stock KSP currently provides.\u00A0 Hence one more reason why we need larger (1.875, 2.5, and\u00A0maybe even 3.75 meter) jet engines in KSP...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.

*below* the peak (having excess wing area like this increases Drag, but has benefits like reducing takeoff/landing velocity and improving cross-range by increasing the cruise altitude and V*L/D, even as L/D falls).\u00A0 So, having Canards deflect just a few degrees will bring them to\u00A0peak L/D, and having them deflect a little more won\u0027t cause L/D to fall by much (while significantly increasing Lift).\u00A0 The key is simply not too place too much burden on the Canards relative to their area- they should be able to maintain control with maybe 6 or 7 degrees MAX deflection (so most
