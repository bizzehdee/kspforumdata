This is great, except it makes for a lot of switching over to a distantly orbiting buoy to wait on phase angles before ejection due to the altitude limits on time compression. All in all the system works, but it\u0027s terribly inconvenient and makes it easy to overshoot your ejection window. In my mind the ideal solution to the issue would be to allow instant warping to a particular date like one might set a clock ahead. Given that all entities not being directly interacted with are on rails, this should be no less doable than conventional time warp. It is worthy of note that this may be done in Orbiter through the editing of save files without fault, though orbiter also lacks an actual implemented tool for doing it to my knowledge. As far as balance is concerned, I don\u0027t see how it would be any different than standard time compression.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T02:41:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this is somewhere on the planned features list... or it should be.

It\u0027ll even let you plan a node, set an alarm for it, switch to another ship for faster time warp purposes, and then when the time comes it\u0027ll drop you out of time warp, let you jump back to the original ship, and restore the maneuver node. It\u0027s one of those mods that should be part of the stock game TBH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also edit your save file to fast forward time, much like you described in orbiter. Just google \u0022KSP save file editing\u0022, there are several guides on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that being said, I agree with you-- the altitude restrictions on warp are really a pain sometimes (though clearly necessary for several technical reasons.)

You then press go and it warps you within a degree (a few days give or take). This blends current time warp mechanics with a much faster, more convenient way to set up phase angles. It is important to note that KSP should realy start using predictive collisions and SoI changeovers so that you can\u0027t warp through planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
