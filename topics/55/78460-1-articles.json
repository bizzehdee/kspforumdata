I started over career mode, and within a single in-game day, I\u0027ve managed to work up 80k funds.

The only thing 0.24 has changed for me is that, rather than orbiting Kerbin because I want to practice orbital turns, I\u0027m doing it because the contract says so.

But I think there will be more economy added in later patches and it will be more balanced. For now and for me, I think the balance is just about right. And here is why. I don\u0027t like sandbox and during a career play I also build satellites, space stations and you know pretty much all you can do. So if for example at the middle of the tech tree I decide to build up one or two space stations, I will have to send up at least a few big rockets for each space station and parts later in the tech tree get more expensive. So building stuff which doesn\u0027t generate any money will cost big time, if you are like me and like to have dozens of sattelites (with expensive equipment) orbiting Kerbin. Thats what I will be using the excessive funds on. So the contracts are merely to progress in the tree and to earn funds. And with that money I build space stations, satellites and bases on planets. If the cost of parts would be increased and/or contract payouts decreased, there (may) not be enough money left over to do other stuff than contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-19T16:39:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2014 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by morph113\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T16:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that this is the first iteration of contracts, it is no surprise that it is not yet balanced, and errs on the side of generosity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Increase the amount of funds rewarded by completing contracts even more, BUT give us something else to spend excess funds on.
