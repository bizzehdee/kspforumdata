Example: what do apoapsis and periapsis mean? As it stands, a player would need to either figure it out themselves, or go look it up online. Knowing what these terms mean and their significance is a very important aspect of the game, yet the game doesn\u0027t equip the player to understand them. For example, even if they could figure out that Pe and Ap are the lowest and highest points of an orbit, they probably don\u0027t know about the Oberth Effect. New players probably also don\u0027t know what specific impulse means or what gimbal or thrust vectoring mean, and these are bits of information that game provides to you at the start. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne solution to this would be to explain all of this information in a series of tutorials. That might work, but it would require the player to complete the tutorials and re-play them if they wanted to revisit specific information. The tutorials would also require some very intentional design in order to convey the information in a useful way. A big part of this game\u0027s design, as stated by Harvester, is self-guided exploration. My solution fits into this concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESolution: The Knowledge Base\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I\u0027m suggesting is to create an in-game Knowledge Base (KB) comprised of brief explanations of important game concepts. The knowledge base would be placed in the R\u0026amp;D center and would essentially be optional. If players don\u0027t want to get bogged down with technical concepts, they can always do things the \u0022Kerbal\u0022 way, and slap some boosters on something. But if they find that they can\u0027t overcome a certain challenges (like achieving orbit), they can head to the KB and find out that orbiting the planet isn\u0027t about going straight up into space, but throwing your rocket at the ground and missing. The idea is to explain things in a brief, intuitive way without getting into equations or more technical information. For the players who are interested in learning more, they can go to wikipedia or pick up a book. My suggestion is about providing players with all of the information that they might need to play the game, but doing so in an unobtrusive way that allows them to seek out and explore the information at their own pace. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started playing this game, I was often frustrated and I wanted to find out \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy\u003C/strong\u003E certain things were happening or what things meant. If the Hows and Whys are contained within the game, it keeps the player engaged in the game itself, because they don\u0027t have to interrupt their gameplay by checking the game wiki, wikipedia, or forum posts. Keeping the player in the game itself enhances immersion, which is always a good thing. Providing the information also has the added benefit of making the game itself more educational, without bombarding the player with tool tips or forcing them to play tutorials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne issue I\u0027m wrestling with is how much information should be available and when. In Sandbox Mode, I think that all of the information should be available from the start. In Career Mode, I\u0027m on the fence. One implementation might have the player uncover more knowledge as they collect more science or upgrade facilities. This would be appealing from a gameplay perspective because the improvements in science and facilities would feel more meaningful, and would allow you to try new things from a technical standpoint (e.g. more parts available, higher vessel mass, more orbital information available like patched conics), but also a knowledge standpoint (e.g. knowing what \u0022patched conics\u0022 means, understanding transfer orbits, grasping the concept of delta V). If this knowledge becomes available, it should be available \u003Cstrong\u003Ebefore\u003C/strong\u003E the player tries to do something new. The idea being that Kerbal scientists and engineers have figured out these things from a theoretical standpoint, and you the player can go and test the models and theories by trying them out yourself. That allows two approaches: you can either read about the concept first, then try it out, or you can try it out, then go read about the Hows and Whys after you fail. The player isn\u0027t forced to \u0022study for the test,\u0022 so the game doesn\u0027t become boring for some, but the information is there if you need it, and the player knows where to find it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that an in-game Knowledge Base would allow the game to better stand on its own and improve player immersion. This information should be enough to give the player a basic understanding, but not so much as to be intimidating or tedious. I\u0027m curious to hear feedback on this idea from others and perhaps brainstorm ideas for implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ETL;DR\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep the tutorials.
