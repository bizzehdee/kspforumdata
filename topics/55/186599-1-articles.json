You can design robotic atrachments ato clamp the whole ship, but when warping they drift apart as they are seperate ships, so the sticky pads would clamp on and behave like the claw to make\u00A0it into one ship possibly with the fuel transfer disabled as that would be silly, bu allowing warp and allowing transfer of kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-22T13:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, attaching two vessels to each other by clamping one with a robotic clamps with the Grip Pads (or \u201Csticky pads\u201D if you like \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E) does not make the vessels into one vessel.
