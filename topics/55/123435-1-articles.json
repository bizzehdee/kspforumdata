It\u0027s not that engineers and scientists have no use, it\u0027s just that I have to have a pilot, and in the early pre-probe part of career, it\u0027s awkward to build multi-kerbal craft (the Mk1 pod really doesn\u0027t stack well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the moment that I unlock the OKTO, suddenly pilots are totally obsolete. I have no use for them at all. Yes, it\u0027s kind-of-sort-of nice to have the advanced SAS modes available before I have the top-end probe cores unlocked, but that\u0027s only a nice-to-have, not a have-to-have; whereas I really need what scientists can do (reset experiments) and engineers (mining). So for the 90% of my career that happens post-OKTO, pilots are just taking up space. It becomes particularly frustrating for me, since I like to populate my program with rescued kerbals, and fully 1/3 of them are useless pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I really like what Squad has done with the various professions, but pilots are in an interesting hole. Engineers and scientists have a use the entire game, but pilots get left out in the cold. I\u0027d love to see some sort of mechanic that makes pilots have some use throughout the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea that occurs to me: The upcoming patch will add the RemoteTech-like need for probe cores to be able to talk back to KSC via line-of-sight or relays in order to be controllable. It will also make it possible for kerbals in a ship to remote-control probes. What if you make it so that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eonly pilots have remote-control ability\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and also that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Econtrolling a probe core in your own craft counts as \u0022remote control\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. Thus, if I send a scientist to the Mun with a probe core on the ship, and then the ship goes around behind the Mun and loses LOS to Kerbin... suddenly it\u0027s an uncontrolled probe core, and the scientist has no SAS. That would give a reason to send pilots along: \u0022well, either I can add a pilot to the ship, or else I have to build a relay network of satellites.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s just one idea, I\u0027m curious what other folks have thought about this.

It\u0027s why I play KSP, that\u0027s the fun part. It\u0027s why I\u0027ll never run MechJeb-- it would be a game-ruiner for me. I realize that different players like different things, and what one player considers fun another just thinks of as a chore. But precisely because of such variations, anything that goes into the stock game should be something that pretty much everyone can get behind. The various \u0022hold direction\u0022 options they currently have are pretty good, I\u0027d be wary of going farther down that path in the stock game. Folks who want heavy-duty automation can run MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuto-kill horizontal and vertical velocity aren\u0027t needed, anyway-- they\u0027re easy to do with the current hold-surface-retrograde button, just set up a suicide burn and it\u0027s pretty easy.

For certain missions, they\u0027re a must-have: they\u0027re the only ones that can reset goo and materials-bay experiments. They can man science labs. For the mid-game where you need all the science you can get, and haven\u0027t yet unlocked the top-end science instruments, they let you get far more science done-- you can make a Mun lander go biome hopping and pick up multiple sets of results in a single round trip to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers? Gotta have them for mining. If you\u0027re flying a repeat Duna lander, gotta have them to repack the parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilots? ...Not so much of a much.

But once you have that basic ability, being able to auto-hold a particular attitude is just a minor convenience, not a must-have. Craft are easy to steer. If I\u0027m sending a Mun lander that has to have a scientist in it, I\u0027d rather put an OKTO on it and do manual piloting than try to add another ton of mass for an extra command pod to hold a pilot just so I can have \u0022hold retrograde\u0022 or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould love to see something that pilots can do that you \u0022gotta have\u0022 that isn\u0027t just a trivial convenience-- without being a game-breaker for a substantial number of players.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shark4558","CreatedById":147537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T21:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the only use of pilots is to handle rockets that have no remote control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich applies to the emergency rockets in my Kerbin space station ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea use that could be given to the pilots would be,having them in space, so when a important load arrives,let the pilots handle it,just in case something happens...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T22:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPilots have (for me, at least) an interestingly difficult problem: they have a shelf-life with a rigidly-defined (and early) expiration date.\u003Cp\u003EUp until the moment I unlock SAS-capable probe cores, pilots are utterly indispensable and I use them to the exclusion of everything else-- it\u0027s just too painful to try to control a ship that doesn\u0027t have SAS capability. It\u0027s not that engineers and scientists have no use, it\u0027s just that I have to have a pilot, and in the early pre-probe part of career, it\u0027s awkward to build multi-kerbal craft (the Mk1 pod really doesn\u0027t stack well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the moment that I unlock the OKTO, suddenly pilots are totally obsolete. I have no use for them at all. Yes, it\u0027s kind-of-sort-of nice to have the advanced SAS modes available before I have the top-end probe cores unlocked, but that\u0027s only a nice-to-have, not a have-to-have; whereas I really need what scientists can do (reset experiments) and engineers (mining). So for the 90% of my career that happens post-OKTO, pilots are just taking up space. It becomes particularly frustrating for me, since I like to populate my program with rescued kerbals, and fully 1/3 of them are useless pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I really like what Squad has done with the various professions, but pilots are in an interesting hole. Engineers and scientists have a use the entire game, but pilots get left out in the cold. I\u0027d love to see some sort of mechanic that makes pilots have some use throughout the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea that occurs to me: The upcoming patch will add the RemoteTech-like need for probe cores to be able to talk back to KSC via line-of-sight or relays in order to be controllable. It will also make it possible for kerbals in a ship to remote-control probes. What if you make it so that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eonly pilots have remote-control ability\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and also that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Econtrolling a probe core in your own craft counts as \u0022remote control\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. Thus, if I send a scientist to the Mun with a probe core on the ship, and then the ship goes around behind the Mun and loses LOS to Kerbin... suddenly it\u0027s an uncontrolled probe core, and the scientist has no SAS. That would give a reason to send pilots along: \u0022well, either I can add a pilot to the ship, or else I have to build a relay network of satellites.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s just one idea, I\u0027m curious what other folks have thought about this.
