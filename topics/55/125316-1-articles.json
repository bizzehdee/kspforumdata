I was wondering if this change would make it possible to show a crew portrait in EVA mode. While this seems a bit redundant on first thought, it would be nice to be able to see who you are controlling at a glance. Especially important when switching around between crew and ships using the bracket keys. The crew portrait could still show the camera in front of the Kerbal for added flare, allowing you to see the body they are on or in orbit of, or the skybox, what ever happens to be behind them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else think this is a good idea if possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, who wouldn\u0027t want to see Jebediah\u0027s smiling face as he galavants along the surface of the Mun (it would be especially funny if he started tumbling).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T17:44:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T18:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta admit, that is a handy feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
