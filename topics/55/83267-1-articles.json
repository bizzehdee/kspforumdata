A cylinder experiences the same drag going end on or sideways, there is no concept of streamlined or anything like that. This makes it easy to predict how the orbit of a craft changes as it flies through the atmosphere (unless it has wings). So as is, it\u0027s not too hard to do what you want, and the hard working folks behind mechjeb have done it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the plan is (or was) to change the atmosphere model to a more accurate one. Squad never made it particularly clear how much more accurate (I\u0027m hoping for something like NEAR), but better than the current one anyway. The side effect of this is that it will become much harder to predict the effects of aerobraking, because you\u0027ll have to consider the shape of the ship, and it will be different if it enters the atmosphere broadside on.

The only difference between stock aerodynamics, and something like NEAR/FAR is AoA, and since player can change AoA while aerobreaking, the ultimate prediction might be unrealistic. However, some prediction is better than none, and the aerobreaking predictor can easily assume a reasonable AoA, such as 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 depending on whether it is a splaceplane or pod i.e. choose whichever orientation is stable (i would argue for 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 default rather than a constant one relative to heading, since the initial AoA might be unstable once thicker atmosphere is reached; nevertheless, the player might want to know how much dV he would lose if he hit Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at 36 km at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 AoA, so i would still support advanced tools). The only catch would be is if 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 requires too much deceleration and/or heating (if aerodynamic disassembly or deadly reentry is enabled) for high speed/interplanetary kerbin captures, though i suppose the aerobreaking predictor could warn of that as well. To fix that problem, one could try to adjust AoA on the fly until it Apoapsis is not interplanetary. Thus, i think this predictor should be integrated into the patched-conics trajectories which are drawn on the map screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, as for the argument that Squad hasnt developed it since they would have to redo it once more complicated aerodynamics is implemented, i think that is bubcus: all they would have to do is make the predictor as general as possible (i.e. more complicated than would be required for stock aerodynamics) such that once new aerodynamics is added, it would still work. For example, even though in stock ksp, lift/drag is not a function of AoA, rather than using this fact when writing the prediction, it should call a function that gets the lift and drag coefficient as a function of AoA (and maybe even Mach). When stock aero is used, it would return a constant value, independent of AoA and when more complex aerodynamics is used, it would return those values. Thus, i dont think the predictor would have to be redone after stock aerodynamics improves...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
