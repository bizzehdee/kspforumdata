The idea is that you would have to perform a task like orbital insertion, getting to geosyncronous etc three times while you \u0022train\u0022 that Kerbal. Depending on how well you do (fuel used, circularity of orbit), the Kerbal is correspondingly skilled. You would then get to instruct that Kerbal to perform that task (essentially an autopilot). It only performs that task as well as you could (or slightly worse). You could perhaps only unlock training after a particular career stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has a number of advantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt prevents end-stage tedium (putting up 20 parts for a station.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHowever, you don\u0027t get to \u0022cheat\u0022 and use an autopilot to avoid learning how to do something.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPerhaps most importantly: there is then a real value put on Kerbal lives - you don\u0027t want to lose you expert launcher/ lander/ geo-synch pilot.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, this is similar to an Autopilot, but I thought this was a way of adding one that allows late-stage convenience but doesn\u0027t affect the early stage learning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T18:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Doozler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Doozler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know if this has been suggested before - I can\u0027t find anything exactly the same.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been suggested many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Doozler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Doozler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere seems to be a reoccurring Autopilot debate - does it remove the grind or remove the fun?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are you seeing this?

I played without mechjeb for ages before discovering it and so I did get used to doing things without help, but mechjeb actually helped me learn better ways to do things. Also even after playing for ages (probably not 100 mun landings but more than 20) I still found it tricky and frankly annoying the amount of times I would still crash on landings, have to reload, repeat, reload, repeat (snores). The latest releases of mechjeb limit access to modules depending on techs researched and I think it works pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I think there\u0027s (at least) two fundamental groups of players of this game. The \u0027purists\u0027 who feel that flight should consist of flying by eye and desparate button mashing during landings, and the \u0027realists\u0027 who prefer to simply see their craft fly and land efficiently without having to fight with controls. (yes guess, which i am!) I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to please both.
