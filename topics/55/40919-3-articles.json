(Assuming the KSP team decides to add other star systems) While it\u0027s very realistic to use ion or nuclear engines as an interstellar tug, it would take a very long time to get to the nearest star. (Scott Manly did a video and talks about a chemical propulsion with infinite fuel taking a day or two of acceleration, to get the travel time between stars down to around a day or two at full warp) Granted you can shrink that by increasing the warp, but your still talking about a ship that takes days of in time acceleration to get to a speed that takes years to get between stars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would like to see a way to build some kind of orbiting gateway.

This would make it so that getting to other stars is very difficult, but also make it viable to go there again. (After all, if it takes a hundred and twenty years for one round trip (and that\u0027s a assuming you could fit a return trip, instead of having to build it on site) it won\u0027t be very economically viable) This way you could set up a base on another planet in another solar system and add onto it and expand into that solar system.

Though power is more likely to be the governing factor of interstellar travel in this case. Shutting down all systems and ensuring that there was enough power left over to keep life support ticking for such an extended period of time would create new challenges.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDamn.. that sounds good too.

By hybrid warp I mean warp which could be huge (for example 10 000) but during which engines could work (altough the thrust level, roll and direction are fixed and physics disabled). There could also be a restriction that it couldn\u0027t be turned on if the ship hasn\u0027t last at least 2 minutes of speeding up at desired thrust level without structural linkage failure or changing the direction more than 5 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made separate suggestion of it, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-06T11:51:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2013 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anton P.
