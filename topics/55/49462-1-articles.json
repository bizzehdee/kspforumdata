Launches must be done with the camera facing towards the sky. Plane flying is tedious and painful. Even in orbit around Kerbin, the lag makes docking and other maneuvers frustrating. I\u0027ve already changed some of the config settings to help with that, but there is still some lag from the oceans, and now they look lower than they actually are, so things end up floating in air, instead of on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killerblonde","CreatedById":36220,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T17:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI experience the same problem with terrain in general, particularly Kerbin, the Mun, and Duna (the three places with the fancy terrain additions/craters I believe.)

They are a separate planet that is combined with the solid ground, causing huge slow downs with weaker GPUs. The only real way to get around this is to keep the ground/horizon out view, alter the settings.cfg file, or stay more than 160km above Kerbin. Obviously it\u0027s difficult to always keep the ground out of view (and kind of aggravating), and 160km is pretty high up. The settings.cfg change can usually help, but it\u0027s not always enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe settings.cfg changes are detailed here, if anyone is interested:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T18:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThen why is the problem almost gone if I look straight down into the ocean?
