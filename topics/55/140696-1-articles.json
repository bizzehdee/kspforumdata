I orbited Kerbin but I didn\u0027t get Orbit Mun until after I flew by the Mun. Now I want to land on Minmus but the contract doesn\u0027t appear- the guy wants to send me back to Mun instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the game should much more aggressively provide contracts for new bodies, so the player has a choice as to where to go and if they can get a contract for it. It\u0027s always a bit excrements to do something new but not have a contract for it so you don\u0027t get a big reward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe instead all of the \u0022Orbit Mun\u0022 style contracts should just be eliminated and folded completely into the World Firsts thing, so you never lose out by going further than you have a contract for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T14:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think (and many others) that programs (implemented in place of strategies) would work best for this kind of thing. Each program would have a bunch of missions/objectives the player could pick themselves. That way the progression would be way better, players could choose their own paths of progression and be free to do whatever they want to do at any time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knaapie","CreatedById":156655,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-29T14:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222605477\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464459683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002299040\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeadMG\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, DeadMG said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n....I think that the game should much more aggressively provide contracts for new bodies, so the player has a choice as to where to go and if they can get a contract for it.
