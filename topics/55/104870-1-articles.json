Very heavy ships, not much SAS force, very oddly placed RCS make easy controlling impossible. I constantly used the timewarp-stabilise in order to point my craft in the right way...\n\nNot very new-player-friendly, is it ?\n\nThyere\u0027s more : The fuel lines are very wery weirdly placed too ! You usually have 4 nukes around a big Rockomax tank, and on top of each theres a small 1.25m tank. The fuel lines from the big tank to the small ones do not work... This means you have to transfer fuel manually into each small tank every 30 seconds or so. ... ? This is terribly annoying...\n\nI wish those ships were redesigned, not for 1.0, but maybe the next update or so, because it will only confuse the new players. And it\u0027s not a hard thing to fix ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
