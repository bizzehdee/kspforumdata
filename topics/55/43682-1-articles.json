Currently the IVA dashboard dials can be too small to make out in detail (I have a 1280 x 720 resolution for the screen on my Envy 6) it would be nice to be able to zoom in by double clicking like you can on the window in the Mk. 1 capsule. Furthermore, ultimately it would be nice to be able to get, either as upgrades or as new command modules and cockpits, or both, a control panel with glass (digital) avionics and readouts or with a Heads Up Display that would allow easier access to the information. In career mode, they could be balanced as an upgrade or module by having less weight and being better with regards to user interface with a suitable addition to the cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso some selections of remote cameras would be nice, such as some drone cams for probes and satellites with a heads up display or some other way of giving flight information so that probes and satellites would have an equivalent to the IVA view; (maybe a computer screen with this information and footage from the camera so it would seem one is sitting at desk \u0022cockpit/control panel\u0022 in the KSC?) maybe a telescopic camera for surveying terrain and landing sites from orbit with probes, satellites, and space craft, last possibly a general camera that be selected from either internal or external views for docking, looking around with turning the ship and wasting fuel, or providing a view into a ship\u0027s blind spots (especially with capsules like the mk. 1 or mk. 1-2).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T04:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you right click to zoom in and look around? Or something like that. I\u0027m pretty sure you can zoom in absurdly far, too.

Or maybe the first command pods you use have certain control panels then command pods you unlock later on have high-tech looking interiors. Would be good, methinks, if only to make it feel like your space program is actually progressing through time and technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T05:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Scott Manley said that you can see Jool from cockpit view if you know where to look.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T06:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the scroll wheel and press the middle mouse button to zoom in in IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn topic, I agree that IVA needs some work. For example, I\u0027d like to see buttons for custom action groups.

I guess I will have to start using my usb mouse more often. The rest still stands as having improved cockpits would be nice for the aesthetics of technology improving over time, but I also think having digital readouts would be better than reading analog dials and gauges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
