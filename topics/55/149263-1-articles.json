That is, bases that can be the start or end-point of a journey, where ships can be designed, crewed and launched, possibly also recovered. Establishing and upgrading these bases would be a major objective of gameplay, a motivational boost to help people take on the interplanetary hurdle, as well as a way to expand gameplay once interplanetary flight has been mastered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore suggesting a \u0022how\u0022 of colonization, I\u0027d like to elaborate on \u0022why\u0022. While there are many legit and feasible ways to approach this issue, in order to find a viable solution the issue itself must be accurately described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, anyway. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139943-is-it-true-that-most-ksp-players-never-go-interplanetary/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EIt has been established\u003C/a\u003E that most KSP players rarely, if ever, leave Kerbin and its moons, for a myriad of reasons. I think the three main ones are the high initial difficulty treshold, the psychological factor, and convenience. Some even whisper that this was the reason why trans-Joolian planets were never implemented: so few people even go beyond Duna that the new content would only benefit a tiny fraction of players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven after you\u0027ve mastered landing on and returning from the Mun and Minmus, you have little idea of how to approach interplanetary transfers. You also need an unknown amount of fuel to go there, even more so if you plan on returning, and every attempt requires upwards of a solid hour of play time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the psychology: Kerbin is home, if you can make it back to Kerbin you\u0027re safe, but there\u0027s a large and empty solar system out there, no rescue or return, all civilization is and will remain behind you. Going to the Mun and Minmus is fine, you can look back home right over your shoulder. But when Kerbin ceases to be even a speck in the distance, you don\u0027t know how far your fuel will get you, or whether the craft design is up for the task ahead, you truly feel far from the safety and comfort of home, and wonder if you\u0027ll ever find your way back. Besides, the game feels like it\u0027s giving you things to do, contracts to fulfill, all the time. At the start of the game, you do several missions and make immense progress over the span of a day. When timewarping your way to Minmus and back, you might skip a few weeks. Very little will have elapsed in that time. Going to Duna easily requires a year just to get the planets aligned, half a year of travel time, another year on Duna while the planets align again, and another half-year to return. While you know nothing will ever have changed on Kerbin, you still feel like you\u0027re being away for too long, that your in-game time could be better spent progressing your space program further.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven when you overcome your fear and eventually master interplanetary travel, there\u0027s also the convenience factor: No matter how far you progress in the game, every flight will start off the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E launchpad and runway, fighting your way out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and gravity well. If your craft has a slight design issue that needs to be corrected, you\u0027re back to square one. For more complex journeys, you might even need to go through a multi-launch orbital assembly and fuelling process. Getting anywhere truly takes time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd what lies at the other end of this scary, time-consuming process of interplanetary travel? Basically the same as the Mun, in most cases. It\u0027s true that in KSP, the journey matters more than the destination, but the destinations still have very little going for them. Land on the flattest piece of ground you can find, let your Kerbals stretch their legs with an EVA, plant a flag, maybe climb a hill, and then leave them there or begin the return journey. You can return with your ship full of Science and your head full of that tingling sense of achievement, but in terms of gameplay, you haven\u0027t really done much. Nothing will have changed. You could get the same Science while grinding the biomes of the Mun or Minmus. The planets look different from orbit, you can take some cinematic shots of certain pretty locations or visit some anomalies, but on the ground there\u0027s precious little to do, and few reasons to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnter extraplanetary bases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your journey into the great yonder had a purpose beyond pure exploration, a reward to look forward to, and a permanent effect on gameplay, I believe more players would bother with the interplanetary trips, and do a lot more of them. It would encourage exploration of the other planets, since it would no longer require hours of preparation before your \u0022fun craft\u0022 could make it to the \u0022fun place\u0022. Late-game would have more diversity, since not every craft would need to be hauled out of Kerbin\u0027s gravity well. Why not launch from Minmus, where gravity is lower and air resistance non-existent? Establish a Dres base for your missions to Jool. Build a base on Moho, to make use of its short year and subsequently many launch windows. This could also be used for some fun one-way freight contracts: Move rocks from your Moho base to the one on Tylo. Tourists from the Mun to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe old-fashioned explorer could keep using Kerbin as a base for all operations. At the onset of the game, you would only start from Kerbin anyway, but later expand out to bless the whole solar system with Kerbalkind. The long-term purpose of your space program would be to establish Kerbals as a multi-planetary species, if only by way of small bases on the surface of various planets and moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a small bonus: learning to fly between bases on the Mun and Minmus would provide some practise for flying between planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow onto the \u0022how\u0022: I think this post would be too wishlist-y if I just went too deep into details, so I\u0027ll try to be brief:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027m torn on whether \u0022permanent settlement \u00E0 la \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in predetermined locations\u0022 or \u0022hand-built bases \u00E0 la space stations anywhere you wish\u0022 would be the best approach to colonization. The latter approach is much more hands-on and the smallest deviation from the current system, but the management of crew, contracts and vehicle design would be problematic.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuilding a gigantic rocket \u00E0 la Saturn V shouldn\u0027t be as cheap and easy (or even doable?) on off-planet bases as it is on Kerbin - at least not initially. There should be a trade-off between convenience and price, so as not to make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E completely obsolete.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEstablishing a base should be a more complex matter than landing one craft the first time you visit a planet. Some data should at least be brought back to Kerbin (or other bases?) from the site before a base could be built. On the other hand, forcing the player to wait out several conventional missions before being able to establish a permanent base might feel too restrictive.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEvery base should have a convenient and easy way to access the Tracking Station, Mission Control, R\u0026amp;D, Administrations and possibly the Astronaut Complex. In most cases, these buildings would perfectly mirror the ones on Kerbin in functionality, if not in visuals.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUpgrading bases to allow construction of larger ships, cheaper fuel, better landing zones(?)/increasing the \u0022recover vessel\u0022 radius(???) etc., should be possible. Upgrades would either be Funds-based like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or done by hauling more/better modules from Kerbin to the relevant base.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I guess a little disclaimer is in its place: I know that the game currently only allows for one Space Center, and that recovery of vessels is only possible on Kerbin. I think Kerbal Constructs gets around this by some loophole, and that making a \u0022proper\u0022 second \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E would be much more difficult - even for the developers - as things currently stand. I\u0027m also aware of Extraplanetary Launchpads, which, even though it is a long step in the right direction, doesn\u0027t quite provide what I\u0027m looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also aware that this would be a fundamental and very complex addition to the game. It would have an impact on most people\u0027s play style, so its implementation ought to be the subject of a lot of debate.This thread is not meant to be a wishlist, but also to hear what other people think. Am I overlooking some important points? Does it clash with the intended gameplay of KSP? Are there any additions or alternatives that should be considered? Is this a wild pipe dream nobody asked for? I\u0027l really like to hear other people\u0027s viewpoints on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hms_warrior","CreatedById":142205,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-04T14:48:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea...here is how i would do it (just my personal idea, opinion.

The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027m not sure which way would be the best approach to off-Kerbin bases. I initially believed that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-like \u0022structure cities\u0022 would be the best, but later I realized that putting together your own base from modules may be the most faithful and \u0022KSP-like\u0022 way to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, before that realization, I thought I had figured out a pretty good way to construct a \u0022quest\u0022 for building your own base. It is rather similar to what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142205-hms_warrior/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022142205\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/142205-hms_warrior/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@hms_warrior\u003C/a\u003E wrote above, but I might as well write it down here anyway:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst step (contract, or achievement, in case a contract isn\u0027t accepted): Explore (body), a contract already implemented in the game. Know what, to avoid writing (body) all the time, I\u0027m just going to use the Mun for the remainder of the example. So your first task would be to flyby and land on the Mun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecond step: After data is initially retreived from the Mun, and the M700 Survey Scanner is unlocked, you can be tasked to scan the Mun for possible sites for a new base. You put a scanner in a polar orbit, and watch as markers appear on your map, similar to those \u0022Temperature scan at site ABC\u0022 contract markers that already exist. The markers would denote locations where game devs/mod devs have already prepared the ground for a base. For technical reasons, I believe it would be simpler to keep the bases in pre-determined locations than allowing players to choose wildly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThird step: Go to any one of the potential sites and place a beacon (functionally identical to a flag, but only one is available at all times - it will despawn from every Kerbal\u0027s inventory once one is placed). The site will be marked with a marker on the map, as well as the yellow \u0022You are now entering/leaving area ____\u0022 message known from area-specific contracts. You will also be tasked to retrieve surface samples from the site.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFourth step: Once the beacon is placed, a new part appears in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is a large, heavy container simply marked \u0022base supplies\u0022. It is \u0022greyed out\u0022 similar to parts from part test contracts, meaning you won\u0027t be able to create it unless a beacon is placed on a site. Bring it to the chosen site in any way you wish. I\u0027d imagine it to be at least as big and heavy as a full 2.5 m Orange Tank, and cost a whole lot of Funds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFifth step: Once the base supplies container is safely placed in your chosen site, a button appears where the \u0022recover vessel\u0022 button is on Kerbin. It says something like \u0022Build base\u0022. Press it, and your vessel is despawned. A rudimentary base, like the Tier 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, appears in its place. The cost of any remaining parts of your craft is refunded, possibly with interest, and eventual pilots would be placed in that base\u0027s Astronaut Complex.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis approach would require players to first visit the planets conventionally, and return data to Kerbin before a base can even begin to be built. It\u0027s not completely waterproof, but it would expand on the existing exploration/travel mechanics rather than replacing them. Bases aim to provide incentives and convenience for revisiting planets, but the first trip needs to be done conventionally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for upgrading the base, I\u0027m not sure if it should be done by hauling further supplies to it, or if it could be done with Funds like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The problem with the former approach is that the base itself would have the capability of spawning parts, meaning that a base would be able to expand itself. This isn\u0027t a problem, strictly speaking, since extraplanetary bases should always aim for self-sufficiency, but it would feel a little weird in terms of gameplay. If so, it would feel a lot more convenient to do it through the ol\u0027 \u0022Funds sink\u0022 method, charging an eye and a limb for upgrades. You have no problem with money late-game in KSP anyway, so one might as well add some really expensive investments. Think upgrading your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to Tier 3 is expensive? A similar upgrade on Vall or Eeloo would easily cost ten times as much. Even a late-game player wouldn\u0027t be able to fly around making bases willy-nilly. An alternative would be to require that all base supplies containers are made on and shipped from Kerbin, in which case you would be unable to use your existing bases as \u0022stepping stones\u0022 to make bases on far-off planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn aspect I\u0027m still uncertain of: How would you initiate the process of building a base? Would it be through a contract? Should beacons and base supplies containers always be available, so you\u0027d be free to fill out every spot for a base whenever you want (and have the cash)? Should there be a button in the Administrations Building, where you have to declare/submit an application that you\u0027re building a new extraplanetary base?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the record, I\u0027d also like for there to be other potential base sites on Kerbin itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, and for it to be realistic, the feature would have to require as little re-coding of the game as possible. It should play well with existing features, and ideally not require new ones to be made. Okay, the ability to insert more space centers would be a pretty drastic modification, but I\u0027d rather not be reliant on secondary new features and modifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny thoughts on these mad rambles?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DragonsForce","CreatedById":160064,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T14:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like this idea. My initial thought was to use two new resources, \u0022Citizens\u0022 and \u0022Materials\u0022, to construct bases (spawning pregenerated structures). City-type bases would spawn more \u0022Citizens\u0022 which could either be used for further bases / baseupgrades or be recruited as Kerbonauts, Station-type bases would essencially provide the benefits of an of-Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Both structures would be upgradable. \u0022Citizens\u0022 could only be aquired at Kerbin or City-bases, whilst \u0022Materials\u0022 could be refined from ore or bought on Kerbin or at bases. Building vessels of-Kerbin would require \u0022Materials\u0022, Kerbonauts would have to be hired there (from \u0022Citizens\u0022) or be transported there from other bases or Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I now think that both methodes previousley proposed would better fit the stock game and be easier to implement, without having any big downsides as compared to my idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would most certainly be a lot of developement work and would change gameplay at a level comparable to the introductions of science- and careermode. But in my eyes, it would also add A LOT to the game, and I\u0027d definetley pay for it if necessary \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
