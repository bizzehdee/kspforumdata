Some mods have no useful in-game GUI other than a settings menu such as DRE and Distance Object Enhancement, so currently I find it a waste of screen real estate for these mods to have a toolbar icon. The toolbar should then only be used to toggle some GUI that is useful during play (like FAR\u0027s in-flight data) or that provides some kind of live feedback (like Science Alert\u0027s icon).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
