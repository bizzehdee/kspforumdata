A small number of primary resources (just one in kethane ofc), and a one-step conversion from resource(s) to product. It\u0027s still not trivial - there\u0027s work involved in making a good kethane miner - but the simplicity keeps it in the realm of being a way to support your missions, and not a string of interplanetary fetch quests that dominates your projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKethane also encourages the player to do some things they otherwise might not do, which I think is a good thing for any ISRU system to do.

Then once you\u0027ve found a deposit you need to land on it, you can\u0027t just set down anywhere. (Biome science also enocurages the player to do both of these).

It\u0027s not a horrendous map of chemical reactions requiring degrees in organic and inorganic chemistry, but there\u0027s more than one type of thing you can do. Alumina plus water electrolysis for hybrid engines. Basically you can drop yourself down anywhere on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, which is all alumina with a small water concentration, fire up the ISRU, and fuel up. Thorium/uranium mining for the beamed-power reactors. Nuclear reprocessing for making the nuclear fuel last longer.
