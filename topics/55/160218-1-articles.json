This is exacerbated by the fact that the tree is so absurd that things we might want, the rightly happen alongside the very first nodes we cannot use without unlocking much later...

Certainly that should be a goal in every game, keeping the player interested and providing things to do, but in KSP it can, and often does, result in a lot of grind and uninteresting missions. At some point you will end up flying missions for no reason other than to make cash, or get some science, or whatever, purely to make another, more interesting\u00A0mission possible.
