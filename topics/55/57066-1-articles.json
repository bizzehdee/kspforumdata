It\u0027s just a different game mode that actually happens to be harder but also offers a different gaming experience as in, you can\u0027t just build something that has an engine under it and throw it at the Mun. There\u0027s actually some planning involved which may or may not include making Deltavee calculations or testing each feature of your craft before sending it to Jool. It\u0027s just a different game experience and from what I\u0027m feeling there are some people trying to play that way right now (just watch Scott Manley\u0027s interstellar series).

I have no idea why there is so much hostility to these suggestions every time they are made. You can make that argument all you want, but there is one little thing that you don\u0027t understand, and that Dombi has already pointed out, that invalidates that argument. \u003Cem\u003ESaying\u003C/em\u003E that you are going to do something is one thing, but actually following through and \u003Cem\u003Edoing\u003C/em\u003E it is a completely different monster. There \u003Cem\u003EWILL\u003C/em\u003E be moments where you will break your rule, because of a botched maneuver or screwing up the time acceleration, or whatever. I, myself, have tried on numerous occasions to follow a set of rules, but, in the end, I always break them. However, by making these rules hard-coded into the game, that temptation is totally removed. It becomes easier to actually play the game, because you don\u0027t have to fight the urge to break your rules. The game becomes fun again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that I would like to point out is that actually HAVING these difficulty settings would actually have some other benefits as well. It could encourage players who normally wouldn\u0027t have thought to try to play in a different way. Because, now that it is there, the idea is there. It opens up a possibility that they would have NEVER come across otherwise. If you want an example of this happening, just look at the introduction to Hardcore mode to Minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, TL;DR Adding this as a game mechanic has more benefits than you think it does.
