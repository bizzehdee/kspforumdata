The colour palette and designs are consistent, and it gives a very professional NASA-esc vibe. Now, if you like the new revamped rocket parts, that\u0027s perfectly fine, but I feel the style of these modern revamped parts\u00A0don\u0027t\u00A0fit well with KSP (I mean, KSP is SQUAD\u0027s IP, they can do what they want with the art-style, but to me the new style doesn\u0027t feel right).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, maybe this is just me, but I cannot envision the Kerbal-race designing something professional or sleek like the Saturn V. They\u0027re very clumsy/primitive (if the game\u0027s trailers/writing is anything to go by), so - to me - slapping something together using scrap seems like the sort of thing they\u0027d do. As a result, it feels weird to me that SQUAD would switch to a more realistic/sleek new style (although A. that\u0027s just my thoughts, and B. for all we know SQUAD might be moving KSP towards a more serious/realistic tone).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis brings me to my suggestion:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIn the future (perhaps after a few bug-fix updates/patches, *cough cough*), I think there should be a new skin group for most rocket parts emulating the game\u0027s original inconsistent junk-like style. I\u0027m a bit iffy about whether to say that a \u0022junk\u0022 rocket part skin should used by default in Sandbox/Science, but players can still switch to the three newer skins if they prefer them.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHeck, there could be a game mechanic included in Career mode (preferably one you can enable/disable in the game\u0027s options) where all rocket parts use the Junk skin by default and you can pay Funds to upgrade parts to use the more professional/sleek skins. That way, you start off career mode with rockets that look like they were assembled from random scrap, then progressing to shinier modern-looking rockets.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EObviously, it\u0027s a bit early to be discussing this, since not all of KSP\u0027s\u00A0rocket parts have been revamped to the new style, but I\u0027m thinking this suggestion could be implemented after the release of 1.6, or further into the future. Just at a point where more than half of the game\u0027s rocket parts (at least, the ones that need to be redesigned) are revamped.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...am I just complaining about something that doesn\u0027t matter?
