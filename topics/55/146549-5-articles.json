Take a common occurrence in stock KSP. You strand a kerbal. So you build a slightly more capable craft to go fetch him. This is a pretty trivial exercise. When you have to get to him with a clock ticking down, it\u0027s much more interesting (throw in KCT, and it can become positively nail-biting). A stranded Duna mission could easily result in the player having to make \u0022the Martian\u0022 type choices regarding rescue ops... They might lack the parts to make anything substantially better than what stranded the crew, so they elect to send a LS resupply while they work on unlocking whatever part it is that will make a proper rescue possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave to agree, count me in the \u0022life support makes for more interesting gameplay\u0022 camp.

Heck, I\u0027d argue that in stock the problem with adding LS is that it\u0027s not hard enough, not that it\u0027s too hard. I play with LS and at 6.4X usually, and then it becomes more of a challenge.

First, time needs to be made a proper resource (because it sure as hell will be with LS), and the game balanced around that. We need the absurd building-upgrade and kerbal-hiring costs reduced to something manageable, with a monthly cost based on building state and number of kerbonauts added to the pie. This gives us a framework to add in time-based mechanics like construction time, long-duration experiments, and, yes, life support. Right now the kerbonaut-replacement cost is too high a burden. This also allows the main difference between difficulty levels to be life-support and communication limits rather than upgrade costs, making harder actually \u003Ci\u003Eharder\u003C/i\u003E, instead of more grindy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, it needs to be simple, like Snacks!
