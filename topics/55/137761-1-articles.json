Not all of us are capable of modding the game. Maybe it\u0027s a time issue. Maybe it\u0027s a competence issue. Maybe we\u0027re just lazy. Maybe it\u0027s all 3.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the bigger point here isn\u0027t about allowing player to mod the game, in game. It\u0027s about finding another use for a resource after the player has completely unlocked the tech tree and has nothing else relevant to do with their science besides watch it accumulate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T19:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurprisingly \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u00A0this has come up before.
