It would be nice to have an option to start the game in a way where the missions and tech tree is reworked in a way that you start off with probes before putting Kerbals into rockets. I know there are mods and everything but would be nice to see in stock game as a more \u0022realistic\u0022 start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd again i know there are mods out there for these things but they are getting outdated and some are being left behind. Making the plumes act as they do in real life or like in the mod RealPlumes where the gasses expand the higher you get into the atmosphere making it look more realistic and pleasing/rewarding as you get higher and higher into space. A visual indicator that you are getting higher and higher into the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
