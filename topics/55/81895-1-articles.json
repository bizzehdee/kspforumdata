Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace station - Interplanetary tug - Command Module (a smaller ship) - Lander - Rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet start our space travel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each time when two module got separated one of the module get a stupid name, renaming, but after a docking one of them lost its name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each time using an action group activated, the \u0022dormant\u0022 modules also get it - I mean: pushing a button for turn off one of the engine of the Tug and the Lander opens its solar panels. Solution: share the action groups among the modules - yes, we can use 2 a.g./module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is \u0022Hierarchic order of command pods\u0022 would do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach \u0022module\u0022 has a command pod of its own. In the VAB I give an hierarchic number to each command pod (0-9), name, type, and separated set of action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If there is more command pod in a module, for example a capsule and a remote guidance unit - they can be equals it means they work as one and same unit, or in hierarchy: master-slave, or alternative (can change the master slave relation): for example an orbital builder has two modules. one of them has the actions of the normal ship, another controls the robotic arm. Changing the status of the command pods also possible with action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hierarchic order of the previous station-ship looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(0) A - \u0022Station\u0022 - Space Station: PPD-12 Cupola Module = RC-L01\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) D - \u0022Interplanetary Tug\u0022 - Ship: RC L01\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) D - \u0022Command Module\u0022 - Ship: Mk1-2 Command pod = RC-001S\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6) D - \u0022Lander\u0022 - Lander: Mk2 Lander Can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(9) D - \u0022Rover\u0022 - Rover: EAS-1 External Command Seat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the beginning of our travel I retract the solar panel of the station - I can use 0-9 to command my active station, because the docked ship is dormant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActivating the interplanetary tug, and docking off the station - Now my remaining ship\u0027s name and type has the highest command module\u0027s data in the hierarchy: \u0022Interplanetary Tug\u0022 - Ship !

What would need to happen is that each piece would have to know which module owned it. When setting up the commands, the player would have to select the piece (as they do now) and the command module, and then set up t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the easiest way to do this would be to have a list of available command modules in the Action Groups Menu. If there\u0027s only one command module, the list of command modules could be hidden, the Action Groups Menu looks the way it does now to reduce clutter and confusion for new players who are just figuring out the action group menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s more then one command module, a 4th column could appear to the left of the Action Groups column with a list of the available command modules, listed in the order they were added to the vehicle, and then the player can select which command module they want, then the action group they want, then the piece they want, and then the commands they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make the list easier to understand, and to deal with the naming issues, the player could name each command module and the list could display the names in the list. Also, the vehicle could be named whichever name the command module in charge has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=-=-=-=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as how hard it is to program, well I don\u0027t know anything about Squad\u0027s code at all. So, I CAN\u0027T REALLY speak to its difficulty or anything... but, as I\u0027ve used Unity on a daily basis I know I could program it in a game similar to Kerbal Space Program. - I know the engine can handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- But knowing the engine can handle it doesn\u0027t mean that it wouldn\u0027t require a lot of rewriting or something on Squad\u0027s part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- So, in other words, it could be a feature they could add with some solid planning and a day of programming, or a feature that would require a complete rewriting and add a year or more to the project. ... My experience in game programming makes the think its somewhere in the middle, but hey, again; I haven\u0027t seen their code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=-=-=-=-=\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t personally experienced the issues that the original poster has expressed, but I can see how they\u0027re a hassle.

Choosing the actual command module in Action Groups menu is a good example of constructive and cooperative replying. I\u0027ve also some more idea, like the command pods can have a description text too over the name, type and set of action groups, and those could be read and edited by a LMC on the command pod. As the topic became more mature, I\u0027ll extend the opening post. (GUI plan, block diagrams, etc...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
