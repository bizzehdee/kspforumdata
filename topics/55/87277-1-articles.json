From there you can select to save it for later use again or scrap it for funds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have say a shuttle or a sophisticated lander that gets into space by being attached to rockets, once you land it back to Kerbin there is no way to get it back into space again. Your only option is to scrap it (automatic when you recover it). With the ability to reuse it, you can recover the craft, go to one of the design bays, select the craft and just add more rockets to it for relaunch. You would also require fund to re-fuel the craft and repair any damage before relaunching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this idea there is also the possibility of giving the craft a service history. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is the option to \u0027retire\u0027 the craft which will place it in a Museum yard (A new part of the Space Center) along with the option to add a plaque with text. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will give the game more depth, realism and make losing a craft more heartbreaking to the player, especially if it has been in service for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T11:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you kept the craft file, how is this different from what we already have?

Look at it this way, you design a ship (Lets say a shuttle) and save it. Now you make and launch a total of 5 shuttles and you decide to give them the names of real shuttles like Atlantis, Challenger, Discovery and so on. When you land one of the craft back on Kerbin, it would make more sense to reuse it, rather than scrap it, load up another one, and name it Atlantis again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd like I said several times already - it will give the game more depth as craft develop histories and players grow attached to the craft that have seen a lot of service. They might be just a collection of pixels on a computer screen, but people will grow fond of their craft, the same way Warcraft players grow attached to their characters and so on. Having a craft that has seen a lot of service will be more devastating to the player over a craft that is just going to be scraped at the end of its mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T06:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI kinda like the idea behind that although it doesn\u0027t require an entire new mechanic to do that. The current system works (I am not saying it\u0027s balanced!). A simple button in the VAB to determine it as a reusable craft would be enough to me. It could let you name the specific ship, keep track of it\u0027s acomplishments and so on. You have to select lets say at least 5 non-physics-less parts of the ship that you are not allowed to change and get an additional small bonus on reputation for each successful mission that increases with the number of missions. The recovery balance is already unbalanced, I don\u0027t want it to be worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImo the thing ksp lacks right now is that I don\u0027t rly identify with my missions. I always have the same 3guys I killed like a million times before. I already do something like commitment to a certain design that doesn\u0027t change all that much over time, but I would like that to be more than just a roleplay aspect\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
