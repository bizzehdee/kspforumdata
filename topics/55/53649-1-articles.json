I\u0027m against the idea of arbitrary restrictions, like only being allowed to launch specific missions, or choose from specific missions, in some specific order. That\u0027s an example of an arbitrary limitation. Giving the player the freedom to choose is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut right now that comes with a bit of a problem: The only real objective is to \u0022go somewhere\u0022. There are lots of different somewheres to go, but that\u0027s really just the same objective with different delta-v requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I was thinking about the kinds of objectives that would progress naturally in career mode.

I\u0027d like to see what kinds of things other people think would fit this model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be perfectly clear: I am *not* suggesting that players should be required to do this missions in the order I have described using some kind of arbitrary mission list. If a player wants their first mission to be an Eeloo landing and return, they should be free to do that. Rather, I\u0027m suggesting that these kind of objectives progress naturally as a result of normal gameplay mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESet up communications satellites\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the new challenge?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunications satellites imply the need for line of sight for transmission, which I know is something Squad is already looking at. Setting up a good array of satellites means figuring out a good geometric arrangement to provide a line of sight from ships to satellites to KSC no matter where those ships might be. For example, three equatorial geostationary satellites around Kerbin is an excellent start. Three satellites in solar orbit at Kerbin\u0027s altitude is another good way to go after that. This represents a different kind of challenge, because you have to \u003Cem\u003Efigure out a good geometric arrangement for multiple ships\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow does it fit naturally into career mode?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s pretty obvious for this one. It would mean that before launching your interplanetary missions (which naturally come after simply getting into Kerbin orbit or a Mun landing) you would want to have your satellite network set up so you can \u003Cem\u003Etransmit your science more effectively\u003C/em\u003E. Launching satellites is relatively easy... they\u0027re light, and the first few don\u0027t have to go very far, so this naturally sits fairly early in your career path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat new gameplay mechanic would we need for this to be a real objective?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETranmissions would have to require line of sight to KSC, either directly or by relaying through other satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMapping/scanning missions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the new challenge?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMapping and scanning missions require you to think about your orbit around the target body. Unlike most other kinds of missions, you don\u0027t want to be equatorial, you want to be more polar. The new challenge is \u003Cem\u003Efiguring out how to effectively (and efficiently!) put something into non-equatorial orbit\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow does it fit naturally into career mode?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt introduces some basic information about how plane changes work, and allows players to discover how they can more easily perform those changes by tweaking their encounter angles before getting into orbit around the target. And mapping satellites can serve several useful purposes, not least of which could be \u003Cem\u003Efinding flat terrain\u003C/em\u003E to use when you send your landers. So mapping satellites, again, come naturally before sending out your manned landers or bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat new gameplay mechanic would we need for this to be a real objective?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to scan for flat terrain (or anything else worth scanning for, like resources) and have the game be able to show you when it finds some and remember it through your persistence file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital space stations\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat is the new challenge?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace stations require either docking finesse, or the ability to launch large payloads, or both. So the challenge is to do with \u003Cem\u003Eintermediate to advanced ship construction techniques and orbital rendezvous\u003C/em\u003E. If any kind of life support mechanic is ever added, it also introduces the challenge of \u003Cem\u003Emaintenance and resupply\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow does it fit naturally into career mode?\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I think of the late stages of my career I imagine having space stations everywhere with big science labs, perhaps spare fuel for interplanetary travellers, and so on. The difficulty of this kind of objective means it sits naturally in a career that has progressed well into the interplanetary stages. Think of it as a \u003Cem\u003Elate game objective\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat new gameplay mechanic would we need for this to be a real objective?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing much, just some big heavy parts that would be useful, in any way, on an orbital space station. The new science lab coming in 0.23 is an example of such a part. Space stations would also become part of your communcations network. For the full experience we would need some kind of life support and resupply mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPermanent or Long Term Bases on Other Planets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be pretty much the same as the space station objective so I won\u0027t write all that out again. The difference is that it is harder, since you don\u0027t just have to get your big stuff there, you have to land it too! So the new challenge is a serious increase in difficulty, and the natural fit in career mode is very late in a career. The required gameplay mechanic is, again, largely the same: Some big heavy parts that make sense, and are useful, as part of a permanent outpost.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-19T12:48:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2013 12:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turvok","CreatedById":60891,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T18:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like that you\u0027re having this discussion.

I prefer to see \u0022organic\u0022 objectives alongside missions so that those of us who have a clear idea of what we want to do within the game have the freedom do do so and also will get rewarded (and advance) within the career. The science system, with a few minor tweaks that SQUAD is already writing, does this; it provides a limitation and challenge but it doesn\u0027t prevent you from doing anything specifically. I hope to see the same thing come out of monetary and mission systems, limitation and challenge without arbitrary restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason a mission system cannot coexist aside a system of nebulous objectives, where a player can pick and choose how they want to go about approaching their career, where the experience can be as structured (specific guiding missions) or as adaptive (providing opportunities based on player actions) as needed for the player. In fact, a player who is setting their own goals and objectives could want to \u0022do a mission\u0022 every so often to find new direction, and a player who is strictly \u0022doing missions\u0022 might want to just land on the Mun one night for fun.

No need for story missions or restrictive objectives, just that if you want to send kerbals to Duna, you might want to spend some time around Kerbin doing things to increase your tech and/or available budget.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Queeg","CreatedById":92659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T02:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat you seem to be talking about here is a few structured, guided objectives up front for newer players. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I\u0027m thinking about a lot more than a few and not just front loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think of it, the more I think Theme Hospital would make a good game to compare what I hope career mode might be.
