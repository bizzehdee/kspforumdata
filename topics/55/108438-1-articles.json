Overheating for the big burns wasn\u0027t a major issue as long as you attach the LV-Ns to something like quad-couplers and then directly to the fuel tanks. You can get away with 7/8ths throttle for almost unlimited time I believe, (well until your fuel runs out). That was using Mk3 liquid fuel tanks. It does limit your options a bit as placing LV-Ns on things like modular girder segments is a big no-no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDraining oxidiser from normal tanks isn\u0027t great because the ratio of liquid fuel to the weight of the tank hits your efficiency by a significant amount imo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sonny_Jim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sonny_Jim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShouldn\u0027t the title be \u0022un-nerfed\u0022 rather than \u0022re-nerfed\u0022, which would imply that they need nerfing more?\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I like the way the other engines are slightly more important rather than \u0022Leaving Kerbin system?
