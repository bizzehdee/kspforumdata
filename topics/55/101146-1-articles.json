Science point and money can be used for research single part, and with a good money reward for collected science points the player is encouraged on planet biome exploration.\n\nOther point is the space stations and ground station, after research the biome or situation they become totally useless, that can be improved by adding a new science lab that give timed money and science rewards, on that way is encouraged build biome stations for improve economic situation.\n\nThat is only my idea and probably some others have better, for that i like have a discussion about this because to me the game lacks of a bit of arcade. \n\nSorry for my bad english Regards Luca"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T11:20:27Z","Content":"Time based money and/or science need many other time based mechanics to work.\n\nOtherwise you can just leave the computerr running with max timewarp.\n\nEven if you make it so that timewarp doesn\u0027t affect it you can still leave it running.\n\n(and it also is a bit weird and immersion breaking.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Badsector","CreatedById":118465,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T11:42:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Time based money and/or science need many other time based mechanics to work.\n\u003E Otherwise you can just leave the computerr running with max timewarp.\n\nIf i\u0027m not wrong by now you have only 200 years of game, and first you have to research that science lab, the reward can be after every year in space and related to science multiplier in a way that encourage colonizing all the biome but don\u0027t broke the gameplay"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:24:47Z","Content":"Time based funds/science would work fine.

I prefered it back when the main reason to go to planets was for the achievement and experience, not to gather more points to remove inconveniences. I think to make career mode fun, it needs a new feature or two to enhance the experience of visiting other planets, and offer something beyond what\u0027s in sandbox, not just be a set of hoops you have to jump through before you get sandbox level capabilities. \n\nI also would be a fan of something to make time a resource, such as a very simple life support requirement, \n\n[![5RViAPNm.png](http://i.imgur.com/5RViAPNm.png)](http://imgur.com/5RViAPN)\n\nI also think contracts and experiments that take time should be a thing. You could have research contracts: these would require you to have at least a certain number of kerbals and parts on a base or station, and you must make the base/station is kept supplied with certain things. The contract might pay up over time, or at the end of a certain period of time."},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:35:45Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t mind a set story but any set story loses its impact after you\u0027ve played through it a couple of times.
