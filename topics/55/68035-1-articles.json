off let me introduce myself, i am hawk_za and have been around since version .17 as i find forums general are way ahead of anything useful i have to say and so make a point of not posting on them unnecessarily BUT in this case i have to make an exception.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to suggest earnestly that the developers seriously consider integrating the mapsat mod from damny into the ksp stock version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55832-PLUGIN-PARTS-WIP-SCANsat-terrain-mapping\u0022

rather sacrifice machinery instead of kerbals and also adds more purpose to the in game satellites. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It adds game play hours by introducing an intermediate step from getting things into orbit and then landing on a foreign body to get into orbit map it and the land on the damny thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebad puns not withstanding:sticktongue:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) As it is currently stands as of date of this post the science reward is very well balance by rewarding you for mapping harder objects and also teaches you about planet axial rotation ....OR the lack there of \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso a better scanner at a later stage if you want color hi resolution maps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) the ability to export to png allows a user to print a map and makes planing tor landings a HELL of a lot easier to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Not to mention the feeling for accomplishment when mapping a planet successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt its heart this mod symbolizes ksp mentality more than any other mod i have found to date as it is by no means over powered and dose not defeat the purpose of the game but enhances the very aspect of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei understand there are licensing issues with regards to this but I\u0027m sure a company like squad can overcome any such minor issues as this is one of the very few development teams i have noticed that actually cares about their product and reputation with its user base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason i suggest this plug inn over any other is its ability to be used in time warp although i must say kerbal engineer redux is also high on the list as it make the game far more newbie friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei hope this post will be read by ksp Dev team and thought given to the points i have tried to raise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyours in service

creating redundant posts but this is something i truly believe in and feel passionately about if i could code id try code a new one and give it to the devs free but ..alas i cant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso would be awesome to see map integration into the tracking station but i will gladly settle for integration as it stands at the moment the great thing about it is there is very little work for the devs to do and adds so much it helps counter the development asymptotes spoken about in harvesters blog here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca
