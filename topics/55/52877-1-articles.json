Thank you Scott - though next time you use phrases like simple orbital mechanics, I\u0027d like to remind you that for the rest of us \u0022simple\u0022 and \u0022orbital mechanics\u0022 don\u0027t belong in the same sentence.\u003Cp\u003ESo you can gauge my level of knowledge, I\u0027ll mention that so far I\u0027ve managed to orbit both the Mun and Minmus, but not land. I struggle to land back on Kerbin anywhere except extremely flat areas but after a bit of trial and error I am at least able to return back to Kerbin after reaching either of the moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been mostly playing the Career mode so far. Primarily because the number of parts for Sandbox mode is just completely overwhelming for me right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing it\u0027s been a very long time since any of you first played KSP and therefore there is SO much you guys take for granted. Certainly from reading the forums so far, the majority of suggestions and such are pretty advanced stuff from my point of view\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I figured I\u0027d post my feedback so far, before I forget some of the stuff I struggled with here at the beginning. (or at least, seemed out of place).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELauncher\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bought the game from the KSP store and have no intention of using Steam to play. So I\u0027m using the KSP Launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERight now, when the launcher starts the game, it doesn\u0027t set the game to be the active focus application. So when I hit [PLAY], the main KSP.exe starts, the launcher closes and the game does all it\u0027s usual \u0022loading...\u0022 parts thing. BUT when everything is finally loaded and I click the \u0022Start Game\u0022 option, it instead clicks through to my desktop and effectively alt-tab\u0027s out because whilst I can only see KSP on the screen, KSP isn\u0027t the current active application. I run the game in full screen mode. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E(btw, as someone with two monitors, a \u0022Full Screen Windowed\u0022 mode would be really nice).\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cem\u003EEdit: already in the advanced options menu of the launcher.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUI\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENavigating between buildings/menus seems to me to be inconsistent. Sometimes you need to press [Esc] to select from a set of menus, sometimes you don\u0027t. Sometimes where are (menu/zone) navigation buttons to move between areas, mostly not. I can\u0027t help but feel that a lot of the navigation within game could benefit from someone rethinking it from the ground up and adding a core set of navigation buttons to all areas of the game, with some additional situational buttons that are available depending on where the player is.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u0022Recover Vehicle\u0022. I only found out about it by sheer accident. I don\u0027t know where else it could go, but in career mode at least it seems way too useful to be hidden away. Maybe have it automatically appear when the ship lands/crashes?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt would be incredibly useful if the size of parts were reflected in their icons. I\u0027m sure the expert players know where everything is... I\u0027m still in the \u0022pick something up, realise it\u0027s too big/small, put it back\u0022 stage. All too often I mistake Rockomax X200-16\u0027s for FL-T200\u0027s as one example that is just the tip of a huge iceberg of adaptors, tanks, decouplers and docking ports. Maybe different coloured borders around the icons. Maybe a \u0022S\u0022, \u0022M\u0022, \u0022L\u0022, \u0022XL\u0022 mini icon in the corner of the main icon. Something to make the UI parts selection a little less daunting.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhilst I\u0027m already finding swapping between parts tabs a little annoying, I think a few more categories would help people like myself. Something like separating Propulsion into Fuel Tanks/Others Tanks/Engines. Similarly simplify Structural and Utility a little.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn a similar vain, I\u0027d also really like to see two or three user custom tabs. Something I could drag parts I use regularly together according to my own whims. I think I\u0027ve seen some youtube/twitch users with custom parts tabs like this - undoubtedly added via an addon. However as a newbie player, I can already see the advantage to including that functionality into the core UI.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMap Mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIs there any chance a legend for the various line colours could be added? I\u0027m sure everyone who\u0027s played for a while understands the blue, yellow, dotted, purple, etc. lines. For me, trying to plot my first trip to the Mun, all those various orbital paths confused the living daylights out of me. Especially when even a tiny adjustment of a manoeuvre node can have such huge consequences.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs a follow up... selecting and adjusting manoeuvre nodes when zoomed out is painful. Especially if you accidental click somewhere else on the screen and \u0022lose\u0022 the node you were editing. Could a list of nodes be added to the map, as icons perhaps along the bottom of the screen? Such that we can just click on \u0022node#1\u0022 to pick it up again (or center the screen on it or something). Maybe add a hotkey to tab forward and backwards between nodes even if no node is currently being edited? So that when you\u0027re zoomed out to plot a path to Eve, you can reselect that node you were trying to create?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECareer Mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, sorry. This is where I\u0027ve spend most of my time, so it\u0027s where my imagination has been most active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPacket Sizes, ever changing rewards, etc. have been confusing as hell. Maybe they\u0027re supposed to be. But currently I\u0027m trying to do each \u0022investigation \u0026amp; recovery\u0022 twice to maximise career points, before the diminishing returns make doing them again seem like a waste of fuel. I can see there\u0027s an element of \u0022there\u0027s still more to learn\u0022 - but surely this sort of repetition shouldn\u0027t be an active game-play solution?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETransmission penalties don\u0027t help either. Again, maybe that\u0027s the point. But 40% of a full report than won\u0027t be the same value the next time I repeat the experiment and so will yield even lower results just feels like punitive. Maybe limit it purely by electrical power instead? Especially since solar panels are so deep within the trees\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI was wondering if perhaps all experiments could be stored in a capsule computer rather than within each component? Maybe computer memory size could also be upgraded later? It might also simplify the \u0022transmit\u0022 mechanics that seem to be a bit all over the place, being both on the experiments and antenna separately .\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIt would be nice to see what career trees are further ahead. Right now, it\u0027s difficult to plan what to spend career points on without playing through once, then restarting to spend \u0022better\u0022 the second time around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn my opinion, progress needs more limits and structure, a little more of the single player \u0022theme park\u0022. And yes, I realise everyone who\u0027s been playing the sandbox mode forever is going to hate that idea. But right now, it feels like Career Mode lacks direction and goals... beyond unlocking parts. Even then, the ability to just head out to orbit Minmus for a (relative) huge number of points seems to offer too high a reward. Equally, performing experiments within the various biomes on Kerbin seems overly repetitive given the very low rewards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn a similar vain, perhaps unlocks should be \u0022gated\u0022 by more than just career points. Perhaps a certain number of experiments on Kerbin would need to be completed before scientists suggest maybe we should be performing those same experiments in space? Equally perhaps we shouldn\u0027t be able to skip the Mun and Minmus before heading out to conduct experience further out? etc, etc, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think it might also be helpful if there were some sort of \u0022experiment handbook\u0022 or something. A log of past experiments and a \u0022progress bar\u0022 of career points for each element. Right now, I\u0027ve no idea if I remembered to do an EVA while in low orbit around Mun. Did I visit the highlands on Kerbin? Would going back there and repeating the experiment be worth while? I just got a brand new \u00222hot\u0022 thermometer, is there anywhere I should taking it, perhaps somewhere I\u0027ve already been with other experiments? Whatever form it takes, I guess I\u0027m suggesting what in effect will be a quest log.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETalking of EVA... It would have been handy to know EVAs and taking samples were even possible. My first few play attempts made use of the equipment experiments only. Only watching someone else on Twitch.TV opened my eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u0027m not entirely sure that unlocking parts is right way to progress. Career mode (so far) feels fairly flat. I don\u0027t know how to express it better than that. I know the unlocks are supposed to limit our access to the solar system, but right now earning science seems to be an all or nothing progression, rather than a gradual and ever more difficult curve of further experiments and further exploration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs much as I hate to say it, getting access to SC-9001 Science Jr so early in the game is too powerful. It\u0027s HUGE rewards compared with other equipment like the thermometer and barometer. I can\u0027t imagine being able to earn science points quickly enough without it, but I was tempted not to even equip some of the later unlocks when I realised that they gave so little science in return.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFinally, the beginning... There\u0027s something very unrewarding about starting by putting a capsule on the launchpad at the very beginning in order to do an EVA and then immediately recover the vehicle. I think I\u0027d like to start with a few more parts and make a tiny flight to the first experiment area. i.e. take the launchpad and KSC out of the equation and offer slightly higher rewards for the coastal and grassland areas. or something. I honestly don\u0027t know, but something just feels off about \u0022not launching\u0022 in order to make progress.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure Career Mode will be excellent and I realise it\u0027s still in it\u0027s infancy. But I suspect when finished, the majority of newer players like me will need a lot more hand holding than the existing, expert, player base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully my inexperience will help remind you of just how much new players DON\u0027T know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep up the good work and THANK YOU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E02/Dec Edit: Added UI feedback for part size for icons and custom user parts tabs for frequently used parts.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E02/Dec Edit: \u0022Full screen windowed mode is apparently already there in the advanced options for the launcher\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T23:05:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Queeg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dun Kirk","CreatedById":11365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T21:50:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe game devs I guess are still in debugging mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seriously don\u0027t get the logic of not having a clickable science dude who tells you random facts like \u0022ISP = fuel efficiency\u0022 and \u0022less is more, but not when space tape is involved\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis game needs a fact sphere.... ^ ^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T22:24:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso money and part cost has not been implemented.

But currently I\u0027m trying to do each \u0022investigation \u0026amp; recovery\u0022 twice to maximise career points, before the diminishing returns make doing them again seem like a waste of fuel. I can see there\u0027s an element of \u0022there\u0027s still more to learn\u0022 - but surely this sort of repetition shouldn\u0027t be an active game-play solution?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EIt\u0027s not needed at all.

Especially since solar panels are so deep within the trees\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EThey are there for a reason. Devs want to reward you for brining the sample back safely, rather than just transmitting a picture off it. Right now you can still transmit over and over again to get the full science points.

And yes, I realise everyone who\u0027s been playing the sandbox mode forever is going to hate that idea. But right now, it feels like Career Mode lacks direction and goals... beyond unlocking parts. Even then, the ability to just head out to orbit Minmus for a (relative) huge number of points seems to offer too high a reward. Equally, performing experiments within the various biomes on Kerbin seems overly repetitive given the very low rewards.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EIt\u0027s like Simcity.

Perhaps a certain number of experiments on Kerbin would need to be completed before scientists suggest maybe we should be performing those same experiments in space? Equally perhaps we shouldn\u0027t be able to skip the Mun and Minmus before heading out to conduct experience further out? etc, etc, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EAnd why exactly would we not be allowed to skip the Mun and go straight for Eve? If you can do it, go for it\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI think it might also be helpful if there were some sort of \u0022experiment handbook\u0022 or something. A log of past experiments and a \u0022progress bar\u0022 of career points for each element. Right now, I\u0027ve no idea if I remembered to do an EVA while in low orbit around Mun. Did I visit the highlands on Kerbin? Would going back there and repeating the experiment be worth while? I just got a brand new \u00222hot\u0022 thermometer, is there anywhere I should taking it, perhaps somewhere I\u0027ve already been with other experiments? Whatever form it takes, I guess I\u0027m suggesting what in effect will be a quest log.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EComing next update\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETalking of EVA... It would have been handy to know EVAs and taking samples were even possible. My first few play attempts made use of the equipment experiments only.

I don\u0027t know how to express it better than that. I know the unlocks are supposed to limit our access to the solar system, but right now earning science seems to be an all or nothing progression, rather than a gradual and ever more difficult curve of further experiments and further exploration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027ll come eventually when we get a budget and other stuf that we don\u0027t even know about yet\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAs much as I hate to say it, getting access to SC-9001 Science Jr so early in the game is too powerful. It\u0027s HUGE rewards compared with other equipment like the thermometer and barometer. I can\u0027t imagine being able to earn science points quickly enough without it, but I was tempted not to even equip some of the later unlocks when I realised that they gave so little science in return.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EMeh, the main points come from location, not the part itself.

There\u0027s something very unrewarding about starting by putting a capsule on the launchpad at the very beginning in order to do an EVA and then immediately recover the vehicle. I think I\u0027d like to start with a few more parts and make a tiny flight to the first experiment area. i.e. take the launchpad and KSC out of the equation and offer slightly higher rewards for the coastal and grassland areas. or something.
