When I first heard about the idea, I had mixed feelings. \u0022That\u0027s great!\u0022 I thought, while at the same time scratching my head wondering, \u0022So what?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike others, I was disappointed when Squad eliminated multiple probe science transmissions as this rendered probes essentially pointless. Real probes continue to gather data for years (even decades). Why should KSP probes be tossed after their first transmission? I understand Squad\u0027s reasons for the change. I just thought it could have been implemented better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it hit me. We\u0027ve been trying to balance collecting one resource between two different types of activities, probes vs manned. With the introduction of a second resource, we would be able to separate the activities and allow (essentially require) players to perform each kind of mission in order to collect their respective resources in a balanced way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain. If we were to leave science pretty much as it is (minus a few tweaks here and there, like bringing back multiple transmissions) but reward big money for manned missions, the player would be able to choose which kind of mission he would like to execute based on his highest priority. If the player wants to open up the tech tree a bit, he can launch a few probes and explore. But if he wants to buy any of the expensive new parts he just unlocked, he\u0027ll have to send some Kerbals off on a dangerous mission in order to drum up advertizing revenue / science grants / commercial contracts / government funding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis need not be an either / or endeavor. Lots of new science would earn some (a little) money. Conversely, while manned flights earn huge money, they could still bring in a little science too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo aid this, we could make probe oriented parts relatively cheap to purchase, essentially disposable, while making command modules (and Kerbals) very expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe wouldn\u0027t need to limit the abuse of probes and the endless science one may collect with them because one need only covet new parts in the tech tree for a little while before feeling the itch to earn more cash by risking a few lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as money is concerned, the name of the game is \u0027Big risk, big reward.\u0027 Make the financial penalty for the failure of manned flights huge. But make their potential payoff equally vast. In fact, find ways to potentially bankrupt a space program with the failure of only one or two missions. KERBALS SHOULDN\u0027T BE EXPENDABLE! THEY REALLY DO WANT TO LIVE! It should cost money to train and develop cadets into full fledged astronauts. This will add excitement to manned missions without penalizing a player\u0027s ability to explore the solar system with probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf no mission can launch without money, and exploration cannot expand without new technology, then the player must execute both types of missions to make their space agency to grow and prosper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we would have the beginnings of a real space exploration strategy game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would be a great topic to discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-26T17:24:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2014 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pineapple Frenzy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T17:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like probes and I don\u0027t want to launch any more of them than I have to, they\u0027re way too easy to build and launch; doing a mission with Kerbals is more challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately the devs have already said it will be possible to convert science, money, and reputation to the others, so even an idea like yours will work with the way I play.

Establish a KSP bank account in the name of the player\u0027s space agency. The player begins his career with his first fiscal quarter\u0027s modest government / commercial / private (the benefactors\u0027) funding credited therein.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each fiscal quarter the account is credited with funds allocated by the benefactors. The benefactors love space exploration and expect results. Fail to impress them by your lack of mission success and you can expect to see each quarter\u0027s funding stagnate, or even decrease. Wow them with your success, and you will see their checkbooks open wide. Remember, space agencies are paying staff whether they fly missions or not. So if you have no income, you will quickly move into the red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In the same way science is awarded when the player achieves certain mission parameters, the player receives one-time cash bonuses for putting kerbals in different places throughout the solar system. The key here is that, unlike science where you cannot stack sensors, rewards are given on a per-kerbal basis. Manage to safely get ten colonists to their new home on Duna? Congratulations, step right up and receive your massive ceremonial check. Of course, you had better hope you sent a comms antenna with them. Otherwise the only people enjoying the warm glow of mission success will be the Kerbals you sent yonder. Bring them back to Kerbin after an extended stay in space, and collect even more cash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the one I like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. After a successful manned mission, in addition to your massive one-time bonus, expect the Benefactors to increase your periodic funding. Hey, you\u0027ve proved you can deliver success. That\u0027s what a good investment smells like, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The corollary of course is that mission failure ought to bring with it devastating consequences. After the (hypothetical) costs of the vessel, accident investigation, litigation, and humiliation are tallied up, expect to see a major incident penalty debit applied to your account. The philosophy of \u0027vessels can be replaced, Kerbals can\u0027t (at least, not right away)\u0027 should apply here. Probes ought not cost the agency more than the cost of materials, regardless of mission outcome. However the potential loss of Kerbals, and expensive manned vessel parts, ought to strike enough fear in the player to make him sweat while landing a Mk1 pod on Minimus, no matter how much fuel is in the tank. The Benefactors\u0027 too are fickle creatures. They live by the motto \u0022What have you done for me lately?\u0022 Fly no impressive missions for a while and expect your periodic funding to slowly dwindle. Kill Kerbals, and watch it disappear faster than a jellybean at Fat Camp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Kerbals must be finite, in the sense that once they die, they are dead (i.e. forever dead). If their individual personalities aren\u0027t enough to endear us to their well-being, the money we invest in their training ought to motivate us to look after them. At the beginning of your career your have 2 fully qualified astronauts ready to go, with a number of \u0027cadet applicants\u0027 eagerly awaiting training at the Academy (sound familiar?). To increase your roster of qualified astronauts, not only must you invest significant capital into their training, but cadets won\u0027t be ready to fly for at least a couple of fiscal quarters, depending on how stupid they are. Courageous astronauts make better role models. Therefore when they successfully complete missions, courageous astronauts earn you greater financial respect from the Benefactors. Of course the Academy interviews only a few applicants each year, and accepts even fewer as cadets, so your pool of bodies will dwindle quickly if you like turning your asparagus stacks into pinwheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. The player must have some opportunity to recover his career if he buys the farm and ends up in the red. In addition to purchasing parts during vessel construction, the player ought to be able to add parts to a \u0027parts bank\u0027 as funds allow. That way the player can continue his valiant (vain?) efforts to keep his job as Director by launching a hail Mary mission or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Manned command modules ought to cost significantly more that other parts. How much more is a subject of some difficulty. No mission should be cheap, but to make manned missions riskier, probe-only vessels must be significantly cheaper to launch than manned vessels. Perhaps if a command pod cost on the order of two or three times that of the booster it would need to escape Kerbin SOI would be a good place to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end game: Should a career end? And if so, how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. I can think of only two ways a space agency (real or otherwise) ought to cease operations: either it runs out of money, or it ceases to be relevant, in which case it runs out of money. A KSP career need not end automatically for any reason other than the player resigns because the agency he directs is hopelessly bankrupt. When this happens, he need only press the \u0027resign\u0027 button (like the \u0027recover\u0027 button, but way more humiliating. Don\u0027t confuse them). At this point the player sees a career summary and can explore mission stats, history, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this post covers a lot of material, but these ideas demonstrate what KSP would look like if I were Q (Booyah!

The best example I can give is the obligatory \u0027first mission\u0027 where with limited parts you unlock enough science to get parts you can use for better missions.

That\u0027s all automatic, the player might be able to review this information but it happens without their input. After all, KSP is about rockets and flying, not crunching numbers. Once that\u0027s done, your quarterly budget is set. You can now use this money to build rockets, fund missions and hire Kerbals. At the end of each quarter, whatever money you have left disappears and you receive your next quarterly budget. At the end of each year, your budget is recalculated based on your reputation. So, instead of receiving money for missions, you receive reputation based on your various goals, how well they were achieved and on what timeline. This is perhaps the most complicated part because it cannot be an XP system that simply rises with each mission, instead it needs to be a median indicator of how well you are performing as a space program. Overall consistent success yields a higher reputation, while mistakes, wasteful spending, missing mission goals or whatever it might be lower it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s simple, and at first glance the thing people hate is not being able to hoard money. First off, as long as the player is able to, they will. This causes them to push things into the future with \u0027well, once I have this money I can ...\u0027 Quarterly budgets encourages players to be both frugal AND spend what money they have. It\u0027s a human impulse to not let it go to waste, so whether it be launching that small satellite you wanted or testing out a new jet design, trying to zero out your budget each quarter encourages the player to play. But, on the other hand, since you\u0027ll always have a budget, there\u0027s little pressure to do any specific task beyond keep your program running, you don\u0027t have to do obligatory missions JUST to have the money to do the ones you want. Additionally, only recalculating budgets yearly means the player is allowed to have a number of successes and mistakes before it is reflected in their budget, and long-term planning and goal-setting is more useful than trying to \u0027grind for experience\u0027. You aren\u0027t required to do everything \u003Cem\u003Eright now\u003C/em\u003E. You can put together that space station over the course of a year so you have enough money to launch other missions. Putting together your reusable program keeps costs low, giving you more cash to spend on experimental projects. And most importantly, because missions don\u0027t provide you money directly, there is no grind. The player can naturally enjoy the game at their own pace and have success and failures based on what they\u0027ve done, not what the game demands they do. For people who enjoy planning, this adds an extra layer, and for those who are less interested in it, its just a framing device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as science goes, I think we should be using it to unlock nodes AND parts, then spend cash to manufacture them. That would allow some of the time-sensitive science gathering people want to do to exist so you aren\u0027t just on-offing your missions. Keeping Kerbal\u0027s in orbit doing studies and such yielding \u0027trickle science\u0027 is more viable because there is a larger sink, and it goes along with the idea of playing the game over time instead of doing fifteen missions in one month to max out your science. After all, career mode is essentially an excuse, it\u0027s a framing device for progression. Where I differ from many suggestions is I don\u0027t think it should require obligatory patterns. I think the player should receive many parts to begin with and unlock more specialized parts up the tree, it\u0027s just silly that we\u0027re spending science on a basic ladder, but it makes sense to investigate a retractable, electric one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T17:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hyomoto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
