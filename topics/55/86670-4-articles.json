Instead, make it multiplicative: \u0022get N% less funds (from everything), receive N% more science (from everything).\u0022 e.g. set the slider to 20%, I get 20% less money for everything that gives money, and 20% more science from everything that gives science.\u003Cp\u003EI think a big part of what makes this feature seem \u0022broken\u0022 to so many people is that it goes against a basic KSP game mechanic, which is \u0022science is about discovery.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad did an absolutely brilliant job with the basic design of how you get science: by going places and doing new things. New experience = learning = science. Especially key to the design is the fact that \u003Cem\u003Eyou can\u0027t get more science by doing the same thing again.\u003C/em\u003E If I\u0027ve got my seismic scan from a particular biome on Minmus, I can\u0027t get more science by doing that same thing again. I have to do something different. This is a great way to give the player an incentive to go lots of different places and do different things. The get-less-science-if-you-transmit mechanic is great, too-- it gives you a reward for doing a return mission, which is a bigger challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current turn-funds-into-science mechanic turns that on its head. No discovery is needed. Just turn the crank and out comes science, in fully-repeatable fashion. There\u0027s no reward-incentive for going anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy making this to a percentage boost to science, that means all the basic game mechanics still hold-- something that was zero science before is still zero science, all the rewards are still in place. It just makes it so the player has the option of making science a bit less hard, in exchange for making funds a bit more hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(And of course, one would need to tune the percentages for playability/balance-- i.e. likely the percentage boost to the one shouldn\u0027t exactly equal the percentage hit to the other-- but that\u0027s just a detail to work out.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow... I hadn\u0027t initially thought of it that way, but this is really the heart of the issue. I like this even better than what I and others have suggested (changing the conversion ratio to 250:1, 350:1, or even 1000:1). This provides incentive to go out there and visit places, like the Science Game Mode. You can still unlock the tree through part test contracts if you really want to, but a Jool flyby is still going to yield more than an LV-N test on an escape trajectory from Mun.

It keeps you from unlocking everything in 3 flights. and stretches it out to about 40. The mid game missions still pay out a good bit of science, even scaled at 1% .. If you scale the science to funds ratio to 1 to 1000$, it makes up for it.
