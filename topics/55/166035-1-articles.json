One problem, though - with a methodical approach I\u0027ve usually unlocked the whole Science tree by the time I make substantial progress beyond Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. After that, the game becomes a sandbox, and beyond self-satisfaction and self-set missions, there isn\u0027t the payoff to conquering other planets. Yet to get much further without great frustration, you do rather need the majority of the science tree, so I wouldn\u0027t suggest slowing down the progress of unlocking. But... what if after the Science tree was unlocked, it was possible to go back and spend more science points to further develop individual nodes or components? That is to say, for increasing levels of science points, it could be possible to apply, say, a 5% positive increase to the stats of a part (or even one particular stat at a time - \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0 for e.g., or crash tolerance), then spend a higher level of scaled science points for a further 2.5% increase, then 1.25% etc... all the way on up to infinity, but constantly scaling up the cost and down the return, to prevent ridiculously unrealistic results. In this way, however, there would be loads more to spend your post-tree science points on, and there would always be a \u0027point\u0027 and a payoff to scoring more science points across the whole Kerbal system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne or two new \u0027science fiction\u0027 level parts or nodes might be good, too - e.g. something akin to an \u0027Epstein Drive\u0027 - but priced at an absolutely colossal number of science points, to make it a real long term aspirational \u0027end-game\u0027 objective. Alternatively, what if you could spend science points on the \u0027gamble\u0027 of subsequent research that only \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E payoff some rare new SF discovery - so you could at least feed your late game science points into some kind of scientific \u0027one armed bandit\u0027?!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR L A","CreatedById":150940,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T11:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould just use a mod that reduces science income \u00A0and stop science mining lol.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example I use a mod that reduces science and I do not allow the Science Jr component on manned lander missions\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmetman","CreatedById":181322,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T12:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181776-cj286/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022181776\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181776-cj286/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CJ286\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 It\u0027s not that difficult to go anywhere using all the 90\u002B science nodes without any frustration, less actually. I mean, those parts get you everywhere, period. I\u0027m not saying this to arrogantly expose myself as a pro which I aint lol. But it\u0027s kinda the truth so with some more training you\u0027ll go to Eeloo without needing all the science nodes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your ideas...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is determined by fuel type, exhaust temperature, the actual rocket system (i.e. open/closed cycle) combustion chamber/nozzle among other things. So more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E from a engine means another engine. Meaning something that looks different rather then be the same engine that has it\u0027s stats magically increased by clicking a button. Got that?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for your idea in general, stat increases on parts up to infinite parameters by throwing bulk science at it? \u003Cu\u003ENO!\u003C/u\u003E The idea in general is, so so but ok nonetheless if you scrap the infinite part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe learn a lot in real life to make things sturdier with less weight. Or do things more efficient by optimizing systems. But there are no infinite part parameters to be reached, since this isn\u0027t possible in real life also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also said increased part parameters could increase crash damage.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nCrash damage of ksp parts is already ridiculously \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I know ksp isn\u0027t real life but it already is quite cartoony in how far one can go. If a real rocket would only fall a few centimeters off from it\u0027s anchored launch clamps tear and shear may rip the tank apart causing a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Rapid unplanned disassembly\u0022\u003ERUD\u003C/abbr\u003E greater then ever seen in KSP. In ksp we count in several m/s (but this can be next to nothing like a real rocket if you\u0027ve build gargantua) So that\u0027s the relative comparison basically. However not any tank is supposed to survive the crash loads ksp throws at your ship. If you haven\u0027t made something to land on a barge without empty fuel tanks your rocket is essentially constructionally devised to lift something and fail miserably if anything goes the other way. Not take bottom loads of any kind. Or side loads for that matter.\u00A0 These are things KSP forgives you for if your rocket isn\u0027t to heavy even at default part values. Dear lord, don\u0027t let me upgrade this any further prayer...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0As for a Sci-Fi part. KSP isn\u0027t a game style to have science fictional elements, even if you were to argue it as a unlockable achievement for a scientific endgame.These ideas are better suited for mods. And you can always suggest a Epstein drive on the mod forums and manually configure it to be at the end of the techtree. Eventually your success for obtaining a Epstein drive is far greater by having someone mod it rather then wait for Squad who will never do such a thing anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese and many other things are pretty customizable in KSP so it shouldn\u0027t necessarily be stock anyway. I do agree with more career diversity (overhaul) which is also moddable by the way so if you can\u0027t wait, don\u0027t let yourself be waiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this was useful for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-01T13:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEpstein drive is essentially a rocket with infinite fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthen you have the timewarp problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
