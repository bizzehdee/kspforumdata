What I suggest is that alternate solid skins be made. That way it would be possible to make better looking rover bodies more akin to that of the RoveMate probe core. It would be more believable that wiring to the attached parts are hidden inside them rather than parts working through space magic. Squad has added scanner arms, so why not parts to make actual decent looking rovers for them to go on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-08T14:42:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2019 02:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Spagoose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-08T13:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like a nice idea, I like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-10T10:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it really odd that you consider girders to be the best part for a rover body.
