It would seem to make sense for the setting to obey the snap/precise toggle already in the general construction UI. When enabled the slider will snap to values of 0, 15, 30, 45 etc. If more precision is required the mode can be toggled to precise and an exact value can be attempted with the slider (thought that UI needs fixing too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazarus MonkeyMan","CreatedById":198287,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T13:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYES!\u00A0 And a place to actually type in the value, instead of being forced to do it all by slider.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
