Well, that is probably true, but it has not been proven!\n\nThis is how it\u0027s going to work:\n\nIf someone suggests adding a suggestion to this list, that suggestion will be added.\n\nIf someone disagrees with a suggestion on the list, that suggestion will be removed.\n\nIf a bunch of people really want a suggestion, and a few people really don\u0027t want that suggestion, it will be settled in a discussion/poll in another thread (I\u0027d guess that 3/4 majority would be fair enough to call that suggestion agreed upon).\n\nFeatures that are already confirmed for future updates will not be on this list.\n\nThat is all.
