I often end up binding other functions to abort, brake and even stage as I\u0027m always several action groups short. Here\u0027s an example;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my current project I have a large (200\u002B ton) cargo transport craft that lands VTOL style on Mun or does orbital deliveries to further planets. It has to be able to deal with different cargo and fuel loads and remain balanced during a landing. To achieve this it has adjustable engines at the front and rear (the VTOL engines from B9) so I can adjust front/rear thrust balance and that alone takes up 4 action groups. 3 more groups are taken up toggling different engines sets (IP drive engines, low power VTOL landing engines, high power central landing engines) and another one to reset all adjustable engines to the same angle. 8 groups gone just on engine control! The onboard crane then takes the rest plus o,p,; and # and so I use brake to toggle the cargo bay doors and abort to toggle Qstruts that secure the cargo. And then there is the cargo that includes solar panels, sat dishes, a full set of kethane gear, life support systems and a rover (plus half a dozen KAS winches). I could actually use ~30 action groups on this craft!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, I usually end up \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/40559-All-craft-from-my-Constellation-mission-vid\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewriting flight manuals for my craft!\u003C/a\u003E (see action group table at the bottom of the initial post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou only need look inside the cockpit of any modern flying vessel, never mind space vessel so know that 10 control buttons ain\u0027t going to cut it! If you can\u0027t remember all your action groups, and I certainly can\u0027t, then make use of the B9 info drive which enables you to write notes about what each group does and keep that attached to each craft. It\u0027s standard issue for my craft now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t agree that being able to rebind action groups is a bad idea and I can\u0027t see how that would be dangerous. You can re-arrange the staging menu during a lunch if you so choose so this would be analogous to that (less risky imho). It would actually be a simple and elegant solution to the lack of available keys and provides a way of looking up what action group do (if you forgot your info drive). You could have your action groups that are concerned with flight and then once you land you can re-assign them for the running of base components, for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t like the idea of having a menu as a solution to increasing the number of action groups, half of the reason for action groups is not needing to fiddle with menus, partly for speed of access and its important for those of us who want to film cinematic shots. Having to pop a menu up in the middle of that detracts from being all cinematic. That said, if it was the only way to extend the number I\u0027d still take it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple days ago I was about to make a new post about an idea I had for increasing the number of available action groups, but I got side tracked, so I\u0027ll put it here and hope it gets discussed. I\u0027ll do my best to explain it, in my head it makes perfect sense but what\u0027s in my head and what gets conveyed ain\u0027t always the same, anyway... here goes; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage specific \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eaction group sets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you start out exactly the same as we have now, only difference is that there is also an icon in the staging list that represents the first \u003Cem\u003Eset\u003C/em\u003E of 0-9 action groups and by default it is in the first stage. If you didn\u0027t do anything to it then you\u0027d have exactly what we have now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe change is that in the action group editor you can choose to add a second set of 10 and another icon will appear in the staging list. In the action group editor you can define 0-9 actions for the first set and a different 0-9 actions for the second set and by moving the icons in the staging list you define when the different sets take effect. So now you can have your first set of 10 action groups in stage 1 and then in stage 6 (for example) you have the second \u0027action group set\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second (and later sets) you would also have the option on each 0-9 group to \u0027inherit\u0027 which will mean that a particular action group will have the same function as it did in the previous set. For example in the first stage\u0027s action group set you may have solar panels on group 1 and a load of other things on the other groups. In the stage 6 set you could set group 1 to \u0027inherit\u0027 so that group is sill solar panels, but then define a different set of functions for the other groups. With groups that inherit they would automatically change if you changed them in the previous set. So in the example of group 1 in stage 1 being panels and being set to inherit in stage 6; if you added another panel to stage 1\u0027s group 1 that would automatically be included in stage 6\u0027s group 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could then define as many action group sets as you have stages, if you really wanted each stage could have a different set of 10 action groups (thou personally I think that would lead to insanity). But for example your horrifically complex mining rover can have its specific 10 action groups set on the stage when it decouples from it\u0027s lander but up until then the lander was functioning on its specific action group set. Once decoupled the lander still has its original action groups but the rover is now on a different set. if the lander and rover re-docked you could move the sets around so the desired one is in the current stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the other advantage here is in docking multiple ships together. When you dock the staging list merges and you can (and often need to) re-arrange that after docking. You can take the action group set that you want in control and move that to the current stage and have the docked craft function according to that, when you undock you can switch back to the action group set for the departing craft. This means that you don\u0027t have to make absolutely sure that all your craft that are ever going to dock have compatible action groups and you don\u0027t (as I did in the above linked thread) have to get excel out and write it all down, cos who wants to get excel out in the middle of what is supposed to be fun!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that\u0027s my possible solution for a flexible system that leaves it as it is for those who don\u0027t care for more than 10 groups, while opening up the option to have 10 different groups per stage (if desired) for us lunatics who want lots of controllable parts on overly complex ships and also addresses how to deal with merging action groups when docking ships that have different action group setups. Interested to hear what you guys think.
