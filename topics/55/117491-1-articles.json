Right now, if you want to know if the fuel cell is running, you have to right click on it.\n\nSo, how about adding a simple light to the model so, for example:\n\nLight off: fuel cell is off\n\nRed light: fuel cell is on and producing electricity\n\nBlue light: fuel cell is on, but the batteries are near full/rtgs or solar panels are producing enough power for the current consumption, so the cell isn\u0027t producing electricity\n\nBlinking red light: low on fuel.\n\nThat way, the player can see at a glance and in an immersible way if the cells are on/off/expending fuel"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:27:39Z","Content":"I like it. Except, low fuel blinking other color that shows status. So dark=off, green=on making power, blue= on standby, blinking green= on making power \u002B low fuel, blinking blue = on standby \u002B low fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:10:53Z","Content":"Well, I would rather like colors that are similar to MechJeb\u0027s indicators. \n\nNone - off\n\nGreen - Status:operational\n\nRed - Status: Oxidizer deprived\n\n Status:Liquid fuel deprived\n\n Status:Batteries recharged\n\nAn alert for low fuel? I have no idea for that.\n\nPeople have so many problems with the fuel cell. They should be fixed."}]}
