There are situations where you just have to sit there and watch for minute after agonizing minute, basically doing nothing, but you have to sit there so you don\u0027t miss an important action at the end of your wait. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Warping. If you want to warp to your encounter with Jool, you just have to sit there watching the timer count down. You can\u0027t go do something else in the meantime, because you might miss your encounter and go flying off into a useless orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Burning. If you want to run a nuclear engine burn, some of those take 15 minutes! Like with warping, you can\u0027t go do something else in the meantime, you just have to sit there and watch, to make sure you don\u0027t miss the end of the burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Flying. Say you want to fly halfway around Kerbin. That means, sitting there and watching for 30 minutes! You can\u0027t activate an autopilot and go sleep for a while (like pilots do in the real world). You have to periodically adjust your pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rovering. Similar to flying, say you want to rove over a wide plain. Same problem, you\u0027re mostly just sitting and watching. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe physics warp \u0022sort of\u0022 helps, but it seems to cause unstability and other problems. Also you still have to wait, because physics warp only goes up to 4x. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI formed these opinions after playing .22 with no MechJeb. I could do it, I got through the science tree twice, but man, the waiting... the waiting...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T19:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor warping, I suggest Kerbal Alarm Clock.

I avoid ion drives because of that but even with nukes you can have some crazy burns. 4x physics warp helps but by all means do a quicksave first. That cuts a 15 minute burn down to about 4 minutes if you can actually do 4x warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor flying... Yeah. That\u0027s an issue.
