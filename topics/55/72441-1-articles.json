C7Studios\u0027 aeroplane parts pack was originally a mod until v0.16, when it became part of the stock game. Since then, Harv\u0027s other mentioned point has happened -- it\u0027s grown outdated, and a lot of the parts need a total re-do. Doubtless C7 or one of the others will get to it when they have a moment, but essentially the more mod code they include at this stage of development, the more code they have to debug and fix up as their own original code changes and evolves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T19:07:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emods that make up for technical shortcomings in the game totally should be part of the game. however i think they should have the same features implemented in squads own way, rather than to just slap the mod code in there as a quick and dirty hack. having full access to the game code means they can implement the features in a much more robust way that is closed to mod makers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T19:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of the most popular mods might never be integrated directly into the game. Some mods such as the Sub assembly loader were brought in almost directly. Other things like the said spaceplane pack from C7 were brought in for other reasons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts almost garenteed that over development Squad will go over some mods ground, just because there are so many that add critical gameplay. Such as deadly re-entry, or FAR. Both are critical for the game to be more realistic but aren\u0027t needed for the game to be played enjoyably. These sort of mods really don\u0027t need a poll of IF they get implimented but when and how much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods such as B9 or kerbal engineer would have a massive fan base but neither might ever make it to the game in their current forms. The Devs will most definantly go back over the old stock spaceplane parts since they are very out dated, but engineer is very questionable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one hand engineer is critical to almost any player that wants their ship to go and do something. On the other it IS somewhat like cheating, for the new and the older more experienced players. We can still do everything we make and do and just litterally \u0022wing it\u0022. It does make designing an effective rocket more luck or hard study time with calculations. Or just more fun if you don\u0027t take it serious. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly time will tell when certain mods get their ascention to stock. But its almost garenteed some will make it, its just more a matter of when and how much of if will.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-15T19:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elots of modders are also implementing stuff right out of the planned features list. those mods are definitely getting deprecated once squad implements things in their own way. rovers, docking and asteroids to name a few have all been replaced despite being modded in before squad got around to it. i kinda call them temporary mods, because people stop using them when the official version comes along. i kinda think these mods are a waste of effort on the part of modders who want something now vs something that will stand the test of time. the other side is that modders can try out a lot of ideas long before squad gets around to implementing something. figure out what works and what does not before squad puts any effort into the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei dont like to say mods should be part of the game, because when you do that they arent mods anymore. its better to say: x features from mod y should be part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
