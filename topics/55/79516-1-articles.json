Every time I\u0027ve completed the tech tree in various versions, with various mods, it\u0027s just never clicked as a fun game mechanic. I started thinking on this earlier today, and realized why - it just doesn\u0027t make any SENSE! Instead of bits and pieces of dirt somehow being able to help develop rocket parts, currency could be used for R\u0026amp;D Points, with it being expensive to develop new parts. Science could be sold for a large amount of currency to various groups, increasing your overall reputation, or \u0022released\u0022 publicly for a large reputation boost. This of course means you could develop your space program purely via contracts - meaning you are effectively a private space program. Another improvement that could be made is reputation affecting the quality of your scientists - More gifted individuals being willing to work in the rather explosive environment of the KSC. This could make tech nodes cost less, or maybe all gathered science gets a small multiplier on return, depending on your scientist quality.

This both makes quite sense, modeling real world science/patents/knowledge.
