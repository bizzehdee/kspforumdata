Please put your flamethrowers down long enough to hear me out! This is not intended to be a thread bashing SQUAD by any means. In fact, I have the greatest admiration for the things they\u0027ve accomplished so far. Part of that is the extensive framework that they have laid down for players to modify the game to suit their needs. That\u0027s a brilliant innovation! I\u0027m glad that we can look for features we\u0027d like to see in the game and then download them from third parties who have every bit of respect for SQUAD\u0027s work as I do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet I\u0027m starting to get the feeling that this is part of the problem. Now, I\u0027m not going to ask SQUAD to hurry up their production schedule or implement features I\u0027d like to see in the game now, or any number of entitled demands that so many have tossed their way. However, I\u0027m starting to get worried that KSP is beginning to show signs of sprawl - expanding outwards farther and faster than it is expanding upwards. Because modmakers have been so expert in their expansion of core gameplay features (I could list them ad infinitum: MechJeb, FAR, EVE, Kethane, KAS, and so on...) that the devs appear to no longer have any interest in taking these matters into their own hands. There\u0027s nothing wrong with adding a new feature here and there, and I can see the appeal in doing so (how many threads have we seen in which newer players complain of not enough features in recent release), but we are now at the point where I think rather than adding new features, they should be improving the features they\u0027ve already implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClassic case-in-point example: How long have the Mk. 2 and 3 cockpits been in the game and yet *still* don\u0027t have an interior views? And that\u0027s one of the easiest to address! Science gathering is a mess still - completely divorced from the main body of gameplay (though I suspect and sincerely hope that the upcoming contracts system will remedy this somewhat). The atmospheric drag model is outdated to the point of becoming a running joke, with deadly re-entry still a thing of the distant and unspoken future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one thing that is bothering me. Another might actually seem hypocritical of me to bring up since I just mentioned I\u0027m not pleased with the development of existing features in favor of adding new ones, but bear with me... Perhaps what is upsetting me the most, we\u0027ve visited and re-visited the issue of a lack of end-game content with no indication that any such popular concepts as in-situ resource utilization, other solar systems, and extraplanetary colonies are even being considered. The reason I don\u0027t think it hypocritical for me to say this is because these are not features I am expecting tomorrow (literally or figuratively), but in one way or another they\u0027ve been discounted and ruled out as part of the game\u0027s future development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat in itself is not a problem. The developers have every right to implement the features they want and leave out the ones they don\u0027t... but the nature of discourse is to voice one\u0027s opinion with the hope of being heard. That, and the very reasons provided seem to conflict with previous precedents set by SQUAD in a very direct way. The biggest example I can cite is a previous discussion on implementing other star systems: IIRC the official stance was \u0022We cannot do this with time warp alone, which requires some sort of warp drive. This takes KSP out of the realm of science fiction, and places it purely in that of fiction.\u0022 However, this seems to conflict directly with SQUAD\u0027s previous stance of \u0022gameplay before realism.\u0022 With all of the gameplay implications having other star systems would provide, I see no reason why a break from realism is such a bad thing. Especially since HarvesteR himself once advocated an Albuciere (spelling?) Drive as part of KSP\u0027s possible future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like not to dwell on such specifics however. My point is that when taken as a whole, these \u0022offenses\u0022 (and I call them that for lack of a better word, though I in no way mean to suggest that SQUAD is intentionally trying to antagonize the community) point towards a growing trend towards the watering down or outright elimination of important features, the over-reliance on third party modifications to improve the existing structure, and the perpetuation of confusing policies such as \u0022gameplay before realism... except when gameplay makes the game unrealistic.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I am over-reacting, or misunderstanding the problem. In either case, I am not trying to call for a dismantling of SQUAD or the drastic alteration of its handling of the game. KSP is, and always will be SQUAD\u0027s to do with as it will. However, as a catalyst for discussion I am interested in seeing if others feel as I do. If so, perhaps a discussion will provide SQUAD the input it needs in order to continually drive its work towards excellence.

The ARM pack, while really good, felt like SQUAD was adding new stuff before they had consolidated. The prime example of this is, as you say, the Mk2-3 cockpits, the aerodynamics (Which can be improved massively, a la FAR) and the lack of any mention of resources, dedicated base systems, and a science system that works 100%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I do have to disagree with you on the \u0027warp drive\u0027 issue. I am aware that this is the subject of \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E contention (Dripping with sarcasm there) but I do think that it would be a bad idea for squad to completely depart from the theme they have set. The game parts are all analogues of real world parts or at least near future tech, so something so far-fetched would seem horribly out of place. However, these arguments have been going back and forth for a while, so I don\u0027t think me saying that will have a massive effect on peoples opinions. However, I think the drive should not be added simply because of how much contention it has caused within KSPs friendly little community. Such a rift would doubtless be unhealthy for the game, as a \u0027You\u0027re either with \u003Cstrong\u003EUS\u003C/strong\u003E, or you\u0027re with \u003Cstrong\u003ETHEM\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027 stance would be pretty nasty. I think there are alternate solutions to be looked to, such as having a dense galactic cluster rather than an earth-like distance, an extra x10^\u002B1 on the TW and some near future tech that is far more viable then a magical space-time bending megaengine.

This was implemented in the ARM release, although Ferram\u0027s KJR continues to exist because it provides even further reinforcement and other features beyond the scope of the stock game. In this particular instance we reached a harmony between stock and mod content. Before that we had Lagsbane, which was implemented as a stock feature entirely. Want another example?

What Kethane provides (for me at least) is the ability to run more interesting and varied mission types. I can do a scanning run, then build a mining colony with life support and infrastructure designed to keep a small crew alive for as long as possible. Those mission provide me hours upon hours of planning the missions, designing the equipment, et. cetera. A small fraction of that time is actually spent mining, and to be frank, once I\u0027ve started mining I just leave it in autopilot and move on to other things. Those hours of planning and execution, however, are more varied and interesting missions than anything I could run in the stock game. One of my favorite missions was a crew-juggling mission to populate my kethane base on the Mun! At no point during this process did I feel \u0022railroaded\u0022 with artifcial gameplay mechanics.

However, I see program development as more like building the house room by room. Coding has the advantage of being more modular than a house, so the analogy isn\u0027t 100% accurate.

For the asteroid example, there was nothing preventing the injection of a non-controllable debris-like game object into the save. Rather than spend the resources on getting the textures and the procedural generation et. cetera, more pressing matters could have been attended. Besides, if the devs keep adding new features they may eventually lose track of all the changes that need to be made on existing ones. They\u0027ve said as much themselves.

That may sound trivial, but anyone who has taken a programming class can tell you that documenting the code and writing it in a standard way is considered every bit as important as the code itself, so that those coming along behind you know which parts do what. But even that is assuming that the mod maker has implemented his invention in a way that will continue to work with future versions of KSP, so that it doesn\u0027t need to be reworked when Squad adopts the mod\u0027s code. How likely is that? You all know how many mods stop working each time a new version of KSP comes out. Lastly, Squad is a profit-making business while modders are unpaid volunteers. What happens when Squad starts making money off of the mod-maker\u0027s code? Legal arrangements have to be made before that transition can take place.
