If you\u0027ve not sent guys to Duna, you don\u0027t get Duna rescues. You don\u0027t get munar surface rescues when you have barely gotten to Kerbin orbit. For the inflatable hab shown, forgetting the fact that it makes no sense in orbit with a guy in it, you\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Erequire\u003C/em\u003E the claw (and I agree that crew (or fuel)\u00A0transfer via the claw is something that should not even be a thing, anyway). It\u0027s just as absurd to be asked to rescue someone with a part you do not have as to rescue someone at a place you cannot get to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the above 2 issues are how the game is designed, and all stock parts have a hatch, I think that added parts without a hatch are actually non-compliant. The stock game would need to \u003Cem\u003Echange\u003C/em\u003E such that crewed parts with no hatch (of which none exist in stock, so this would be a change to support mods) only appear via rescue contracts that include \u0022recovery\u0022 of the part. Then at least players would know that the rescue attempt requires a claw ahead of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the LS \u0022exploit\u0022 of the LS not turning on until you approach, I think that is a limitation of the stock game, as you do not have LS on a craft until you \u0022own\u0022 the craft, and for rescues ownership requires getting into range (presumably so the player cannot self-rescue a kerbal via EVA).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T20:42:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
