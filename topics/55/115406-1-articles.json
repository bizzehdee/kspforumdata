In case you\u0027re wondering I\u0027m playing on a 21 in monitor typically @ 1920x1080 but sometimes 1680x1050 for a performance boost if needed. \n\nAnother complaint i have is that you cant choose what missions are being shown. This would be nice bc they tend to get in the way of each other.\n\nAlso the camera would be great if you could set it into chase mode. The zoom also never seems to go in far enough when fine tuning trajectories.\n\nIf anyone else has suggestions to ease my pain plz plz hit me with them cuz orbital tuning is such a pita atm for me(mehbe im lazy?![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)).\n\nAnyone else think a little Orbital view overhaul would be nice?"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T18:39:27Z","Content":"Well, first; welcome to the forums!!\n\n(and second, this would probably be better if posted to the [Suggestions section](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion))\n\nOne thing I can suggest is that if you click on the Ap/Pe markers then the values displayed with them will remain without needing to hover the mouse over them. They are visible through the planet so with the values shown you can make adjustments and not need to change view to see them. \n\nDo you mean a camera chase mode while in map view? \n\nYou can get better view on maneuver nodes by using the tab key, that will cycle through what you are focused on and you can focus on the node rather than the craft, in some cases (particularly with nodes that are a long way off) that helps (backspace while in map mode will reset your focus back to your craft, off course it\u0027s also the abort shortcut key when in regular view so....caution). Another thing is just to double click on the planet, for adjusting nodes that are near to a planet I find that can help quite a bit (again backspace will return focus to the craft)."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:06:10Z","Content":"[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863)\n\nIf you\u0027re not using PreciseNode, you\u0027re just asking for frustration."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T20:22:32Z","Content":"ContractWindow is a great mod that can manage your display of contracts (grouping, hiding, showing rewards, order by, etc.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bigtimbers","CreatedById":147721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T02:51:10Z","Content":"Brilliant I will check out those mods. \n\nYes I am familiar with the orbital controls but I just find everything overly difficult. (I have plenty of patience. I just think it could be drastically improved)\n\nI find that half the time when I click on the Ap/Pe nothing happens. Also they tend to get mashed together with other objects orbiting and can be difficult to click unless you zoom all the way in.\n\nYeah I typically focus on the planet or the node, but i think it still feels very restricted.\n\nThanks for all the help and I will re-post this in suggestions!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T03:41:33Z","Content":"These suggestions for the game\u0027s development have been moved to Suggestions and Development."}]}
