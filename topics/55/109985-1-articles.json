That way, you could make pointy, angular fairings.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n-MRS"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:42:45Z","Content":"I like this idea, right now, you can\u0027t make a fairing completely round or completely pointy : its always a bit of both.
