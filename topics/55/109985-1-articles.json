That way, you could make pointy, angular fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MRS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T19:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, right now, you can\u0027t make a fairing completely round or completely pointy : its always a bit of both.
