That mod decrease the max thurs to a more realisic one (140 Kn) and reduce the operative speed range of the engines, but I\u0027ve never used the lazor postburners because they were still powerful enuoght. I think that afterburners are a good Idea for future version of KSP, but presently they aren\u0027t as useful as you may think. Remember that the game physics let you to go at Mach 5 (hypersonic speed!) without any extra thurs while in real life it\u0027s quite hard to go over Mach 1.5 even with postburners due to the law of the areodynamics and of physic, because higher speed cause higher heating, bigger problem for engines (The turbofan engine CAN\u0027T WORK with an intake that overcome the sound speed), bigger structural trouble...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T16:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn afterburner would increase the mass of the craft while increasing thrust without increasing fuel consumption.
