This would be especially useful to know for retractable solar-panels if they are located in a way that requires one to retract them before an engine-burn to prevent the engine\u0027s exhaust plume from damaging the solar panels. To keep the electrical charge as full as possible, it\u0027s helpful to know how long one can keep the solar panels extended before needing to retract them for the engine-burn. Similarly, knowing how long landing-legs take to deploy could be useful for timing when to extend them for a landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-26T15:27:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn space flight you always want to extend and/or retract everything as soon as possible (if it will be needed at some points).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext time you need extra EC to kick start your vessel I would advise you to keep one extra battery\u0027s flow disabled.
