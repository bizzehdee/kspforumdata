It\u0027s quite good for it, the proof is in the pudding. If you start up KSP, you can see that it runs at a reasonable to good frame rate, and is very much playable. \u0022Switching to a different engine\u0022 will not guarantee that suddenly, everything looks better, plays better, and is better. What it does guarantee, is that ALL current progress is lost. Not your own silly game saves, but the actual game. \u0022Switching engine\u0022, is like tossing out all you made the last few years, and starting from scratch. All you might be able to bring over is some art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I could ramble on why you couldn\u0027t directly \u0022switch engines\u0022, but instead, I shall give you a silly analogy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t compare a game-engine with a car-engine. The game-engine is a car, developers modify the car so that it, in ksp\u0027s case, can go to space. If you were to \u0022switch engine\u0022, you would salvage some stickers you put on your current car, and then scrap it. Then you would take a brand car, and you would have to modify it all over again. Except this car is completely different, and most experience you got working on the previous car would be useless. You can\u0027t just switch out out the engine for a better one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, no there is no other engine that KSP could realisticly \u0022swap\u0022 to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESources: My experience working with different 3d engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T16:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou cant just swap and game engine.
