KSP should have the ability to toggle between control surfaces and flaps. When you right click a control surface to access its tweakables, there are 2 new settings. 1st is to allow it to act as a flap. The second is to adjust the angle of the flap. Furthermore, it can have action groups assigned to raise/lower the flap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a brief introduction on flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps are generally areas of the wing that can move up or down, similiar to a control surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps are installed in most aircrafts today. They are lowered during liftoff - landing or while cruising, to buffer the lift generated by the wing itself, hence reducing the need to constantly pitch up to increase lift. They are essential in all aircrafts flying today and is a very important part of the plane. If it fails, the plane may not be able to land safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAircraft flaps look like these\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.decodedscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Flaps.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Flaps.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the windflow is hard to visualise, here\u0027s a graphical representation of flaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/images/fig_28-08.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fig_28-08.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the windflow is directed downwards, hence increasing lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlaps are very essential in flight as it aids with takeoff , landings and low speed flight. It acts as a surface to deflect air downwards, thus enhancing lift. When a flap is lowered, its angular drag is increased, hence it slows the plane down slightly. Drag increases with the angle off attack. Hence a flap lowered to 50 degrees has more drag than a flap lowered 20 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this will really help very much as most of the planes in KSP are very hard to take off, and they rely on the sudden drop on the end of the runway to take-off. It will also allow better flying as the angle of incidence can be closer to 0 at cruising speeds, hence reducing the need of reaction wheels or even RCS to keep the plane\u0027s nose up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough it is a very simple idea, it is nevertheless essential to flying our spaceplanes so we can crash it.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E .I don\u0027t think it is very challenging to implement in KSP , and many people will appreciate the addition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-21T12:58:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2014 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rdivine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T13:12:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif only AOA or drag or anything worked properly in ksp\u0027s \u0022aerodynamics\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T13:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, flaps and air brakes would both be nice-to-haves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T15:11:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason planes only take off at the end of the runway is that main landing gear are too far back, meaning that it\u0027s hard to pivot on them.

You\u0027re confused what flaps are suppose to do. They don\u0027t magically make planes take off. They increase the lifting force for a price of drag. And that increase isn\u0027t as huge as you think it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. In current aerodynamics system - flaps are impossible to be implemented in any reasonable way. And when they get around fixing aerodynamics - your plane that barely can get airborne now most likely well be very firmly sitting on a ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T20:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like flaps.
