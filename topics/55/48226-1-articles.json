My suggestion would be to allow the text of the result to be displayed, even if no points are gained.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow players who are building their own \u0022career\u0022 mode in sandbox to have some results, it gives a meaning to explore the different parts of Kerbin or the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, I would also suggest some way to review the data and the results you have gathered. I don\u0027t think we have seen any sort of interface for reviewing science results which you have gathered. I would love to have an overview of what results I have gathered from the different planets and biomes. This would also help to plan the next mission, and stop people from making missions where they in fact have already done the science experiment some weeks or months ago, they just can\u0027t recall!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus when Biomes are in for all planets, we need some interface to keep track of which experiment on which biome on which planet we have run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEg \u0022Hmmm, I\u0027ve been to the big western Mun crater, but did I run the Goo experiment, the materials, and did I remember to pick up a rock ?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that 0.22 is not yet released and that this can change still, but making the suggestion in case it isn\u0027t in \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T15:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it will allow to have to have an idea of the scientific effectiveness of a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree with the review suggestion: when you have to qui the game while making a mission, you can easily forget the experiment you have done(or haven\u0027t done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: I want to do science and have feedback from the science I did i sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T17:02:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 05:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by goldenpeach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
