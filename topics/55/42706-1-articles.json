That got me thinking. Here\u0027s my suggestion: (Warning, spoilers ahead)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you could use the current 2001 space odyssey-esque monoliths scattered around the Kerbol system to unlock new part trees. I don\u0027t mean just singular parts. I mean entire trees of parts. For you to use the monolith, you would have to get a Kerbal to stand next to it, right click the Kerbal, then select a new option: photograph. Your Kerbal would then walk around the monolith , taking pictures of it as he goes. Once you take off again and land back at KSC, then you can recover your flight. That will then add the monolith-specified branch to your tech tree. For instance, one of the monoliths on the moon would unlock the Nuclear Power branch, which includes NERVAs, RTGs, etc., which you would then have to research. Another monolith might contain advanced alloy technologies, which, depending on what level you research it to, would reduce the dry mass of everything by up to 50%. Maybe you could even go to the site of the \u0022Duna code\u0022, have your kerbal listen to and decode the SSTV signal, which would unlock major things, such as new planets, maps of existing planets or even new star systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my idea for the tech trees. Any suggestions, constructive criticism, or death threats are welcome. Well, maybe not the last one. You get the point. Hope you enjoyed my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.

After being dug up it sent a signal to TMA-2 which is at Lagrange between Jupiter and Io (read \u0022on Iapetus\u0022 for the book version). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETMA-2 has no such magnetic field and a mass that makes it just as dense as air. Furthermore TMA-2 is more like a swiss army knife than a transmitter (like the on one the moon). It could \u0022absorb?\u0022 HAL and Bowman and could multiply itself like a von Neumann device (and transform Jupiter into Lucifer). After that job was finished it dropped to Europe and spawned a new round of evolution there.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not exactly known, but expected that TMA-2 also did transmit signals to the unknown civilisation that started the whole Monolith \u0022program\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that sums it up ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T15:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be totally okay with munoliths or other hidden things like them helping you with research. Even if you just got some extra science points for doing experiments near one, it\u0027d be cool.

I don\u0027t really have a habit of talking about things I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClark just loved to hand-wave things. In other words - it\u0027s not science! You can\u0027t just hook up some strange artefact into your wonder machine and get yourself a meaningful result. Imagine medieval alchemist getting his hands on the modern-age chemical batteries. Will he figure out what they do? Will he be able to built something that uses them? The same with Clark\u0027s monoliths - I can\u0027t remember humans used any of them to fulfil their own goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no actual evidence that monoliths found across the kerbolar system are similar in function to those in 2001: Space Odyssey. They may be just giant ice-cream machines for all we know. And they are not similar - they have a giant logo on them, which further supports the giant ice-cream machines theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding CCTV signal - the beauty of KSP right now is that you can go places without actually knowing anything about them. That\u0027s the joy of true exploration. It\u0027s like real life - you don\u0027t need to \u0027unlock\u0027 stuff, you just look at it through the telescope and say: \u0027Yeah, let\u0027s go there\u0027. So this CCTV signal may serve only as a key, as a direction where to go, which star you should visit. Even this is an outrageous speculation, it\u0027s impossible to use this signal without external applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s sad to see people who don\u0027t know much about science try to influence the development. I\u0027d say - let developers make science in KSP work in a realistic yet fun way, and everyone will benefit from it - hardcore players will get their realism, and more casual players will learn about scientific process in the same way they\u0027ve learned about orbital mechanics. It made KSP special, so why not stick with it?
