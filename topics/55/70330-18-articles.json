I didnt not know what I was doing, some of the landings were probes, and one probe got slingshoted out of Jool orbit (because I thought it would be wise to launch all probes and landers at once, while in elliptical\u00A0orbit of jool). Everthing I did was guestimating thanks to some youtube/wiki research. And succeeding was the most awesome thing I did in the game. I had a redundancy in the form of two extra refueler vessels who didnt need to land on a body.

The numbers don\u0027t mean much without experience, or a lot more research than I did in the past.
