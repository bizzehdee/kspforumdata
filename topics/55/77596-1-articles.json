In ksp, you could count, but rather players just go there, and if their lander is not enough good, they crash and make a rescure mission using the experiences, as a more \u0027kerbal\u0027 solution. At interplanerary missions, it is a bit harder, but you can still experiment at Kerbin and M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn in that case. And finally, you just always try to have as much fuel as possible, if your lander has more fuel in it than needed, no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mentioned feature could be really good, blowing up things and killing kerbals witouth any serious result, but maybe the work what it would need would help the game become better at other parts. And yes, there is still lots of problems around the game that is more important than this. The planets are being explored by you first, so how we would know how they look like? But still, it sounds good, altough somehow it is not fitting the game. And it\u0027s a simulation in a simulation.

I would not agree with spending science points on it, I would prefer having it become more accurate as you do experiments near and on the planet. This would also include scanning the surface from orbit to make topographical maps and for more precise landscape and colored surface you\u0027d have to take pictures. This would make all your science actually meaningful. Right now it\u0027s quite meaningless, you just get some points and get parts in return. I would prefer being able to do something useful with it, too. This would give us a good reason not to finish the tree from Mun science, it would give us a reason to explore beyond that. However I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to happen.
