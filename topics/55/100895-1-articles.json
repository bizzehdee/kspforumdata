Seeing as Leonard Nimoy is one of (if not) the most iconic actors of all Science fiction. Sure he didn\u0027t land on the moon, but he is one of the reasons space is engrained into so many people\u0027s memories today.

Out of place because well, this is the Kerbal Universe, not ours (Armstrongs monument gets a pass because they guy did walk on the Moon and I think that one man is symbolic of the entire space exploration. I read it as RIP Neil Armstrong but I see it as a monument to space flight everywhere and the advances and knowledge it\u0027s given us). I think it\u0027s the start of a slippery slope because why stop at Nimoy? Will Patrick Stewart get one? Sir Patrick Moore didn\u0027t get one when he died in 2012 but was a beloved astronomer in the UK and arguably helped inspire many younger people back then about space and the Moon.\n\nAt the end of the day, Nimoy was a great actor, but still just an actor. He didn\u0027t walk on the moon, he didn\u0027t help figure out the secrets of our universe.. can we keep the memorials to an absolute minimum and only to those that actually made a significant difference to space flight? Or are we going to want a memorial for any well-liked famous person? I\u0027m worried this is just going to be a knee-jerk reaction to some sad news.\n\nEDIT: Don\u0027t get me wrong, this is sad news and I liked Nimoy, but I do not want a memorial to him.
