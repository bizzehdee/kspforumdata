Though in my opinion, at least 50% of these tools\u0027 value stems from letting you edit your node while being zoomed in onto your destination. In principle, one can make very precise adjustments with the stock pull-thingy.\n\nHowever, I understood the OP to be not only about precision, but convenience as well. \u0022Circularise\u0022 is a simple task, yet in order to get it just right you have to twiddle quite a bit. I don\u0027t think it would be bad, or degrade gameplay, if the game provided a solution to some of the more straightforward problems (like circularization, plane change, or hohmann transfer).\n\nAs I said before, this could conceivably be tied to piloting skill.

Nodes are great, but they don\u0027t give you the same understanding about how two orbits interact. Having something that adds predefined nodes would be a further step away from teaching people about space flight. So, personally I\u0027d be against having anything that automatically adds a defined node as part of stock. As a mod, then great, that makes it a conscious choice. If the game just gives it to you then why would you bother learning about hohmann transfers and why they are effective or why you need to lower or raise your orbit to make a rendezvous, they just become the thing you do without having to think about it."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T22:25:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E PreciseNode should be stock in some form, in my opinion.\n\nI disagree with this opinion (and actually disagree with the OP).

PN has too many niche controls for most people (myself included). The only time I use PN, is to use the editfields to perfectly tweak my nodes anyhow. We need something small, like an editfield window like PN has; for the nodes themselves, literally 3 text boxes that you can edit normal/radial/prograde with.\n\nAs for the placement of nodes; I would like to see an expansion of the \u0022rightclick\u0022 feature that lets you \u0022wait an orbit\u0022. The node in this mode should have an additional prograde and retrograde control to it; which when pulled, would move the node in the direction specified (this should also be editable as per my previous suggestion.) Above the node indicator should be a text overlay of the angle to prograde of the maneuver node itself.

Editing my node when I\u0027ve gone forward or backward an orbit, because KSP loves to reset the node to the current orbit.\n\nSo most of the time, I use PN to overcome the clunky KSP UI.
