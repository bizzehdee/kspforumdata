I want contracts for Geostationary satellites, comsats, science sats, space stations and docking, colonies where you have to have a certain amount of kerbals on a planet or moon, and missions to expand, resupply, return kerbals to Kerbin...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I find myself launching things to space for no reason, but KSP has massive potential, and the keyword here is immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal007","CreatedById":92253,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T09:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESupported.

It would support a more historic progression, but that\u0027s more of a personal preference \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts just need some polishing.
