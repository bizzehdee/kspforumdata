That\u0027s buggy as KSP will disappear from your tray, and you can only swich back to it with Alt\u002BTab again. Unlike other programs, if you switch away from KSP, the game won\u0027t be paused, and also the music will remain. That\u0027s why I turn off the music in the options. This should be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
