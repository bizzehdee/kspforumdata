It would be more realistic to have the LV-N run on liquid only, and I think it would be good for gameplay, too. Most SSTOs use jet engines for in atmosphere ascent, then a rocket engine for circularization/orbital maneuvers. Having a rocket engine that runs on LF only would make their design simpler as the player doesn\u0027t need to guestimate how much oxidizer to bring along; all fuel is good for either the jet or rocket engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Comrade Ninja!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T12:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to testify as a person who would prefer to play with stock aerodynamics instead of FAR at this point in time, and please explain how Squad has broken a promise for say reentry heating, it\u0027s in development, can you link me to where they say it will not be happening in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs schizophrenic said below me not implemented yet does not mean forgotten, I feel like a lot of issues people are having with the devlopment of the game would be solved if they would just wait, I mean it\u0027s early access, you knew what you were getting yourself into.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-18T13:08:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2014 01:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dodgey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shizophrenic","CreatedById":107022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T12:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot implemented yet doesn\u0027t mean forgotten. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E most mods Focus on one aspect. that one solution to do something how that aspcet could be done. but is it the ONLY solution?? from dev Point of view it wouldbe ONE concept that is more or less proven that it works. nothing more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T13:41:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i played already FAR and removed it again.

It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve played KSP, a year now since I really tried it again. I basically went trough the same process I did when I first started playing and what made me stop in my tracks was the same thing that made me stop playing a year ago. The performance of the game is still awful. I have a 200 part big ship in orbit and I\u0027m getting regular frameskips.

Well i would bet all my money if someone opens up a new challenge to see who can lift more payload into LKO FAR or stock, FAR will loose.

When re-entering at high speeds, expect to build up heat on whatever is reentering. If the heat is too much, the object disintegrates; simple as that. It seems very unrealistic to me that a Mk1 capsule can survive reentry speeds greater than 100,000 m/s (yes i have tested this). I can see obvious flames and superheated plasma surrounding the craft but no heat buildup for some reason...(yes I know thats on the what not to suggest list, but thats not my main point here). I think new players should have to deal with these realisms because that is what forges better craft-making skills and memory power (remember to put on a heat-shield, etc). In real life, there is no option to turn down the heat, enable simpler aerodynamics. Also, NASA and other space agencies had to deal with those problems early on, so I see clear reason why new players will have to deal with them too.

When re-entering at high speeds, expect to build up heat on whatever is reentering. If the heat is too much, the object disintegrates; simple as that. It seems very unrealistic to me that a Mk1 capsule can survive reentry speeds greater than 100,000 m/s (yes i have tested this). I can see obvious flames and superheated plasma surrounding the craft but no heat buildup for some reason...(yes I know thats on the what not to suggest list, but thats not my main point here). I think new players should have to deal with these realisms because that is what forges better craft-making skills and memory power (remember to put on a heat-shield, etc).

I already mentioned this a few post before, in first place it is a game not an real life simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany popular space games had nothing to do with realism yet they where very popular. Wing Commander, Star Wars series to mention a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow many of you build an exact replica of the Space Shuttle, installed all the reality mods required to simulate an realistic reentry \u002B landing and actually landed that thing exactly at KSP runway only by gliding?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone did this, because to do this 100% you will actually need 100% engineering information about the shuttle which we simply not have, for example (but not only) the software running the computers on the shuttle. Also to simulate it the right way you need tons of data about the flight profile of it and so on. You will have to actually rebuild all the command pods and all parts that are in KSP and perform flight tests with them on a planet that has the same conditions like Kerbin to collect enough data to be able to simulate that, everything else would be only an guess and approximation at best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see?

So when discussing features which affect the difficulty of the game, because it\u0027s not like the effects of reentry scale with how far along the game you are. It\u0027s always there for players new and old, so you have to ask how much more difficult would this make the game for a new player (note this applies to all mechanics including aerodynamics)? How likely is this mechanic to drive off new players? Ect ect. Now, this isn\u0027t the only consideration to take but it is an important one. It is always preferable to have to mod the game to make it more difficult than to have to mod it to make it more easy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the topic of \u0022NASA has to deal with this so should we\u0022. NASA has to deal with a lot of things, Kessler syndrome, time delay for the transmitting of commands to probes, reliability of parts on spacecraft, n body physics, orbital decay, life support, precise delta v calculations, ect ect. My point is it\u0027s a game, and feature addition consideration should be made around gameplay, not just realism, and even if reentry heat was added why wouldn\u0027t you be able to turn it off? Certainly there will be mods to adjust it/turn it off, why not make it a toggle option like gravity. Basically realism by it\u0027s is not a good reason to add something into the game, forging better memory skills is just silly and should be left to brain games and increasing better building skills just doesn\u0027t make any sense, the skills wll adjust to fit the environment.

I once had the privilege of a long conversation with a Planetside 2 developer about sniper rifles, which are horribly underpowered by RL standards. They must land a headshot to kill and their velocity is so low it\u0027s laughable. The most powerful ones fire at 650m/s despite the descriptions talking about Gauss acceleration. Realistically, that muzzle velocity should be in the 4 digits. The conclusion of the discussion was that if they were on spec with reality, it would be painfully easy to die to a sniper, something nobody enjoys. What has stuck with me is this: \u0022reality does not always make for good game balance.\u0022 -Matt Higby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is unique in that it walks a fine line between reality and gameplay, embodying the best of both. Back to the topic of the thread, I personally am losing a lot of faith that Squad will get the job done. It seems like the focus is tunnel vision career mode. All career mode developments only further career, while sandbox developments further both. I think sandbox is being neglected because most of what is left to do is things that all come down to implementation, as opinions are across the board. Some people want true-to-life aero \u0026amp; re-entry while others want mild heating and simplistic flight models. There\u0027s no good way to please everyone with one system, so some form of modular difficulty, which in teh case of KSP, can really be complexity instead of difficulty, has to be implemented which is again something the devs aren\u0027t keen on. They find themselves in this jam and the solution is to go work on something else. While it is fantastic (I really do respect the hell out of squad for what they\u0027ve done) this is the case, it creates this unfinished appearance with no sign that it will be rectified. That is what concerns me about the current development direction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
