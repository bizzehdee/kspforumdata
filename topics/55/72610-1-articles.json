It can either be reusable or it cannot. Most spacecraft and launch vehicles so far have been not reusable, only usable once. The exception to this so far have been elements of the Space Shuttle, and SpaceShipOne. Luckily the future might bring us some more reusable rockets and spacecraft, such as the Falcon/Dragon by SpaceX and the Skylon by Reaction Engines Ltd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EReusable Vehicles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are advantages and disadvantages to a reusable vehicle, but one thing that is clear is that in (stock) KSP it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s quite an accomplishment to make such a thing. The game should reward this skill by giving the player the cost of all the intact parts back upon retrieval. This could be perhaps modified by distance from KSC. This would also incentivize players to invest in a reusable infrastructure of spacecraft moving crew and cargo to Low Kerbin Orbit followed by refuelable space tugs moving them further into the Solar System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMass Produced Vehicles\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA reusable vehicle is not the only way that real-life space programs are trying to get costs down. Common designs and mass production are another way. If NASA had to start from scratch for each mission they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d run in the red after only a few launches. They use common designs so that they can mass produce components and keep costs down. If KSP would add a modifier that would reduce costs based on how often a part or a combination of parts would be used by a player (to a certain lower limit), this would incentivize players to come up with common designs and use those to launch their missions. Like reusable vehicles this would add a challenge to the game, because players would have to try to build their missions around what their common design could carry into space. A cost-reduction modifier would reward the player for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts on this fellow Kerbalnauts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-17T13:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a way we already have mass produced stuf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have specific parts that we glue tougether, rather than having to design the parts for each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the money back, I agree you should get some of the costs back for the parts you recover.

Under the free recovery system you get all those benefits with none of the tedium and it can be done from very near the beginning of the game, and is an integral part of the mechanics, and you can also magically transform old craft into new ones for free if you recover them.

This should also go with simpler engine tech and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part i only believe advance parts and special parts should cost a lot of money. Such as high end engines, command pods, science equipment and maybe some special parts such as docking ports and solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
