It would be helpful if it also showed you a little more information, such as your projected altitude and speed at that point. In addition, if you have a target selected it could show your target\u0027s position on its own path, so if you are pointing to one hour ahead, it would show where your target will be in one hour.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
