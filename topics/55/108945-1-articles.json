Yes. Sorta, better rep = more interesting contracts. But really, perhaps a more interesting concept might be, better rep with a certain company means stronger long term deals, better payouts, that sort of thing. I could even imagine rivalry among competing companies. So doing a lot of work for one company may turn off another- or on the flip side doing work for one big company may make another more eager to appease you with better contracts in the short term- depending on the \u0027personality of the company\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would require a re-vamped screen within your contracts, somewhere to gauge your contracts and \u0027working relations\u0027 with various companies. But it would put a lot more focus on reputation points. It would also clean up the contracts too. For instance, clicking on the company name could bring a drop down list of those contracts- rather than all being displayed at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mocked up a pretty simple but easy to follow template to get a better idea of what I\u0027m saying. This would basically take the place of the current left-side listings of contracts currently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i129/spinomonkey/Contract_zpso8oypul4.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Contract_zpso8oypul4.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T21:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea.
