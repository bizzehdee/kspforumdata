I tinkered with it a while back when it first came out, but with the introduction of Career mode and the non-spammable science experiments, it seemed more fun. I finally \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ecrash\u003C/span\u003E landed on Eve with a probe, and I\u0027m almost through all the upgrade stages. I think I\u0027m gonna build some more probe rovers before I commit any of my Kerbals to anything beyond the Kerbin system. Safety is Job 1. And because of that, I ended up thinking it\u0027d be really rad if I could build a probe that uses balloons to get a measure of a planet\u0027s barometric readings, temperature ranges, and be able to map out the different biomes. It could even be used to probe Jool. They might even be useful for extended EVA travel on Eve, Duna, and Laythe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as ease of implementation, I think you could just change the models on Parachutes, and give the canopy a constant minimum lift at low barometric pressures. The difference being, though, that the balloon expands the higher it gets, where a parachute acts conversely.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T20:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHooligan labs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220395-hl-airships-v2-6-for-ksp-0-23-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220395-hl-airships-v2-6-for-ksp-0-23-5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"butterknife","CreatedById":114777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-09T20:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah. I\u0027d seen that, but I don\u0027t really dig the look of the models. They don\u0027t really look kerbal-ish. Kerbish? Kerbash? And from the screen shots I\u0027d seen, the balloons, not the airships, seemed like solid structures. So it\u0027s more like implementing an antigravity part than a balloon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
