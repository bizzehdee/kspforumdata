The patched conics approximation breaks down near the inner moons of Jool, but otherwise it works fine. Some people might complain that orbits remain stable without stationkeeping, but it\u0027s a minor issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solar system could not exist as such, so it\u0027s better to think it as a bigger system scaled down for player convenience. This has two major unrealistic consequences. The delta-v requirements for reaching orbit are so low that single-stage rockets can lift useful payloads. For a similar reason, interplanetary ships can just cruise around without dropping stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJet engines are broken in every conceivable way. Surely they take something from the atmosphere to burn the fuel, but apart from that, they don\u0027t resemble real jet engines in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon engines are a mixed case. Even though they are four orders of magnitude more power-efficient than real engines (1000x thrust for 1/10 of power), their performance is similar to real engines, as long as they\u0027re used only for orbital maneuvers and interplanetary transfers. As soon as you put them in landers, they become magic technology with no basis in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Monthar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Monthar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can see bigger ion engines making the nuclear engines obsolete. Bigger xenon tanks however would not. The entire point of this thread is about bigger tanks not bigger engines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigger tanks would actually have more impact. Currently you need one ion engine per 1-2 tonnes of payload to get TWR up to useful levels. As most interplanetary payloads are at most tens of tonnes, the engines don\u0027t increase the part count or the complexity of the ship significantly. On the other hand, you need 5-10 xenon tanks per engine to get the delta-v figures to similar levels as with nuclear engines, which becomes a significant burden with bigger ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T03:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree. You\u0027d still have the same total mass from the tanks and the amount of xenon they hold. The only difference between bigger tanks and multiple small tanks would be the part count, which means the game will run smoother as it wouldn\u0027t need at much memory for that ship.

The difference being the part count jumped from 3 to 10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo compare with the nuclear engine here is an ion engine with enough tanks to exceed the delta-v of the nuclear engine from the previous screen shots, along with the minimum number of fold out solar panels to power this one engine. This also take 10 parts, but you\u0027ll notice even though it has significantly less total mass it also has a significantly lower thrust to weight ratio, so you\u0027re going to have to burn the engines for much longer to reach the same speed/course change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s738.photobucket.com/user/Monthar/media/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot6.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx28/Monthar/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note, that if using the small flat solar panels (first one unlocked), you\u0027d need 12 of them instead of 5 of the fold out panels thus increasing the part count by another 7 parts for a slight decrease in total mass. If you went with RTGs so you could run the ion engine when on the night side of any of the planets/moons it would also take 12 of them which would increase the total mass of the ship. However, after replacing solar panels with RTGs you have to add 2 more inline tanks to have slightly less (40 less) delta-v than that of the nuclear engine ship from the first two screenshots, but still less than the first ion engine ship\u0027s screenshot. That raises the total mass of the ship by approximately 72% over what it is with the 5 fold out solar panels. The extra fuel and tanks of course increases the total mass even more and raises the part count to 19. See the next screenshot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s738.photobucket.com/user/Monthar/media/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot10.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx28/Monthar/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot10.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would take 19 ion engines on the ion ship to equal the vacuum thrust to weight ratio of that nuclear engine ship. That\u0027s only if the total mass of the ship remained the same. However since the mass will increase just from adding the extra engines. then you have to also add the extra power generation from RTGs or Solar Panels to power them all. Since you can\u0027t mount an inline xenon tank on the side of another inline xenon tank you have to add cubic-octagonal struts to mount the extra ion engines. Luckily you don\u0027t need to run fuel lines to them. Here\u0027s an example with just adding 6 more ion engine, the extra RTGs to power them and the extra tanks to have a similar delta-v and it only doubled the thrust to weight ratio of the single ion engine ship. This increased the part count to 133 and total mass to almost double that of the nuclear engine ship. If you\u0027re playing in Career mode where you have to worry about costs, it costs more than 35.5 times as many Kerbucks as the 3 part nuclear engine ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s738.photobucket.com/user/Monthar/media/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot9.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i738.photobucket.com/albums/xx28/Monthar/KSP%20Larger%20Xenon%20Tanks%20Suggestion%20Thread/screenshot9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, no matter how you look at it, there is absolutely no way adding some larger xenon tanks would ever make the nuclear engines obsolete.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T04:49:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 04:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Monthar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T06:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking about proven designs that have completed nontrivial missions, not some hypothetical ships.
