That\u0027s something that is built into engines. Anytime you attach something to the bottom node of an engine \u003Cem\u003Ethat supports fairings\u003C/em\u003E (some don\u0027t) then a fairing is created. This has nothing to do with the separator or decouplers. You could attach a fuel tank to the bottom of a \u0022poodle\u0022 and a fairing is created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for physical connections... not sure I understand where this is coming from. Physical connections are created with everything that is attached to something else. This too is not function of a separator. The only thing I can think that you might be referring to is that in your example above, you\u0027re connecting the 2.5m separator to a 1.25m docking port and finding it wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that is the case, then the problem is because you connected a 2.5m part to a 1.25m docking port. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re trying to recreate Apollo then what you need is not modifications to the separators. What you need is a part like KWR\u0027s \u0027petal\u0027 fairing or Procedural Fairings, which have special parts that let you attach something like a lander to a fairing base while the CSM would connect to the top of the fairings. (really it attaches to a second top node that the fairing base has and which separates when the fairings separate)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NWM","CreatedById":67386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T10:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I know how the default fairing works, a I know some mods too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027 just want to say: make the separators work as real: base of in-line holders and fairings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
