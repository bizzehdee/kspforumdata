Not because I want a delta-V view in the map view, but because I want to be able to see my staging sequence from the map view, since it makes flying from map view that much easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Long Finger","CreatedById":169468,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-02T20:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah this is a good idea. Also being able to stage in map view when your current stage runs dry\u00A0would be good too. So many times I\u0027m part way through a burn in map view and then have to switch view twice to continue the burn with an engine with different performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-02T22:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they could add this for Xbox, I will forgive all of Squad\u0027s mistakes and such and continue buying the DLCs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
