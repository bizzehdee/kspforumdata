How about introducing bullet-time as a gameplay mechanic for manned vessels? Give your kerbals an \u0022adrenaline level\u0022 that charges slowly. When it\u0027s full, you can hit a button and cause time to go super-slow while the adrenaline level drains over a period of some seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor probe missions, if anybody can suggest a reasonable replacement for \u0022adrenaline\u0022, that\u0027ll do too. CPU overclocking with a heat level, perhaps? Massively increased power usage while in bullet time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tery215","CreatedById":89094,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T19:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the suggested system to make slow-mo harder will be less effective when players realize that they can just spam probe cores.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T20:40:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tery215\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tery215\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think the suggested system to make slow-mo harder will be less effective when players realize that they can just spam probe cores.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could spam batteries, but that\u0027s just a legitimate trade-off of weight versus capability. Probe cores aren\u0027t exactly massless either. This is something that could be balanced, but if a slow-mo mode took say, 300 units of power for every mission-time second in slow-mo (or more!), it would make it certainly only worth using in emergencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr at least, only worth using in those critical moments before impact with terrain.
