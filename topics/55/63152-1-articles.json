A engine with a very large gimbal range. This would be very useful in things like shuttles and SSTOs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A larger version of the BACC SRB. Another thing useful for shuttle type rockets. also this would be 2.5 meter with about the same or more thrust then a mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.A larger nuclear engine engine, such as the one in KSPX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.C7 parts with oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T06:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m down for an additional nuclear engine and a new Ion engine of a larger size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T06:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d throw in for a 2.5 nuclear engine.
