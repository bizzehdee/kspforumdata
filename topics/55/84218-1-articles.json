The hdrs would have to be hand made which would be strange and give odd results. Also hdrs only properly work for small areas. On a fps map where there isnt much environmental change they work great but if your in orbit I cant see how it would work. The reflective shaders that the reflrctive shader mod adds work great. Only issue is they dont provide environmental lighting on non reflective objects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
