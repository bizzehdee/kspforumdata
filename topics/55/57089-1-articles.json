None of them conflict with each other, no competition. You want more science, add a transmitter and solar panels, only going one way, you can only get 1/3 rd of the science. But u can use that 1/3 of the science to get remaining 2/3\u0027s. Again no conflict, because all the science u can get by returning the goo home is still there, not been consumed by transmitting.

Different subjects should contribute to the science pool differently. For example, an EVA report is worth just as much whether you report it over comms or bring it back home. In fact, it\u0027s worth even more the sooner you transmit it because the experiences are still fresh. Imagine if Neil Armstrong had waited until he got back home before he described what it was like \u003Cem\u003Estanding on the surface of the freakin\u0027 moon\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example. Consider how the goo behaves in zero gravity. Obviously if you observe the goo and report your observations by comms, your results aren\u0027t going to be as thorough as if you had a lab on site and could perform a more thorough analysis. However, once you bring the goo back home it\u0027s no longer in zero gravity. You\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Edestroyed the experiment\u003C/em\u003E so how can your observations about how it behaves in zero gravity possibly be worth more than the observations you could have reported through the radio? Clearly in that instance the on site lab is the best option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if on the other hand you have a clutch of soil fresh from Duna and the means to preserve it properly, here your observations clearly would yield the least amount of benefit and your on site lab would give you a better means of analysis, but that\u0027s nothing compared to the analysis you could do at home. The best option here is clearly to return the sample to Kerbin for analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the way I see it, every experiment has an ideal option. Furthermore, once you\u0027ve conducted an expetinent you are imposed by a set of conditions that decrease the value of the science gained once those conditions are no longer met. Took an EVA report? Good! Report it while you\u0027re still on EVA or the experience won\u0027t be as fresh and therefore worth less science. Observed the mystery goo in zero gravity? Good! Now keep it in zero gravity while you try to exact the most science possible from it (via mobile lab or reporting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin each set of conditions, you should be able to mine a total amount of science from it regardless of what you do as long as the parameters of the experiment are upheld. In the goo example, if you report your observations you get some science, but you have not broken the experiment. If you then take it to the lab and conduct experiments on it, you should then get the total amount of science available, since that was the ideal option, minus of course the science you already got out of it by transmitting. That only makes sense, as the experiments you conducted in the lab would not be able to tell you anything new that you had already observed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo by treating every experiment as something different, the game opens up the challenge of players discovering what the optimal method of science mining is, what the parameters of the experiment are, and how best to gather the most science from the experiment while still adhering to the constraints it imposes. Science mining becomes less of a grind and more of a puzzle to solve, and becomes less abstract and more representative of conducting science in the field.

Another thing about such remotely controlled experiment is that this is really necessary when you don\u0027t exactly know hat to expect.

Some experiments have less than 100% recovery value, meaning that you can get more by repeating. Large part of that gap can be because of factors not accounted for first time. So in the early game opening comms channel directly during the experiment could give you some bonus that narrows this gap. But the more experiments of this kind are done, the more experience you already have and this gap narrowing bonus appears without the uplink - by the time you get to interplanetary missions (where you can\u0027t have real time dialog with science team) you\u0027ll already have that bonus almost full on it\u0027s own.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-24T16:10:19Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2013 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Alchemist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T15:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptRobau\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELine of sight broadcast is a bit too hardcore for stock KSP, I think.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes you think that?
