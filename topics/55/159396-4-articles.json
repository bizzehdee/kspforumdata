This warping idea is not a propulsion system, and as I\u0027ve said before encounters would not be as we currently understand how to do them. To do them in regular KSP, you need to burn to create an orbit that intercepts the orbital path of a celestial body, essentially being in the same place at the same time. However, with this warp idea I\u0027ve tried to explain, you don\u0027t need to wait for the Mun or Jool or whatever to actually go anywhere for you to intercept it. You just burn the fuel you need to go straight to the destination. In regular time-warping, this would not work, because as you got to the Mun\u0027s altitude away from Kerbin, for example, the Mun would have moved away in that time and you get no intercept. With this idea, you WOULD get an intercept because the Mun didn\u0027t go anywhere. It still moves, but at the normal speed which it orbits.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EThe only thing moving faster or differently is the vessel.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bolded a section of \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163933-cucco-master/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022163933\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/163933-cucco-master/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cucco-Master\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s quote up there to show what I mean.

It is exactly the same as never touching the time-warp button in a regular game. That\u0027s how every body moves, all the time, no matter what. The only way you could get to a body with Non-Time Time-Warp is having your orbital path, the blue line in the Tracking Station, crossing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E of the body you wanted, and then warping there.

What I\u0027m getting is, MP server dictates common time for all players connected. Doesn\u0027t mean all to be tied to 1:1 (non-warping) time, all players may be fine to be warping 50:1 during a same time interval, so the MP serve would be able to allow common timewarping. But any time one of the players requires to slow time flow, either the server complies for all players (which could be pretty annoying to those just waiting time to pass), or the interested player would disconnect from MP, do what maneuvers, builds, or else he needs, do, and then try to reestablish a common time with the server (meaning his time may have to advance suddenly to sync again with others). That player vessels may appear as ghosted in the meantime, as the server can\u0027t but keep their positions updated to its own time, rather than with the time current for the player. When reconnecting, the ghosted vessels would be changed to \u0022true\u0022 vessels whose orbital state, positions may have changed differently due to maneuvers done in the meantime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T17:18:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone explain me how the orbital rendezvous works in this model?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-22T17:19:04Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2017 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T17:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223030637\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159396\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492881526\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Enceos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Enceos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone explain me how the orbital rendezvous works in this model?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand this correctly: you approach a station.
