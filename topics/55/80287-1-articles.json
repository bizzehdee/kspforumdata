AKA, we should be able to turn of despawning of low-altitude debris, or make debris with probe cores stay spawned. When you invest hundreds of thousands of Kerbollars into your heavy-lift first stage, you sort of want some of your cash back. My solution now is to have my core stage boost into orbit and recover it using RCS and a Remote Guidance Unit, but I\u0027ll still lose my boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T19:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is discussed in quite a lot of topics - you might want to have a look here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88772-Control-distance-extended-or-tweakable\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88772-Control-distance-extended-or-tweakable\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86248-0-24-If-a-Booster-Has-Enough-Parachutes-On-It-Count-it-as-Recovered\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86248-0-24-If-a-Booster-Has-Enough-Parachutes-On-It-Count-it-as-Recovered\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T09:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, better keep this topic going with the previous threads. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff8c00;\u0022\u003EClosed\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
