As it stands, you can do a simple Mun or Minmus flyby with Tech 1 rocket and thus unlock quite a few nodes with one flight. Well, that\u0027s quite a feat in itself that deserves rewards, but it kind of... dilutes the experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, I believe the \u0022progression\u0022 itself should somehow be worked into the tech advancement other than with science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, limit tech tiers or nodes by assigning certain \u003Cstrong\u003Erequirements \u003C/strong\u003Ethat have to be met prior to unlocking and researching further. What would those requirements be? Why, it is \u003Cstrong\u003Epractical experience!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I mean by practical experience? Simply achievements of the KSP and its people, that is you: the player. You start with several stock parts and delusions of grandeur. The first command pod, engine, fuel pod. R\u0026amp;D eggheads have ideas, however to flesh them out, they need hard, stone cold \u003Cstrong\u003Efacts\u003C/strong\u003E. That is the practical experience: the data about performance of engine, airtightness of the capsule, conditions in the upper atmosphere and so on. At this point, nearly the whole tech tree is greyed out but the first node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is that node\u0027s requirement? Why, nothing but the first flight: reaching a certain altitude that makes the egghead nod in approval and parachute engineer sweat profusely. Once you successfully launch the rocket, reach certain altitude and successfully bring it down (that is, by not squashing the contents of the command pod), the eggheads scurry back to their tables with newly-acquired and still warm facts: the practical experience. The effect on the player? The first tech tier is unlocked and he can proceed with research!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext tiers could have similar conditions for progressions. For the science branch, for example, you would have to collect samples and perform various Kerbin-based experiments. Say, collecting surface sample from a certain biome would unlock the Goo container. Collecting samples and reports form, say, three or four different biomes would unlock the Science Jr. And so on. Other tech branches could be done in similar manner; to unlock docking ports and stuff, you\u0027d first have to achieve an orbit and maintain it for a certain period. Then eggheads would start throwing ideas of more permanent orbital presence and present the space rendezvous and station ideas... Space planes? You\u0027d need practical experience from both aerial and space flight (unlocking jet engines et cetera by performing various flight tasks, such as landing on the island strip, reaching certain altitude and maintaining it for certain time period, maintaining mach 2\u002B speed for a couple minutes and so on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical experiences tend to come from failures, as well. Rocket crashed? How about those radial parachutes? Ran out of fuel in space? Try this fuel-efficient engine! Ran out of electric juice? Just point this refurbished mirror at the su- er, Kerbol!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, you get the idea. Limit the tech progression by certain conditions, such as crashing probes on certain bodies, achieving orbits, performing experiments et cetera. I feel this would be much more satisfying than simply min-maxing a rocket to grab the SciencePointCarePackage at Mun/Minmus before doing anything else. Sure, it\u0027s a nice challenge, but it kind of trivializes everything up to that point. Of course you can try and reach Mun with lowest tech possible, but you\u0027d still have to do those mundane orbital experiments back at home before you can advance on the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe space program is like a ladder made of smaller challenges that lead up to the bigger.
