The Community Resource Project for which I asked for some help in starting this thread with, and didnt get much of a response (yet maybe they will show up here now), has a part in making the game realistic by using resources to add resource use in the game; this is all well and good for \u0027payloads\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources are fine...but now there is a serious problem with \u0027fuel densities\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad is trying to get into the resource game which is an added complexity when the \u0027lift and drag\u0027 issue have yet to be resolved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltho some formulas do not use derivatives, simple differential math is needed now because of fuel use; liquid fuel use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am assuming it was done; I dont think it was done correctly; why; because Squad\u0027s Liquid Fuel densities were pulled out of the perverbial hat just like the Comm.Res Proj did when they started out; then some of us pulled together to make resource densities more real-world like; even though the CRP (short for Community Resource Project) is off by a factor of 1 million, the values \u0027work\u0027 in game and there is a relationship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll except for fuel densities...something is really wrong here.

The volume is essentially meaningless in terms of burn rate. The capacity of the tanks ARE measured by volume for whatever stupid reason though. The tanks though appear to be wildly wrong in terms of liters - I think Squad just made up values for \u0027em.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, the FL-T400 tank is (by specification) 1.25m in diameter, and I estimate it\u0027s length at about 1.875m (it\u0027s about 1.5 diameters long).

IIRC the old assumption was that LiquidFuel was RP-1 which meant that the density worked out to roughly 4.5 liters per unit based on the capacity of certain tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the problem, though: KSP runs on arbitrary units and not liters, or some other meaningful measurement. Real Fuels attempted to solve this by moving all unit measurements to liters and adjusting its densities appropriately, and then moving tank volume over to the usable volume inside a tank cylinder. This meant Realism Overhaul could actually be realistic instead of using arbitrary units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you had Realism Overhaul using realistic volumes and densities, and a key mod or two moved to supporting that. Then along came CRP which intended to unify the mod community\u0027s resources so no one would stomp on each other. I can\u0027t remember entirely what direction the push came from but Real Fuels resources were to be integrated into CRP (because of TACLS, I think, which bridged the gap and used liters) which meant that all of CRP\u0027s resources would move over to liters for tankage with realistic densities. That, I think, is now how CRP is doing things because RF will be using it (and RF would only use it if it were realistic, that being its goal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, CRP will not redefine any of Squad\u0027s resources, for good reason. RF doesn\u0027t use abstractions, inasmuch as possible, and so tosses Squad\u0027s resources right out the door (where they belong), and other mods generally try to work with stock systems and thus need to leave those resources be. However, everything else in CRP moved over to 1 liter per unit with realistic densities because it\u0027s something that we can understand and actually account for, and people making part models can use the actual volume of their tanks instead of just slapping whatever number \u0022feels right\u0022 on their tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why Squad hasn\u0027t done that, but that\u0027s why CRP does it, to the best of my recollection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this thread pretty much just \u0022Why doesn\u0027t Squad use liters?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T14:40:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth noting that the given mass specific heats for LF and OX are now pretty close to something Hydrazine-y (Aerozine 50?) and NTO.

Although the individual masses are wrong, the 1.22 volume ratio fits right in the middle of the range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think anyone actually runs a NTO/UDMH rocket at a 2.3 mixture ratio (what we have), but whatever. (Capsules and top stages sometimes use 1.9 so they can use the same size tanks for both propellants. Launch vehicles run as close to max combustion temperature as they can (around 2.6-2.7) since the engines are easy to cool and NTO/UDMH doesn\u0027t really burn all that hot compared to the alternatives.) As an average value the Kerbal mixture works out, and mixture ratio generally doesn\u0027t make more than a few percent difference in rocket performance anyway (design-wise, that is -- mixture going wrong during a mission is about as disastrous as you can get).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably can\u0027t run a jet engine on UDMH, but UDMH and kerosene are near enough the same density. We can just assume that \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 is whatever parts UDMH or Kerosene you need to run your rockets or jets for as long as you end up running them. (You can actually build a kerosene/NTO rocket, but you end up needing something like 70% NTO by volume -- so that\u0027s not it.) It\u0027s a bit more of a stretch, but an LFO tank with no Oxidizer in it gives us a fuel density close-ish to methane for the nuclear engines, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe showstoppers for realistic masses are the everything-elses, not the fuels. Capsules, cockpits, structural parts, and fuel tanks weigh 2-3x as much as they should. The fuel tanks are the easiest to compare: dry fuel tanks in KSP weigh 11% of their wet mass, while the tanks on most real-life launch vehicles (Ariane, Proton, and Soyuz at least) hover around 6%. Stuff like Atlas V and the Shuttle Super Lightweight External Tank are down to 3.5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcept it\u0027s worse than that. Kerbal masses were balanced to make the rockets \u0022look right\u0022 taking off from tiny super-dense Kerbin, but the balance of each individual part is completely ad-hoc.
