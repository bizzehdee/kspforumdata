And, the avionics package is also useless right now because all the pod modules provide SAS capability already, which is all that package does. I think it can still be of some use though. I didn\u0027t like the idea of putting reaction wheels in plane cockpits, so I removed that, and I added torque control to the avionics package instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Still playing around with the values but here\u0027s where I\u0027m at right now.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E\tname = ModuleReactionWheel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tPitchTorque = 2.5\u003Cbr\u003E\tYawTorque = 2.5\u003Cbr\u003E\tRollTorque = 2.5\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tRESOURCE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ElectricCharge\u003Cbr\u003E\t\trate = 0.1\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt low altitudes, you will hardly notice a difference, because the other control surfaces easily overpower torque control anyway, but once you start getting into the thin stuff you will want the avionics package. However it does make putting a reaction wheel in your plane an optional thing, which I think is nice because planes do not typically have reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still playing around with this, so I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s such a great idea, but I\u0027m bringing it up in case anybody else wants to give it a shot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
