You know those mods that seem like they should be a standard part of the game? Like KSP Engineer. If the devs planned on adding something like that to the game but haven\u0027t gotten to it yet will they not now because of the mod. I\u0027m not saying there is any thing wrong with the mod version. But for those of us like like to play games vanilla, it would be nice to see some of the great features to be put into the game as standard parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wampa842","CreatedById":85841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T17:23:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPractically most of the \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 list.
