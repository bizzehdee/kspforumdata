The same principles work with software versioning. This got me thinking about how saved craft files work. Why not have an extra variable to the craft file called \u0027version\u0027 or \u0027issue\u0027 or something so that your \u0022space-rover 1001\u0022, that needed more solar panels, can be revised keeping the initial version intact for later use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe save files could be done using the current format of .craft files and use a directory structure to save the versioning: i.e. \u0027space-rover 1001\u0027 would be saved in a folder called \u0027space-rover 1001\u0027 and the craft file be either saved in mutiple sub-folders (1,2,2.1,2.2 etc...) or have the issue appended to the filename.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big advantages to this are if you are developing a large and complex vessel and make a design error and then do lots of other work, then it can be rolled back without too much hassle. Other uses could be that you can roll back an existing design to use it for a different purpose (i.e. change a science ship to a fuel-tug, using the same staging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my thoughts on the matter...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T23:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65388-Ship-subfolders\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65388-Ship-subfolders\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend you discuss this in this existing thread.
