Also, combine multiple contracts into a single mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recognize your situation at all. In fact, if I had posted anything on the income (career at normal setting), then I would have said the opposite. The contracts pay more than sufficient. The world-firsts will actually pay you even without you accepting having a contract for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo give you a picture: I rescued 23 Kerbals from various Kerbin,\u00A0Mun and Minmus orbits (typically I rescued 3-4 per mission). I explored the Mun and Minmus quite thorough (as in: visited most biomes) and went to Duna, Ike, Eve and Gilly once. And after that, I was 14 million funds in the plus. Then I built a Jool-5 mission, which I launched without any contracts... The Jool-5 mission cost 3 million, but when it was finished, I had 16 million in the bank: the world-firsts alone had generated nearly 5 million, apparently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to combine contracts for e.g. (1) testing parts, (2) collecting science data, (3) rescuing Kerbals and (4) planting flags. For example, you can fly to the Mun, test a part in Mun orbit, save a Kerbal from the surface, plant a flag, do a science experiment on the surface, fly back, and cash in 4 contracts in one go. This gets harder later in the career, when the contracts are scattered over many planets and moons... so you may have to accept one or two contracts first, then warp forward a few days to wait for a third/fourth contract to pop up to be combined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also helps to put a thermometer onto each satellite you launch, so you can instantly complete a contract to \u0022collect science data from orbit of...\u0022.

The difficulty of career, to the extent there is any, rests entirely upon the limitations of what parts or funds are available. Except for the very early game, no funds restrictions exist, and the parts restrictions are only around for a little bit longer in play. So I want to do X, but I am limited, so I grind some other stuff until I can unlock needed parts, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn career we are looking for difficulties to overcome, that\u0027s kind of the point. When the obstacle to an objective\u00A0is \u0022tech,\u0022 then we play to buy tech to design our way to our objective. That\u0027s why my idea career mode would be either real exploration (requires an unknown solar system every game, and the tools to unlock the information needed to explore it), or a space race. In the former case, the foil is the unknown (not the tech tree or funds alone), in the latter the foil is the competing program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T20:32:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002239636\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Veeltch\u003C/a\u003E I agree with your PoV and your suggestions thread offers some excellent ideas!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime I play Science mode because the collection of science gives me a reason to start with smaller ships and it gives me some loosely defined goals without the strict (put a satellite here, save this dude, test this part) sorta random structure of Career.

I don\u0027t disagree with others\u0027 concept of \u0022fun\u0022.

Of course the \u0022super custom\u0022 mode would need to be completely configurable not just with some sliders but by completely altering how the game functions. The biggest problem would be implementing something like that at this point in time because they can\u0027t very well rip out the old system entirely since some players have spent hundreds of hours playing and savegame compatibility is important... That said I don\u0027t think creating additional modes is any more difficult than most other stuff done on a regular patching basis, assuming the underlying framework is done in a reasonably organized manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-12T03:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA way to make money without missions is to set up a mining rig near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, then you can fill up empty tanker trucks or something and recover them for profit. I s\u0027pose it\u0027s a bit cheesy though. Alternatively you could launch spacecraft unfueled and fill them using a tanker drawing from a rig on Minmus.
