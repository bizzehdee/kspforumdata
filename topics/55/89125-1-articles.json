You would then be able to choose your preference and scale how much of fuel it would have. You wouldn\u0027t have Mk1 lf/Ox, Mk1 LF and Mk1 Structural separately. You would just have Mk1 Tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Integrate TweakScale, or similar setup. You would have just one fuel tank with different lengths and then you choose the size. You wouldn\u0027t have 1,25, 2,5, 3,75 and 5 meter tanks separately.

If you have parts that are identical in all but resource amounts, scale and texture, what\u0027s the harm in making them one selectable part that has those three values tweakable? If the end result is the same as if another part that those parameters pre-tweaked, what\u0027s the difference? Not seeing it. Select Jumbo-64, not cheating. Select FL-T800 Fuel Tank, change to 2.5m (that has the same resource amounts of J64) and change texture to be Jumbo-64 - cheating!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP-Parts is different as that allows a more precise scaling than stock sizes/lengths so I\u0027m not so keen on that, but I can see the appeal and wouldn\u0027t complain (a lot) if it was included.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aatch","CreatedById":98993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T03:05:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike the idea in general. However, I find the B9/Firespitter way of switching parts/models a little clunky. It\u0027s fine, and only working with the tools available, but I\u0027d prefer to see a menu, maybe like a sub-folder, for these kinds of parts. This makes it easier to see the various sub-parts ahead of time without needing add the part, flick through the options and then see if it\u0027s what you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
