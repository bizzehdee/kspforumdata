Creating a set of objectives, who accomplishes them first, etc. Once a majority are completed by a player the game is over and he won. We are planning to allow for attacks and such to happen because it would make the whole situation harder on us both. Set up a refueling station? Stolen! Megaship on its way home? Rammed!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is to do something like have all of Player 1\u0027s ships be classified as stations, all of Player 2\u0027s ships to be bases. Each player has the other player\u0027s filter disabled so fog of war becomes a thing. This generally means that things in near Kerbin orbit are relatively easy to find/detect, whereas something further out-system is going to be harder to find. Kethane and a few other things would be enabled, so refueling stations would still be real, only now you have to take care to hide them in strange locations or away from the other players area of activity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
