The announcement of the upcoming patch made me think about features I would like to have in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRocket Test Facility - Some place to test fire rockets, maybe some way to mount\u00A0the rocket and test the ship as it burns and see how \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and all that jazz is affected prior to an actual launch. I know you could just do that on the launch pad but still...A place to test certain setup and maybe earn a little science with out risking a ship exploding on the launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCities -\u00A0I really want and maybe its coming, but I really want missions to setup satellites to bounce Kerbal signals around to different cities.\u00A0Missions to establish\u00A0satellites TV/communication \u00A0network foot prints or GPS networks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I need an incentive or drive to do stuff in KSP. I love it but I am not very good at it because I get distracted. I need a reason to go to Mun. It\u0027s like legos I can build what ever I want, but what do I want to build?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can setup a GPS network of satellites but I need them to blink and flash and tell me they connected and doing something\u00A0and need to see all the fake data the sending back and forth. I know with 1.2 coming out we may be a step closer to this, and maybe a few mods will help it reach what I would like it to be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my only real problem with KSP is I feel disconnected after a while, like I am alone in the [-]world[/-] universe just\u00A0me and my Space Program of expendable Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat game other wise, love it and keep coming back to it.
