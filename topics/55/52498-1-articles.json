I have 5000 fuel left? 5000 what? Liters, gallons, cubic centimeters? Temperature is also confusing. It\u0027s impossible to tell if it\u0027s Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit. It would also be good to know what ElectricCharge is measured with. Just a simple suggestion, putting the unit of measure after a number would make things a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T18:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENutt, these threads always devolve into bickering over the perceived superiority of imperial or metric, so I\u0027ll have to close it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure the devs have mentioned before that all measurements in KSP are metric, as they themselves use metric, not being American for the most part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel can be considered to be in litres, temperature readings are in Kelvin, and Electric charge can most closely be related to Amp-hours.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
