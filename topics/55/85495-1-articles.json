Either an optional download or a separate folder in Gamedata or something.. Either way, the deprecated parts should be hidden in the editors so for people who carry over craft files can easily update their stuff and then delete the legacy parts entirely. I always start fresh on any new update anyway - entirely clean slate, not even my savefiles are transferred over, let alone crafts. An easy way to remove irrelevant stuff would be highly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T01:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMight be an easy mod to make, using module manager perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T19:04:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMight be an easy mod to make, using module manager perhaps?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, the textures and models would still load.
