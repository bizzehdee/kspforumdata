Sure, it still has some issues to iron out such as those with the auto-complete contracts in career, but it\u0027s far from unstable. I\u0027ve been using some sort of Kopernicus config in all of my playthroughs in 1.0.x KSP so far (OPM standalone, RSS, KScale2 \u002B OPM \u002B Trans-Keptunian) and have not had any issues in sandbox/science modes except one that was quickly fixed due to a small typo in the code.\n\nAs long as Kopernicus becomes more and more stable, I honestly do not really see a need for a new stock planet.

I am in favor of doing other things to improve current game play, robotics such as Canada arm anyone (yes I know there are mods, but stock stuff usually turns out better)?\n\nI would also love to see the inclusion of mini games for things such as science or maybe minor vessel repairs. KAS/KIS somewhat add this for orbital assembly of stations and ships. I enjoy being able to take useful science readings in game and transmit the findings back to Kerbin, but would like to see more than just \u0022click, take a reading\u0022. \n\n - Sample taking for example, you could have a contract to bring back a certain type of metalic sample, and to find it you need a metal detector which tells you if you\u0027re in the right location to obtain it (like the ISRU scanners do for resources).\n\n - A station based science mini game could involve blowing up things in a zero-G test chamber (\u0022testing\u0022 materials).\n\n - Astronomy anyone?

As you say, they have said nothing and we are supposed to take that as some form of information.\n\nReally, sometimes I think we would get better info about the future of the game by throwing bones and examining chicken entrails. Maybe doing the I-Ching would help or possibly putting the game on one side of a large set of scales and a duck on the other side...\n\nEDIT :\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Counter-Kerbin: a dwarf planet at Kerbol-Kerbin\u0027s L3 Lagrangian point. This would present an unusual challenge because there would be no transfer window to reach it directly.\n\nTo reach the counter-kerbin you would just thrust in the direction of orbit to get an elliptical orbit 1.5 times the length of a year. It would never change. Launch just before dawn, same time every day, straight up and achieve the same velocity at 70km and you would get there every time except when you hit the SOI of Mun or Minmus.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-06T16:59:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by John FX**"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:19:58Z","Content":"The most recent official word seems to be from the last two AMAs:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E More planets are a big maybe right now.
