We also found Pluto, Ceres, and Vesta. The only really big stuff discovered since has been beyond the orbit of Neptune. Most of the large objects discovered since then have still been found with ground-based telescopes.

I understand what you\u0027re saying though, and it would be cool to have some stock telescopes we could use to discover stars and exoplanets that aren\u0027t part of the skybox, much like we are in real life. Perhaps, once the game has reached V1.0, a DLC for interstellar travel could be made. It\u0027s the only feasible way for anything that nature to be put into the game, IMHO, as it would be incredibly OP, as is the Warp Drive in KSPI. I don\u0027t like the idea of discovering major bodies such as the planets though. Dwarf planets like Pluto and Ceres analogues would be cool to make discoverable, but a planet is pretty damn obvious in the sky you know. (Obvious enough for even the kerbals to find easily enough.)
