Just moving some of the parts around doesn\u0027t completely solve the issues since the part costs (and in some cases their specs) have already been tweaked to reflect their position in the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely. There are a lot of parts so taking a fine-tooth comb to all this stuff isn\u0027t a trivial task either, but it would go a long way to smoothing things out. I also agree on simplifying the transmission and science payout system. I\u0027d actually like to see different biomes produce different bonuses, so landing in a specific canyon might yield more science than landing any old place in the \u0027Midlands\u0027. You should really also be able to produce a biome overlay in map mode with the survey scanner.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen we get into the slightly deeper stuff like anomaly contracts and life support. I\u0027d like to see all that (and a graphics and art assets pass too), but those get\u00A0into some deep investments in development time. There are a couple of other threads on the anomalies right now. I\u0027ll be honest the existing anomalies are cute as easter eggs but don\u0027t do much for me as a real considered part of the game. I\u0027d rather see them as part of a larger system of geological landscape features players could explore, and if that were the case receiving contracts to visit specific places\u00A0would be totally great. You\u0027d want to think carefully about how this played out though. You don\u0027t want them just linearly connected, nor would it mean much if they were totally random. Maybe the contract pops up after you\u0027ve scouted it in Kerbnet? Something like that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLife support too is a bit of a doozy.

It\u0027s also about as simple as it can get and still be a challenge, and even at that you really have to carefully think things through.

At standard settings, it is fully unlockable with just Mun/Minmus - possibly just Minmus - with the result that many players go from entry level to end game and never do anything with the mid range parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor my current playthrough, I\u0027ve taken the community tech tree, added Near Future and Space Y, and stretched the costs. Up to the 300 band is about the same, meaning you can get to your first orbit without massive pain,\u00A0but the 1000 level now costs over 4000, and the end-game stuff is 24,000. Conquering the moon (SSRSS) got me some rover wheels, resulting in a science station around Mars and several surface expeditions to maximise each landing. I\u0027ve been sending resupply ships and replacement landers to the station rather than launching repeated round trip missions, because efficiency has become important. Once all the data gets processed I\u0027ll have nervas, and a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Echoice\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of pursuing 3.75m tech, or spaceplanes.

Being forced to \u0027make do\u0027 with the mid-range tech results in a more challenging game, and means I will actually get to use things that I\u0027d have simply skipped over before.
