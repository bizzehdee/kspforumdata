This means that you won\u0027t have to have an available node on a specific part so you can save almost anything usable as a subassembly. This also means that all available nodes on the subassembly should be usable when loading it into another creation, not just the one on the core part of it. This will probably be useful because otherwise you\u0027d have to constantly edit the thing you want to use as a subassembly so it\u0027s viable for subassembly usage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T19:22:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MelonHeadSeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T19:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be pretty hard with how the ships are in a tree structure.
