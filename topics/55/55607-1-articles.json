Imagine having to make an emergency on the spot command to one of the parts and you can\u0027t bloody right click on the thing because it\u0027s constantly moving about on your screen.

If you could grab the main camera reference, your ship\u0027s velocity, and the amount of atmosphere it\u0027s traveling through, you could do some clever maths and apply a random vector to the position of the camera (in the process lerping it back to its original position). This would be easily tweakable too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T11:50:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like my game to NOT shake and give me a headace, thank you very much\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T12:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would pose huge problems when you need to right click on something on the vehicle, so no thank you, this is fine enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrembling in IVA mode, however, would be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T12:32:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe new camera modes are on what not to suggest list.
