off I love all the parts of Stock KSP and am NOT suggesting adding anything to stock. \u00A0If KSP is really based of lego part theory why doesn\u0027t\u00A0Squad release more official part packs? \u00A0I love the asteroid mod but it would be nicer if the parts were themed with instructions or\u00A0pics of the intended purposes of the parts. \u00A0You can then download the part packs, put together the models and play around with them. \u00A0Then take them apart and throw all the parts in your play bin. \u00A0I know the suggestion is not the best currently as the modding community already does this\u00A0but definitely something to think about around the time of 2.0 or officially supporting mod part packs that align with Squads direction for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-12T06:49:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
