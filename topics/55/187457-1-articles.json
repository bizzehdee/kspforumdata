The contracts were already terrible,\u00A0loads of them make very little sense and if you are sick and tired of certain types of them you can\u0027t just block them - you have to manually keep declining each and every one of them forever and hope the game randomly offers something you want to do. Now that Breaking Ground introduced a number of new types of contracts this has gotten completely out of hand, I\u0027ve spent up to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eseveral minutes in a row doing nothing but declining\u00A0extremely undesired\u00A0contracts that keep respawning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E just to get a dozen good contracts of the types I have any desire to deal with.

When players call Career Mode \u0022grindy\u0022 it is more often than not primarily because of the contracts.

Using these parts for non-testing purposes should be possible, but dangerous. For example liquid engines should be tested for total burn time.

Now there is no ending, and player understands it, so the player stops proceeding and exploring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-07T16:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223737536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221581089312\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022195829\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022desert\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n28 minutes ago, desert said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart testing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a contract pack for this.
