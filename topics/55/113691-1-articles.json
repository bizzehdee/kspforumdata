This happens if you a) run drill and converter at the same time, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) mine resources faster than your converter can handle it, c) the ore bunker is full.\n\na) is common practice, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) \u0026 c) go hand in hand: when your drill outpaces the converter, the tank will fill up. Once the tank is full, the following will happen:\n\n1. ore bunker is full\n2. refinery takes 0.5 units\n3. drill sees empty space, springs into action, mines 8.5 units\n4. only 0.5 fit into the bunker\n5. the other 8 units are spilled\n\nActual units may be smaller depending on how many updates/second there are, but that doesn\u0027t touch the core of the issue. Even if a single drill can\u0027t keep up, this will happen if the player brings enough drills to keep his converter(s) busy. It only really matters on asteroids though, because bodily resources can\u0027t be depleted.\n\nI kindly propose that the drill should follow the fuel cell logic: cease operations once the bunker is 90% full. As there may be situations where the player wants to fill the bunker to 100% (e.g. mining contracts), this behaviour probably should be toggleable or linked to timewarp.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T11:28:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 11:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T15:20:35Z","Content":"Simpler solution:\n\nIn each situation, a drill has a max ore per tick it can produce and transfer.
