But one thing I noticed was that I can\u0027t receive any money instantly, which was exactly what I needed, since I only have about 4000 funds left. I suggest that in the Administrative Building, there is a tab added for loans. And if you click on it you can either apply for a loan, or manage existing loans (like pay it off immediately.). When you go apply for a loan, you can go ahead and choose how much money you want to take out, as well as the loan term. So if you take out a $1200 loan for example, and interest rate will be 4%, and the loan term is one Kerbal year. then you will pay $102.18 per 35 days (about the time of a Kerbin month when the days are divided evenly). Then you can choose your collateral. It can be either a building or an active mission (Space Station, Rocket, Spaceplane, etc.). If you go into debt and cannot repay you loan, you will be forced to sell your collateral to the bank. You cannot use it anymore until you buy it back, which you can. If your collateral either gets destroyed or isn\u0027t enough to pay back your debt, it\u0027s game over. If you\u0027re not on an active loan, then you will be forced to sell one of your buildings or active missions to the Government. You can not use it until you buy it back from them. If you sell all of your buildings and active missions to the government it\u0027s game over unless you can buy either the administrative building, the VAB and Launchpad, and/or the SPH and Runway, it\u0027s game over. Also, loan interest and value of collateral can be adjusted in the difficulty settings.
