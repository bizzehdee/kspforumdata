The big swept wings do fine for most larger ships (ISRU-carrying grand tourers, heavy tankers and space station lifters), but takeoff speeds get a bit ridiculous at the heavier end of the scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is the lack of variety. Everything built with the deltas looks Shuttle-ish (unless you mid-mount them, which gives you something like a stumpy dolphin...), everything built with the swept wings is C-17 or 747-ish.
