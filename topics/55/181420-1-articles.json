Want to move an asteroid on the cheap?Land a robotic probe with a mining drill, and what amounts to a big coil gun on it. Drill up rock and use the coil gun to throw it in whatever direction, and Newton\u0027s First Law pushes the asteroid in the other direction. Why not write this into the game? The resources would be electricity and ore, and the engine would probably look a hoop skirt attached to a box or cylinder. It would produce low thrust\u00A0like the ion engines and Nerv, but also like them would have very high efficiency and burn time. They\u0027d also be large and heavy. The animation for the \u0022drive flame\u0022 would probably be a similar to the dust clouds that the drills make when in use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T00:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223522790\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181420\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221547578393\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022151656\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zosma Procyon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Zosma Procyon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not write this into the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause it\u0027s too obscure for stock.\u00A0\u00A0 Excellent idea for a mod though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T01:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass drivers already exist in the Mining Expansion Mod\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6969011390\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130325-16-stockalike-mining-extension-099-release-111718-wip/\u0026amp;\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:227px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-16T03:21:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Asteriod Recycling Technologies ART has one as well. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E is basically stock in my book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2097244460\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/82809-13-asteroid-recycling-technologies-v090/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-17T01:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP\u0027s part catalog is based on things that happened or could have happened in the past.
