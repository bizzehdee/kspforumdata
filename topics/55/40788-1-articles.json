For example, my craft \u0022Apollo two stage lander\u0022 splits up into a lander, a station and four probes. Currently all I see is \u0022Apollo two stage lande\u0022 repeated down the list of craft for every combination. What I would like to do is grab the right hand side of that list and expand it so I can tell if my craft is a lander, probe, or station without having to go to the craft and then back to the tracking station or having to resort to names like x1-A, x1-B etc so when a suffix is added I can read it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to my second suggestion, I\u0060d like to be able to go from tracking station to craft and then back again. Currently I have to go to the space centre and then to the tracking station, an unneccesary step in my view. Also I am unable to rename a rover or any craft without a pod/probe core, being able to do that in the tracking view would be VERY handy. I\u0060d like to be able to easily find which craft in my huge list of craft are the ones I wish to \u0060terminate\u0060, being the ones without crew, from the large list of names all the same that I cannot change, or see properly, or easily examine the craft to identify it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else got any views on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T14:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of these ideas are great.
