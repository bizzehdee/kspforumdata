I\u0027m sure this wouldn\u0027t be hard to implement just use the model of the mk32-R Radial Mount Parachute, recolour the blue stripes to orange, and copy and tweak the settings of the mk25 Parachute into its settings I\u0027m sure this wouldn\u0027t be to hard to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could do this myself if I knew what program is used to change the colour of the parachute box.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommander jebidiah\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
