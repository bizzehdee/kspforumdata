This make a complete circle of them and no room to add more without stacking exactly on one another. What if you could Select all 3 sets of 8 and combine them to one piece. But unlike most suggestions with slightly worse stats for balance! (or whatever is realistic/appropriate.) Radial parts might be particularly good for this and some very basic logic could be applied to balance them correctly into one part without much work on squads part either programming or design wise. It could be all logically driven and limited to those simpler adaptations pretty easily. How much would those 24 parts, if of the same area, have as a new stats if it were one seamless part without all the overlaying sections. Just one large doughnut ring! 8) Maybe calculation logic could be put into when you combine it for the situations it could be applied. There are only so many around each type fo part like an MK1,2,or3. That would not be a lot to work out logically to implement. Is there an easy way to generate the new graphic? Or is it easier to make the graphic and merely reference it and use this sort of method as a way of getting to it besides the parts bar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even one set of 8(or anything in radial mode) selected as a new part. It could be a clever way to add more parts to the game. And a way to give people more to explore in the game as combining stuff and seeing what you could do to it could be fun. It would add a whole new dimension to the game(pun intended). Maybe it could be added later on to extend parts usefulness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, again, what should be the stats on a ring like this if it were not overlapping and one item compared to 8-24 parts crammed in with radial placement?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I would imagine a real doughnut wou\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would have less mass and air intake area becuase the material and area of collection are overlapping. I\u0027m not sure of the intake air stat. I don\u0027t know what it means well enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the intake area would be close to 8x intakes as they touch at the endges. But the air intake would be near what x16 would be as the base of the parts are then aligned where the air is collected. Maybe all stats near half the 24 at x12.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXM-G50 Radial Air Intake Doughtnut: 8x-16x(12x)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake area: 0.048-0.096(0.072)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir Intake: 4-8(6)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.1-0.2(0.15)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag: 1.6-3.2(2.4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash tolerance:....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible modded stats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake Area: 0.06\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir Intake: 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass: 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDrag: 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash tolerance: 80-160?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunway Stats: (?/?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMax Air intake: ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual air intake on runway: ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar with structural intakes could be interesting also. Especially if you could do it with only half of the body like the top or the bottom. Then you could take the bottom of and MK2 body part and make a longer single structural intake or break it into several parts and combine the parts that touch. I do that now with my landing gear in the middle. But it could be nice for saving parts counts while getting performance. I would think structural intake would be a bit different thought as it would largely stay the same or even add area intake if you did this based on the geometry it\u0027s being applied to. Where as this radial intake seems to mostly lose because it usually overlaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would assume the answer is to allow selection of parts and use the geometry to calculate new borders and apply rules to those potential outcomes. then the new area and stats can be calculated and new borders/graphics generated based on the original part. This wouldn\u0027t be too complicated for this game as it only has a few types of surfaces. The MK2 is the odd one out the rest are circumferences and the MK2 even is a circumference on radial patterns. Though I would think non circumference surface measures would be more interesting as it give more versatility along with any simple radial calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny parts that are not lined up on the y axis(the one determining whether their front to back is evenly placed to each other)can have the new part put directly in the difference of the parts applied. Or the starting and ending part and only parts on the same part can be combined. Then the new part can be dragged and moved around as you wish like normal. Or to simplify it even more, only dragged forward and backwards on a single axis from it\u0027s starting point so not to deal with changing surface curvatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules for the current parts could be applied to make how it generates the rules for the new parts. Then it\u0027s always balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything in the current game data that is or could be used as a cross section to determine shape for a sufficient reproduction like that? Are the current stats in any way based on geometry or could be used with it to make new stats and items in a new placement mode? 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine flat surfaces would be even easier than that. Or the same...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck if you generate the new item in the persons personal game based on which geometry they use you could make a basic engineering ability for people to make customized parts(sort of). It would be a good simpler stock way to do it. this on top of the fact that there are only so many parts producable if the logic is limited. Most of it would only be chosen length of geometry. And you only need so many of those if it\u0027s limited to angle snapped parts for instance(making it easy to even have some pre save parts for easier loading). Though using non angle snapped parts to be purely made from generation instead of having any permanently saved stats would be just as difficult to make I would think if the game has the capability.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T16:53:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
