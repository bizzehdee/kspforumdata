I think there is. Firstly you don\u0027t have the invent anything new, the mixtures for engines and tanks can already be changed and secondly I see a benefit to playability when resource collections comes along. Finally it will increase the educational value of the game by giving players a closer approximation to real world rocketry without making the game any less fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, I\u0027m sure at some point in the future you\u0027ll be running a balance pass on all the parts. At that point reconfigure the liquid engines to require the new ratio of 2, it\u0027s a nice clean number that is closer to the real world and has the advantage of needing double the oxidizer (easy numbers to work with). Then change the fuel tank parts to match the new ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a more advance change, link the fuel into the research system, so that LH/LOX equivalent engines and tanks can be researched (either are new parts or changes to existing parts) that would have the 5 ratio and an increase in ISP and cost to represent the more efficient fuel and the complexity of storing it. If and when teakables come in you can use the research to unlock the tweakable option to change to the more advanced engine and different ratio in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woppeldopple","CreatedById":74678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T12:01:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a good reason to introduce units, too!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E90 \u0022fuel\u0022 doesnt tell me anything! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T12:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHigher fuel ratios mean less dV in rocket designs, and increasing ISP just makes the parts that much less realistic (the ISP\u0027s of the engines are the real life ISP\u0027s of the engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022woppeldopple\u0022 data-cite=\u0022woppeldopple\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E90 \u0022fuel\u0022 doesnt tell me anything! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are given the amount of fuel burned per second, and knowing how much fuel you have gives you a rough idea on what you can do with the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"woppeldopple","CreatedById":74678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T12:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are given the amount of fuel burned per second, and knowing how much fuel you have gives you a rough idea on what you can do with the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh really?
