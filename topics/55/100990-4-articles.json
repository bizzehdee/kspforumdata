We\u0027d have to test, but at 30k a shot (and 1 science), and no time passing in Mission Control, you can fill the bank account in no time if you can stand the clicking (I just checked, the munar contracts are ~70k, and 2 science). We are told that science over time is bad, because players will just warp past the time. SO WHAT! The time then passes. The other contracts or goals that actually have time limits MATTER for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo time-based contracts for funds (science/funds per unit time)---the mere existence of them---instantly make time matter with no KCT-like stuff at all. Note that they need not make X funds per minute, and Y science, they\u0027d make maybe 5,000 fund per MONTH, and 0.5 science (or whatever). Yeah, you can warp ahead, but if all the contracts (and the early explore goals at the least) have reasonable time limits, then it is self-defeating. You could take rep hits (assuming it is made to matter) for every X months with no launches, possibly as another mechanism to curtail serious abuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would this play?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay the starting career fund rewards are low, and players actually struggle a little with funds (hard to imagine now) after rebalancing. Then a few contract types that pay a few thousand per month exist. You might only be allowed so many based upon facility upgrades (another balance tweak method). So our player now has nearly no funds after a tragic accident involving poor Jeb, but needs 20k to build a rocket for what he wants to do next (mission already selected). He has a satellite in orbit can make that 20k in 4 months of collecting data. He time warps---but 1.0 is supposed to have skip to node, so it uses THAT, 1 click, 4 months pass---and he can can now do the next mission because he has the funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat extra click or clicks to skip ahead is less grind than the clickfest of taking the same contract now (which pays better), and time actually passes. Make these contracts useful enough that they effectively fund an annual program a few thousand at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a time mechanism that uses nothing not already in the game, and succeeds entirely because it is a beneficial strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T06:05:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 06:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T06:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA \u0022grind\u0022 is doing something you don\u0027t like very much, knowing you will eventually progress toward an upgrade or activity you like more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet, if the activity you like better - is the same contract type, just in a different place: that also ought to get boring with too much repetition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysical \u0022grind\u0022 is reduced by increased pay, or decreased costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPerceptual \u003C/em\u003E\u0022grind\u0022 could be reduced by more variety of available activities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T06:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m weird but I can\u0027t get enough Survey contracts.

It\u0027d help solve some of the exploiting of using the same vessel for multiple orbits. Yes, you could timewarp those days and complete the contract, but if you do, you\u0027re no better off or further on than if it was for 10 seconds, so it doesn\u0027t matter. But, as I said, it\u0027d help exploits and seem a bit more reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The \u0027Explore X\u0027 contracts shouldn\u0027t follow a progression and be unavailable at times the game chooses.

Looks like you\u0027ll have to do more of the same and more and more and more and more until you have the money. Cutting the R\u0026amp;D upgrade price by 50% would be a good start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Monthly (governmental?) funding is needed, with the amount given calculated from various achievements. Use and expand the internal progress tracking and the UT timestamp to see what\u0027s been done in the last 30 days and award funds (no science) based on that. Do nothing? Get nothing. Do loads of things? Get funding. If you timewarp on a trip out to Jool, you\u0027re no better or worse off for it. Unless you actually do something in that time, you won\u0027t end up rolling in money and you won\u0027t end up in debt, you\u0027ll end up exactly as you left off.

It\u0027s effect is negligible now, so any change would be an improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- How to stop this government funding being OP? What\u0027s to stop you launching 30 Mun missions, 5 solar ejections, farming Minmus for Science and then getting a bajillion Funds in the first month? Some kind of construction time, that\u0027s what. Make things take, maybe not a week, but at least some days. Enough for you to do a few missions a month, at least. Obviously, the funding you get would have to be more than the launch costs at the very least, so running out of funds shouldn\u0027t really happen. As long as you do things, you\u0027ll get Funds. Pretty simple. And it\u0027s self policing too - say you build up multiple cheap and small copies of the same craft and put them in LKO. Sure, you get your costs covered at the end of the month, but you\u0027ve still only achieved LKO (add on diminishing returns on top) so you\u0027re not going to get that much bonus. And now you have a bunch of useless junk in orbit that you wasted your money on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The strategies are.. basic, to say the least.

I mean it like, the player says basically \u0027I\u0027m going to Duna, anyone want anything?\u0027 Various agents then present contracts related to that. Say, Rockomax will give you 20% discount on their parts for it at the cost of -5% rep if you use Kerbodyne parts. Or Probododyne asks you to test their engine there. Or R\u0026amp;D will give a percentage increase on Science experiments done there. Also, the government funding could take this into account - if you say you\u0027re off to Duna, the funding is increased or you get an advance for a month, long enough to build whatever thing you want to take there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, its not third party companies hiring you to put metal into space, you decide the direction next. You decide what you want to do and then various companies ask to be a part of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there\u0027d be an overall tracking thing as well like if you take lots of succesive Rockomax contracts, you get a permanent discount on the parts.

Contracts are the core of Career Mode because they\u0027re the only way to obtain funds but right now they don\u0027t feel like they have a lot of purpose to them\u003Cem\u003E other\u003C/em\u003E than giving you money. And as ObsessedWithKSP pointed out, they might as well all be given by the same company. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, making the contracts more engaging would improve the whole game by providing some context and narrative for your space program. Better flavour text would be a first step towards that by giving different companies more personality and providing a reason for the contracts they hand out (beyond the ever-popular checking whether Kerbin\u0027s day is exactly 6 hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond - linked contracts. Somebody has already mentioned this with regards to space stations but I think it could be applied to pretty much all the contract types. For example, Sean\u0027s Cannery hire you to put a communication satellite into kerbostationary orbit - which you do. Some time later they come back with a second contract for you to help with their booming telecoms business by putting another kerbostationary satellite up for them (at a different longitude). Some time later still, they want an update to their satellite fleet and \u0027because Sean\u0027s Cannery is an environmentally friendly company - even in space\u0027 they want you to deorbit one of the old sats first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, little mini-stories like that would add a sense of progression to my space program and a sense that I was building up a space infrastructure for kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally - time. Have stuff take time to build. Again, just my opinion, but having played around with KCT, it does give your space program more of an epic feel, rather than \u0027Day 1 - launched Jeb to 6,000 m.... day 4 - went to the Mun. If the entire pad crew hadn\u0027t taken Sunday off, we could have gotten there on day 3.\u0027 It should also make contracts a bit more engaging by making their expiry dates a bit more meaningful and potentially having the player juggle conflicting priorities and overlapping contracts. Plus it opens up the possibility of time-critical contracts. Rescue this kerbal within 5 days, get supplies to this station by the end of the month - that kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T13:37:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- The \u0027Explore X\u0027 contracts shouldn\u0027t follow a progression and be unavailable at times the game chooses.

As the tech tree progresses, the tech becomes more powerful and/or efficient engines and larger fuel tanks. Both of which are major factors in how far from KSC you can get, specifically how much fuel you can move around (power and size) and how much fuel you need to move around (efficiency). As the VAB, SPH, runway, and launch pad progress they increase the size of a vehicle that can be launched, again increasing range. As the admin and mission control buildings are improved the speed at which funds are gained is improved.

To balance the contracts, towards my assumption of what aspects the devs are trying to balance and what they consider balanced, the availability of Science currency should be completely removed from contracts forcing Science harvesting via parts and reports, and the buildings at their various tiers should be more restrictive.
