But I think the parts for rovers are a little lacking. Such as the wheels. Now I like mods, but some of them like to conflict from my \u0027Must have\u0027 mods. Omni wheels are out of the question. Why not more wheels like dual tired wheels, and curiosity rover wheels. While at it, why not special types of solar panels and cosmetic camera/ science equipment. more body parts, cosmetic mining equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like mods but they like to conflict with other good mods. How about that? I personally think it\u0027d be great to have more rover specific parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, why not its own hanger? When you press \u0027Launch\u0027 there\u0027d be a little testing track. A small little pool to test buoyancy, some little cliffs to test the strength of the rover, and inclines. Obviously it\u0027d have to have turns to test how well and stable you rover runs. And it\u0027d have to be large for those monster sized rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think? I personally love to see this implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T00:31:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much all of this stuff has been suggested quite a few times in the past. Granted, that doesn\u0027t make them bad suggestions, just a bit redundant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, they\u0027re undoubtedly going to add more rover parts at some point but for the time being they\u0027ve got bigger fish to fry. That gigantimo fish being career mode, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test track thing has been suggested before, too and I\u0027ve always thought it was a good idea. Could be little bumpy areas, ramps of varying length and inclination, rocky/unevenly bumpy areas and so on. Would just be fun, though with subassemblies right around the corner, I think a rover/payload assembly building might be kind of needless since you\u0027ll be able to build things with mirror symmetry in the spaceplane hangar then load them as a subassembly into the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
