Both physically and in quantity. If more is needed multiple tanks can be added but it\u0027s so large now it consumes a lot of the design space that would be better served for LFO and in most cases you won\u0027t need that much mono-propellant for a plane. My suggestions is to make it roughly the size of the Mk II probe core and reduce it\u0027s quantity to a fitting amount for that size.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T14:53:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T14:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...which is also the size that Mk2 decouplers and SAS units should be.

Not really a fan of decouplers for Mk II personally but I don\u0027t have any arguments against them either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can see the current Mk II monoprop tank would be useful for is the O-10s, but with the proposed probe core sized mono prop tank with a 75 unit capacity, you could simply stack 4 of them and get back to where the current tank is now so it would be much more versatile. 300 monoprop is just way to much for simple docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-09T15:34:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2014 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T21:26:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI modded a pair of decouplers for the Mk2 and they work really work for a jury-rigged escape system. 300 units of Mono is indeed to much.
