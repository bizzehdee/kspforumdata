The basic idea for any endgame goal in KSP should be to make the player explore most of the system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t know if that should (or would) ever be in the core game, a mod that did something like this could be really fun. Put a bunch of tech in an inaccessible tech node, and then randomly place items throughout the system. Once you find the item, it is moved from the hidden tech node to node 0 and you can use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould make for a fun way to play at least a few times, methinks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T23:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pulstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pulstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- kerbal skills/experience\u003Cp\u003E- life support (possibly as a \u0022higher difficulty\u0022 toggle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- heatshields and re-entry heat (possibly as a \u0022higher difficulty\u0022 toggle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- payload fairings and improved aerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say that those are still planned, but all have been discussed as having at least some dev interest. I only remember life support being discussed by the devs in a receptive manner back when the ISRU chart was being discussed because some of the resources were tagged for life support use, so I certainly wouldn\u0027t get my hopes up for that, or anything else on that list for that matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll agree with those that say that multiplayer isn\u0027t high on their list (of non-career-mode related mechanisms, the four you mentioned are probably top picks as well), about all I\u0027d want to use it for would be with some kind of observer mode so that I can help people new to KSP. On the other hand, I\u0027ve been around long enough to remember a time before multiplayer was officially discussed, and it was requested fairly often, so I can accept that I don\u0027t know whether or not I\u0027m in the majority.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tmbrodie","CreatedById":114176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T00:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PwnedDuck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PwnedDuck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI desperately hope it\u0027s something other than career mode.

When you\u0027re limited in access to tech by the science tree, there is a discipline to learning to use what you have \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eeffectively\u003C/span\u003E so that when you\u0027re in a much more difficult place you can both construct and execute an appropriate solution. There\u0027s also the development of how we think about that tech in its limitations and application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, (for me) I found that the lack of parts early in the science tree caused great challenge in landing on Mun and Minmus, especially when trying to land within a hundred meters of a previous landing site. The skills gained in doing this mini goal enabled better understanding and appropriate skills to accomplish the mechanics of orbital rendezvous. If I tried the latter without the former, then it was only somewhat through luck that it got done. Kind of scratching my head... hmmm how did I get that done again? Having an early tree contract offered to do a Minmus landing would have gently moved me to that sooner, and I would have advanced faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would be fun for me would be to have a more open end game after the science tree career that wouldn\u0027t open up until the tree was done. Even if it was, there would be no point as to \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eactually\u003C/span\u003E play the end game would require skills and thinking that would be absent if you hadn\u0027t climbed the tree via appropriate contracts/goals. I mean, the initial value of watching someone\u0027s YT of how to do something often results in first saying, \u0022what, you can do that?!\u0022 Then a time where you can\u0027t even get there to try it out yet, let alone get any traction on what the person was demonstrating. Then finally you get there, and wow, that demo was actually very awesome \u0027cause it made the whole difference to my success!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo totally resonate with your idea of \u0022more to do\u0022 -- its what I also envision as this end game.
