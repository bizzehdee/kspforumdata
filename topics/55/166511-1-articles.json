We\u0027ve had VR for well over a year now, and although the game market is still\u00A0small, there are quite a few sims which already fit into the \u0022I can\u0027t play this without VR anymore\u0022 category. And with future performance boosts from hardware, and better resolution and field of view to come, the VR future is bright enough. Heck, the present isn\u0027t bad either with such gems like IL-2, Elite Dangerous, many car sims which are a lot better than what could\u0027ve been expected from this first generation. So why not KSP as well?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore you ask, yes, I\u0027ve played the KPS 1.1.3 VR mod. Yes it\u0027s slow, buggy and clunky. But I\u0027ve put RasterPropMonitor and I\u0027ve made Mun and Minmus landings with it. And boy, what a ride it was. Vomit inducing yes (because of the bugs and low fps), but still a heck of a ride. I did have a lot of experience with \u0022interior only\u0022 flights and I am a good KOS user.\u00A0I didn\u0027t manage to put a first person camera mod, so I was robbed of a bit of EVA fun, but overall, it sold me completely to the idea of Kerbal VR. If the devs would manage to make a proper VR implementation, it wouldn\u0027t just be a gimmick, it would be awesome. So let\u0027s talk implementation...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EDifficulty of implementing: \u003C/strong\u003Eit would require a lot of effort, but it would open up the sales to the hungry VR market, so, if it\u0027s done properly, it would pay for itself easily. Kerbal is already a fantastic educational game and sim in itself. I mean, how many people ended up buying the pretty basic (so far) Elite Dangerous, just to be able to play one more title in VR? How much did the IL-2 sales jump when it became apparent it was the best VR game? And there have already been VR fans keen on making it KSP VR happen (see the VR mod which is 1 year old). Hire one of those. And don\u0027t think twice about making it cost a few extra bucks. I\u0027d buy it in a second. With thousands of hours played\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EPerformance:\u003C/strong\u003E Kerbal isn\u0027t exactly a light\u00A0game on the processors. With VR requiring 90fps, yeah... Realism Overhaul wouldn\u0027t be an option... but most of us have been here in the beta days, struggling with limited RAM and constant crashes. Things improve. Computers improve. By the time Kerbal ends its shelf life,\u00A0we might be in the 2nd generation of VR, sitting on 200 of extra fps, even with a ton of mods loaded. So as long as the devs manage to crack the Unity VR cookie and provide decent performance for the vanilla game with the current hardware, it should all be fine in the end and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E compatible in a few years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- \u003Cu\u003EWorld scale\u003C/u\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMake it customizable from the start.\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0Is that underlined enough for you? For example, in the VR mod for KPS 1.1.3, the world is very \u0022realistically\u0022 scaled. So that means that everything is scaled to a kerbal. So it\u0027s tiny \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0, with the interiors being very claustrophobic. Just add a slider from the start, to allow people to make the Kerbal 1m high, or human scaled. Also make sure to put the skybox as far away as possible, lest you end up with a bad 3D like Elite Dangerous has (and has yet to fix grrrr).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E while I am happy with RPM and KOS, most users might not be. An interior-only game would be sad to see. We need everything to work, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, map, the lot. Probes should really get an optional \u0022probe control room\u0022 interior variant, but 3rd person camera would still have to work. And first person kerbals are a must (with better control btw). Mouse cursor should work flawlessly (think DCS in VR). There are enough implementation options for game interfaces to get inspiration from. All in all, the game should needs to work\u00A0normally, as it does now, with head orientation and 3D being there just to improve the overall experience. All normal mods shouldn\u0027t be rewritten from scratch. And non-VR modders shouldn\u0027t worry about their addon not working in VR. However....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- Gameplay 2:\u003C/strong\u003E Consider just how far people have gone with the whole addon stuff... moddable interface?... BAM! 1000 mods. One of them is RasterPropMonitor, which is a gem in itself and lovingly maintained. But it needs to be vanilla. Sure, VR would bring more modders to RPM and expand it somewhat, but if the vanilla game itself brings a clever way to display monitors and create an interface \u00A0layer for it (plus the controls), imagine what mods would come out. Now imagine the other \u0022exterior\u0022 mods, such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. How would VR work with that? My point is that any help from the devs, any amount of work they put in the vanilla game, would be improved by modders. Just give them a solid\u00A0VR base to build on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- Interiors:\u003C/strong\u003E well... this has to be done anyway, doesn\u0027t it? There is no lack of talented modders to create amazing interiors for the crafts. The issue is different: movement. If the devs manage to make a proper movement in the interior of bases and crafts (vanilla parts), with docking ports, doors, artificial gravity, zero gravity, sitting down in a seat, using a particular prop to do something (science experiment, eat, repair, \u00A0etc)\u00A0the modders would be able to go crazy with the interiors and that would be benefit everybody (not just VR users).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- Hand controllers:\u003C/strong\u003E meh... I have a Vive but I keep my controllers pretty far from my HOTAS, if you get my drift. But controller support would be able to make an interesting EVA control and be really fun to grab\u00A0objects and build in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. But I\u0027ll pass, I think that a more important aspect would be the movement and camera controls, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- Movement and camera controls:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI guess most of us use (or have used) a first person EVA mod or another. What I would like to see is a \u0022helmet\u0022 effect, with a visible visor, maybe some form of light filter to dim out the extra bright Mun surface. Rotating your head \u0022inside\u0022 the helmet is the way to go. I\u0027ve played enough VR first person games to know that you should keep it as simple and basic as possible for keyboard and mouse controls. I suggest moving independent from the head position. Rotating the kerbal should be done with keys or mouse, not with the head. Headbobbing and ragdolling your kerbals from the top of a Minmus cliff should be minimized as much as possible. One other problem is the speed at which craft rotate. That can be fixed with various mods (limiting Gforces, or reaction wheel forces). But other effects, such as cockpit shaking can be kept. They\u0027d provide a nice feedback and make life difficult for the pilot, trying to press the small buttons while the craft is shaking like hell.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-14T02:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVirtual reality would also be perfect for use in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karamazovnew","CreatedById":63072,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-14T02:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223194439\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022166511\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221507948148\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180784\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DAL59\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, DAL59 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVirtual reality would also be perfect for use in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wouldn\u0027t make it \u0022easier\u0022, but I\u0027ve recently built my Lego Saturn 5, so yeah... totally agree.

A simple list would do better in VR, instead of the current 3D version of that mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I have a decent VR computer, with a GTX 1070 and a Q6700 processor at 4.4 GHZ. With my modded Kerbal (no graphics mods, but all settings turned to max), I get around 150-180 fps in external cameras, and between 80-120 in interior camera with some really cool RPM cockpits. So VR with a supersampling of around 2.0 should work just fine for me, as it already is. I\u0027d probably turn down a few graphics options here and there and I\u0027d probably have issues around big bases/stations. But the VR mod for 1.1.3 was way lower than normal, with framerates in the 20-40 region. Camera movement was fine, but doubling was a huge issue. I have no idea if that\u0027s a Unity problem\u00A0or not. If it is, than it might be a nail in the coffin, no matter how much the devs would want to make VR.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the bright side:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- most VR games today have framerate issues.

KSP could be a great entry level VR game if you could stabilize the camera or lower sensitivity and make it run on phones. Then sell KSP VR as a DLC or an option, like Elite: Dangerous. As for making money, sell it as a PSVR game with a higher price than the base game. You could also sell it on phones in a few years. If this game can run on my laptop at 1.9 GHz at 60 fps, so can VR on a phone at 90 fps. In terms of money, Squad could start a Patreon. I for sure would happily give money for KSP VR, and I don\u0027t even own a Vive or a Rift!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, don\u0027t start a flame war. \u003Csub\u003E\u003Csup\u003EPlease.\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E I just wanted to counter some of your points, nothing more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
