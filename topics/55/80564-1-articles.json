I have found myself avoiding repetitive missions to sample Kerbin or the Mun, in favour of attempting challenges, and some of these have taught me new strategies for spacecraft construction. Great stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say, their progression seems a little odd...I would have expected some more basic challenges for new players that might help them learn (such as an EVA on the surface of Kerbin, and a soil sample from the surface of Kerbin). This could be implemented as the basic first mission set, before going on to the randomly generated or selected challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only suggestion regarding this new feature, and what it adds, was that it made me replay the game from scratch, which was fun, BUT it made me think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we have some sort of cinematics, an inset window or cutaway to the mission control room (the kerbals are so damned cute, i\u0027d love to see an inset window with a cheering mission control room), or even just some sort of sound effect or pop up messages from mission control (surely very easy to add) when for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou achieve your first orbital flight around kerbin. It seems like a milestone in kerbin space history, so shouldn\u0027t there be a wee cheer? I know for 99% of players who know the game, this is probably nothing, but I know that new players will be very pleased with themselves when they get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou achieve either your first orbit around Mun, or landing on Mun...after all, it\u0027s a famous \u0022one small step for kerbal, one small step for kerbalkind\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou successfully return from your first Mun landing to kerbal. Time to wave the stars \u0026amp; stripes (insert flag of your choice), get the ticker tape parade, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest that probably landing or landing \u0026amp; returning from other worlds would trigger the same sort of \u0022events\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I think rescuing your first kerbal should be another similar milestone, after all it\u0027s the sort of thing that would be in a movie...brings a tear to the eye when they all group hug on the kerbals return to kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know the player will cheer their own achievements, but I think it would be nice for the game to cuddle the player a little bit more...and even better if it means we get to see some kerbal characters and animations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T04:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello Red Cloud and welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a forum subsection for suggestions and feedback, and this thread has been moved there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
