However, to answer your question, kerbonaut101, there is no plan to publish a public roadmap for future updates. There is a lot that can change during a development cycle. Unless clearly noted otherwise, such as HarvesteR\u0027s article about what he has in mind in 0.24, SQUAD wants to make sure that what is stated to be in the game, will, in fact, be implemented. There are certain long term goals, like budgets, contracts and multiplayer that have been laid out publicly and will see release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
