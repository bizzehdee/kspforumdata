Not all biome-specific science happens on the surface of celestial bodies though. There are a few experiments that are biome-specific when flying in an atmosphere and a few when orbiting in space. As such biome-specific data could be gotten from Jool and Kerbol... if they had biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a surface doesn\u0027t mean there aren\u0027t any specific areas on a celestial body. Kerbol has clear sun spots, which would be different from the rest of the molten surface and would be interesting subjects for study. Jool has various zones, belts and bands just like Jupiter and one can even detect a few individual storms (although none are as awe-inspiring as the Great Red Spot of Jupiter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in conclusion: biome-specific experiments would be possible on Jupiter and Kerbol and both bodies have individual features that could be used as biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
