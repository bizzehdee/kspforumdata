I can only image how impossible it will be to set up a precise orbit in the console versions. \u00A0Having the altitudes always showing would definitely help out, when using the flight controls in map mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T01:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould be a keypress for it, you\u0027re right.
