If the fuel tank is larger than the engine it results in a shroud that is too small which makes the shroud look very odd in the ship. My suggestion is when you place a small engine such as the rockomax 48-7S under a larger fuel tank the engine shroud should be the same width as the fuel tank. I think this would make rockets look much better. I hope that one day this will be implemented.
