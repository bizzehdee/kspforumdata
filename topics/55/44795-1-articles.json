Rockets getting postponed constantly due to shifts in the wind and/or weather. Spending our day waiting for this thing to launch only for it to be postponed a day later. This got me thinking what if the same scenario was introduced in Kerbal Space Program... Dynamic weather and wind... Hmm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain how the system would work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom Day 0, the day you start a new career/profile - The weather is calm, normal, a perfect day for launching. It will stay this way for a while. This is to make sure launching a rocket is simple as can be, and can help newcomers get a feel of rockets. Let\u0027s say several weeks later (What do you think?), the system should start kicking in. You\u0027ll be getting winds that may affect how you launch, and launching during heavy winds can be fatal. Rain and cold may foul your launch. Fog can obstruct your vision. Lightning storms would make a risky launch. Tornadoes and floods may wipe your rocket off the launch pad. Tsunamis too. (KSC is close to a ocean after all, right?) Weather can be different for every planet. For example, Duna may have dust storms that can make it hard to see, aswell as volcanoes erupting, and should your craft tred too close, be melted. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m sorry if this was already suggested, but I just thought of this and sounded like a very neat idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptus86","CreatedById":81284,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T13:34:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea...
