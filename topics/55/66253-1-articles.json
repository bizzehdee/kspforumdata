(for example, I\u0027ve launched a Mark 1-2 Command pod up with 1 random Kerbal in it, reverted it back to the VAB because I did something wrong, and when I launch it again it will have 3 in it; when I needed the spare slots...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I can just check the crew before launching, but my memory isn\u0027t the best...
