The flat edge is for attaching more wing sections. If it werent like that, the Structural A and B would be only one section (as they are the same, but rotated 90 degrees) of wing. I don\u0027t know the design reasons for that (it seems it has to do with stock aerodynamics handling), but if the leading edges were removed we would have a lot of styrofoam planks lying around (visually, at least). On the other hand, the leading edges visually help to know what direction should they face to generate lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey look nice for spaceplanes when used normally, so I don\u0027t complain on their looks.
