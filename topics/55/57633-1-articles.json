Particularly when you \u0022review\u0022 data. This might be because having 50\u002B reports at once is somewhat unusual? But with the mechanic that you can move data around I\u0027d think this might get more common as you gather everything into a single pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have a list, rather than having to cycle through everything one by one. Would make it easier to weed out duplicates (though it\u0027s not necessary since storage is unlimited).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Keep data\u0022 button moves, depending on if there\u0027s a \u0022Process\u0022 button.
