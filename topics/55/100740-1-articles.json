Not only did it add much smaller and sharper features that were fun to navigate to and around, but it also increased the realism of the Mun immensely. In the real world, we find that nearly all solid surfaces are *totally* covered with craters unless:\n\nthere is a thick atmosphere protecting the surface (like on Earth, Titan and Venus), or \n\nthe surface is very young, and subject to a lot of dynamic processes (like on Io, Europa).\n\nAs it stands now, the terrain on almost all bodies is very rolling and there aren\u0027t very many interesting features to visit that are in close proximity... making rover rides on Duna, for example, a tad bit tedious. \n\nKSP should therefore add procedurally generated craters to the other bodies, and very the crater density and sizes where appropriate. It would add more interesting terrain to explore, hazards to avoid, and increase overall realism. \n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T23:46:40Z","Content":"Yes, all airless bodies should be cratered"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T00:03:43Z","Content":"All airless bodies should be cratered.
