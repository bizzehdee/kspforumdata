The aft protective cover/fairing would only be necessary if the drag model gets updated. What the in-game LES needs is a built-in decoupler so it can be jettisoned once the rocket is near space in an almost circular orbit. I also find it kinda sad that the LES is not available in career mode until Tier 6, when it should have been available in tier 2 or 3 (so, an LES for the mk 1 module), when players are still probably making rockets that fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only 2-man capsule currently in the game is the Mk2 Lander-can, and the regular capsules go from 1 to 3 crew. I\u0027d like a 2-man capsule earlier in the Tech tree along with docking ports so that we can do Apollo-like landers early (ie- first. Though I\u0027d like to be sending probes before a Kerbal ever hits orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-6 man capsules can be done already by adding Hitchhiker Storage Containers to a regular capsule, but it is a rather large behemoth at that point. The Mk1-2 capsule looks like the orion capsule to me, except with the limit of 3 crew. Also, do we really need more conical command modules? I think I\u0027d rather have a 4-man version of the lander can for space stations and base building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I do like the idea for being able to limit the part counts or some better ways of sorting the parts in the SPH and VAB, even without mods it gets annoying to be constantly tabbing all over the place to build a simple rocket (HINT: put fuel lines and space-tape as the first item in their sections. I could do a whole paragraph on re-sorting the VAB).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd mission emblems would be cool, and I bet people would also love a flag editor/emblem maker too... but that might be too much. Maybe we need an external mission-patch maker on the KSP website or something? Stock it with images of each planetary body, a star field, orbital stripe... well now I\u0027m just listing all the things I had to go make for my own flag editing...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BLUESTREAK","CreatedById":103065,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T11:06:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a 2 man capsule is most glaring; every time I launch something in the early game I feel like I\u0027m jumping a logical step from Mercury to Apollo. A Mk1 scale escape tower would be extremely useful, and could be backed up with a SRB to fill the gap between the sepratron and the dustbin of explosives you get at the start - far too overpowered for that stage of the game, in my opinion. It would also fill a gap in the \u0026gt;0.5m SRB range.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hanno","CreatedById":72949,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T11:40:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Baythan\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that I could use the 2 man lander for a gemini capsule and the hitchhiker for a MPCV capsule but since they are made for non atmospheric areas there should be real 2 and 4 man capsules.
