Some of them are even almost impossible like testing an SRB in Orbit or a Mainsail while splashed down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also saw someone posting a Picture where he had to test a Jet engine on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about you divide the parts into categories like rocket engines, landing struts or fueltanks to give those parts more ... reasonable testing situations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Testing the Landing strut with a 5tonne Craft dropped from 1000m with a mk16 parachute\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Testing an Engine in Flight/on Ground\u0022 (not just at certain Speeds and altitude that when the TWR of the Engine would be too low)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Guzzling a fueltank empty in a certain amount of time to test the plumbing\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other Contracts worked perfectly fine for me and I think they give you a nice Storyline, like landing on the Mun and bringing Science back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the Science involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting a Part is of course something that belongs in the Process of Research and Developement. So my Suggestion is to bring those two elements closer together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about you have to BUY the technodes with funds. Because what is the reason that makes you develope a Nuclear Engine because you brought Rocks from the Mun back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be more plausible that you gain your Funds by taking contracts from Laboratories and bringing back Science from different Planets and Muns which gives you the opportunity to spend them on the developement of more powerful rocketparts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeveloping something also costs time and you have to wait a couple of days/weeks/months until your can use your part. BUT, you can test the parts in developement through a contract that gives you Access to the part but the downside would be that the Prototypes cost you extra or that they tend to fail after a certain amount of time (Damage can be fixed with a Kerbal on EVA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats about it, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont want to rip .24 into shreds or anything but I want to share my thoughts with you. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T13:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother Idea that came to my mind while I was playing KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about you have your Astronauts work in the R\u0026amp;D Facility to help out with their Experience they gathered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I saw a documentary the other day that described how the apollo astronauts worked together with the engineers and designers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork_werewolf","CreatedById":90749,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T14:08:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the parts tests are there for people running low on funds. If you can\u0027t afford to go the the mun how can you get the money to go to the mun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only impossible tests the things like the launch stabilizers being tested on the Mun. Getting a mainsail to be splashed down is a new type of building test and requires lateral thinking. Do you need to build a rocket or can you rover it to the sea and test it there? Engines and the such don\u0027t even need fuel to be tested. I will say I once get a test a S3 KS-25x4 Engine Cluster (9.75 tons unfueled) on Minmus. It was a bit ridiculous but would have got me 300k just for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might like to see a buy cost of new technologies as well as the science cost. You could unlock the part you wanted and leave the rest in the technology group till you have more money. It would also give people something to do with all their money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that there are deadlines for contracts I can see the point in having a \u0022design\u0022 time for new technologies but it could still get annoying. Also if you have 5 year deadlines what is stopping you just accelerating time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
