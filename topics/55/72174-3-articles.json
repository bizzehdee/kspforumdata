Building large wings out of 50 parts each (which by necessity forces design of smaller spaceplanes), when they could easily be created out of a single \u0022Stockized\u0022 procedural wing part, and having Mk3 cockpits that have a screwy offset from other 2.5 meter parts doesn\u0027t help with either point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see a day where, with both spaceplanes and rockets, players don\u0027t need to make use of 120 stock parts to build heavy lifters- they can build the same designs with 40 or 50 parts... (easily possible with \u0022Stockization\u0022 of some of the features in the Procedural Parts and Procedural Dynamics mods...)
