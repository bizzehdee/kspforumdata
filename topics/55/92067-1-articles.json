Therefore there are MANY situations where players can potentially benefit from this feature in a 100% stock game (in fact, the ONLY new case that mods enable is the marginal case of being able to build electric propeller planes to fly around on Duna and Eve- but rocket and stock ion planes already work perfectly well for this purpose...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MKI\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MKI\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve done a couple Polar Missions, whith a whole base setup via Airlines.
