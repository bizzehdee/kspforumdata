I believe I have a method of doing so. Basically, some new parts with the old textures (smoothed out, but staying true to the original textures)\u00A0would be added as cheap, low-tech items for an\u00A0early\u00A0space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETCFF-01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cheap\u00A0but heavy\u00A0fuel tank.
