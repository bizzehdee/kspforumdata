Sure, it generated lift, but lift in and of itself is not really useful, especially when it was compensated for even in previous versions by lag and drag.\n\nWhat I\u0027m asking for, with respect to stacked wings - is not a return to exploitable lift. Stacked wings should either be mergable into larger wings with the same lift and drag characteristics as large wing parts, or have both drag and lift removed. Or the aero model should calculate protection from the airflow by the leading edge of the wing.\n\nPreviously, wing parts were used to build fuselage shells around aircraft. This is only marginally possible now. Again, the largest issue is that the aero model bluntly takes wing parts as an attempt to exploit, not create. And again, it doesn\u0027t pay attention (either in lift or drag) to part merging and stacking, even in the right direction.\n\n\\*removed paragraph\\*\n\nNevermind, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on with the thread title.
