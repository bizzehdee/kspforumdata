Normally you would either have to return the rover to kerbin for 100% science points or you would have to cope with a reduced percentage of science. Lets say 15% of the initial science value. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough if you took the time to bring a comsat in orbit around duna that can relay the signal, it\u0027s value would be 40% if it was to bounce straight from the rover to the duna comsat back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf however you have a comsat or spacestation orbiting Kerbin, it could be used to further boost the signal and science value of the transmission to 60%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a comsat to \u0022work\u0022 it has to have atleast 2 transmitters and either solarpanels or a RTG, guaranteeing it would always have power even when its not \u0022loaded\u0022 in memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe percentages calculation could also be calculated by having the longest distance between 2 points of the chain being the determining factor. Atmospheres also add a modifier to this distance to balance it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can mean its better for a rover to wait until a comsat is flying over closely or to wait until the position of the planets is the closest when trying to get the maximum science from a transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso this encourages the player to bring satellites into orbit in the same plane as the surface operations so that the distance between rover and comsat is the smallest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reduce waiting times and having to make sure multiple satellites align it is also possible to add multiple comsats into the same orbit, this will increase coverage and make sure there is always the \u0022shortest\u0022 distance used for transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis system could also reduce the amount of power required per transmission. (or increase the amount required when there are no comsats around)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheres would also have an impact on energy costs, so a transmission from ike would be \u0022cheaper\u0022 then a transmission from Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComsats could also enable the requirement for line of sight when transmitting, so if you are exploring the rear of the mun you would need a comsat in order to allow transmissions in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo provide full coverage you would then need at least 3 satellites in the same orbit to ensure there is always a line of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these ideas are currently relying on a instant transmission, though i could also imagine satellites being able to store a transmission and wait with sending until their position is more optimal, either automatically or by the management of the player. Though this would make things a lot more complicated for the beginning player.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-18T01:46:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2013 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MissStabby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think adding transmission delay (which I believe is already planned) as well as as scaling the initial science value with distance (I believe it is random ATM) would be fantastic additions to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MissStabby","CreatedById":31168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T01:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother option that i can see is the transmission from surface to an orbiting \u0022data probe\u0022 and then have the orbiting probe fly all the way home to KSC for nearly full science points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor full points i could even imagine a small probe with a storage compartment that can detach from the rover/lander to fly into orbit and be picked up by a bigger craft that can bring a sample home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese small probe storage compartments can only store 1 sample and cant actually gather science points themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
