The point is that which wheels to disable is a decision that varies during flight, but the action group solution doesn\u0027t allow you to vary it during flight. You can\u0027t decide to switch which end is the front after launch (well you can, but then you\u0027ve got brakes only on the front because you can\u0027t change which wheels have braking power after the launch, which is the point.) This is a thing it would be useful to be able to change during flight. Most everything else that\u0027s done with action groups can also be accessed during flight with the rightclick on parts. The point of action groups is to provide a hotkey to do several of the things on the rightclick menus in groups all at once, but this one is missing from the wheel rightclick menu so action groups end up being the ONLY way and that seems like an exception that doesn\u0027t need to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T14:49:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnything can tip over if you try to break(sic) it hard enough. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, editable action groups would seem to be the way to go, although I mostly prefer to have extra braking power to having not enough braking power to tip over.
