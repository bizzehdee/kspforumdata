When I took a surface sample of Minmus, this got me thinking: wouldn\u0027t it be cool to have a Science Exposition feature in KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, you perform Science experiments on a body or in the atmosphere, you get a report and bring/send it back to Kerbin. The R\u0026amp;D building gives you an overview of your Science reports, but that\u0027s about it. You do the experiments purely to unlock parts of the Tech Tree and gain no real sense of achievement. I would love to have part of the R\u0026amp;D building (or a new building) contain an exposition of the experiments you have performed. Kind of like a record of all your Science achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis \u0027Kerbal Space Museum\u0027 would contain sections for each planetary body. At the beginning of your game these sections would, naturally, be empty (apart from the general description you see in the Tracking Station maybe). Once you perform a crew report or temperature/pressure/seismic experiment on the surface of the body, the KSM description would expand with the corresponding data on the planet. Did you perform a pressure scan on Laythe? You can now see the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Laythe#Atmosphere\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epressure table\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E for Laythe\u0027s atmosphere in your KSM. Got a temperature scan from Moho? You now have the minimum and maximum temperature listed in your Moho section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccompanying each section would be a visual display for all surface samples you\u0027ve taken and \u003Cstrong\u003Ephysically\u003C/strong\u003E returned to Kerbin. Did you bring back a sample from Duna\u0027s polar caps? You get a cool ice crystal next to the reddish sand and red rock from previous visits to Duna\u0027s Midlands and Highlands. See that awesome, purple glowing liquid sample in the Eve section? That\u0027s an ocean sample you brought back after your first successful return from Eve! Did you perform an experiment with the Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Varoiometer in Jool\u0027s atmosphere? You get a glass container with swirling green gas in Jool\u0027s section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that seeing the collection of your Kerbal Space Museum grow as you progress through the game would provide you with a greater sense of achievement than the current recordkeeping in the R\u0026amp;D will ever do. It would also give you a greater incentive to go to planets like Moho, Dres and Eeloo other than \u0027it\u0027s hard\u0027 or \u0027I want to have visited all the bodies\u0027 - especially if surface samples from those bodies would contain beautiful crystals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T21:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this has been recommended in a few different forms, but I fully support it.
