I have sunk so much time into this game and still going strong. There is never a booring moment on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo buisness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.A.P.I.E.R. Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis engine is useless. It does not provide the listed air breathing thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts listed as providing 190 Air breathing but it only provides 95.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt barely has enough thrust to lift itself of the ground let alone a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have done a bunch of tests with it but the most relevant one i can show.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s25.postimg.org/vrucun9un/RAPIER_vs_Basic_Jet_Engine.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RAPIER_vs_Basic_Jet_Engine.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease fix this cause the Rapier engine is amazing and I have a bunch of space planes grounded cause of this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first problem I have with these parts is that all the parts are different lengths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethey dont square up when building stuff like I would expect them too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease standardize all the parts. so that girters and construction parts are the same length as fuselage bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a Visual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s25.postimg.org/oncjlm2lb/Part_Length.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Part_Length.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere lengths are different so I cant tie them off in a tidy simple manner.

I have lost many aircraft from a simple adjustment throwing the craft out of control. This effect from the SAS is most disruptive at higher speeds, Ironically it is at higher speeds that SAS is needed most, so its a damned if you do damned if you dont situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see SAS inputs applied to controle surfaced from there current position not there default position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrim.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see Trim and SAS intergrated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have 3 Trim Memory banks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 for each of the 3 inprtant stages of flight. Takeoff, Cruise, landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can set the trim values for each of them and have them load when I select them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow for trim data to be interchangable with SAS. I could upload my current controle surface data to a trim memory bank and disable SAS allowing smooth transition between SAS and trim flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese would make flight all around better especially when flying large aircraft like the ones above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
