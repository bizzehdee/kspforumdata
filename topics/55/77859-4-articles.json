In orbit, with no thrusters of any sort firing and no reaction wheels moving, the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E force is gravity. There are no other forces. With parachutes and with ground impact, there are multiple forces at play, and different parts have substantially different forces applying. There is literally no possible equivalent of rails; rails are based on a (reasonably accurate) patched conic Keplerian orbit, which is analytically solvable. With such an orbit, there is no force simulation required. Keplerian orbits do not require \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E considerations of force, except to initially derive orbital parameters; after that, there is an equation in the orbital parameters (which don\u0027t change during the orbit) and time that returns the position of the orbiting object.

First, the force is initially applied just to the bit that touches the ground; that means rotation angle is key (while it is irrelevant where there aren\u0027t collisions, such as in orbit). That has to be simulated. Likewise, you need to look at where precisely the part will land, what slope it has, what torque is applied on initial touchdown, how the part behaves from there... it is far more complicated than setting position equal to Pos(orbit, t).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T15:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tuareg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tuareg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell seen you know nothing of development. the falling back could be simulated the same way as the rail for orbit with a simply check at the impact if the speed of the falling back part will destroy it or not. it doesnt need the unity physics just the primary school physics knowledge. you know, from weight and speed you can simply calculate the forces and check if its within the impact tolerance or not... you accept this simplified mechanism for the orbit why you want silly way over-complicated crap for the unsupervised reentry?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure.

As to why this undermines funds: For funds to provide a meaningful restriction, launches should be fairly expensive.

At that point, there is no reason *not* to use parachutes, which will return the majority of the cost of the booster, meaning you have much less incentive to do the much harder task of minimizing dropped stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore, what about manned pods or scientific payloads?
