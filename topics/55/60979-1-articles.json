You would need to do ssto to return the lower stages. Also, if you can just sell inventory for cash and use cash to buy whatever you want, what would be the point? I think that a cash budget accomplishes the goal well enough, but if the game can be changed to make recovery a viable option, I think recovery for cash is a great idea. Maybe the game could continue simulating any parts detached from the active vessel during that flight scene?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T22:45:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggested once that if any debris or ship got inside atmosphere, the game would stop timewarp and show a hint, allowing you to switch to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, all not-landed ships that are on the atmosphere would be processed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much a MUST HAVE, because, as said, recovering boosters is pretty much extra profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sort of warehouse would be required for that, and it can even have limited room.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also belive that when you recover you may have three options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStandby - simply brings the ship or recovered part to the warehouse, for the recover cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReady - recovers and readies the ship for launch, re-building the launching stage and refueling, costs the recover cost, the missing parts cost and a small extra cost for checkup.

Recovery of Kerbals will likely be important for reputation, and it seems like recovery of hardware is primarily motivated for budget reasons. But the primary reason (I think) for having a budget is to constrain rocket design; now you need enough fuel to get to the Mun and back but as you\u0027re ditching unspent fuel right before landing you\u0027re thinking about how you could build a cheaper launch vehicle next time. (Note: the tech tree already does a little of this by constraining the size of the parts available - maybe you play differently but I found myself naturally building smaller more efficient rockets due to the parts available.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardware recovery is a reasonable avenue to pursue when creating rockets, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessarily even necessary for efficient rocket design. (I\u0027m hedging because IRL we have few if any examples of reusable spaceflight hardware being unequivocally more efficient than disposable.) I suspect a budget will incentivize us to build less extravagant rockets without making it necessary (or even worthwhile) to recover some, any, or all of the pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one aspect of KSP that already hints at recovery is the popularity of SSTO\u0027s and other space plane designs. Even if NO money was refunded, the low fuel cost and low part count of many space planes would probably still give them a sizable budgetary advantage, more so if a portion of the cost of the pieces (minus spent fuel) were refunded whenever a pilot-able (crewed or powered with probe) craft were recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T21:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think KSP must take the super realistic way of dealing with disposal crafts, if a battery is intact, why not re-use it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of a \u0022life per part\u0022 gets added, then, repairing that part damage would cost, and if it\u0027s too damaged it\u0027s worth to trow it away (heatshields should behave like this at least).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if that thing is not added, the only difference between a refueled lander which came from orbit and a just spawned lander on the launchpad would be their placement on the planet, so Why create an imaginative damage to that part which will make it\u0027s reuse not feasible if that damage is not even there?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be worth to use \u0022today I build a rocket\u0022 methods to pick an used lander and stick it to the launching stage and you good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just allow us to recover it and reuse/dismantle/discard/store it as we wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting a used probe that is not worth reusing on a museum would give reputation, that sounds cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
