But if all engines had a realistic TWR,the that would pretty much remove the variety of engines in KSP. Would you really care if your engine weighed 0.1T more with a difference in 15 or so ISP?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T22:17:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DundraL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe the nerf to Isp across the board was to better represent the new aerodynamics system: launches to Kerbin orbit are easier, thus flying everywhere else is now harder. This makes sense because you can fly a slightly larger ship to orbit for about the same cost as before, and netting you about the same dV as before. You just have to change your rockets a bit; your space program (in general) has not been nerfed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
