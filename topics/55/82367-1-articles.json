This is how I would prefer to play. It might not work for everyone. It might not solve all the problems. But I would like to share it in the hopes that it may be refined into something that could indeed work and maybe get incorporated. So let\u0027s keep things friendly and civil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing I\u0027d like to get out of the way is that anyone who wants to cheat any science system can do so. With timewarp or simply editing the persistence file. So really it doesn\u0027t make sense to say no to a system because some people can cheat it. That being said, timewarp sees normal legitimate use so we don\u0027t want to have people \u0027accidentally\u0027 cheating because they were focused on a single long term mission and using timewarp a lot. So to solve this I would reduce any resource gained over time by the same factor as the timewarp. For example, x100 time warp would take your income and divide it by 100. (x/100 while Tx100) So your resource gain is always calculated in real time opposed to game time. This can apply to money, reputation, science, snacks, anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027d break down the tech tree so that each node is a single part. Only combining parts where they are useless without another. Such as ion engines without a xenon fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience itself I would break into two types of points. Science Points and Research Points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience points are collected as we always have. Doing experiments, reports, goo, measurements and so on. However instead of being used to unlock parts they are spent on attracting researchers. The idea being that your program is doing some interesting projects. (Look at this goo we sent into space!) Your reputation determines how big the pool of researchers is and how smart they are. Early game you would only be able to hire interns but working towards triple PHDs and Kerbin HawKing as your program reputation grows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch points come from those you hire and are produced slowly over time. (Assuming you have the money to pay them) The chief scientist you already have working for you has his hands full administrative duties so let\u0027s say he only produces 10pts an hour. (The actual rates would need balance and play testing so for the purpose of explaining my system lets assume they are balanced) You hire an Intern who produces 5pts so you have a rate of 15/hr.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first tech node needs 100 pts to unlock. So with just your Admin it would take 10 hours to unlock. With the Intern it takes 6.6 hours to unlock. Once it\u0027s done it splits into several nodes. Each take a slice of your pts per hour. That really slows things down right? That\u0027s where part testing comes in. Take a contract to test a part and you get a boost to that part. Test a new engine and suddenly you get a 25% boost to any points applied to that part. Testing that part again in a different context gets you a 20% boost, then 15% and so on. For example, on the launch pad gets you the 25%, flying over kerbin gets you 20%, in orbit gets you the 15% and progresses from there. (or we can invert the process and give you 5% boost for the easy test on kerbin and 25% for testing it in deep space) To me the first test should be on the launch pad and the first test should always yield the most useful data. The way the boost helps is that if a part node gets 10pts an hour, and you do the first test, it gets boosted to 12.5 pts an hour. 75% being the most you can boost a part via testing, resulting in 17.5 pts an hour. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat then? Well science over time shouldn\u0027t just be limited to your scientists. All science experiments gain another option. Continuous transmission. Meaning they feed directly to your R\u0026amp;D building producing extra Research Points. Antenna would have a new use but also a limit. Communotron 16s can transmit to local orbit, DTS-M1s to deep orbit, and 88-88s to different planetary orbits. (Or they keep their unlimited range for now, as long as they can maintain the signal with power and line of sight) Each type of experiment produces pts/hour. Less than a researcher but more points depending on the type of experiment and its location. If a mobile processing lab is within range (assuming range of transmissions are limited) then the pts/hour get a boost. However! The lab needs to be staffed by researchers and not pilots. So the Kerbals you hire at the astronaut complex cannot man the lab. You need to send the scientists you hired but whom cannot fly the ship. (This would undoubtedly require you to pay them more money)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, once the tech tree is unlocked then the research generated can be applied towards Pure Research (ie. More money) for now until they introduce something like part upgrades or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I explained this well (and avoided the WNTS list) and it will get a lot of you thinking about science and maybe make it a lot more interesting. Please keep the demand for specific parts at specific points in the tech tree to a minimum. We all feel very differently about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T20:12:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like your \u0022real time\u0022 science gain one bit because ti relies on me having the game open and running rather than me doing things in the game, like launching rockets and landing on other planets; it\u0027s a bad idea and there are better ways to balance use of timewarp.

The idea that you gather some \u0022science points\u0022 wherever you\u0027re willing to go (if you weren\u0027t there before) and then you decide what you\u0027ll discover based on that information is completely unrealistic to me. I said it once the science system came out and I still think it would be better if science points were completely removed and technical progress was quest-based. Circumnavigate Kerbin in atmosphere to develop better jet engines. Build orbital station to discover new materials and e.g. better solar arrays. Or at the very least, perform these five specific scientific measurements to get a new rocket engine. Every time you could have multiple such quests (contracts) available and it would be up to you which of them you decide to do. Their hierarchy could even follow a graph similar to the current tech tree but tasks necessary to open individual nodes should be of corresponding difficulty.

Mun rocks shouldnt help make an SLS rocket. But getting too realistic would be too tedious to be fun. Thats why I suggest that science points act as a type of bait for the researchers to come work for you. Once they are there then they can get to work on a new engine. Part testing would help move things along but you dont need to circle the globe for it. Just test it under specific conditions. Plus you can invent a part without having tested it for its specific use. NASA didnt need to send a probe with the Lunar lander landing legs before Apollo 11 used them.

So I don\u0027t really think that a science over time should be the primary mechanic for gathering science, but there might be room to include it somehow. Anything to reduce the clickfest mechanic that is the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely agree that the antennae in stock need some differentiation; as it is now there\u0027s no need to use anything other than the first one unlocked. Range seems like an obvious choice for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suggestion of dividing science gained over time by the time warp factor is a good one that will reduce the exploitability of the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I like getting science for just hiring and assigning kerbals; to my mind it would be better to have to station them in a space station or base so that the player has to do some spaceflight to start earning the rewards. It\u0027s probably a good idea to introduce some kind of specialization for kerbals as right now they\u0027re completely interchangeable, scientists and pilots seem like the obvious choices. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother refinement might be some limitations on the rate at which the science over time can be gathered (to prevent lab spamming) and perhaps a per-biome lifetime limit; i.e. a lab on Duna\u0027s surface gains x science per hour for the first 10 hours, x*0.75 for the next 10 hours, x*0.75^2 for the following 10, and so on. This way, the amount of science diminishes over time without ever reaching zero and encourages players to establish facilities in other biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T22:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@No one Leaving the game running before going to sleep is still a cheat and would take less time to just hack.

My system might not work the way things are now, but after things are balanced then it might.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Red Iron Crown For your first point, the research would require funds like a rocket needs fuel, if it runs out it stops or at least slows to a trickle. Glad we agree on the antenna and timewarp, should that apply to physics warp? As for science to hire, I thought about using it as reputation in the scientific community and use finds to hire them. But we already have a reputation resource. Maybe a combination of paying science and money to hire them. Either way you need some in the lab as KSC and some in space. JPL vs Scientists on the ISS. They would sill need to do spaceflight to hire them in the first place. Lastly I totally forgot to include limits per biome and thank you for pointing that out. How about a single lab per planetary system? Or would that be too simple? The smaller experiments would likely fall under the biome of the body. One of every experiment in any biome on the Mun gets an x value (lets say 100) over time, but setting up repeating experiments in every biome would boost the yield. So if you got 100pts from the east-side crater and set up the same stuff in the midlands you would only get 125 pts instead of 200 despite doubling the scientific equipment. But all the science from the mun can only be processed by a single lab so that original 100pts becomes 115 (assuming a 15% boost by the lab) and that extra 25 pts becomes 28.75 so you get a total of 143.75 per hour.

This is a benefit outside the tech tree (you know \u003Cem\u003Ewhere\u003C/em\u003E to build a mining base). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpaceflight Science (SS):\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---Space measurement sensors (orbital, the different distances, etc).

These points would go towards habitat tech, including any manned elements of spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech would be more available than it is now. You\u0027d not need to do major munar exploration to get the \u0022science\u0022 in order to build.. a ladder, for example. Fewer brand-new branches, and more incremental stuff. Clunky, fixed ladder, then a later retractable one. Mk 1 pod might have a few days worth of life support, while the Mk1b has more, and the Mk1c even more. Retexture existing models and reuse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake command pods, since they use all 3 types of science. Start with a Probe body and a manned pod with almost no life support. That could branch. With some SS points, you can get maybe a 2 person pod, pods that are better at reentry (assume deadly reentry), less mass (carbon fiber or something), etc. Another command pod branch is for MS points. Spend those and get pods with more life support time, are more survivable at a slightly higher impact speed (they add seat cushions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E ). Lander pods would use more of PS stuff (improved storage space for experiments, etc). Combine the 2d level for SS and MS command pod improvements, and start getting habitats, etc. You get the idea need work, but it is more incremental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should be clear that I don\u0027t like automatic science points per unit time---unless they are linked to player actions. Mapping probes can generate science over time while they orbit. Maybe someday robot rovers would be possible, same thing, they slowly move, and check for minerals that are useful and prod cast back \u0022science\u0022 over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor OP: think of it this way, the baseline of tech development over time is subsumed in the choice for whatever the tech tree order is. The \u0022stuff\u0022 done by players is what drives the specific space tech (without a space program, there is no need for that tech).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-22T06:53:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2014 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerged multiple posts\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T03:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think limiting scientific advancement to a maximum rate of 175% is too low.

You get science from going to different places, and you get the science when you go/return, not when you wait. Science is thus an additional goal mostly aligned with the main goal rather than an annoying pesky obstacle overcome by waiting not doing.
