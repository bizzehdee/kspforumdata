It is fairly interesting in it\u0027s own right, but this post isn\u0027t about XCOM. Rather, it is about an interesting feature that I believe would be awesome in KSP. In XCOM, your troops don\u0027t re-spawn, and the game tracks all those who died. it does this through a menu, not unlike the one in KSP, which records their names, rank, and the mission they died on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1008.photobucket.com/albums/af209/Stiggy_PA/mem1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mem1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see in the attached image, there is something else. In the background, behind the menu, there is a \u0022memorial wall.\u0022 what you can\u0027t see in this picture, is the fact that as the game progresses and more people die, their pictures (and more candles/flowers) get added to the wall. I think this would be a nice touch to KSP, as a simple little change to the \u0022crew lost\u0022 page. It would also be nice to have the name of the mission (or the craft name I guess, since KSP doesn\u0027t really have mission names) that the kerbal was lost on, however I\u0027m sure that has already been suggested numerous times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway, discuss?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T02:20:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of the ideas that has been suggested so many times that it\u0027s been included on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elist of things not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E.
