In reality, the size of a rocket engine is more related to ISP, not so much to thrust. To get more ISP you need a bigger nozzle (larger expansion ratio). For example: The Vinci upper stage engine (high-ISP, only 180kN) of the Ariane 5 is over 4 meter in length, while the first stage Vulcain engine (over 1300kN) is only 3 meter in length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022danilon62\u0022 data-cite=\u0022danilon62\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would prefer it to be an RS-68 or F1 Equivalent instead of the crap it is now lel\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mainsail is your RS-68 equivalent.

You can\u0027t compare its old uses with its new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour better off to compare this Engine with a Skipper or poddle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the most interesting aspects is the 4 degree gimbal. Which means big upper stages can be handled much more easily. It also is probably the closest thing we are going to get for a MK3 space shuttle engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the key thing to think about here is the usages of the two largest engines in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KS-25 cluster is the MAIN ENGINE. For the most part you will use to half way to orbit (as is planned for the SLS system in real life) The KR-2L is there to finish up with the higher orbit stuff which will be more useful with a more efficient engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you want an engine that is more of a first stage engine that has a lot of thrust. Well that\u0027s the KS-25, its strong enough to fill the void for and more or less carry anything all the way up to orbit if your upper stage is small enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you don\u0027t want to pay for that much thrust, then theres the Mainsale and redesign of the lower stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like what they did with the SLS engines, as they use to be pretty much be all end all.
