Now the Atmosphere-vacuum change might be realistic, but I feel like it\u0027s too much - the engine is practically *weaker than a Mainsail, which is smaller by far*, and tons of designs became obsolete and impossible to fly because of this. \n\nAm I the only one who feels like this is too much? If this is impossible, at least change the other stats - The weight is still 8.5 tons, and more.\n\nWhat do you guys think of this?"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T07:37:30Z","Content":"The idea behind the Rhino seems to be that it\u0027s an advanced/cryogenic engine. It has 50s greater Isp than the Mainsail - which from the top of my head I think is around 12-15% - but less thrust. It\u0027s an upper stage engine, it\u0027s built for efficiency, not TWR.

The Rhino is the largest vacuum tuned engine by a considerable margin, so if it didn\u0027t get tuned for vacuum use, we\u0027d have to push asteroids around with poodles or use a lower ISP engine.\n\nWe\u0027ve already got the Mainsail if you want a lifter engine. More thrust, better atmospheric ISP, less mass. We\u0027ve got the S3 KS-25x43.5 if you want more oomph."},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:36:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E the engine is practically *weaker than a Mainsail, which is smaller by far*\n\nThis is realistic. In reality, the size of a rocket engine is more related to ISP, not so much to thrust. To get more ISP you need a bigger nozzle (larger expansion ratio). For example: The Vinci upper stage engine (high-ISP, only 180kN) of the Ariane 5 is over 4 meter in length, while the first stage Vulcain engine (over 1300kN) is only 3 meter in length.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would prefer it to be an RS-68 or F1 Equivalent instead of the crap it is now lel\n\nThe mainsail is your RS-68 equivalent. The KS-25 performs the role of the F1 engine (even if it\u0027s modelled as a stack of SSME\u0027s). The KR-2L is the equivalent of the J-2 engine of the Saturn rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:38:34Z","Content":"Well then, at least have an *alternative.*\n\nMany people used it on their replicas and all that. Why would you do that just for the sake of being a good engine? You can just increase the price or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T10:53:43Z","Content":"Throw away your old saves and craft files and start over in 1.0... Many people also used lots of LV-N\u0027s and 48-7S\u0027s on their designs, as these were also overpowered. Finally a balance pass has happened. Price is not a good balancing mechanism as I play only sandbox."},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:39:17Z","Content":"As said above, forget the old. You can\u0027t compare its old uses with its new ones.\n\nYour better off to compare this Engine with a Skipper or poddle. \n\nOne of the most interesting aspects is the 4 degree gimbal. Which means big upper stages can be handled much more easily. It also is probably the closest thing we are going to get for a MK3 space shuttle engine. \n\nI think the key thing to think about here is the usages of the two largest engines in the game. \n\nThe KS-25 cluster is the MAIN ENGINE. For the most part you will use to half way to orbit (as is planned for the SLS system in real life) The KR-2L is there to finish up with the higher orbit stuff which will be more useful with a more efficient engine. \n\nNow you want an engine that is more of a first stage engine that has a lot of thrust. Well that\u0027s the KS-25, its strong enough to fill the void for and more or less carry anything all the way up to orbit if your upper stage is small enough. \n\nNow if you don\u0027t want to pay for that much thrust, then theres the Mainsale and redesign of the lower stage. \n\nI like what they did with the SLS engines, as they use to be pretty much be all end all. Now they fill their niche as still the most powerful engines, but in their own respects rather than being more or less OP."},{"CreatedByName":"a2soup","CreatedById":68260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T05:57:43Z","Content":"Just chiming in to support keeping the KR-2L the way it is. This was a change I had hoped for since 0.23.5, when it was introduced (and was almost strictly better than the mainsail). \n\nI\u0027m very pleased with the changes to every engine (now that the nuke overheating has been lowered), but changing the KR-2L and 48-7S was especially important. I could hardly have hoped for a better balance pass ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
