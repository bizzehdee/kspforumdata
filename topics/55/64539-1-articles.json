It seems to me that kerbals requiring electricity would drive a player to batteries and solar panels, which they would need for missions of any serious duration anyway. Am I wrong about that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I see it, you are correct. Now imagine a new player having to not only deal with life support but with electricity being consumed by their Kerbals on a Mun flyby. Depending on the electrical consumption rate this becomes a big issue and drives a new player, who may just be exploring the tech nodes (and the game!), to get solar panels and batteries and nothing else until they have those. Adding three days of \u0022Life Support\u0022 to a capsule is a completely new balance point, but adding electrical consumption for Kerbals along with all your other gear and transmitters and such is just compounding other balance points. Furthermore, after a certain point electricity is so easy to generate it is almost a secondary concern, so why bother having Kerbals use it at all? The point being, a new \u0022Life Support\u0022 resource would be pretty easy to balance by itself but adding electricity to the mix will cause balance issues all over the place and will eventually not matter in the slightest (this is also why I have an issue with 100% Life Support recyclers and don\u0027t play for them).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T16:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are good points, it is probably better to have the energy required to support the kerbals be part of the abstracted life support resource.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nathair","CreatedById":102894,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T20:46:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow imagine a new player having to not only deal with life support but with...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EI don\u0027t think that new players is an appropriate way to gauge such matters. If something worthwhile seems too complicated for new players then don\u0027t simplify it, improve documentation and tutorials.
