If you\u0027re running multiple missions simultaneously, you may have a contract popping up to put a station or build a base in, let\u0027s say, Duna, hundreds of days before the transfer window. So if you take the contract at that point, it will be sitting there and occupying a slot for in-game months because you can\u0027t cheaply launch to Duna for all that time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s sort of the KSP management saying \u0022We have a window for Duna within a month. Let\u0027s take advantage of it!\u0022 which is pretty much how large and well funded space programs work: \u0022There is a window to Saturn coming up in 20xx - let\u0027s try to get funding to send a probe there by that time\u0022, so it adds immersion. And since it doesn\u0027t take years to design a probe in KSP, the contracts can pop up within, let\u0027s say, 30 days from a transfer window. On top, it also allows players who don\u0027t play with mods (either because they are new to the game, because they don\u0027t like it or because they take a more casual approach to this game and don\u0027t read wikis, forums or reddits) to figure out something is happening regarding some specific planet. Sort of \u0022Ok, why half the contracts popping up are suddenly about sending stuff to Duna?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to add immersion, I think resource and survey missions could be exempted from this timing, if the required equipment/ships are already at the destination. Or, and maybe that\u0027s guiding the player\u0027s hand too much, contracts could require sending a ship which can later be used to perform survey contracts. For instance \u0022Send a base/rover, on wheels, with capacity for one kerbonaut and with a gravioli detector to Ike\u0022. Once that contract is complete, you get gravioli survey contracts, since the earlier contract was about sending in a rover capable of fulfilling it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-07T21:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is a very nice idea.
