Instead it sort of just stands there as this little flimsy thing that ruins any appearance of the ship having structural integrity. With a docking port (regular or Jr) it\u0027s really bad, since you get this big open area visible below it, like the engine is just floating. Since I design my ships with at least some attention to \u0027realistic\u0027 appearance this pretty much rules out using this engine despite some cool designs that could use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan the LV-1 just get a copy of the same shroud that is given to the Rockomax 48-7S (the tiny 0.1t engine)? The only issue I could see is the 48-7S is a fraction taller - maybe it could be clipped a little shorter for the LV-1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T19:12:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe shrouds are part of the engine, so this would have to be done to the ant in the Unity editor, a modder could make a new ant with a shroud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr do what I do and fill the gap with some struts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
