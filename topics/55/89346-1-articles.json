Just because it does not play out like in the battlefield games or call of duty games or even like say WoW, it STILL is a campaign with goals being forced on you by the contracts you take. This is campaign. NOW, is it wrong of YOU for example to like this? nope. thats YOUR scene man, not mine.

For me, career mode IS broken. Why? Its not linear, its not logical in how it progresses. It gives me no reason to care if I sling jeb into the sun or out beyond eeloo never to see kerbin again. it askes me to do things that are pointless and frankly do not advance my planets space program in a logical or meaningful way. The contracts are written in pure gibberish. By that I mean, they make no logical sense. SOME make some sort of random sense, but others are incoherent at best. A prime example of caring about my kerbals or rather why should I bother to care? In \u00A0my sandbox, each of my astronauts has a story, a reason why they are in the space program. In career? not really. Why should I rescue Bartmund Kerman from floating around Kerbin for eternity? For a few bucks and some reputation? Who is it exactly that I am impressing? More importantly, WHY is Bartmund stuck up there? I dont know. Do you? The contract never says, it just says this lost little soul is stuck and he needs bringing home. Better yet, is he the first one to get stranded up there? IF this is the case, HOW did he get there? I did not put him there, and far as I know, as again, the game has not made it clear that there is any other agency capable of space flight, howd he get there? None of this ever gets explained, its a plot hole. an infuriating one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nworse yet are the test part blah in situation blah. Why?

Maybe not a set of structures that says, Now Snark, you MUST fly THIS mission or you fail completely game over. No, nothing of the sort. Think more like Fable. You do action A get result B and get to do action C which gets result D which down the road because you did A now Z is available but Y cannot happen because A was done. Way I see it, give us a nice meaty story, something that drives our missions while letting say you Snark do things in one way while I do the same story in my own way, and in the end our space programs are equally grand, but, my kerbals are famous in ways yours are not and vice versa. Ya dig?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT, as it stands, and I try career each and every time a new version hits, and every time, I get 3-4 missions in and the pointlessness hits and novelty goes away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it broken? yes. yes it is. for me.

Some days I think it would be a great idea, other days I\u0027m less enthused. Done well, I think it would add a lot to the game - but I\u0027m not quite convinced that the game is correctly set up for it. My yardstick here is one of my all time favourite games, Sid Meier\u0027s Alpha Centauri or SMAC.\u00A0Stop me if you\u0027ve heard this before - I may have posted bits of this elsewhere on the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, SMAC had a story - and a pretty good one at that - but it was entirely possible to play your own game and ignore the story altogether. It managed to do this because the story primarily tied in with one possible victory path for the game - follow another path and part of the endgame sequence just included a note somewhere that \u0026lt;stuff driving the story\u0026gt; was still a problem and would need to be dealt with, but for now - enjoy your hard won victory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther strengths that SMAC had were strong world-building and multiple factions you could play, each with advantages and disadvantages. World building was\u00A0partly handled by some very good technology descriptions - all the techs were designed to complement the game setting and all the flavor text for them did a great job of putting them into a context for that setting. One description may have been all about the rigours of setting up an off-world colony from scratch (for example), another would include a short \u0027reaction piece\u0027 to the technology from one of the faction leaders. SMAC also had Secret Projects to build, complete with immersive little video clips for completing them - and again, the video clips were all contextualized around the game setting, for more world building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think KSP could learn a lot from this. Video clips and Secret Projects are probably too much but multiple factions based on the current faceless companies might be an option, complete with different starting locations, resources and possibly technologies. The KSPedia entries and tech tree flavor texts could then be the vehicles for fleshing out the background to those companies (and the kerbals in general if you so chose). The Career game largely revolves around accepting contracts from these companies, so give us a reason to care about them. Give them faces, give them history, give them motives for exploring space that the player can relate to (or not). If you were feeling adventurous (and I don\u0027t know how feasible this is within the current game systems) then have inter-company rivalries and possibly per-company reputation for the player. Take a lot of contracts for Kerbodyne for example and get less favourable contract terms with Rockomax. Or going with the wiki descriptions, have Probodobodyne as the in-game elitist jerks, who stop giving you contracts if you do too much work for that ridiculous (in their eyes) Sean\u0027s Cannery company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s where I think a story might work - putting the game world and it\u0027s inhabitants into a context. I\u0027m less convinced by the set of scripted contracts idea\u00A0(although that would undoubtedly be easier to implement), simply because they impose an end goal on the game that probably\u00A0can\u0027t really be ignored - if\u00A0it\u00A0could then\u00A0it wouldn\u0027t provide a particularly compelling story.\u00A0If I know there\u0027s an asteroid heading for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E for example, I pretty much have to follow the story and deflect that asteroid else it\u0027s game over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned above,\u00A0SMAC managed to work around this by having multiple end goals corresponding to multiple styles of gameplay (tech tree crawling, conquest, diplomacy, acquiring wealth etc.) I don\u0027t think that\u0027s really an option for KSP - by design it doesn\u0027t really \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E distinct gameplay styles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-29T13:22:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2016 01:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T13:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222734384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002289346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472476331\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103157\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, passinglurker said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157190-aperture-science-employee/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022157190\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157190-aperture-science-employee/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Aperture Science Employee\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002239636\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Veeltch\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0try to understand that not all players want want to write a story themselves but would instead rather a game entertain them by telling them a story with a little more substance than pure imagination. naturally story mode is not for everyone just like how carreer mode or science mode isn\u0027t for everyone, but in an effort to give more reasons to play the game every little bit helps just like how adding some more planets or easter eggs would help or how giving modders a scenario editor would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am totally aware of that, but I\u0027m also sure that this will never happen.
