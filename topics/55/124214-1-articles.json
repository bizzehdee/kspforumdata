Apart from gathering science points and getting there for the sake of it they are kind of boring. How about we get random events? Like that flowing water on Mars recently?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how I see it is there are random events happening on the surface from time to time. Let\u0027s say you landed a base on the surface of Duna. You are on EVA walking around, connecting pipes and whatever, when suddenly you see a meteorite zipping overhead and hitting the surface a few kilometers away. A contract notification pops up telling you that you can go there and gather some extra data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch events would last for an X amount of time and then disappear. Same thing applies to flowing water/lava, dust devils and whatever else is realistic and interesting enough to make people visit the place. Maybe a camera part would make the events more visible from orbit if a satellite with such part was placed around the planet/moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean wheater changes here btw. It would be nice, but wouldn\u0027t be very realistic without the axial tilt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T00:03:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECertainly I like the idea of having contracts that involve \u0022go to place X and take a science reading\u0022 where the timeline is deliberately tight-- i.e. give you a reason to build a very fast ship to race there before the time limit expires.
