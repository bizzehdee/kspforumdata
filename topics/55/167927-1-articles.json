In my early days of .19 and even up to 1.0 this was acceptable as the majority of my flights were crewed and when my vehicle crashed into something it was generally a catastrophic failure as the game suggested. However now that there are more and more mods and possibilities in the game, the result seems highly outdated and dependent on the situation. I intentionally crash orbital debris or return to spent booster stages and track where they impact. As well as send impactors to the Mun and other bodies. Their entire mission goal being to smash into the body I am aiming at. Meaning a collision is an absolute success. Not a catastrophic failure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, maybe I\u0027m the only one with this issue. I recognize it may only be a small issue, but it\u0027s just something that\u0027s been on my mind for the last few weeks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-25T23:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe have the crash message depend on what the vessel type was set to.
