This idea would be to have a dialogue (clickable from the ion engine), that would allow the player to specify a burn time, and when that time is over, the engine will be shut off automatically. Thus, the ion-engines would be easier to use, and more practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T13:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eseems like a good idea. never thought of from my knowledge\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T13:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhilst I agree in theory, what I\u0027d like to see is something like Kerbal OS where you can program an entire set of commands, including something like shutting off the engine.

Reentry or having a moon/planet between the probe and mission control blacks out communication and distance creates lag so important maneuvers are often programed in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt shouldn\u0027t be as easy as telling the probe to launch and fly to mun with 10Km orbit but allow plotting with maneuver nodes which once transmitted to the probe it would follow. Maybe allow more precise controls such as manually entering pitch, roll, and yaw with burn times and delays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf such a system was added new parts would be needed to allow landing of probes with less active control like the air bag system the Mars rovers used to soften their landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-29T19:29:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2013 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nobody\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"docfish","CreatedById":83007,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T19:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out Kerbal Alarm Clock, it doesn\u0027t stop the burn automatically but one of it\u0027s options is to entirely pause the game, you\u0027re still looking at it running real time but you could at least make sure you didn\u0027t overshoot your time frame. Also, to take it the same angle as the last commentor, there is a programable auto pilot already, kOS.
