It\u0027s glaringly obvious that Squad intended the tech tree to slowly introduce all the parts to new players (Devs have said this several times), not for actual career mode purposes. It seems like Squad has ditched the tutorial system without even properly fleshing it out. I\u0027m assuming that the layout we saw in all the media group videos and on KSPTV is close to the final product. I doubt Squad has the time to change the nodes very much before release. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nodes should unlock parts based on technological progression, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Probe cores, basic antenna, small SRBs, fuel tanks (all 1.25m sizes, there\u0027s no point in making them span multiple nodes), liquid engines with low efficiency and high chance of overheating (With the budget system you will only be suborbital here)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Higher engine efficiency, solar panels, reaction wheels (from this point on each node will slightly improve the engines, branching nodes will do this too, with the budget system you may have enough to reach orbit now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Manned pods, ladders (kerbals may not leave ladders or they will float away, since jetpacks are disabled at this point), return equipment like parachutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Science Equipment, better antennae to transmit more information\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Large engines and fuel tanks, larger SRBs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Landing legs and rover wheels (at this point with the budget system you should be able to land on the Mun/Minmus)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Jetpacks on EVA suits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Nuclear Engines and RTGs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Xenon Engines and tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.

Also ladders are pretty far down the tree when they are an extremely basic technology. There appears to be no penalties or handicaps at the start such as inefficiency.

Between capsules being easier without rebalancing parts and the hook of having the kerbals in the corner, capsules first makes sense from a gameplay perspective.

I would give Squad the benefit of the doubt for now, as there are several features of the game that hasn\u0027t been developed, which will ultimately change how the tech tree looks; mining, space telescopes, fairings, solid-booster fuel plugs.

I know this is anathema to the spirit of KSP but recently not many of my rockets have blown up, usually they just fail to reach orbit or run out of batteries, or run out of RCS, or get their docking ports on backwards.

I don\u0027t want to land a Kerbel because I don\u0027t know if I can get them back and presto - I\u0027m really looking forward to probe technology! To me, this is why probes do not start out the tech tree. Not that I could land a probe on Eve with only a basic rocket anyway. Also, because getting to the Mun and Minmus is so \u0022easy\u0022, and because there\u0027s such a scientific bonus of having Kerbels on board, I wouldn\u0027t send probes there anyway. It seems to me like probes are for one-way trips hence later in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I\u0027m digging the new tech tree. It\u0027s lots of fun.
