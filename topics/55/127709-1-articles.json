Currently, all they are is a name and a flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is that the \u0022reputation\u0022 system is broken down into a reputation bar for each company. The main reputation bockomax\u0027s ar seen on the KSC screen is\u00A0 the average of the company reputation bars. You would gain or lose reputation for each company, so if you failed Vac-Co\u0027s part tests a lot but completed every one of Kerbodyne\u0027s contracts, your Vac-Co rep would be very low and your Kerbodyne rep would be only slightly affected by failures for other companies. Tourists would have their own class of rep, and killing a tourist or kerbal, even if the kerbal is not on a tourist mission, would give you a massive hit to your rep.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the new contextual contracts in 1.0.5, companies can ask you to move an already existing satellite, even if it was not launched for them. I suggest that when you launch a satellite or probe for a company, it gets a flag saying which company it belongs to. Companies can only ask you to move ships that you launched for them. If you moved a satellite belonging to another company without them asking you to do so, you would lose ~10 rep points for that company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T21:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really really like this idea !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis actually makes much more sense than what\u0027s in place right now.
