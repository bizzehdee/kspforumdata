Default should be no, in which case the \u0027switch to next/previous\u0027 hot keys should only switch between craft that have kerbals, command pods/seats, and/or probe cores. In those few use cases when one needs/wants to be able to switch to uncontrollable debris, turn the toggle on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have found it handy at times to be able to switch my camera to a piece of debris that had no control point whatsoever, but after having experienced a few times how switching to a completely useless piece of debris -and then not being allowed to switch back anymore- made me lose an entire ship, I would really prefer this to be something I only enable in those very few circumstances. Especially since we get absolutely no way of controlling/predicting what exactly the game will select next when we hit the \u0027switch to next/previous craft\u0027 hotkeys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T06:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI greatly dislike ALL the switching restrictions, when we\u0027re talking about craft inside the physics bubble. Outside of that sure, there\u0027s a good reason, but within 2.2km you should be able to switch regardless of crashing, being in atmo, while moving along the ground, etc. The thing that really irks me is that it\u0027s not consistent and in some cases you can switch and then other times not. That shows that there isn\u0027t a technical reason to prevent the switch (and also in early versions of KSP these restrictions didn\u0027t exist) but rather a (poorly implemented) rule that doesn\u0027t always take effect. Why have the restrictions in the first place?

The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E describes of having a craft break apart in flight and while trying to cycle through to that\u00A0bit that I could still control I get stuck on a bit of debris. So it let me switch objects to switch between various debris, but then suddenly it locks you onto one particular bit on junk the game has inexplicably taken a liking to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother similar thing is slamming rover brakes on when switching away from one that\u0027s in motion. Again, doesn\u0027t always do it, sometimes you can leave a rover rolling and then switch back and it\u0027s still moving, but other times it\u0027s like it gets bolted to the floor. If I switch away from a rover and it crashes, then so be it, maybe that\u0027s what I wanted!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, please Squad, remove all restrictions around switching between craft/debris that are within the physics bubble.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T06:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis so much. \u00A0I was launching a rocket from a Jet and once I finished by direct munar injection burn, I tried to switch back (Via the new 24.5km unload bubble) and viola!
