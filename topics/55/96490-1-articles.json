I say make FAR as is stock. Now when I first started looking into FAR for my game I was intimidated. Intimidated by all the charts, graphs and supposed complexity that comes with the mod. So after installing it and getting used to how to perform a proper gravity turn ( only took a few tries honestly, no harder then first learning how to get to orbit stock ) I realized.. this is EASIER then stock. 3600dV to LKO instead of 4600. This here can be a turn off for people, but once your payloads increase in size things become more proportioned as they should. As for those complex graphs in the VAB/SPH.. I don\u0027t use them. Haven\u0027t referred to them once. And all the planes and rockets ive created flew beautifully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is not some complex monster that completely changes the game to the point where you have to forget everything you learned ( that\u0027s RSS/RO ).

The learning curve with FAR would be just as easy if not easier then with stock. \u003C/strong\u003EIll stand firm on that comment. Less dV to orbit and practical common sense rewards you instead of penalizing you. When I first started the game years back it was learning how to play with the games unrealistic aspects that made it hard for me. IF I had FAR installed when I first started playing the learning curve would\u0027ve been alot less steep. Again I dont see why people say it makes the game harder... it just doesn\u0027t. Whats hard about it is having to \u003Cstrong\u003Erelearn\u003C/strong\u003E how to ascend with launches, but had I learned that from the get-go...
