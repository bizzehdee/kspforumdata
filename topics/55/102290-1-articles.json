In fact, if you look at the stats of the proposed [NERVA-2 stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA) of the Saturn Rockets, the KSP NERVA is actually **over**powered compared to it.\n\nThe thrust of the NERVA-2 stage was 333.6kN in vacuum; but as everyone seems to be ignoring, the dry mass of the stage was **34.019 tonnes**; and (as always), Earth\u0027s gravity is 9.81m/s^2\n\nA quick calc shows that the TWR of this stage is 0.9996; very close to 1 (as this is a circularization and ejection engine, the TWR doesn\u0027t need to be as high). But this is the TWR of the STAGE, not the ENGINE; I don\u0027t know how heavy the fuel tank is, but as it\u0027s a big one, lets assume 10 tonnes.\n\nSo if you re-calc with the tank weight taken off, you get an engine TWR of 1.417. The KSP NERVA has a engine TWR of 2.718, nearly double. And balance says that a bigger engine should have higher TWR, to make up for the fact that the increased weight reduces dV, this really should be the other way round... or at least the KSP NERVA has less than 1.4 TWR.\n\nThen it comes down to ISP.... the KSP NERVA has a Atm/Vac ISP of 220/800, whereas the NERVA-2 is actually more efficient with 380/850. To be honest, if the KSP NERVA recieved the TWR nerf that it technically should have, I wouldn\u0027t mind if it got the ISP buff; makes it so the engine can have more dV, still allows it to be a transfer engine as it should be, but means it\u0027s awful as a landing engine, also as it should be...\n\nWith a little bit more research, I managed to find the stats for the Russsian NTR, the [RD-0410](http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0410.htm), which is much easier to compare to, as it weighs 2 tonnes (250kg more than the KSP NERVA), is a very similar size (only slightly larger) but has 35.3kN of thrust... making it have an Engine TWR of just under 1.8. It does have an even higher Vac ISP of 910 (Wow), but still the KSP NERVA is overpowered compared to it...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T17:35:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Random Tank**\n  \nRD-0410 Stats"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:50:58Z","Content":"The NERVA stage was considered as a replacement for the S-IVB stage, so we can use its stats as a basis for our estimates.

The NERVA stage would have had 144.3 tonnes of propellant, so we can use 19.6 tonnes as our estimate for the non-engine dry mass. That leaves 14.4 tonnes for the engine.

It\u0027s got enough isp for good interplanetary burns, yet it also has enough TWR to not make said burns super-boring. Thus, it is also one of the most diverse engines in the game, able to be used on anything from spaceplanes in the upper atmosphere to interplanetary motherships to low to medium gravity landers. This engine could take you anywhere you wanted to go in the game, but it would still require some creative designs to get there.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s actually one of the most balanced engines in the game. it\u0027s actually slightly underpowered, if we assume that a balanced engine has about 64% of a real engine\u0027s thrust. After all, both real-life NERVAS and LV-Ns have 800 isp, and the LV-N has about 60% of the TWR of the NERVA (NERVAS had 7, the LVN has just over 4)."},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:16:06Z","Content":"Well as i expected you didn\u0027t understand my post. \n\nI\u0027m not talking of nerfing or make it powerful, simply to use a coherent fuel for nuclear propulsion ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T05:59:20Z","Content":"I would be fine with it being changed...

I never touched the LV-N tho, mainly because every engine in KSP uses 2 resources or fuel. Unless the game is modified to handle a lone fuel-type, I cannot modify it to use only LF (or Kethane as I thought doing).\n\nI did buff the ION-Engines to 5 thrust, long before the Devs \u0022buffed\u0022 it to 2, mainly because it was too boring.\n\nI also tweaked the Rapier to combine the ramjet power/isp with the Poodle power to make it a used engine.
