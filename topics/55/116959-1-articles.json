For any interplanetary craft of decent size I need to add quite a number of them. For example my Endurance interplanetary ships used six:\n\n![24xOM46l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/24xOM46l.jpg)\n\nWhile this is something I took advantage from (there\u0027s a docking port at the back which I used for lander attachment), I feel like NERVA is something that you shouldn\u0027t need more than one or two. In fact most of the real life NERVA concepts used one engine per stage. And with 60 kN of thrust like it\u0027s in the game, we basically have to spam NERVAs all over the ship to go places, unless it\u0027s a small ship like this:\n\n![g7Zyegol.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/g7Zyegol.jpg)\n\nSo, I suggest to either make the current NERVA heavier and more powerful, or add one more NTR which is bigger. Or maybe even other kind of NTR - liquid core or gas core engine, but that realistically should have more ISP and I\u0027m not sure the game needs something like that."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T09:35:47Z","Content":"Making the current nuclear rocket heavier would obviously be bad, since it would break people\u0027s existing designs.

Once their TWR was lowered by increasing their mass and lowering their thrust. The \u0027worst\u0027 was that they started to consume only LF, making NERVA-powered rockets carry more than half-empty fuel tanks (but also making them realistic). Instead of lowering their thrust, I think something should be done like removing gimbal, power generation, and limiting its usage. For example, you can run them for \u003Cbalanced value=\u0022\u0022 here=\u0022\u0022\u003E minutes only, before their reactor core is depleted. After that, you have to recover them. 2m version: less effective than 1m versions, just like with any other engines, but having extras like gimbal and power gen, and longer life?\u003C/balanced\u003E\n\nHaving a right-click option for each fuel tank, to carry either LFO, LF, or nothing(structural) would also be nice."},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:42:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What about a 2.5m nuke with the thrust of 3 nervas, but the weight of 3.25 of them?
