As you said it yourself, the game is *already* beautiful. You just have to look up to Jool from Laythe, fly at low altitudes around Vall, go crater hopping on the Mun with Kerbin hanging up there. making it better would be very nice, but it would also mean pushing back other stuff that needs being taken care of. Not now. And thats why its better left to the modding community to take care of, because thats what it for; implementing awesome stuff that is not a development priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nemrav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nemrav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eplease please please, before you talk about eve and all these things, discuss what will happen to those without the amazing non-integrated non-trash graphics cards....\u003Cp\u003EI think they should get the procedural craters on other rocky boring planets, but for the most part, I think optimisation should come 1st thing before anything here comes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually graphic options are options.
