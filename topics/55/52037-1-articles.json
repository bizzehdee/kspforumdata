Let me present my idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that most people who want multiplayer is to do competition or COOP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, there is no need for massive multiplayer but a functionality for 2-4 players (or a reasonable or affordable number, I suggest 2-4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KMP mod, there is a control to change your vessel status between public and private (share your vessel to others or not). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good idea that I extend this to a similar scheme for multiplayer for time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere public means they want to do COOP/competition, private means he/she wants to temporarily play individually (vessel status does not impact others)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are 4 players in the game, and if all want to COOP, then they just choose public. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if someone wants time warp, he needs to start a vote. If others do not have any operations and agree, then the one who starts the vote will fully control the time warp. So there is no sync issue among those COOP players. (Of course, others can stop the warp if they want to do something. There should be something to avoid mischievous interupt)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf one temporarily wants to play individually, then he choose private. So if he wants time warp, the time warp applies locally. Once the warp done, server will automatically sync his current status to other 3. And if other 3 do warp, after the warp done, the other 3\u0027s status will be sync to the one who is in private. Since the individual one is not coop with others, so he status is not critical/sensitive to others. Therefore local time warp which could make him to be in the future time does not matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater if he wants to coop with the other 3, just change to public, and only his current status will be considered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a rough idea of multiplayer functionality. I know it may not be good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I hope everyone here can post your suggestions and comments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we can have a better suggestion for KSP, and we may be able to enjoy the official multiplayer soon. (If they put someone to do the implementation)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer is the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every first item\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, and time warp voting has already been discussed many times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JayCheetah","CreatedById":81229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T23:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t this forum has a profanity filter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, add multiplayer to the list :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMultiplayer is the \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Every first item\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not To Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, and time warp voting has already been discussed many times.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T00:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JayCheetah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JayCheetah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo true.\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t this forum has a profanity filter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, add multiplayer to the list :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, how the hell is your voting thing suposed to work when 1 of the players isn\u0027t playing at that moment?
