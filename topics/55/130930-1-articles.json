This stock relay will only limit the transmission of science: If the probe is landed\u00A0on the dark side of the Mun, then you will never be able to transmit the sweet surface science points(since the Mun is in the way and tidally locked), until you actually get another probe behind the Mun so that it can see both the lander AND Kerbin...only will the lander actually be able to transmit science.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing about losing control AFAIK.
