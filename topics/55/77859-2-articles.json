While I believe that this is quite feasible, it is just a theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say, just to give a tangible example, that every 2 meters or so of an object\u0027s determined height, the game will check the general spatial dimensions of the object and possibly mass, thus statistically \u0022separating\u0022 it into \u0022portions\u0022. This could take place when it\u0027s no longer part of the main vessel, or when it goes out of the 2.5km limit. Those values could then be inserted into an algorithm, to which the objects within each section, whose boundaries are defined by the the locations of the measurements, are given certain chances of survival. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, objects in higher up sections have a lower initial chance of getting destroyed, and the lower objects have a higher chance. Naturally, these chances are also affected by the calculated speed of the object (the speeds of it with the parachute deployed at the highest possible point) when it hits the ground and the impact resistance of each object. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, a part with a resistance of 4 m/s will have a 90% chance (Figures are more or less random) of getting destroyed when it is in the bottom most portion of the overall object when falling at 6 m/s, but only a 20% chance of getting destroyed when in the top section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with the point of toppling over, any calculations made above will not be the final chances of destruction. This theoretical algorithm will then compare the general dimensions, and if possible, mass, of the selected points for a chance that the object will \u0022fall\u0022. Certain areas of Kerbin, probably biomes, are then to affect that chance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if the measurements of the bottom portions of an object is quite skinny, say 5 meters in diameter, while the overall height of the object is high, say 40 meters, the chance of \u0022falling over\u0022 is to be quite high; let\u0027s say 60%. If the object happens to land in a mountainous area, those chances are bumped up to 95%; if in a flat area, it may simply stay at 60%; if hilly, it may go up to 75%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that\u0027s calculated, parts of the object are assigned different chances of getting destroyed, depending on which portion they are in. Generally, objects in the lower portions have a lower chance of getting destroyed, while objects in the higher portions have a higher chance. If a certain portion has a large area/width compared to the surrounding portions of the object, the objects in that measured area (\u0022portion\u0022, as I\u0027ve been referring to them as) may get a higher chance of getting destroyed, but a lower chance for the objects in the surrounding areas/portions. These calculated chances are then applied to each object, with their own individual impact resistance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf possible, it may also be wise for the mass of each overall area to play a roll in the chance of destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another example: An object with, say, 5 portions, is to be calculated for damage. An object with a resistance of 10 m/s in the bottom-most portion has a 12% chance of destruction if the object is to fall over or topple. That same object in the top most portion, portion 5, is to \u003Cstrong\u003Einitially\u003C/strong\u003E be given a 60% chance of destruction. However, portion 4 has a large area or width when compared to the other portions due to some outcropping objects. The same object in portion 4 has a 75% chance of destruction, but the same object in portion 5 is to have its chance of destruction changed from 60% to 40%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce this is calculated, chance takes its roll on the object that is to fall to earth. First, the initial fall destruction is to be resolved, and some objects are to be tagged for destruction, and others not. Afterwards, whether or not the object will have toppling damage applied will then be figured out. If luck has it that it does fall, then objects will have another chance of destruction, but with the new calculations meant just for toppling over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find it necessary to not combine the chances (falling and toppling) and make it all one big chance of destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny object that survives the roll o\u0027 death is then recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an option, if the object fell on mountainous terrain, all of the objects will have another chance for damage, but this time not in the measured portions, but rather proportionately equal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if an object is to exceed a single portion, should only the highest chance count, or should it have 3 chances for destruction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m sure that my idea is possible, its only a theory, and hella ambitious for one, and thus may end up being not very feasible at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great if someone more learned on this could provide some insight on this and some actual values that could be plugged in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: There would also need to be a way for the game to determine the bottom and top of the object.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T04:14:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 04:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Exxmorphing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade some of my idea clearer\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
