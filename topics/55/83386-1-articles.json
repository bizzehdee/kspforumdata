I hope there is something being done about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I was still inspired to try and save money where I could so first, I tried adding parachutes to the booster rockets that would otherwise crash on kerbin. I saw the chutes go out so I assumed it worked but as I got back from my mission there was nothing to recover from those. Ok, I figured I\u0027d add an ai command module to each of them so they would count as probes. I did some ground testing, gained a few km of altitude, released them and saw them land nice and safe. After I recovered the main vessel, I went into the space center to recover the booster rockets but they were gone, like they never existed. Sucks! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen a few days later, I forgot all about it and was trying out a different science recovery - lander design where most of the vehicle would stay in orbit containing the high and low orbit science and I would only send down the minimal required to get 2 samples of science from there, later I would meet up with the orbital craft again, head home and land in 2 parts. Everything worked out brilliantly, I was clapping my hands as I watched 2 vessels with chutes out landing side by side on kerbin, I recovered the main craft and again, as I went to recover the other craft, it was gone. Sup with that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
