Just so you can switch between mirror-symmetry based on a specific part, or the vessel as a whole. The radial symmetry mode already has that switch, accessible by pressing F when placing parts. Maybe add that switch to Mirror symmetry as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T13:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been a part of the game for a while, actually.
