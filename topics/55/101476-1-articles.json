If you have an engine with a 90 degree gimbal, and you hit \u0022w\u0022, suddenly you\u0027re thrusting 90 degrees to your previous vector. With the new system you could hit \u0022w\u0022 until your gimbal was at the right spot.

(hard to tell) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the engine gimbaling at least.
