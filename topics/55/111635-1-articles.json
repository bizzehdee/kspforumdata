If an idea gets alot of interest, or if I cant explain it properly in a paragraph, I may give it its own thread. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: Dont post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Add a fuel pumping function to docking node context menus: A click of a button starts evenly draining fuel from tanks on one side of the docking port and putting them evenly into the fuel tanks on the other side of the docking port. Simply moves fuel from one side of the part tree to the other (relative to the dockingport) . Fuel flow logic would still apply. (no effect on locked tanks or tanks separated with a decoupler.) This is to allow for an easy fill up at orbital depots, without coding to try to keep track of what parts are new to the current part tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Clicking altimeter to toggle between the display between sea-level and radar altimeter. Pretty self explanatory for the reason. Maybe a little indicator telling you which mode its in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3:Jet engines: handle intake air indirectly to prevent asymmetric thrust. (its still a thing) by calculating TOTAL intake air rate (from all intakes) and TOTAL intake demand (from all engines) you can use that to apply the resulting performance changes to ALL engines. Directly subtracting intake air from each engine will eventually result in the last engine to take its slice of the pie to get less pie than the rest so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4:Handle the mass of intakes and jet engines as a system, not as independent components. This will allow more control of an aircraft\u0027s CoM. That or reduce weight on jet engines by a fixed amount and add that much weight to intakes. please note this thread has nothing to do with aero, thrust, altitudes etc. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\u003C/a\u003E for more into on that problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5:Move electrical and thermal parts to their own tab in the editor. The utilities tab is getting over-crowded. Moving solar panels, batteries, fuel cells etc to their own tab. 14 parts I think. Make the tab have a lightning bolt on it. Should be pretty easy to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6:Solar cells: Change the texture to show that it has a radiator on the back. This will help players realize the additional function of solar cells faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7:Science parts: Add a new science tab beside the resources tab for the in-flight UI. Clicking it should show you a clickable list of science parts on your vessel. Clicking one should result in \u0022using\u0022 that experiment. Unusable ones should be greyed out or list the reason they are unusable/ already used. Should highlight the part like hovering your mouse over the part. Keeps you from having to mess with the camera to get it inside those service bays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8:Bacon: make it crispy and delicious. Dang now I\u0027m hungry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9: Probe cores: give them a stand-by or hibernation mode in their right click menu. This makes the vessel uncontrollable, but the core stops using power. You can of course still bring it back out of standby. BONUS: put probe cores in standby when their battery gets really low. Make it a slider in the right click menu labeled \u0022standby at power %\u0022 It would give us one last chance to deploy solar panels before a probe is lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10:An extra level of time warp available only on solar orbit above 50,000,000M.... Even at current max warp, it takes ages for things to happen way out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E11:An easy way to do inline fairings based on squads UI. (assuming you are in the process of making a fairing already) click the rim of the fairing you are making (or press space?) to leave the top of the fairing open and create TWO (2) attachment nodes at the height of the farthest fairing section. yay, now we can have engine clusters for mid-stages.;\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EFail, this is already almost done and I didnt know it. Just add the ability to terminate fairing construction at any point and add a node there.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12:Improve fuel flow logic. Treat fuel tanks connected directly and inline to eachother as a single large tank...a \u0022tankset\u0022. Drain each fuel-containing part in a \u0022tankset\u0022 evenly. This prevents CoM from swinging so far towards the bottom of your rockets near the end of your first stage and causing a tumble. Fuel lines would still pull from other tanksets first. It would have no effect that would change existing designs, other than making CoM move around less. You wouldn\u0027t even need to change your design in 99% of cases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E... So thats a dozen ideas that I think would have a good effect on KSP gameplay overall compared to the amount of work required to implement. Sorry if some parts don\u0027t make much sense, I\u0027m running on about 2 hours of sleep atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DundraL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:30:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat list, I especially like the idea of a tank set for rockets and jet engines as a system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENumber 8: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94648-1-0-2-Burger-Mod!-0-3-%282015-04-28%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94648-1-0-2-Burger-Mod!-0-3-%282015-04-28%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T17:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E9. you can do that by simple disabling battery in probe core in craft editor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DundraL","CreatedById":118705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI DO do that... but IMO, I think it would be nice to be able disable a probe core on a manned flight till I need it for automated return for example.
