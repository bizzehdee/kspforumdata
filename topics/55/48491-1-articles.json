You would need to do risky manned missions so the public will have an adventurous and patriotic image of space travel and send a steady stream of advanced probes and rovers to hard-to-reach places, so the government could see with its own eyes, that what you do are huge leaps to the scientific community. Occasionally, you would need to donate money to the government so they could make propaganda films and campaigns about space exploration, such as sci-fi\u0027s based on realistic events and \u0022space camps\u0022 for young children. If you do things that are not good PR-wide (e. g.: too many Kerbals die on your missions, or your unmanned missons prove scientifically useless), Karack Kerbama, the president will show up and cancel your space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T15:42:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven the scope of the game that might go too far.
