Actually only in one regard IMO, their separation.\n\nAs with most of what I\u0027ve seen for 1.0, their look and construction are great, and as far as weight and balance issues is concerned, we\u0027ll see when we get to test them out. But the potato chip separation is the only thing they don\u0027t have me hyped for. I know they\u0027re trying to sell it as \u0022omg so kerbal\u0022, but when I heard that further options aren\u0027t implemented yet due to time constraints, it kinda sounds like more of an excuse, to me at least. I really hope they get around to it soon, as I\u0027d hate to have a kerbal-style fairing sep on my replica craft. It\u0027s ok for the people who like the kerbal style, but it\u0027s an eyesore for replicators like me, who like things somewhat realistic and sensible.\n\nI don\u0027t mind constructing them in several procedural parts, it\u0027s still a vast improvement over 0.90 stock fairings. But some sort of exrta staging options would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSo here\u0027s to hoping the devs will listen to us once more!"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T02:02:05Z","Content":"\u003E Harvester suggested that they didn\u0027t have time to make it work clamshell style, so it sounds like they were really constrained by how they implemented it.

So the number of sides may actually depend on the size of the fairing base. 2 sides for 1.25m, 3 sides for 2.5m, and 6 sides for 3.75m.
