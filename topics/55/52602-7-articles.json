I think Ekku\u0027s work will put the debate at large sufficiently to rest, as it will give others (including the OP of course) the ability to try it out and perhaps refine the idea further. After all, MechJeb and FAR change the game substantially in an attempt to add some complexity and give the player more to think about.
