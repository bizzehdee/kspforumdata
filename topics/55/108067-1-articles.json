I use Goodspeed Fuel Pump whenever I can for that reason (it\u0027s effectively a fuel priority system that gets saved with your vessel.

Fuel gauges on tanks should be active sliders that you drag to transfer fuel to/from other selected tanks instead of having these excruciatingly slow and difficult-to-control on-off buttons.\n\nI\u0027m okay(ish) with the existing system (mostly.. I wouldn\u0027t complain if it got better though), except for the issue that you can\u0027t transfer LF and O in a balanced fashion unless you\u0027re completely filling something (or completely emptying something). Filling a small LF/O tank from a large one halfway in stock is a PITA... gotta use little sub-tanks to ensure that the 9:11 ratio is maintained etc."}]}
