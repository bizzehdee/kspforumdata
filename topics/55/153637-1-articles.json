You may enter fierce competition with it to complete certain goals first, or you may delegate missions to resupply your space station to it - the choice is yours. It would breed a completely new gameplay mechanic - perhaps your comm-sat coverage is having problems so you reach out to them for help with connection / maintenance etc etc etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this idea would also help solve the \u0027lack of storyline / end-game\u0027 complaint that some people have with the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what you think, or if its even a viable thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-17T17:19:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been proposing a \u0022Space Race\u0022 mode for a while.
