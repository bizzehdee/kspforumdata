Remember as well that even if the marker disappears, as long as you were thrusting in the exact same direction as it, you can still thrust in that direction to remove any residual velocity, so when it does disappear, just give it one more tap on the RCS, and you should be golden.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T13:34:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re facing the marker on the navball and want to slow down just use reverse RCS (N key bey default).
