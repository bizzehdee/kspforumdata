The reason to not use a nuclear ssto is related to safety. I don\u0027t think there are any issues with reusabiloty, unless you have to replace the nuclear materials or parts inside the closed cycle. This is not likely to be required for many years of service time. \u0022No refunds\u0022 would only solve one half of the issue in a good way. I don\u0027t think that LVN\u0027s should be basically banned from the SPH.
