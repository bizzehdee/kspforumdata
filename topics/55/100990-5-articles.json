Add some maintenance/building costs. Ideally, introduce a hangar mechanic to make re-use vs build-new a significant gameplay decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of building a spaceplane (presumably out of the parts that you had) each time, you save a spaceplane in the hangar in whatever state it was when you left it, and then you can edit it as a ship, but removing parts costs money too, unlike when you build a new ship. Placing parts would still be important if you wanted to overhaul a plane, and especially if you wanted to add cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, building new ships would not only assign a cost to parts, but to the joints between them, and then another price for the cost of running the VAB\u0027s machinery such as cranes and lifts and trucks. So a ship that costs 10000 funds might add a 70 to 90 fund increase due to the part assembly, and a times 0.123 or so to that from the VAB. The assembly modifier might improve with the tier of the VAB, but of course, that would further putting the difficulty curve in the wrong direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while you could salvage all of the parts from a crashed rocket that broke into pieces, even at the KSC, the parts recovery value of 99% wouldn\u0027t mean you could put it all back together for the same price. Recovering a big rocket that\u0027s still put together would keep the funds for the part joints, but it wouldn\u0027t be able to be reassembled in the VAB as easily, since you\u0027re still assembling them out of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you could just take the fully assembled bit and save it in the hangar, where you can relaunch it with little to no extra servicing costs, except that you can not just take in broken parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure there would have to be a saving mechanic so that if you break off some parts of your ship, you could rebuild them exactly in the hangar. Saving would also be useful for designs where you fine tune the fuel tanks and you need just the right amount in them at launch. Fueling cost would of course be added on to servicing cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding payloads would probably be done in the VAB. Once you\u0027ve built a payload, you can instantly transfer it to the Hangar, but for the same cost as building and launching it. Then you can place it however you want. Perhaps placing a part directly onto a ship in the hangar might cost more than in the VAB, unless you are using a docking port. The difference being that taking OFF parts would also have a cost compared to the saved ship. I think that if you use a docking port though, no placement cost at all should be added to the craft, because you\u0027re just putting together pieces. It doesn\u0027t cost anything to dock two existing ships in space, so it shouldn\u0027t cost much to put them together in the Hangar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly there might be a need to take a recovered spacecraft and put it on a non-reusable launch vehicle (Space Shuttles!). So you could then take a ship out of the hangar and put it in the VAB with no extra building or assembly costs, and then build out a launcher for it. The thing would be that you couldn\u0027t change anything in the shuttle at all, it would be it\u0027s own part for all intents and purposes in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Build once, launch as many times as you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there\u0027s another thing: Gus gets way more strategies. For instance, maybe you could have a strategy that takes away from VAB costs but in exchange makes hangars more expensive to use, would be great if you\u0027re running a big-dumb-booster powered space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T13:02:45Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 01:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T14:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just want to say KUDOS to the Contract(s) Modders...I have yet to make Resource Contracts...ugh !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECmdr Zeta\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T17:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis subject came up in another thread, and as I posted there, this thread started to languish a little, and I think it\u0027s because we have no idea what Squad is planning on doing, or even what is on the table. I think there are good ideas here, and not all from the same POV, so it could be very useful. It would be nice to see someone actually working on it chime in. Even if the direction they chose is not what some of us consider ideal, we could at least drive the conversation in the direction of way is actually going to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print added some OK stuff, but it doesn\u0027t change the fundamental problem with career. Right now the contract system requires the player to try and invent a context for seemingly (and actually) random missions/contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI harp on Mission (your own program) vs Contract (doing something for a 3d party), and want that separation from a storytelling sense. People can argue \u0022open ended\u0022 all they like, but if the \u0022contract\u0022 says that X corp wants you to build a base, it requires that the player intentionally ignore what the contract actually says if he/she continues to to use the facility, or even mans it (since you explicitly built it for someone else). There is no point in have a contract come from some 3d party entity if none get treated as belonging to a 3d party, it requires the player to actively ignore something he has specifically been told. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny new mission/contract ideas can be interesting, but often they are interesting\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003Cem\u003Eonce\u003C/em\u003E. After that, a grind, or something to ignore. Many extant contracts are absurd (the parts testing with no reasonable context, which is over 90% of them). FP added some that are just as absurd---landing asteroids? Really?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic paradigm now that for game difficulty, \u0022hard = lower funds/rewards\u0022 is just a grind slider. Adding hoops to jump through on contracts is often not harder, just \u0022more tedious.\u0022 The fundamental problem is that things are not actually ever more difficult, the same equipment/skills are used, all that is needed for different mission profiles in more dv (obviously some manned missions are actually harder to build for, like manned Eve, etc). This is even true just looking at \u0022management\u0022 which honestly isn\u0027t a thing now, it just isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would make difficulty levels actually matter? What would make contracts feel like less of a grind, or less repetitive? What would eliminate the early game grind of upgrades, particularly for players who have a clue already?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think time needs to matter. Somehow. Either KCT-like, or possibly a mechanism like the one I suggested above, to pay funds out over the expiration time frame of a given mission (KSC mission, not \u0022contract\u0022). Missions then become \u0022budget\u0022 items, and contracts are a short term bolus of funds. Eliminate dumb contracts. Obvious, but needs to be said. Facility upgrades? Perhaps finer grained control of facility upgrades. More steps that cost less. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d Separate commercial contracts for 3d parties from those your own program employees suggest. Many of the current contracts need to be \u0022mission suggestions\u0022 internal to your program. Odd station ideas make no sense from 3d parties, particularly when you get to own them. Same mission from your own program makes far more sense than trying to explain in your own head why some company is giving you large sums to build a station for them---then they give it to you. Go over the extant contracts and make sure they make sense. Putting a satellite in X orbit should make some sense instead of being a random parameter. \u003Cem\u003EWhy\u003C/em\u003E, matters from a story telling POV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey talked of \u0022tycoon\u0022 or other management level issues, but there are not any right now. Management implies time to me. A budget, costs for having astronauts, if they are used right now or drinking coffee at KSC. I\u0027m not saying I want to be bothered with that, but that\u0027s the implication. Even if really abstracted so we don\u0027t have to be bored with it, it would make some sense to consider. Honestly, some stuff should be done autonomously by kerbals themselves. Many hate this idea, but the concept of a \u0022manage a space program\u0022 game combined with \u0022the player has to individually control every step a single astronaut takes\u0022 makes no sense. If you set up a facility on the Mun, and it requires \u0022scheduled service\u0022 it would be nice if you could design craft for that mission, assign astronauts to do those missions, and they would just happen on a schedule (obviously time would have to actually matter, and it doesn\u0027t at all right now). Any failures (which would be nice to have) would present fun mission opportunities for the player (rescues, repairs, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T19:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy #1 issue with contracts is that they are the only way to make funds. I think the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Espending\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of funds in career is fine, it\u0027s the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eearning\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of funds that needs some alternatives. Ideally there would be 2 or 3 different ways that you could earn funds, with contracts just being one of those means. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal favorite option would be achievement/milestone based funds. As you complete achievements, you gain bonus funds based on the difficulty or effort required. If you have collected science data from 10 different biomes you get X funds, you would get even more funds once you collect science data from 50 different biomes. The achievements could include all of the events that currently used for Kerbal XP: flyby, orbit, flag planting, etc. The difference with this sort of setup would be that you get no funds up front, only after you complete the achievement, but it also means that as you do \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Enearly any activity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the game you will gradually complete various achievements naturally over time. Other achievements might be more specific and can represent fun challenges to attempt (return a surface sample from Eve for example). In general, this method of funding allows for a greater deal of freedom to explore and wander, knowing that you will gain funds naturally as you play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also like the idea of some sort of government funding budget, assuming we can balance it around time warp issues. The main point is I want multiple ways to earn funds, with contracts as only one of those options. With multiple options then you can play the way you want and not be forced to doing it one way in order to proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for science, I am of the opinion that the ONLY way to earn science should be recovering or transmitting the data from your spacecraft. This means ZERO science from contracts or from strategies. I\u0027m not really sure there\u0027s a good place for strategies in this game at all - I do not like strategies that relate to funds, science or reputation, but I could imagine strategies that affect your usable parts and their stats and effectiveness. There have been good examples in this thread already for strategies that affect things apart from funds, science and reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaLVin-K","CreatedById":118452,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T21:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart test contracts that require you to take the part through a certain flight regime, such as run the LV-N atomic motor for 30 seconds between 10km and 15km between 200m/s and 500m/s.

The former should basically just be a list of milestone things (alt-records, 1st time SoI / orbit / landing - that kind of stuff) that you can complete at any time, without choosing which you are planing to do next. By and large, the main reward for these would be REP, plus a little extra funds. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Contracts\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 otoh would, in tendency, reward the player with funds and a little bit of REP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also very much agree with the notion of more (less? more tiers) granular steps in building upgrades. In another thread i compared the grind involved with World of Tanks and for the science building, it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s the equivalent of starting out on tier VI or so, trying to get to VII. And the total road block that is the low tiers buildings restriction is probably not the most fortunate choice of parameter to upgrade in it, either, even if \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4time\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 is not on the table. A simple science cost multiplier (tier 0 -\u0026gt; 200%, tier 1 -\u0026gt; 180%, or something like that) would probably be better and might keep science valuable for longer within a game, keeping it so throughout: The early, easy, launch pad sciences wont get you as far in the beginning, you dont hit brick walls rendering science temporarily unimportant (until you can afford the next upgrade) mid game and the tree might last a tad longer end game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also agree that science should exclusively come from \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4doing science\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 - exceptions may confirm this rule, but they should really be exceptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother point i agree with is \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4contract-chains\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. I dont know how many of you have played paradox games (europa universalis, crusader kings f.e.) but for those who did, think event-chains. Or the good old Panzer General campaign. Depending on how well you do on a specific contract (say there is one primary objective and a secondary one - depending on weather you managed both or just one and which, or none) or even on how you solved a specific given problem, there could logical follow-ups. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4chain\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 is actually sort a misnomer - it would be more like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4trees\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 with branches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETesting contracts should, imho, only crop up for parts, that you have the tech unlocked for, but not the part itself, and the benefit would be gaining free access for this part and maybe a small contigent of it for you to use for free. I find it sort of debatable, though, if the conditions for these tests really have to make sense on first sight. Sure, testing landing gear on high orbit seems pointless at first, but it might be about its durability in space, not about the actual use of it up there, but rather how well it perform on the ground afterwards. So: Probably there can be all sorts of funny condidions, as long as they are concluded with an actual meaningful test, that makes sense for practical purposes. As in: Bring the landing gear up into vacuum and then land on it, too! Or: Bring a jet engine to the mun alright, but the actual test takes place back in some sort of oxygen atmosphere (point being to see if it still works properly after the journey). It shouldnt be too hard (i guess) defining meaningful test-conclusions within reasonable parameters - if those are always at the end of such a test, whatever apparently wierd stuff you have to do with it before this seems a lot more plausible.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T09:43:59Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 09:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T10:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me, personally, one little change that I would like is to have satellites pre-made in some file somewhere for the satellite contracts.
