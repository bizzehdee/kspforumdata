Mission 1, Save jebidah from Minmus orbit. If you accept the mission, the engine would spawn jedibidah in orbit. Then if u go get him in a craft you build, and recover him, you receive a reward, say credits or money or a little science. Let devs decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe little engine, could spawn things like a space station in Mun orbit that requires repairs. This lets people who want more EVA\u0027s, build there craft, then fly over to this spawned station, then do EVA repairs and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould also spawn a return rocket on a decaying orbit whos aprachutes have failed. You must fly up and eva, repair the shoots before it crashes and destroys valuable science data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpawn a SAT that needs to be recovered by docking with it and bringing it home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel the inclusion, much later on when devs have time and get around to this as I know they have other things they are planning on doing. The potential of using a small spawn engine I think would make missions very flexible and interesting with variety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my proposal a mini spawn engine to use with missions in the future. Could also spawn crashed rockets on planets and do rescue missions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pigletx2","CreatedById":78322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T15:00:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, your the only space organization created.
