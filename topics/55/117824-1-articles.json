I can\u0027t really remember my first return trip from the mun and I definitely can\u0027t remember what the ship looked like. The only issue I could see is that the possible objectives would have to be specific enough that you could only complete it with one ship. All of your examples should work nicely, except space station, because determining what constitutes that goal is so much less specific.
