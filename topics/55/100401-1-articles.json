Do you think that we will get a spore-magnitude galaxy to explore, or do you think that the game\u0027s expanse will stay as it is forever? Do you think that we will get far-future warp drives, or will ion engines, nukes, and RAPIERs always be the pinnacle of technology? do you think that potato computers will be able to handle 10000-part ships, or will performance and RAM usage always be the same?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about with mods? Do you think the modding community will ever create a galaxy? I\u0027d guess they will, but i\u0027m not a modder, so i don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, what do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOH NO I SUBMITTED IT ALREADY I CANT POST A POLL OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ringotuna","CreatedById":79252,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T04:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere may be new planets and futuristic parts but I doubt they would be nice as system requirements are most likely not going to change. There might be better add-on support for more complex plugins and stuff but then there probably won\u0027t be any genuine mod makers left to make them. There could be more realistic aspects to the game but then we wouldn\u0027t get them as Squad would have to deduct realism for that specific age group who can\u0027t help but use the infiniglider exploit to get spaceplanes into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in my opinion I think the game is going to be \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E from complex.

It mean that there is only so much planet you can make before you start getting bored or go into unrealistic stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvoiding the boredoom some would think KSP would \u0022naturally evolve\u0022 to a RPG/strategy game where you have to install base and colony, mine and sell stuff. Unfortunately such feature would require a completely different game-design and depict a unrealistic economy of space (in short : the only thing worth bringing back are asteroid already coming to you) as well as auto-pilot and overpowered engine to keep it from becoming a painfully tedious space-truck simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for engine\u0027s power, I think the Dev will first try to balance KSP\u0027s Career-mode, so the \u0022best engine ever\u0022 will likely have the power to do manned mission to Jool\u0027s moons or beyond without requiring a painfully big rocket, be it on the launch-pad or assembled in space. Myself I kind of hope for 2.5 fusion engine with heat radiator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly I would like to call back that \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A SIMULATOR\u003C/strong\u003E and I kind of wish some guys stopped lying blatantly that \u0022more realistic anything\u0022 would make the game easier and more interesting for everyone when they are just catering to what they hope to find interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough KSP can\u0027t be perfect already, you do not add complexity for the sake of complexity, in fact there\u0027s a saying :\u003Cem\u003E \u0022the best solution to a problem is always the easiest one\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.
