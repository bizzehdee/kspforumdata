It looks like a first stage engine, but it doesn\u0027t work too well in that role, as it doesn\u0027t have enough thrust per surface area. It\u0027s much better as a vacuum engine, because it has the same Isp and better TWR than the LV-909, while providing more thrust for its size than any other engine of comparable efficiency. It\u0027s also quite short, meaning that it often fits well in landers and spaceplanes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T11:28:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospike is useful for asparagus staged rockets going to Mun or Minmus, if you want to keep the weight low.

In bigger, more reasonable landers, the number of engines and attachment parts just gets out of hand when using the 48-7S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new big engines may be good as the first stages of an Eve lander. Their Isp is low (280 or 320 seconds), but raw power and low part count may be more important than efficiency in big landers. Still, you are going to need something else for the middle stages (something like 15-30 km). The lander has probably already lost 90% of its mass by the time it reaches 15 km, and the big engines need a lot of fuel to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
