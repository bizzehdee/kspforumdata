Remembering them is sometimes a bit problematic and a lot of going back and forth between these two buildings is involved. Maybe there could be a way to click on the landmark/desired orbit and accept the contract from the Tracking Station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peteletroll","CreatedById":144573,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-09T22:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
