I haven\u0027t seen much on my specific ideas so hopefully it isn\u0027t just a rehash of everyone else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I\u0027d love a means to delete/recover multiple things in the tracking station at once. Much like how my computer allows me to select multiple files to throw away in the Recycle bin I\u0027d love to be able to select multiple debris and destroy or recover it. It\u0027s super super fun to click the item, click destroy/recover, and then click again to confirm X25 or whatever you may have your debris settings at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Contracts. Personally I like them. If you don\u0027t do anything to them I\u0027ll be happy as a clam. It seems a lot of people don\u0027t like the testing of parts in strange flight regimes. I like it. If I were the boss I guess to address this issue I would make it a semi linear progression for parts testing. For example, take the Mainsail engine. Instead of the first test being test flying over Kerbin at X altitude and Y speeds, have it landed Kerbin. Then the next test could be flying at a low altitude and weird speeds, then medium/sub orbital/ orbital at various speeds. Theoretically, this will give it a feel for a real test program. You would have 5 or 6 \u0022test missions\u0022 for each part. I would think these could still be procedural? I don\u0027t know, I can barely spell programming let alone program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Science. As a noob I really loved the first discovery of how to science and learn new parts. I thought the pace of it was great. As I get better and more experienced I can see why people want more difficult science progression. I\u0027m only on my 3rd save and have never been outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I can\u0027t grind all the science in 4 launches. I\u0027m just not good enough. It takes me quite some time before I can unlock enough tech just to dock. So, basically I\u0027m asking/hoping that the science difficulty remains the same for us stock newbies and if we want more difficulty then we can mod it. As there are already at least 2 mods for more difficult tech trees/science games. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. For a mod, I\u0027d love to see Life support remaining time for my Kerbals. I use TAC and understand why it went to 1unit = 1 Litre and prefer that but I do miss the ease of looking at the resource panel and seeing 80 units of Life Support which meant 80 kerbal days of life. I guess I hope that Kerbal Alarm Clock or Kerbal Engineer Redux adds it in somehow. This being implemented in stock would be silly of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the ramble and yet another view concerning Contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
