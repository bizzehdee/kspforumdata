Something that lets you fully recouple parts and hold them in a cargo bay(heavy parts) or lets you make a ship break into 2 or more separate controllable pieces and go back together and fly off(One being a large engine body for heavier gravity takeoffs). I have various plans for things like this including rovers I need packed back in the ship for reuse for takeoff on other planets(an exploration design) and the ability to make it two ship to seperate a drone portion that is connectable for heavier gravity bodies but also capable of interplanetary travel and reconnectable incase I need to fly back to get parts for the mission from kerbal or from refueling stations to continue exploring. Or the idea of having a nose cone with science cone break off with an ion engine on the rear and act as a temporary satellite or scout. Or anything else I can make it useful for. I was thinking of a whole plane where the engine parts can break off to perform mission tasks during flight return and help do things. combine that with potential Cargo bay ships that can make an asteroid moving kit while being seperate landers and exploration vehicles for multiple various situations to make a complete exploration mega ship that is also sleek and easy to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just asking because I always feel like I\u0027m cheating with mods and prefer doing things with stock first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-31T20:39:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2015 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T20:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have docking ports for that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T20:42:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre they strong enough for taking off of kerbin or eve after reconnecting?
