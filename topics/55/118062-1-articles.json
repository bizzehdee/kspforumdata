Maybe for a life support, but not for stock KSP. Most of us just have a cockpit, a fuselage and an engine. Bill and Bob can\u0027t sit anywhere but the cockpit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On August 21, 2015 at 5:30 PM, Snikersnee said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I\u0027m always like \u0022I jumped from really high up, how did his legs not break?\u0022 But I guess they aren\u0027t human and if a character damage system was implemented, it would be less kid-friendly.

I am no expert on this but kerbals don\u0027t eat, sleep, age, get damaged or get ill. The only thing that happens is if they hit the ground to hard or get attacked by the Kraken, they just turn into dust."}]}
