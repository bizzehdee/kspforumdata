Surely getting to use the goo things again is something that needs to be a challenge for the game mechanism to be interesting. Aside from roleplay, I\u0027m not sure why you\u0027d need the lab when Kerbin is just a burn away. But, with your kerbin system missions, why not leave the labs in orbit, and take the data to be proceeded after landing? It would be simpler to design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KNSA Scientist","CreatedById":74995,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T01:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that would be nice, and that it could only refresh experiments once as a consequence for being smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T03:26:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we might be better re-imagining the science lab system.I think that the current one should be buffed to up science gain to up to 80-90% through transmission, and placed slightly later in the tree, while a smaller (1.875m-ish) lab resembling MOL should be in the same spot as the current lab, but offer science gain up to 50-60%, with a lower mass (1.5T maybe?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T10:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^That.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice all science which consist of \u0022data\u0022 should be transmitted at 100%. Science which is materials based needs to be brought back to a base or lab. The idea of a smaller lab is great.

It could be capable of this, as well as cleaning out experiments, but it\u0027s capability of processing experiments for transmission should be limited.
