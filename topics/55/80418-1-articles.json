As it is, if you\u0027re trying to optimize a launch by keeping your engines throttled to maintain a TWR of 2 using the g-force meter, the tick marks are so close together that the meter is hard to read for this purpose. It might be useful to have the readout either more expanded around this region (squish the -5-0g and 3-15g regions to compensate) or better yet, include a button that swaps the g-meter out for a TWR meter, relative to the most-inner SOI the vessel inhabits, that goes from 0-3.) I don\u0027t really find the g-meter all that useful, but a true TWR one would be.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T18:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I have Mechjeb for that, but if you don\u0027t, it\u0027s easier to use the speed meter to stick close to the therminal velocity.

Even when I\u0027m using KER to view TWR I have to move my eyes back and forth between the KER window and my throttle setting. Easier and cleaner to have it all right there. And it already is; it just needs to be easier to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour other point: terminal velocity changes continuously during ascent, and your current speed is not directly controllable (it\u0027s the time integration of thrust\u002Bdrag\u002Bgravity), while TWR is directly controllable and has a constant most-efficient value. It\u0027s far easier to maintain TWR=2 than to try to match your speed to TV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nli2work","CreatedById":106805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T18:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can build a prop for it if you have the RPM mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T18:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nli2work\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nli2work\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou can build a prop for it if you have the RPM mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a pretty good idea.
