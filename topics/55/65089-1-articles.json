Say you want to launch your Duna Rover and Duna Satellite in one launch with your Jool 5 rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get into a parking orbit around Duna, decouple both probes and they\u0027ll be called Jool 5 probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be fixed if we could name the probe parts and the command pods while in VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust right click on a probe/pod and change it\u0027s name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main configuration would still be called Jool 5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen decoupling a probe/pod, it wouldn\u0027t inherit the main name, but use the name which is stored in the decoupled part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratoroc","CreatedById":73987,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please. Let every commanding part be uniquely labeled in the VAB. Also maybe show the status of docked vessels in the tracking center as \u0022docked with XX\u0022 and keep the flight active and selectable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T14:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea in general (names per probe core/command module), I have placed similar suggestion in the past, too. But I\u0027m not sure defining these names in VAB is the right place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s that classical design/mission discrepancy. Design is \u0022space shuttle\u0022, that\u0027s what you make and save in VAB. Mission is \u0022STS-90\u0022, where you send \u0022space shuttle\u0022 to orbit e.g. to deploy a satellite. You may technically have single design to send probes all around the system and going to VAB to rename them every time you want to send them out may get annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this naming option should be present in the same dialog where you pick crew for the ship. Beside list of free crew positions (or even within it), there might be list of command pods/probe cores and you can assign a name/icon to each of them before the launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alex_Leonardo","CreatedById":56762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T15:08:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know you can still rename them, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, If it\u0027s a big deal, just get the extra time warp, slow it down to 1/64 and rename them before anything happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iStickyDuck","CreatedById":75908,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T22:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis idea sounds great! All my launchers have probe cores on them so that I can return them to Kerbin once they my cargo reaches orbit but sometimes there isn\u0027t enough fuel on-board so it\u0027s floating in space and impossible to find in the tracking station \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
