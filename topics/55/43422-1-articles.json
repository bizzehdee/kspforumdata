My suggestion would be to [have the ability to] bind keys to the 6 different maneuver node axis. I feel that this would not only increase the precision but also allow maneuver nodes to be set and adjusted quickly while focusing on something else (such as an intercept you\u0027re trying to hit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst time posting to this forum, so please forgive me if this is either in the wrong place or somehow violates any rules.
