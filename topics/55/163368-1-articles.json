However, there is no way to limit\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eminimum\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thrust. What I propose is an upgrade to the slider, allowing it to be slid at both ends. A real world example of this is the SuperDraco engine, which can throttle from 20% to 100% thrust.

Most engines in real life afaik have very little throttle ability, and rely on very accurate shutoff times to get into the correct orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlitz Kerman","CreatedById":178055,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-18T03:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:72px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\u0022\u003EGO FOR IT!!!!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
