What i would like to see is a toggle-able option to display the actual science reports in sandbox mode, and it could be given a box that pops up when you check it that warns about it being a spoiler and you\u0027d have more fun leaving it off and playing career mode etc. one of the things that i liked about KSP is the sandbox mode, im a huge fan of sandbox games, and this is one thing that actually bugged me enough to make a suggestion about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGaunt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T05:52:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaunt596\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gaunt596\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eit being a spoiler and you\u0027d have more fun leaving it off and playing career mode etc.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have de-suggested your suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaunt596","CreatedById":70172,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T20:54:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Algiark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Algiark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have de-suggested your suggestion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno, i meant having a warning for those new to the game that turning on this option spoils all of the science experiment readouts. and i noticed in career mode that the Mk 2 cockpit is missing, that why i suggested this, as i use the Mk 2 cockpit more than any of the others\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
