There are so man mods out there that have been effectively implementing proper and realistic fairings from the earliest iterations of this game. Full stop these fairings need to be fixed. I love the way the fairings are placed on the rocket. Squad has creative a new and unique way of making fairings. I actually like that. However the smallest fix that would make the confetti fairings tolerable, is that the separation should be slower. Now I am all for fun over realism. They separation of the fairings is very kerbal. Of course the kerbals would make the fairings explode away. If thats the case they just need to be slower because as of now it just looks like they are exploding away as if they are on time warp. So if we cant get clamshell fairings then please slow down the separation."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:31:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You have my sword.\n\u003E - - - Updated - - -\n\u003E \n\u003E This is not solely a question of aesthetics but of verisimilitude, which is not subjective.\n\nTell that to the people who don\u0027t want realistic aerodynamics in the game either."},{"CreatedByName":"Rocketfeline","CreatedById":137938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T21:33:34Z","Content":"I support.
