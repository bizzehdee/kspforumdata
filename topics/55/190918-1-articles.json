Twice now in an early career game I\u0027ve put my craft in Munar orbit according to the map view, only to find that I was suddenly\u00A0back in Kerbin orbit as I approached my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E. The second time I actually lowered it by half at least from the altitude of its initial appearance before hitting timewarp, and yet still I escaped the Mun instead of staying in orbit. Rather infuriating really. What gives? Is this just some kind of deliberate early career crappiness or is there something wrong with how that level of the tracking station is implemented?

This, as I\u0027m sure you know, is not about me not being able to get into Munar orbit. It\u0027s about the supposed navigational aids in early career making it excessively, unfairly difficult to do so by actually showing you false information about your trajectory in the map view. Lots of people have explained to me now how it is the game does that, which I understand now, thank you, but nobody has come close to explaining to me why it was a good idea for the developers to have made it thus in the first place. If somebody like me messes up two missions in a row and gets annoyed enough to make a forum post about it because the map view lied to them, the consternation that \u0022feature\u0022 causes could easily make somebody in their first 100 hours of game play to just throw the game against the wall and never play it again. That is the point I was trying to make.

That is why it shows you entering and leaving again when you first have your Munar encounter, but not later, when you may have lowered yourself to an AP that crosses the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary but would remain bound to the Mun otherwise. Presumably that will be true for Kerbin too, but I haven\u0027t tried. And that is the part that I find unfair and deceptive.\u00A0 After the first-level upgrade, you get to see everything, including times, speeds, intersects, maneuver nodes, and what your trajectory will be after you leave your current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I guess what I\u0027m suggesting is that it would be much more fair to the player if they did still show the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary at Level 1, but none of the other stuff. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are indeed part of the patched conics system, but the patched conics themselves are the trajectories that are spliced together, not\u00A0 the (arbitrary) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary itself.\u00A0 So just not showing you those or any of the other useful information still seems both reasonable and consistent to me with the statement \u0022patched conics not visible\u0022 for the Level 1 station. Anyway, for my own part I\u0027ve obviously played way past that particular annoyance in my game and will never fall victim to it again, but I still feel like what I said would be a better way to do it in terms of game play than the way it works now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-01-13T21:20:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2020 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Electrollama","CreatedById":196847,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-31T08:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t read the long comments, but I agree that the trajectory prediction should be cropped at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E boundary.
