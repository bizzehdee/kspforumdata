The goal of the contract is to DESIGN and sell a commercial airliner. Later in the game, I would like to see a space tourism contract from Kerbal Airlines. The Spacecraft will be restricted to a certain gee-force and any more than that Gee-Force and the mission will fail. Additionally these Kerbals will not produce control. Space Tourist Kerbals will be selected from the Crew tab and they will have a blue/cyan tab instead of grey, similar to experimental parts. They will also wear the recruit-style jumpsuit while in flight and on EVA, and will die if they EVA without the right air.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-08T14:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think space tourists should be able to eva, its a game afterall, no insurance companies to stop them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut along these lines, there could be a contract to bring a vip to a base, provided the game sees you have a base on a body somewhere, or to a station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
