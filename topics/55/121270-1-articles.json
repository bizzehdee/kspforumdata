You could put a million fuel flow breaking decouplers between your plane and your payload and you would still get to orbit with empty payload tanks. Something is clearly wrong there, that shouldn\u0027t happen. That\u0027s the main issue, that fuel crossfeed isn\u0027t respected by STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW. If crossfeed is set to false on any part, fuel should never crossfeed, it\u0027s simple. To have common cases where fuel does crossfeed causes confusion and frustration. You can post workarounds and fixes and whatever, but that\u0027s no solution at all, it\u0027s a workaround to a problem that shouldn\u0027t exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, not a bug, just a very poorly implmented \u0027feature\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T11:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s ignored as the engines have the same rule as RCS thrusters and monoprop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T14:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want fuel to be drained from your payload, disable its tanks (green arrow next to the bar)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T18:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI report it as a bug because IT IS A BUG!

Saying to disable crossfeed on your tanks is simply NOT a solution for highly specialized landing vessels that use numerous small tanks to keep a compact profile, or for landers inside fairings or cargo bays. where the act of re-enabling them for use/disabling them for stowing would be exceptionally tedious.

It lets you set pumping levels and enable automatic pumping and balancing. This means, if i set my lander to level 0, my orbital platform to level 1, and my stages kept subsequently higher levels, then I can have the GPO maintain the levels of my lander\u0027s tanks, simply by being docked with the orbital platform or launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-04T19:57:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2015 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by richfiles\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T19:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts not a bug it\u0027s laziness (not that there is a difference) they should have written a new flow mode for jets that respected cross feed while pulling evenly from their stage, but instead for the rush to 1.0 they got lazy and slapped the monoprop flow mode on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T01:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf \u0022disable crossfeed\u0022 DOESN\u0027T do this, then what DOES it do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T01:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pincushionman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pincushionman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf \u0022disable crossfeed\u0022 DOESN\u0027T do this, then what DOES it do?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes sure the kerbals don\u0027t steal each other\u0027s snacks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"richfiles","CreatedById":129946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T02:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pincushionman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pincushionman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf \u0022disable crossfeed\u0022 DOESN\u0027T do this, then what DOES it do?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBugger all if I know? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwbrase","CreatedById":150131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T03:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022richfiles\u0022 data-cite=\u0022richfiles\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt takes a LOT of gall to say \u0022this is not a bug\u0022!
