Where you get the all the screen space to build, then while holding q a menu shows up covering the whole screen with the parts menu. you click a part and it spawns into the world, where you get the whole screen to work again. Best way to do it, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T12:03:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen this specifically suggested before, though it probably has been. Not recently, though, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like the UI is going to see a bit of an improvement at some point. Maybe even a complete redesign. I mean, a lot of things in KSP are still placeholder, so maybe the part menu is too. Either way, this would certainly be a small but largely beneficial modification to the way the UI works right now so I can dig it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teodzero","CreatedById":76759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T12:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere should be scroll bar instead of pages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T12:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr drop-down menus, with subcategories (which are already listed in cfg.
