You might also find other star systems might have different resource ratios. So, the Kerbol system might have a whole load of the resources required to get things up and running, but only rare amounts of the resources required to build the more advanced rocket/stargate/whatever parts. Other star systems might have a far more plentiful supply of the more exotic resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, from a pure game engine development point of view, I think multiple star systems would be a good thing. iD and Epic already license out their flagship game engines to 3rd parties, as they allow developers to build an arena-based shooter or other 3D game in a fraction of the time it would take to build everything from scratch.

I was thinking something similar could be implemented, you fly at the \u0027McGuffin Gate/Object\u0027, and depending on your initial velocity/angle - you will then be sling-shotted off into a distance that may be logarithmically/square etc. proportional to these values. If you use the right values you can be thrown to a different star system near the target planet, if you\u0027re off a bit you may be on the outside, if you\u0027re off by a margin more you wind up lost...in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe above solution would require skill in setting the correct apoapsis and burn times for the encounter with the \u0027McGuffin Gate/Object\u0027, it could be fun and rewarding, yet comical if you get it wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re able to find these other star systems with \u0027McGuffin Gate/Objects\u0027 using the telescopes/radio telescopes you research on Kerbin, and they show up on a larger map of the galaxy/cluster etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this may be able to keep the spirit of building simple rocket ships, but also expanding the KSP universe and keeping it fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough warp drives are a good idea, they don\u0027t seem to be in the spirit of what KSP is trying to achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all of the above, as mentioned previously I would rather see FTL/other systems implemented in DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T07:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite, and by far the one I see most fitting to the Kerbalverse, is the Kearny-Fuchida Jumpdrive, from the Battletech franchise.

Meaning that the drive is limited to Zenith and Nadir points, requiring a polar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we have a large, power-dependent drive system that needs a slow recharge between uses, can only be used for inter-system travel (or jumping between the Zenith and Nadir of the same star if you want), and requires establishing a polar orbit around the Sun with a certain apoapsis to use. This means a single big carrier craft - a JumpShip - with a number of smaller ships docked to it to perform the actual exploration and work. Operation requires good design, skill in docking and ability to establish a difficult orbit. In other words, it\u0027s a perfect test of KSP aptitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe carrier doesn\u0027t even necessarily have to be heavy on the parts - the only important ones are the jumpdrive, the fuel cell, and the array of several large solar panels to keep it recharging. The rest is just typical fuel and nuclear engines. The amount of Delta-V to get a polar orbit might be pretty large though, so if that\u0027s actually too difficult to be practical at all, I suppose changing it to be \u0022just very far away from the Sun\u0022 should be good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T10:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry but faster than light travel is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E.
