Comparing the 3 numbers in Group B is much much easier to do with the alignment on the decimals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next issue is the decimal place. Why show us 1/10th of a Dollar in costs, but neglect anything less than 1 dollar in your funds. If we round to the nearest dollar for our bank, then our costs should do the same. else we are not seeing our full balance as the decimal place is hidden from us. in any case both the costs and the balance should follow the same rounding rules and show the same number of digits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo better explain what i mean, I spent a few minutes in Photoshop making a quick representation of what I feel it should properly look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis Is Clean And Easy to Read:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hqrRg58.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hqrRg58.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note, that it was a quick toss-together in Photoshop meant only to illustrate a point. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E that using the same space, you can provide a much cleaner UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how The cost value is now shown with digit group separation (,) as well as having the digits aligned with the current funds.\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003E( ones over ones, thousands over thousands)\u003C/span\u003E making it easy to read how much you are spending, but also easy to compare that spending with your current funds. In this example I added the decimal point to the current funds, But since there is nothing in the game that costs you less than 1, realistically it should just be removed from both numbers. You will also notice that the Dials showing your current funds are no longer just 1 long bar, but are actually 3 pairs of 3 each. (more digit group separation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not perfect, as the bottom bar seems a bit crowded now (i did separate digits AND add in a 9th digit to the bars original 8 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) but it would be reasonably easy to fix with a little effort, considering how little time it took me to make the improvements i have thus far.
