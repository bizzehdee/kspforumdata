We know the asteroid that ended the dinosaurs was approximately 10km in size, is it too far fetched to suggest similar asteroids / comets for KSP2? Perhaps they could even have very weak gravity to allow \u0027walking\u0027 on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-23T18:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyhea but what would you do at these astroids. i guess they could give you a lot of science points but since we dont know how the science sysstem will work idk about this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
