I\u0027m very new to Kerbal and just sort of figuring my way out as I go along. So anyway, I got the Beta Than Ever patch and started working my way through career mode. I faked my way to a surveying rocket within the 30 part limit (2 Rockomax BACC for lift, attached to wings / LV-T45 engine \u0026amp; fuel, \u002B 4 parachutes for a soft landing) and made my way through the first surveys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then accepted my first \u0022EVA\u0022 survey mission, and while I was able to land essentially directly on top of the navigation marker (I wish I\u0027d taken a screenshot but it was near midnight and I was about to go to bed) when I got out of the craft to EVA I didn\u0027t receive any notification that I was at the navigation marker, despite it being selected on my Navball. In fact, what happened was as soon as I stepped out of the craft I could no longer see any navigation markers or Navball, and zooming out to \u0022continental\u0022 zoom levels showed no indication of where the EVA was supposed to take place. Worse still when I was at the Navball / Tracker map you can\u0027t zoom in close enough so I was left with a marker for my ship obscuring / on top of the marker for the navigation point so I couldn\u0027t even work out what direction I might need to walk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, unless I\u0027m missing something I feel there should be some way of honing in on where the EVA Navigation contracts are supposed to be completed once you\u0027re actually on EVA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T01:33:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, welcome to the forums (and KSP!) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E There is a search feature in the top right corner (it\u0027s a little derpy sometimes mind), but I think in this case you\u0027re in the clear.
