The high mass for example, as well as deployment method. Those are things which i\u0027d like to see fixed, and they are important, but they\u0027re not really about the aerodynamic model. Instead, the only aerodynamic aspect relevant to chutes, is that right now deacceleration in atmosphere seems way too easy.... so easy, that often a drogue or airbrake is just dead weight, since you might as well simply throttle down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T11:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s wrong with Lithobraking ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T11:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBasically, I would love to see RealChute made stock.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeh, RealChutes is nice, but it has some serious feature creep happening at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core features of RealChutes are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- gentler deployment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- a better variety of chutes (inline chutes plox! moar drogues!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the brake-chute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(you could do the brake-chute thing without the massive panel of RealChutes by just having a simple tweakable toggle button that goes from \u0022standard autocut\u0022 to \u0022manual autocut\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they could pick up these core features in stock, it would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T16:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Renegrade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Renegrade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E- gentler deployment\u003Cp\u003E- the brake-chute\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are basically the features I want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
