Can we have some\u00A0extra or renameable tabs please? Perhaps an Archive or Historic tab for ships that we don\u0027t really need anymore, but want to keep for whatever reason would be nice. This would really help to declutter the current ship lists and gives some other choices than just deleting our works of love.

I use that sort of external folder system, with various sorted ship folders in my KSP backup folder, but it would be nice to have some sort of configurable system to organize vehicles in-game. Along the same lines, it would be nice to have a way to transfer subassemblies between saves without having to copy the file into the new ships folder, then load up that ship and transfer it into the chosen subassemblies folder manually. I think in general the way vehicles are organized in-game could use some improvements for ease of use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T16:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222937144\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485611092\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that it reads the folder for available .craft files each time the load-ship dialog pops up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can confirm it does. \u00A0 I use your method all the time to move ships between my current game and the sandbox (because I can\u0027t simulate a full Duna mission in a campaign save for example) and back again without exiting KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-28T19:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174337-fendoburn/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022174337\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174337-fendoburn/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Fendoburn\u003C/a\u003E, and I really like your idea.
