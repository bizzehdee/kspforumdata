\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, when Kennedy said the USA was going to the Moon, the NASA Space Program became ALL ABOUT the moon. \u00A0Every thing they did was geared towards this goal (generally, I\u0027m sure they did other things, although I\u0027m not sure testing a parachute while splashed down was one of them). \u00A0In Strategia, you get to CHOOSE a goal for your space program. \u00A0For example, \u0022Plant Flag on Mun\u0022 - this gives more incentive to land on the Mun, while penalising any other planets / moons you land on while this goal is active. \u00A0This is kind of a start, not ideal but a start.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I suggest is implemented, and I don\u0027t think this would be too much work as its just a rejig of the current system:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) We choose our Space Programs Goal (lets say landing on the Mun). \u00A0From that point ALL contracts are geared towards that goal. \u00A0Lifter tests, Kerbin Orbits in the proposed Lander etc. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) We can have a few different categories of Space Program Goals - Exploration, Probing, Terrestrial for example - Exploration is our chosen goal to explore somewhere, The Mun for example (as in point 1). \u00A0Probing is our goal to send a probe somewhere (maybe unlocking that location for a possible Exploration goal once complete) like Duna. \u00A0Terrestrial goal would be getting data from and around Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) While science is great for unlocking the tech tree, I would like to see it linked to unlocking future goals also. \u00A0For example, we can\u0027t choose Duna as an Exploration goal unless we have enough science from Kerbin, or the Mun etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice this is how I see it working:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeginning of the game, we can only choose a Terrestrial Goal: \u00A0Get to Orbit. \u00A0This will give us contracts like, test Lifter, test Launches, Test Launch Escape System, Leave Atmosphere, Get to Orbit. \u00A0GOAL COMPLETE. \u00A0Now we\u0027re in space we can choose an Exploration Goal and a Probe Goal. \u00A0Exploration Goal would be Land On Mun. \u00A0Contracts then appear like, Build Lander, Test Lander in Kerbin Orbit, Fly By Mun, Orbit Mun, Land on Mun. \u00A0At the same time our Probe goal is active which would be to build a probe to get to Duna with contracts such as Design Probe, Test Probe around Kerbin, Test Prove around Mun, Put Probe into Orbit around Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm sure you get the idea, but overall id LOVE to see this or something similar implemented for Career mode because all it feels like now is a Grind for Science without any real targets. \u00A0Yes we can create self imposed goals, but we can do that in Sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, thanks for reading this far!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-06T07:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2016 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by funkcanna\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T07:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EliasDanger","CreatedById":151803,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T14:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like this would be good. I just get frustrated cuz the contracts\u00A0come in no order. Its too easy to miss out on the flyby duna contract, cuz you got the explore duna contrace first, and already landed or at least went orbital around the planet before that contract ever popped up. A step by step logical progression would be ideal. The option to jump ahead a few contracts is fine if you don\u0027t want to do all the initial Lead up contracts...but they should make it where explore duna doesn\u0027t appear until after you\u0027ve had the option to accept or reject the flyby mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-06T17:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really like your third point because it would make the game a bit too linear.
