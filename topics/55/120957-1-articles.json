Low rep results in you lacking the status to get desirable missions, and ultimately can kill your program outright. So you get budget, and if you fail too badly, you\u0027re in deep trouble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if short of KCT, you could have a simple metric whereby the \u0022Difficulty Level\u0022 setting, instead of Reverts/No Reverts and Quicksave/No Quicksave would instead have Infinite Reverts (easy), X Reverts (Medium), 1-2 Reverts (Hard). Reverts in this case represent simulations/testing. After that first \u0022launch\u0022 (simulation) it keeps track, and if you exit the VAB without actually launching, it charges you the most expensive of your reverts, even if you don\u0027t launch. This would keep people from reverting, then deleting all but one part. In fact, even if you do launch, it charges you the most you have spent in this revert cycle of launches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you make a design at 50k cost, and it doesn\u0027t make it to orbit and you revert. The 2d try is way overbuilt and costs 120k, so your 3d try you reduce the parts and it\u0027s 90k. You go with the 3d craft. It will cost 120k this launch, but if you load it later and use it, it\u0027s just the 90k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick saves are trickier. You need those because of the kraken, etc. Perhaps Diff levels could allow quick save as it is now, no quick saves for masochists, and in between, perhaps rep hits for loading a quick save after the first or second. So QS as much as you like, but if you reload after the kraken, then no hit, but if you load saves all the time, you lose a little more rep each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis make diff level less about grind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
