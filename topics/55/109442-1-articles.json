In my early/mid career SSTO\u0027s I end up re-purposing the named action groups (RCS, Stage, even abort) to toggle engines and on some orbital probes I use Gear (G) to deploy solar panels. While that does work, it doesn\u0027t feel right and craft end up with a very strange set of controls. \n\nIf one of the aims of career mode is to guide new players, then part of that should be about using action groups. As it is, I suspect most new players won\u0027t re-purpose the named action groups for things like solar panels or engine toggles, so they\u0027re left having to right click on everything which is kinda clunky and it won\u0027t be until much later in the game that they get to witness the full majesty of a craft unfolding all it\u0027s panels in unison (something I still really enjoy seeing).\n\n(There are ways to get around not having custom action groups in career, but they are kinda hacky and inconvenient.

They could be so much more powerful with more functionality; switching command pods is a very nice idea for that, I\u0027d also like to have them able to increase/decrease an engine\u0027s thrust limits in small steps (ie for balancing cargo VTOLs on the fly). \n\nI also think that it should be possible to add an action group to a stage, so for example you could set up an action group for deploying solar panels, and then click an \u0022add to stage\u0022 button and get an icon for that group appear in the staging list and move it about like any other stage list icon. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah, I\u0027m inclined to agree and say that Squad made a mistake having action groups as part of the facilities upgrade system.

I also agree that in career (and I tend to focus on small craft in career) there is no need to fully upgrade the SPH/VAB except for getting action groups and then to get that in both costs you several million (Jeb feels ripped off).

It feels kinda broken, as it\u0027s currently implemented.\n\nI like that KSP building upgrades, and putting a limit on \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Epart count\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E for the VAB level makes sense to me.  But the restriction on \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eaction groups\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E seems kinda tacked-on; it\u0027s arbitrary, and it breaks that willing-suspension-of-disbelief thing that makes KSP so immersive.  I totally buy *\u0022okay, we can\u0027t build really complex ships with lots of parts until we upgrade our infrastructure.\u0022*  But I just can\u0027t make myself swallow the idea that *\u0022we have the technology to land a kerbal on the Mun, but we don\u0027t have the technology to make \u003Cthing\u003E happen when I press \u003Cbutton\u003E.\u0022\u003C/button\u003E\u003C/thing\u003E*\n\nWhat makes it especially egregious is that the VAB is so expensive.  It takes a lot of cash to upgrade it, especially to level 2.  I\u0027m fine with high cost as a barrier to *\u003Cu\u003Epart count\u003C/u\u003E* (it makes for some interesting game challenges, such as \u0022okay, how do I build this Minmus mission with no more than 30 parts\u0022), but I don\u0027t like high cost as a barrier to *\u003Cu\u003Eaction groups\u003C/u\u003E*.\n\nSo this seems like something that needs fixing.  Some ideas:\n\n1. **Move them down one notch** in the upgrade path.  Basic action groups available by default.  Custom action groups available after upgrading VAB by one tier.  (I\u0027d be okay with slightly lowering the part count limit for the one-upgrade VAB to compensate, if need be.  255 parts is practically \u0022effective infinity\u0022 to me, since very rarely do I launch something with more parts than that.  I\u0027d be fine with lowering that to, say, 120 parts, or the like.)\n2. Link action groups to **tech tree nodes**. Basic action groups are available with Engineering 101.  Custom action groups available with Flight Control.  (Doesn\u0027t necessarily have to be those exact nodes, but should be something low enough in the tech tree that by the time you want action groups, you have them.)\n3. Just make **all action groups available from the get-go**.  (I kinda like the idea of requiring at least *\u003Cu\u003Esome\u003C/u\u003E* sort of progress to unlock action groups, so I\u0027d prefer one of the above solutions to this one.  But I\u0027d prefer this solution to what we have now.)"},{"CreatedByName":"LorenLuke","CreatedById":9830,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T16:53:52Z","Content":"Perhaps, if level 1 is basic and level 2 is numbered action groups, have level 3 be an \u0027on the fly\u0027 capability to edit the action groups.

In-flight removal of action group participants (for when you dock two craft together permanently and need to deconflict groups, removes parts from action groups only, equivalent of simply unplugging a memory module; you can take it out, but you just don\u0027t have anything to replace it with.).\n\u003C/resource\u003E\u003C/part\u003E\n\n(Tier 2 real life equivalent: rudimentary transistor technology, non-writable permanent memory storage (rope core, ROM, etc.), still requires most things to be set up prior to launch but can help take task loading off the crew.)\n\nTier 3: in-flight addition of action groups (think of this like going from rope core memory in the Apollo era, could not be reprogrammed in flight, to EPROM chips that can be updated in flight) and an expansion on the complexity of logic systems.\n\n(Tier 3 real life equivalent: full up integrated circuitry with deep programming/scripting ability coupled with readable/writable permanent memory storage: flash, hard disk, floppy, continuous tape, solid state, etc.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-26T11:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2016 11:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Yaivenov**"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-27T09:06:32Z","Content":"YES!
