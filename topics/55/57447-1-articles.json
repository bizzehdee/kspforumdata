Not sure if this was intended, but it seems like an oversight to me. Either the science returns from the Mun and Minmus need to be reduced somewhat, or the part tree should be reworked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manskal","CreatedById":73159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T13:54:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf .24 is going to focus on economy and reputation, then I foresee large changes in the tech tree and how we acquire parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, career is a WIP, which is to say that there are more parts of it broke than parts already done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T16:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a balance issue that will get attended to later. Right now, it\u0027s basically impossible to balance because most of the bodies in the game still do not have their biomes. I imagine that once all biomes have been defined for all planets, then appropriate reward values will get adjusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, just do what I do, which is only unlock 1 tech node per science mission, regardless of the science value. Maybe 2 nodes if you hit a neat milestone or REALLY want something for the next mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
