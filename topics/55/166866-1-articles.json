If you just rendezvous without paying much attention, about half of them will occur during the night side of the orbit. Unless you have owl eyes and/or have bright lights on your station, you\u0027re probably going to park nearby and warp until sunrise so you can dock without worrying about shearing off the solar panels or even just finding the port (partly why I put the batteries with the little green LED on my ports).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, on topic: I think a more smooth movement of the camera upon docking would be nice, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s really at the top of my list of priorities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
