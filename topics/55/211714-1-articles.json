The engine also slows down so that the recording has a steady framerate, so even mediocre PCs can record constant-60fps max graphics footage with enough time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDifferent game, but hopefully Intercept takes inspiration.

One possible solution could be to use a third-party program or tool to take screenshots of your game. There are many options available, such as OBS Studio or Fraps, which can capture high-quality screenshots while the game is running.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother option is to use the built-in screenshot functionality of your operating system, which can be accessed by pressing a hotkey (such as \u0022Print Screen\u0022 or \u0022Win\u002BPrint Screen\u0022 on Windows) or by using a screenshot tool. This will capture an image of your entire screen, which you can then crop or edit as needed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternatively, you could try pausing the game and manually adjusting the graphics settings to take a screenshot, as you suggested. This can be done through the game\u0027s settings menu or by using a third-party tool such as GeForce Experience, which allows you to adjust the graphics settings of your game while it is running.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUltimately, the best solution will depend on your specific needs and preferences. I hope these suggestions help you find a way to take high-quality screenshots of your game without impacting performance too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
