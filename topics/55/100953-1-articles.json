It\u0027s just a bit out-of-place on a presumably \u0022mysterious\u0022 object. Unless of course it\u0027s meant as a way to let Kerbals know they\u0027re really just characters in a game...\n\nOf course, this isn\u0027t a huge problem right now as a number of the monoliths are still buried or partially buried."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T18:48:46Z","Content":"I don\u0027t agree. The SQUAD logo on the monoliths is a sort of trademark stamp on their product. It\u0027s a similar thing with the Armstrong memorial on the Mun- Neil Armstrong is a human, not a Kerbal, and has no connection with the game whatsoever. Should we remove this memorial too?\n\nThese things are easter eggs, and as such aren\u0027t really canonical to the Kerbal story, what little canon there actually is."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T19:03:47Z","Content":"Those things used to be cannon in an actual planned story though. Then the story got scrapped. So they remains as they are."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T19:21:16Z","Content":"Squad is the Progenitor Race, or more specifically, members of the progenitor race that formed the corporation or company that created/changed/terraformed the Kerbal Solar System.\n\nIf anything, this should be cherished as a way of linking the Kerbal Universe into a deeper conspiracy of mystery and wonder. And I still wish the easter-egg subvplot was still in the plan.\n\nIf there was ever an insane, superdistant frozen progenitor planet, it should be very similar to Earth in continental layout, but at the same time be the size and gravity as Earth."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T07:33:39Z","Content":"I do think certain screenshots would look a lot more awesome if the monoliths were smooth featureless surfaces."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T07:38:23Z","Content":"They give the monoliths a unique, \u0022KSP\u0022 feel to it.

It kind of ruins the immersion when you land in a deep, deep crater in pitch blackness and walk towards a mysterious object using only your helmet lights, and as you approch you see...Bonzo.
