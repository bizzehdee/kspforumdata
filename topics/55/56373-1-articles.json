Consider... what is it, exactly that people like about the idea of resources? Speaking for myself, and several other regular posters who have explicitly stated this, and perhaps the forum in general, the thing that we liked about resources was that it gave us some kind of \u0022objective\u0022, or goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what exactly do we mean by that? Does the science system do the same thing? That\u0027s also a goal... but several players, including myself, see a difference. In fact, given that the squad statements are to the effect that resources were turning out to be grindy, I suspect that squad was discovering that resources worked too much like science points, and we have already experienced the \u0022grindy\u0022 problems with science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s the dealL KSP is, at its core, a sandbox. So when we talk about goals and rewards, what would we mean? Here are some common objective-reward types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Plot advancement. This one is obvious, but KSP does not, and will not, be a game based around a plot, so the objective-reward system in KSP can\u0027t be to advance the plot with the reward of seeing how that plot unfolds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) An alternative to a plot based game is an empire building game. Terraria is such a game. While there is no plot, there are a number of stages of progression through the game, from basic mining, to crafting, boss fights, a transition to a whole new mode with interactions between various parts of the environment, and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) An extension to empire building games is to see how the \u0022total system\u0022 you have built behaves under the various automatic processes that occur within it. The canonical example here would be Sim City. There are certain processes occurring... traffic, population movement, etc, and as you build your empire your challenge is to optimize these processes, with the reward being a well functioning, elegant system where, say, traffic flows perfectly, the population is happy, and so on. Tycoon games would fall into this category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) There are other kinds of objective-reward systems as well that are, conceptually, simpler. For example, an entertaining little pre rendered video when the player achieves something is an objective with a reward. A lot of older games fall into this category - simple shoot-em-up games with a little cutscene once you have won the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what most people expected from resources would be a conversion from a pure sandbox into a type 2 or possibly type 3 game, in which your space program is a form of empire you would be building, because that is the kind of thing that people who have done a lot in the game tend to do by default. They have bases everywhere, satellites everywhere, fuel stations, big intersterllar motherships in various places, and so on. What they are missing right now is something that connects all of those disparate things together into some kind of unified whole... an empire if you will. It\u0027s easy to see why resources would play a role in a game like that (analogously, ores in Terraria). And so the fact that Squad has dropped resources may suggest to some people that they have dropped the concept of making that transition. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are a couple of problems with that expectation. First, as far as I know Squad has not said whether or not that kind of shift in gametype was something that they intended to develop, so assuming that resources was leading up to that might be mistaken. Second, if Squad do intend to make that transition, there may well be other ways to implement it that do not require resources in the way that we have been discussing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I put the question to the readers out there: What kind of objective-reward gametype would you ultimately like to see? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType 0 - strict sandbox, just what we have now. No change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType 1 - Plot based (this seems unlikely)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType 2 - Empire building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType 3 - Empire building with systemic interactions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType 4 - Identical to type 0 but with \u0022cute\u0022 rewards, like little cutscenes on certain achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType x - Something else!

As you say, if \u0022resources\u0022 just means you can send a machine and have it sit there doing \u0022resource gathering\u0022, but with nothing stemming from that, well, that\u0027s just another still life you have sitting out on a planet somewhere.

In most of them this just happens automatically, so there\u0027s no grinding. Now, that kind of automation would be difficult to achieve in KSP for resources. What we\u0027d need would be something like the automatic movement of those resources around the system - which I\u0027m not sure is really feasible.
