At times I was driving blind with the visual enhancements mod blowing red sand and dust around until I saw the face through the red haze. Without cool stuff to see and find, landing on planets is still just planting a flag and flying home. I think every planet and moon should have interesting things scattered around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t it be cool if you could explore underwater caves on Laythe or fly between loose rocks and moonlets around Bop?

Find out what happened to Jose Kermans expedition to Dres. The ship is empty so you find a Lander on the surface. There are rover tracks leading away.
