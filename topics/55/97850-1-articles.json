In contrast, Reputation shows as a bar going from \u0022bad\u0022 to \u0022good.\u0022 This bar has a couple numbers on it; as far as I can tell, the numbers have nothing whatsoever to do with your actual numeric reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is fine if all you care about is if you have a little reputation or a lot of reputation. However, there *is* a number associated with reputation, and this number isn\u0027t hidden from the player -- all contracts and the Admin Building talk in terms of that number. This means that if cancelling a contract or adopting a strategy, we pay a reputation cost that is presented to us numerically, with absolutely no idea how much or how little reputation we\u0027re spending or how much we have to spend. These are both permanent actions, as far as I know; the only way to see the actual effect on reputation is to quicksave, cancel the contract or adopt the strategy, see the new reputation, and reload from save if we don\u0027t like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis really doesn\u0027t make much sense. If you want numeric reputation to be behind the scenes, so players don\u0027t have to worry about \u0022is that a lot or a little\u0022 and to implement some sort of diminishing returns, then don\u0027t treat reputation like a currency when adding or subtracting it -- say how it changes our reputation in a way that makes sense to someone looking at the bar. If you want to treat it like a currency, then either drop the bar, or add a numeric display for the actual value of our rep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T06:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
