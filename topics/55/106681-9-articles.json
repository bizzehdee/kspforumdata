I had been playing with FAR prior to 1.0 and while it is realistic and fun, it might be bit too difficult for some people because of sudden unplanned disassembly caused by stress, and I therefore liked 1.0 aero, which is FAR-like in terms of drag and whatnot, but without all that added difficulty that comes with that level of realism (i might check out nuFAR). I never managed to make a proper SSTO either in pre-1.0 stock (too slow due to the soup) or with FAR (stress breaking). I do mostly rockets, but with 1.0 aero I consider I might try to build a cargo SSTO because of how forgiving it is to those inexperienced with spaceplanes, i.e. I can actually flip/brake sideways and not blow up to smithereens. With new aero \u0022fix\u0022 I find it more soupy and less enjoyable. Really Squad, it is too much to ask you to create an aero switch?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really a matter of difficulty, it was just tedious to have all the flap settings, menus everywhere (one thing i always hated with FAR\u002Bmany other mods, too many menus and crap), and it want worth it imo back then. Right now there is stock disassembly too, its just not anywhere near FAR levels, if you try to pull up more then a bit at mach-3 you will explode, simple as that. I actually liked near the best, but didnt feel like loosing SSTO to laythe and beyond capabilities (yes im one of those that absolutely abused airhogging and jets being OP). Now that stock aero is more logical and jets are nolonger the instant get into space free ticket, im pretty much redesigning everything to work with the new system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm hoping squad takes a good look at what they did (and if they really insist upon teh new drag, then they should buff most engines by around 20% or so in the ISP department to compensate for the extra drag.
