One one hand, it looks like Squad has put a lot of work into making them work well and work right, and on the other hand, that means more complexity on the user end. Much as it\u0027s difficult for players to modify wing part config files (what the hell is a float value anyways?!), I worry that modded parts could be left out from career mode if the tech tree isn\u0027t easily modifiable on the user end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, that could completely ruin the game if users were allowed to cheat their way through the tech tree.

Anyway, as I understand it each part file needs a single value telling it where to appear in the tech tree, so it\u0027s not exactly going to be hard for mod authors to make their parts available in the tree. Furthermore, there are some hidden nodes added specifically for use by mods and/or future features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
