This might not do much right now, but could prove to be a very useful structure in the campaign for mission planning, site location, exploration of the system, tracking of weather/cloud cover/launch conditions if weather is added in future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be fun to check on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar landing sites and topography in a telescopic 1st person view, along with flight tracking, sure, but there would be a lot of other creative ways to utilize such a facility. There are a lot of options out there for ways to utilize such a facility if one were interested, including rough estimation of astral body sizes, gravitational fields, composition, distance, rotation speeds, etc.. Radio and optical options for observatories both offer interesting opportunities to limit the information available to players prior to probes/manned exploration in the campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, this is a long term wish for me - especially because I realize it\u0027s not terribly useful in the sandbox mode where the solar system is your oyster from program day 1. However, if it\u0027s useful for the campaign, I think it could be a really positive addition. Combining it and the features of the tracking center together would be helpful to avoid overwhelming players with facilities and functions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also brings about the possibility of orbital or deep space telescopes as parts for future updates, as well. It would be fun to launch and service a Hubble-style mission eventually, yes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a cursory search on this topic before suggesting it, and saw that a couple of people had mentioned the possibility, but not really gone into details. So I thought it might be an interesting topic of discussion - if there were an observatory/multiple observatories around Kerbin, what would you like to do with them? Or would you not want them at all? Too complicated? Too cool?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, first post, yada yada yada.
