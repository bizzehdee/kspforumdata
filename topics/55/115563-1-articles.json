You can choose from three default playlists:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Whimsical. Experience the childlike awe and wonder of the magic of the Cosmos with this Whimsical track. (This is the current track.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Bleak. Space can be scary, dangerous, and even disasterous, sometimes even a bit sad when things go wrong. For those times when your Kerbals are waiting to get back home after some kind of failure, or loss of crew, this Bleak track will support the mood. (Songs will be like\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/cRHpFXEx9pc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, I am pretty sure Kevin Macleod wrote it but I can\u0027t seem to find it. At any rate it would sound similar to that.)\u003Cp\u003E3: Classical. Almost like a neat midpoint between the two is the Classical Music track. Including music from various famous Earth composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, Strauss, other people, and Holst. If you are content and peaceful in your spaceflight, perhaps space is routine for you, or perhaps it soothes and provides concentration, the Classical Track is for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Mix: Let\u0027s face it, they all sound pretty spacey, and it\u0027s not like you\u0027re susceptible to emotions anyway, right? Well if that is the case, then simply play any group of the other tracks together in some odd kind of supertrack!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe music system would allow other music to be added in and config files written for each track such as playlist order and whether or not it shuffles, or even what planets it plays around or if it plays on the surface or while flying. In Kerbin and High-Kerbolar space, the generic music would play, but holst music might play around Jool. (Bringer of Joolity!) People could add their own playlists or download others using either the gamedata folder or a specific music folder. Some more alternatives:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Ragtime. Are you feeling fast, funny, and on fire due to re-entry? Well good thing, we\u0027ve got just the thing for you! This track provides a delightful list of reallyu fast piano music. Imagine mixing classical music with whimsical music and removing the space! If you are feeling particularly \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EDanny-like\u003C/span\u003E silly, then have fun with this! (This track would have musics such as Maple Leaf Rag, and The Entertainer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a new music track starts, the title of the music is displayed for a short while where the quiksave/quickload messages appear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother neat idea would be to tie theme songs to specific Kerbals, and maybe each of the orange-suits gets their own theme written for them specifically. Jeb\u0027s would pull inspiration from the KSP title theme, Val\u0027s would come from the KSP credits theme, Bill would be loosely based on the old\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/iduBbHLGYqs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E, and Bob\u0027s would be loosely based off of the R\u0026amp;D theme.\u003Cp\u003ESome music tracks can not be changed without editing the default music folder. the Kerbal Space Program main theme and the Credits theme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther tracks could be made to substitute the VAB/SPH track, the R\u0026amp;D song, the Tracking Station song, the Mission Control song, the Astronaut Complex song (but not the chatter), and the Admin tunes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA system like this for music tracks would allow for a lot more interesting things to come from the musically talented of the KSP community, such as\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Al5xoteaZNQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.\u003Cp\u003EAll of this could add a new and interesting element to light modding of the game.
