In career mode the vast difference in efficiency with regular sequential (Saturn V) or parallel staging (Soyuz) has so far not been much of an issue. Since there were no budgets, you could build whatever you wanted. A massive sequential rocket using the 3.75m NASA parts or a smaller more efficient asparagus rocket that both could lift that the same amount of payload were just as effective. But with the introduction of budgets the 3.75m parts will no doubt be quite expensive. If the balance between these types of rockets is not right, the asparagus design will automatically be the only efficient choice. Should there be a balance and if so, how would it be achieved?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only see three options. Either move the fuel duct up a lot in the tech tree (it only requires 160 science to get too), which would make asparagus staging something OP but only after you\u0027ve launched quite a lot of rockets. One could also make fuel ducts very expensive and leave the part where it is now. This makes asparagus staging something that\u0027s quickly available and allows you to put a lot of fuel/mass into space but not immensely cost-effective. Then there\u0027s the combination of the two, i.e. late in the tech tree and not very cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T13:28:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptRobau\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T13:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus is more efficient than onion staging, but not by a tremendous amount, less than 10% in most cases.
