But balancing that sort of pod is difficult. If its 2.5m large, its to large as its competiting with the 2.5m lander can (which is already to heavy) and the 3 man command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd its hard to believe a 1.5m pod can hold two people. Kerbals just have to large of a head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must agree with the OP. Currently the MK1 lander can appears with 2.5m parts, and normally I have landed on all the nearby bodies of kerbin with the first pod. I always felt its existence there would change once we get re-entry effects, so you can\u0027t just use the lander can instead of the pod early. But for now it could be moved down a tier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I totally believe Kerbals can land without seeing where they need to go, they have all those intraments for a reason haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus what about the inline mk1 spaceplane cockpit??
