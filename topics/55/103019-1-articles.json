I have to admit that multiplayer would bring me back to this game again. There is far to much to be experienced with friends and I far doing it alone feels so incomplete. I know there is DarkMultiplayer but I had decided I would wait for the official release since HarvesteR made it sound like it would be something that would come out close to 1.0, if not in 1.0 at KerbalCon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my question is what is the story? I was giving the impression that Multiplayer would follow as soon as career mode was done, but it seems there has been very little to no news concerning it since that announcement. It is BY FAR the feature I looked forward to the most in KSP, and I have quite a few friends who are waiting for it to come out to actually get the game. The prospect of building and working together on missions, particularly in IVA and on the same ship is freaking amazing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave I missed news about this or is it just not on the radar? I really hope it hasn\u0027t been shelved, since I was hoping to see maybe even a early feature with 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T06:29:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuite some time ago, Squad announced that multiplayer would be one of the first things they work on \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eafter \u003C/span\u003E1.0.
