The current line of VASIMR engine being added to the ISS consumes \u003Cstrong\u003ETWENTY\u003C/strong\u003E times the electricity of the largest Hall effect thrusters, at 200 kw energy-consumption instead of 10 kw energy consumption... Models have been proposed scaling to 2, 20, and even 200 megawatts... (in-game, nothing larger than 200 kW would really be practical without nuclear reactors, however)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(3) Improved Thrust-Weight-Ratio\u003C/strong\u003E (TWR) compared to conventional ion engines- due to the greatly simplified internals and reduced number of moving parts compared to other ion engines (this comes at the expense of slightly lower ISP and slightly lower efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(4) Reliance on Argon rather than Xenon propellent.\u003C/strong\u003E This is a disadvantage, as Argon\u0027s lower density requires larger (volume-wise) fuel tanks than for Xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the specific part I would suggest is a VASIM based on the real-life 200 kw model. Assuming the stock ion thruster is a 10 kw model (As this is the largest conventional ion engines get), it should consume 20 times the the ElectricCharge, be configurable to operate at similar ISP for around 20 times the thrust, or 3/5th the ISP for a 66% greater thrust; and weigh \u003Cstrong\u003Eless\u003C/strong\u003E than 20 times the stock ion thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should consume Argon as a propellent, unique from Xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maelstrom Vortex","CreatedById":111435,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T08:49:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou beat me too it..

This would be as intended. And as for thrust, it wouldn\u0027t produce 20 times the thrust- remember it\u0027s less efficient. An appropriately balanced thrust for the stock game might be 15/25 kN (for high/low ISP setting, respectively), with better TWR than ion engines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"meve12","CreatedById":65193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T06:49:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther than Argon consumption, I agree with NorthStar.
