The problem is that your center of mass is so low on your rocket, and therefore behind the center of drag, so your rocket wants to fly backwards (COM in front of COD). Note that what the blue marker in the VAB shows is only center of \u003Cem\u003Elift\u003C/em\u003E, which only accounts for lifting surfaces on your vessel and not general drag.

They provide lots of control authority, equivalent to having a strong engine gimbal. Depending on ship design, they may be too strong (just as engine gimbal can be too strong, for some designs), but they certainly have their place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, they won\u0027t help your current design much. Look at how far forward your fairing is sticking out above your CoM (a long long way), and then look at how far behind your CoM the fins are (not very far). It\u0027s a much shorter lever arm than that huge long bulky fairing sticking out, and with a placement like that, I kinda doubt that any amount of fins would help you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fundamental problem here is that your CoM is far, far too low; this is a problem that many folks have, but I gotta say that the craft you\u0027ve shown is the most extreme example I\u0027ve seen in a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what can you do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re hiding in that fairing, so I don\u0027t know how much flexibility you have there. If you can make it less tall, or move its CoM upwards, that would be a step in the right direction. But probably not enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing you can do is move those radial boosters way, way down, e.g. sticking way down below the bottom of the Skipper. Then put steerable fins down at the bottom of the boosters, as low as possible. AV-R8 winglets would be good. By putting the fins very far back, you give them a longer lever arm to work with. Moving the boosters down will also make their gimbal much more effective, again by giving them a longer lever arm to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure that the fuel lines draining the boosters into the center are connected to the TOP booster tank. This will make your Skipper drain the bottom booster tanks first, which will help stability by moving CoM upwards. Unfortunately your booster engines will drain from the top down, which is bad, but there\u0027s not a lot you can do about that. At least you can configure it so that your Skipper is making the problem better rather than worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility, if you have a really awkward payload and making it more aerodynamically stable is impractical, is to settle for a less efficient ascent profile and just eat the extra expense in mass. Launch straight up, avoid going too fast, and wait until you\u0027re a lot higher than usual to start your gravity turn. Doing it this way lets you postpone the risky flip-prone turn until you\u0027re up where the air is thin and aero stability will be less of an issue. The downside is cost. For example, on your current design, you could stick a bunch of Thumpers under it (one under each radial booster, and four under a quad-coupler under the Skipper. Set their thrust appropriately so you don\u0027t go too fast too low. Then just ride the SRBs straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-07T18:48:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T22:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022silent_prtoagonist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...center of mass is so low on your rocket, and therefore behind the center of drag, so your rocket wants to fly backwards \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eive actually never thought about that, this could help with some designs (it would be great if we had a COD display in VAB)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-07T22:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022fireblade274\u0022 data-cite=\u0022fireblade274\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eive actually never thought about that, this could help with some designs (it would be great if we had a COD display in VAB)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would... the problem is that CoD is a hard thing.
