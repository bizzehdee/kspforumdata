After docking just two modules together, I had already accumulated over 80 pieces of debris floating around in space. This was slowing down my frame rate, and being a tidy person, I did not like seeing all of those entries under debris in the Tracking Center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is allow multiple flights to be selected, with ctrl or shift, in the tracking center. When multiple flights are selected, the fly button would be disabled and your only option would be terminate. Also, if some of the debris must be terminated, while other debris can be recovered, automatically do the appropriate thing to each part when mass deleting like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that pretty much covers it, looking forward to anyone\u0027s opinion on my suggestion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T16:07:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment if it\u0027s just the debris you are looking to get rid off, you can go to the option and change the max debris to 0, save/load and then switch it back.
