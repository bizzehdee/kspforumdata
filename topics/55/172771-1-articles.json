You start takeoff and you reach the end of the runway before you build enough lift. And you know the rest. What I think that KSP needs next is a runway that runs from 2 meters away from the monolith ending 4 meters from the water to 5 meters away from the hills. The runway will be added when a player in science or career mode levels up the main runway to level 2. the Runway will need to be slightly wider than the main runway for space/aircraft that can\u0027t fit or for launching\u00A04 or more fighter sized aircraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-21T18:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat could be cool. Of course, this being KSP, I\u0027d simply advice you to use rocket assisted takeoff because, you know, moar boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
