For example, jet engines have this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nresourceFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat allows balanced drain from all fuel tanks. But it is not always desireable option. Sometimes I might want for jets to drain fuel only from first stage. Jets are efficient on thick atmosphere, so could bring rocket to above 10km and drop that stage. Only after that rocket engines are fired when there is less aerodynamic forces to destroy craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example is oposite, I want to create spaceplane based on nuclear engine that drains fuel unbalanced from first fuel tank that is attached to, but for space plane eaqual balanced fuel drain is preferable to maintain center of thrust and center of mass aligned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T09:17:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 09:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kcs123\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Echanged title to better fit topic\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
