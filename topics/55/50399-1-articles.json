I know we have a workaround by fuel pumps from external to the central tank but it would be nice to have three throttle channels for flexibility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example when you are building the craft you allocate the thottle channel to A, B or C. That way you could use the central booster on channel A and have all the external boosters on channel B.
