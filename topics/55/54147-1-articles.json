It seems almost silly, and honestly it\u0027s horribly organized by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have a suggestion to go with the tweakables in the upcoming .23:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContextual parts. Allowing a generic part to take on the width of the part you attach it to, because it\u0027s annoying to look for that one part in the huge list that you want to stick on. Also allowing you to choose what type of fuel you want to store in any given part (Fuel, Fuel/oxy, Empty, RCS, Etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed there was a pattern for fuel tanks. You can have: Extra Short, Short, Normal, Long. You can see that in the medium sized fuel tanks: The FLT-100, FLT-200, FLT-400, FLT-800. The Rockomax tanks follow the same pattern. Each one is double length, starting from the \u0022Extra Short\u0022 length.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCS tanks and SAS modules are basically both Extra Short length as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally you could organize it like like a collapsible tree. You can select at the top level a Short Fuselage piece, or you can expand the node to select something more specific. If you select the generic top level piece, it contextualizes based on what part you connect it to. Then you can select the type of fuel you want for that part. It\u0027s hard to explain, so let me try some ASCII art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFuselage\u002B\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Very Short\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Short\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Normal\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Long\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelecting Very Short would give you a generic short piece. If you connected it to an Orange Tank, it would become a Large Very Short piece, the Rockomax X200-8 Fuel Tank. If you open the tweakable menu on it, you can switch it to hold just Liquid fuel, Liquid/oxidizer fuel, RCS, and maybe even make it an SAS module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you want to be more specific, expand the Very Short option:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EFuselage\u002B\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Very Short\u002B\u003Cbr\u003E                     | - Small\u003Cbr\u003E                     | - Medium\u003Cbr\u003E                     | - Large\u003Cbr\u003E                     | - MK2\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Short\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Normal\u003Cbr\u003E        |- Long\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you could specify specifically what kind of part you want, if you don\u0027t want it contextualized. Additionally having another level that lets you select what type of fuel you want it to hold (Or if you want it to be an inline docking port, or SAS module, depending on the size). Allowing any part to hold any type of fuel would really open up possibilities (Although it may take a few new textures...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the contextual parts and fuel selection would make it much easier to add new types of parts without it being overwhelming, like in the B9 aerospace mod. I noticed a ton of repeat parts that just had different fuels, it was rather silly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing: Instead of having the length, if the parts are made to be \u0022Stretchable\u0022 where you can select the length, it would make the menu easier. You could just select a top level Fuselage piece, place it, then stretch it to however long you want. Or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T17:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the stretchable/procedural fuel tank idea (there\u0027s a mod for that, btw). Also perhaps an ability to select different texture for the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for tech-tree integration, perhaps the tech-tree would simply place an upper/lower limit on the \u0022stretchability\u0022 of the tank (so, for example, in lower tech level, your tanks can only be 0.5 ~ 1 meters long. Higher tech level allows you 0.25 ~ 5 meters long. On highest tech level, 0.1 ~ unlimited meters long)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dun Kirk","CreatedById":11365,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T19:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d say the same for engines, I\u0027ve designed a inter-planet design and modded a nuke engine so its 1/3 the normal.
