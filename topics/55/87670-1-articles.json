This makes us have to reboot, and sometimes even reinstall the game. I have even see the windowed mode have the bottom buttons cut off by the start menu purely because it is slightly too long. Of course you can minimize the start bar, but then begs the question -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy have both apply and accept if not for this reason?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T02:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES!! this needs to happen\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
