You want tons of drag and very little lift when reentring to slow down quickly and not bounce. Since KSP doesn\u0027t simulate stall, the best way to achieve this is to keep a very high AoA: you want to have an angle of attack superior to 30\u00B0, and to 45\u00B0 if possible (the space shuttle had a 40\u00B0 angle of attack when reentring). Some prefer to get a 90\u00B0 AoA to get the maximum amount of drag but it\u0027s the best way to flip if your plane is not perfectly balanced.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA plane is not a capsule, since it has not ablative shield you can\u0027t just let your thing heading prograde and forget. Spaceplanes are a bit harder to fly than capsule and you can\u0027t do anything about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSpace is not easy.
