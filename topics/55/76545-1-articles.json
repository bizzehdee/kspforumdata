Some kind of animation (maybe interactive?) showing a close-up of the experiment, so instead of getting \u0022The goo shakes as the craft moves\u0022 you\u0027ll actually \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E the goo shake as the craft moves!

It might get boring to see the same animations over and over again, so they might be randomised, or turned into an almost-minigame on the first few readings, where you would play as the Kerbal for a brief moment and click a few switches to get your reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T22:44:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat would not be good all the time, as i do SCIENCE! sometimes right before landing, on decent. i get the science at \u0026lt;15 meters and again when landed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T22:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess it would make it less \u0022cheaty\u0022, or at least realistic, because anything more than a simple thermometer reading would take more than a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that would give a use for multiple Kerbals!

For surface samples the Kerbal should reach down and pick something up, for EVA report the Kerbal should look around a bit, and maybe jot something down on a wrist mounted note-pad, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of seeing the experiment\u0027s results is intriguing on a certain level, but I don\u0027t like it just for the sake of having a visualization. If you had to actually note your observation, and making the correct observation affected the amount of science you got, that might be interesting. So if the goo is wobbling, and you mark down that it is bouncing, you get less science because you\u0027re bad at making observations. But then you have to ask yourself what this game should really be about, and is this just too much fine detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027m hoping for more scenarios in which to run experiments, and more elaborate set ups for the experiments - like an impactor, where you set up seismic equipment on the surface, maybe a multispectral camera aimed at the impact site, then crash a probe at a precise location to gain data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T20:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dwight_js\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dwight_js\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally I\u0027m hoping for more scenarios in which to run experiments, and more elaborate set ups for the experiments - like an impactor, where you set up seismic equipment on the surface, maybe a multispectral camera aimed at the impact site, then crash a probe at a precise location to gain data.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I want as well.
