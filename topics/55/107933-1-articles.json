I feel the same is needed for view control overall... when the camera is fixed around the center of mass of a ship and you need to access something (science experiments on the capsule, or in a Service Bay), it can be a real pain in the arse... same with moving around while building in VAB."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T13:59:27Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been this route before, previous versions.
