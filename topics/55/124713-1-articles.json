I always saw the pilot role as more of a team leader role with the most daring and adventurous Kerbals taking the job. They train the nuggets and inspire even the most experienced colleagues. They could have the following effects I guess (on top of what they already get). (cumulative)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 0: --- (default Level 0 pilot skills only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 1: The entire crew gets 100% more XP. (so 200%) This effect doesn\u0027t stack across multiple commanders and the one with the higher level is picked instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 2: The commander wears a bulkier EVA suit with even more fuel, stronger thrusters and stronger lights. This suit has a communotron 18 (or whatever that first one is) installed, which can transfer EVA reports right away from the field. The suit also has limited electric charge that needs to be replenished (automatically or via refueling if Squad changes it so) at the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 3: The entire crew gets 100% more XP. (so 300%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 4: The entire crew becomes 50% better at their tasks. Scientists process data more quickly and engineers make ISRU go even faster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel 5: The entire crew gets 100% more EXP.

I was playing for over a year before I found out about the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3755-Docking-tip-Fine-control-proportional-RCS-thrust\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emagic proportional RCS thrust in fine control mode\u003C/a\u003E, for example. Heck, I found out about the \u0022F\u0022 key in the VAB editor just the other day. If a commander adds experience to the other kerbals while there, and then that experience lasts afterwards: it seems like it would be an easy thing for players to miss. How do they know that that\u0027s happening? (Since kerbals don\u0027t get their XP until they return home to Kerbin.) When they do get the XP, how do they know that something unusual happened? And what about the sense of regret when you get back and then later find out that \u0022gosh, I should have sent a commander along, I would have gotten all this additional XP\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving an insta-buff that works while the commander is there means that you get the benefit whether you\u0027re aware of the feature or not. The fact that the extra experience levels show up graphically in the crew display gives you a visual cue that something\u0027s going on. It\u0027s a very simple mechanic and easy to understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Everything about KSP professions thus far is pretty much \u0022instant gratification\u0022: having a kerbal with a particular profession at a particular level gets you something \u003Cem\u003Eright now\u003C/em\u003E. This applies to pilot SAS skill; scientist research rate in labs and experiment-reset ability; engineer mining rate and ability to fix things. Having an insta-buff for commanders seems to fit in well with that. \u0022If I look at my crew right now, I can see what they can do right now.\u0022 An XP boost means a delayed gratification: no benefit at all until you get back to Kerbin. Any maybe even longer than that, if it means that this mission didn\u0027t actually generate enough XP to give the crew members a level, even with the boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems complicated to figure out and to explain to the player. Does the commander\u0027s XP boost apply to himself? If so, it makes easy-mode, too easy to get to high levels cheaply. But if it applies to other kerbals and not himself, does that mean that the commander can boost people to higher levels than himself? That seems wrong. But if you start adding rules to prevent that from happening, now you end up with a complex situation that requires paragraphs to explain to people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it also makes it so that kerbals get more experience from the same locations. You can get to level N by visiting fewer locations than you can in the current game. That\u0027s why I consider it unbalancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think XP is a \u0022grind\u0022 and the game should be adjusted to make it easier for kerbals to get to higher levels, then that\u0027s a valid point-- but I think that\u0027s a different topic; would be better addressed by a rebalancing of XP-versus-level-versus-places-visited overall, rather than something specific to commander ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022More Boosters\u0022 data-cite=\u0022More Boosters\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EXP as it is isn\u0027t \u0022hard earned\u0022, it\u0027s a grind and you\u0027ll have to go through it anyway at first with the pilot.
