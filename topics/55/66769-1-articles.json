I thought I\u0027d just throw my opinion on the idea out there and see what everyone else thinks, I\u0027m hoping to be converted (for want of a better word) to another view on this matter that either explains the current system or justifies another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, transmitting data received from temperature scans, seismic scans, pressure scans, and gravity scans only yields 50% of the science from that experiment, indiscriminate of range. Why? Surely the reading is just a series of numbers and is an even simpler transmission than the crew reports and EVA reports, right? I can understand that the physical experiments (ones that acquire a piece of physical data such as the goo or materials experiments) lose out, since the evidence can\u0027t just be beamed back to KSC. This is perfectly reasonable, in my book. No tweaking needed. But the numbers, just the simple little readings from the scanners, should most certainly be 100% successful, right? Maybe some is \u0022lost in space\u0022 or something, but whatever, that wouldn\u0027t have a great effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am suggesting is that the temperature scan, pressure scan, gravity scan, and seismic scan, all have a 80-100% transmission rate for their experiments. It just makes sense, to me. I\u0027d like to see your opinion though - please justify to me the current system or suggest your own system. I get that it\u0027s a game and this reduced efficiency adds difficulty, but I feel that 50% is just a little too far. The vast majority of the data in these small, non-physical experiments should make it, in my opinion. But please, do tell me where you stand on the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T23:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would be ok with higher transmission rates, but they should lower the amount of science you can get from those experiments if they add this, science is way too easy to get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T00:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompletely agree. Unmanned science gathering is already limited enough. The tweak to 100% would help at least a bit.

Think of it not as one click doing the whole job, but as one click telling the device when to begin performing its function. And if so, transmitting the result data of an experiment performed remotely \u003Cem\u003Eshould \u003C/em\u003Ebe less informative than bringing the experimental apparatus back for more intensive study, shouldn\u0027t it?
