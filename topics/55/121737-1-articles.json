I was just on Duna and my delivery crane system had just landed a new base module. I clicked undock and of course it switched to the base module instead of my crane. So I though \u0022Hey ho... never mind. I\u0027ll just hit the \u0022]\u0022 key to go to the crane.\u0022 but instead of going to the crane it went to a decoupler that was still coming down. So I tried to switch back to the crane or the base module AND THE BLOODY GAME TOLD ME I COULDN\u0027T SWITCH WHILE IN THE ATMOSPHERE (which it already clearly did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just to get back to the crane I had to go back to the space centre, THEN to the tracking station and then back to the crane... but by that time it had fallen off the base module and I was shown a lovely explosion... All because the game switched to the wrong part and then wouldn\u0027t let me switch back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad, you really need to sort out the switching in atmosphere limit. I have lost SOOOOOOO many craft because switching goes to the wrong darn part and refuses to let me switch back. Also let us switch directly to the tracking station from the map screen. Having to load up the Space Centre and then load up the tracking station is an unnecessary step. Especially when you are in a rush to save a ship or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative solution would be to have a drop down list of ships in the vicinity to choose which ship you want to switch to. It would definitely be better than the roulette wheel that is the [ and ] buttons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GreeningGalaxy","CreatedById":66813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T14:36:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I agree with this.
