It makes perfect sense to include some sort of experience points or currency in a platformer or an RPG game, but KSP is none of these. There should be a line drawn somewhere. I feel like people just got used to the current system and are scared of changes for some reason. Same with the Dev team. \u0022Let\u0027s play it safe and do a bunch of tweaks instead of creating a proper overhaul\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I\u0027m not satysfied with the \u0022tweaks\u0022 anymore, because I hoped for the career to work differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience system in KSP is a grind (and\u00A0the main reason why I hate RPG games so much). If instead we had funds and time required to unlock the tech it would give a sense of progression. Science should be the main reason and goal of the programs. We go places to understand the universe better and sometimes to unlock a better tech\u00A0(growing super-conductive crystals in space is science too, right?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s have another thought experiment, shall we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou start a new career game. Launch a bunch of sounding rockets and fly a simple jet plane. After some time you decide that the Mun is worth visiting and pick The Munar Exploration Program. After you\u0027ve activated it the program gives you a bunch of missions. For example: Fly a pilot to the edge of space so he can experience zero gee and collect his report, make a VTOL and do a bunch of hops around the KSC to prepare the crew for the landing on the Silver Globe, test an engine you\u0027ve just research (that will\u00A0be used\u00A0on the Mun), go into orbit, perform a docking and go back, and all that jazz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that you have enough knowledge and the tech you decide if you want to go there, or do some more testing/experiments/whatever you want to do. If you decide to go to the Mun you are obliged to take a bunch of experiments with you, because science is the main goal of the program you\u0027ve picked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be, of course, other programs that don\u0027t require science (commercial), but that\u0027s not the point here. The point is: The only change we would feel is that we are actually achieving something in our career games. Many people don\u0027t leave the Kerbin\u0027s SOI and I feel it\u0027s not only because the lack of information. The game simply doesn\u0027t reward your courage, because you can grind the heck out of\u00A0Mun and Minmus with the generic science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd don\u0027t you even start with \u0022But if the science rewards were tweaked in\u00A0Kerbin\u0027s SOI the player would run out of it quick and go interplanetary!\u0022 NO! The players should have clear goals and objectives stated in the programs they would be able to pick themselves. Science should be the reason why you get those annual funds and cash boosts for accepting the programs. Right now it\u0027s just another currency that can be exchanged for something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a game\u00A0but not a platformer, nor an RPG. Let\u0027s draw the line somewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-04T16:50:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2016 04:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T12:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it matters\u00A0what type of game KSP is, KSP is a game, and if you want people to care about something in a game it needs to feed back into the rewards system. In a FPS people are collecting bullets and health powerups because they feed back into the gameplay, in chess you\u0027re taking out your opponent\u0027s units because it makes winning easier. In Mario people collect coins because they give you extra lives. No one gives a s*** about points. Thats the principle at work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you remove that then instead of giving players the ability to go out there and collect you have to specifically spell out each task for them. The trouble is players have a lot of different types of missions they do and don\u0027t like doing. Tater hates rescues, but now you\u0027ve made it a \u003Cem\u003Erequirement\u003C/em\u003E that he rescue a Samgus Kerman from Minmus to unlock the Hitchhiker. Most people hate the part tests, but now we have to do them in all sorts of places to unlock engines and such. Even if you group them you\u0027re still talking about dozens of missions people may or may not want to do.\u00A0They don\u0027t care that Squad or Veeltch thinks those missions\u00A0make sense, they just want to do their own thing.\u00A0People are already annoyed that contracts are requiring too many\u00A0\u0022side quests\u0022, and now you\u0027ve turned the entire tech tree into a really involved series of them.\u00A0Im sure it varies but for me between mucking about in the VAB to testing and reverting to actually flying I probably put 1-4 hours into a mission, sometimes much longer for complicated ones.\u00A0Now all of a sudden Im looking at \u003Cem\u003Ehundreds\u003C/em\u003E of hours of playtime just to unlock the tech tree, not including any of the missions I actually want to do. That seems probably wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we\u0027re saying besides these tech-tree missions we also need to bring experiments along on our missions, but the thing is we\u0027re not \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C/em\u003E them. If we aren\u0027t doing anything with them and\u00A0they aren\u0027t generating a central reward then they\u0027re just required decoration. Players shouldn\u0027t be asked to\u00A0lug around KSP\u0027s experiments, they should be conducting their \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E experiments.\u00A0Say I\u0027ve just scanned Minmus and found a region with some high ore concentrations, but I want to find the very best spot for my mining operation. Now there\u0027s a impactor experiment that both generates science points and produces high-res ore scans based on how big the impact is. I can set up my sensor and smash a small probe into the surface to scan a small area and unlock one node, or I can snag an asteroid, harvest its science, and smash it into the surface to scan a huge area and unlock 3 nodes. You could have a barometer that pays out for the column of atmosphere it passes through and lets pilots predict trajectory with drag. Maybe you\u0027re not ready for\u00A0a manned mission to the surface of Eve, but you can get a small probe to survive re-entry down to the surface. Not only has this helped unlock parts for your manned mission but its let you plan your aerobrake for it. Because these are actual gameplay dynamics and not just \u0022do this\u0022 missions you can do them anywhere\u00A0and easily dovetail them into the types of missions you\u0027re already doing.

But you don\u0027t have to wait for the mission to arrive to unlock a new node. If you pay funds and wait only, let\u0027s say, five days for an engine to be unlocked then you get the engine ready to use. The you put the rocket together to fullfil the mission by performing science experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current system works backwards: You build a rocket, send a probe/capsule to [insert celestial body here] to build a better rocket. That\u0027s not how it works IRL! The Voyagers weren\u0027t sent to Jupiter and other planets to build the Space Shuttle! Tech needs time and money, not pictures of Galilean moons.

Exploration programs, configurable in the admin building. These would give certain missions to do, which would get more involved as you complete previous ones. For example, the Mun program would give you missions to take crew to the Mun, starting in flybys, later orbital missions, then landings, and then eventually a base. Programs could be terminated at any time by the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A monthly budget, based on reputation. Reputation would be increased by doing missions related to the active program(s), and decrease slowly over time. The time it takes for reputation to decrease between missions depends on the time it takes to get to the body involved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.
