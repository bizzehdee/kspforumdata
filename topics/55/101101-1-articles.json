And like the newer gear lists all the intakes/solar panels to let you customize it if needed. I think it should be shortcut to something like \u0022I\u0022 for intakes and something for \u0022P\u0022 for solar panels on the keyboard. They should by default be the \u0022Toggle\u0022 option and should automatically incorporate all appropriate items put on your vehicle into their perspective category. I always use up my shortcuts before getting to these but and always find use for them potentially.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T20:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T20:13:00Z","Content":"Maybe just use an action group ?

Because those keys control something else that you really don\u0027t want to accidentally activate...\n\nEdit: Rereading your post, I realized you said that it doesn\u0027t matter what the modifiers are. While this is true to a certain extent, there\u0027s a reason why those keys are used as modifiers so much. They\u0027re large keys at the edge of the keyboard, so they\u0027re easy to press on purpose, but hard to hit accidentally. Which is probably why KSP uses them to control throttle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T19:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GreenWolf**"}]}
