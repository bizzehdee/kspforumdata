Or do you accept a fractional day length (good luck remembering your synchronous orbit period)? Or do you apply different scale factors to the planet radius and the orbit SMA (my preference, but moons look different in the sky because they\u0027re closer or farther away; it\u0027s a lot less visually impressive with them further away)? These are all valid solar systems to choose.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor the terrain, Earth is very flat over large areas; all the steepness is at very small horizontal scales, smaller than an upscaled Kerbin\u0027s terrain would have.
