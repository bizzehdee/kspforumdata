If the favorites tab was limited to one page, that would be an ample 24 parts that would always be findable and placeable immediately from their user-chosen positions in the list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T00:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea.
