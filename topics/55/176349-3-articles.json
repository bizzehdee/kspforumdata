But as for the rest...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a game with a very, very steep learning curve, and adding more stuff to it will only make that curve steeper. It\u0027s already really hard for people to get into the game, and the last thing the devs want to do is to make that barrier to entry higher, because it\u0027ll mean less sales and less revenue for them. Some things are just best left to mods. That way, we who want them can have without harming the experience of the new player or (more importantly) using up precious development time. Software developers are \u003Cu\u003Eexpensive\u003C/u\u003E, and their time needs to be used judiciously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally don\u0027t think we\u0027re going to see a KSP 2.0 for a long, long time, and even then it\u0027s only going to be a re-implementation of the original KSP in an up-to-date engine with better graphics, to bring it to a new generation of very nerdy gamers. Other games using the Kerbal IP? Almost certainly. Why else would Take Two have bought it? But a KSP 2.0? Unlikely. The game is already the best at what it does. There isn\u0027t a clear way to make the game better at teaching orbital mechanics. Which, I might remind you, is what it\u0027s really about. I\u0027ve seen enough new players struggle to learn the basics in today\u0027s stock KSP. The last thing they need is more complications that have nothing to do with orbital mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-25T20:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[redacted for grumpiness]\u00A0 [also, not relating to topic]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-08-25T20:24:44Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2018 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-25T20:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverlapping threads have been merged\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pae1_zps6e2b6f6d.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022185\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a506/tyciblog/Pae1_zps6e2b6f6d.png\u0022 width=\u0022247\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-25T20:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223440079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535228419\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002262955\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deddly\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, Deddly said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverlapping threads have been merged\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a506/tyciblog/Pae1_zps6e2b6f6d.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pae1_zps6e2b6f6d.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022185\u0022 src=\u0022https://i1281.photobucket.com/albums/a506/tyciblog/Pae1_zps6e2b6f6d.png\u0022 width=\u0022247\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOooohhhh..... shiny.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-25T20:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223409258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530587412\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190176\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dicapitano\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/2/2018 at 11:10 PM, Dicapitano said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing KSP for years now, and I always found the great support the\u00A0developers have given to the game\u00A0matched only by the amazing community that creates and updates content around it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I believe we have reached a limit where the continuous updates (1.4.1 / 1.4.2 / 1.4.3 / 1.4.4 ...) and the efforts of the modders\u00A0to keep up is simply becoming annoying and defets\u00A0the purpose of a great game like KSP.
