Maybe an Olympus Mons for Duna? \n\u003E More importantly, is that still the plan? That was posted almost a year ago, and now the userbase has expanded considerably, and we are 1.0. If they redo planet surfaces and it breaks saves the majority of players who dont frequent here or reddit wont understand why their 1.0 no-longer-early-access save game is broken.\n\nWell, if they\u0027d make changes to planet altitudes, landed ships would have a reeealy tiny chance do explode into what once was the surface, and a big chance to just pop up to where the new ground is, with minor problems. (Tested with planet pack).\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone remember the ol\u0027 Easter Egg hunts? Those were great!\n\nWell, I\u0027m working on a WIP kopernicus based plugin that will add easter egg scatters:\n\nFarms on kerbin, abandoned space centers (very very rare), more types of trees, rare cristals on Eve, salt boulders on Laythe, snow piles on Eeloo. All of thiese have collision andnare randomly generated per save.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E He\u0027s right. Mods are unstable. Some I installed your kopernicus mod and my computer told me crash memory dump. (Aka: blue screen of death)\n\nNot true, Kopernicus is an amazingly stable plugin and most of the related crashes are ONLY caused by something wrong in Planet .cfg, or your ksb being an unique one that doesn\u0027t like kopernicus! For example back in 0.24 EVE wasn\u0027t working for me but after 0.25 everything worked nice. Cheers everyone! I\u0027m looking forward to restarting this community move after 1.1 hits so be prepared to protest! (even trough its their game and I know hoe it feels when people are rushing you to make things you kind of need to dqueze from your free time)."},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T01:09:36Z","Content":"Personally, I agree with what Ted has said during the KPE livestream - that they need to work more on what they have right now rather than starting a whole new project. \\*foul mutterings about career\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T23:04:25Z","Content":"may be it\u0027s better to \u0027work on/think about\u0027 some kind of this wysiwig but kerbal alike at some point (bis)\n\n[http://store.steampowered.com/app/372590](http://store.steampowered.com/app/372590)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/aNcheKr9n6g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\ntypically the kind of thing that could serve KSP at is best regarding the planets system @ medium\u002B/long term ...\n\n(\u0026 apply in this thread as well [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132118-A-thought-on-planets](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132118-A-thought-on-planets))\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-23T23:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2015 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WinkAllKerb\u0027\u0027**"}]}
