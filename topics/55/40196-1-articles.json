Would it be for the better or for the worse if modders could get accsess to the source code by signing an agreement of some sort with squad. The agreement would be something like them being legally obliged to not distribute the source code in any way and to run stuff that would require stand alone installs to go thrugh squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we could probbably see some co op multiplayer as acsess to everything from how warp works to players being able to controll other crafts than the one that is selected (and technically the center of the universe). I would let how these things would work be up to the ones picking up the task. A lot of things are needed for things like multiplayer ( i couldent come up with other Examples, sorry...) that would probbably mess up singleplayer enough to not be worth it as a package, however as a standalone install with its own saves and folders i could see some modders trying...

KSP remaining a proprietary intellectual property through which Squad can make a good living is obviously essential to Squads success at this point. Releasing source code to anyone who is not a Squad employee obviously involves some risk to the integrity of the intellectual property and its commercial viability (no?). As such, it would seem the risks to Squad, the game they are developing and their future potential to offer fine gaming to all of us (talented modders and average users) from releasing anything more than Squad wants to release (legal waivers or not) outweigh any putative benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf talented modders really want to go deeper into it, why not seek employment with Squad or something like that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T18:55:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scoundrel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have a few questions though: what is the likelihood of source code being released to \u0022dev approved modders\u0022 and its attendant issues?
