These contracts don\u0027t need to actually award anything but basically serve as a way of giving us \u0022this is exactly what we want to do, these parameters need to be completed for it to be considered complete.\u0022 Primary use of this IMO would be orbital stations. On some bodies, it\u0027s near impossible to create for example a pure equitorial orbit as there\u0027s no reference point to know where the equator is. With custom contracts, we can go, ok, we want a station at this apoapsis, this periapsis, this inclination, at this longitude and the game will then highlight the exact orbital path required. Exactly the same as the random-gen contracts, but we have full control of the parameters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy extension, also a way of marking a specific point on the surface of a body for a surface station or even a point where we want to land.

I don\u0027t know about you, but everyone I know who plays KSP has OCD to the point we have to re-dock station parts because they aren\u0027t rotated exactly right. I\u0027ll re-dock a fuel tank cause the texture doesn\u0027t line up. If that\u0027s an issue for players, imagine the efforts we\u0027ll go through trying to make orbits 60 degrees apart. This makes that easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you unlock all the science, visit even just 3 of the planets, and upgrade all the buildings, contracts have precisely zero impact on the game because there\u0027s no reason to actually do them. It\u0027s the same orbit, same landing, same science, the only thing different is the color of the dirt. Career mode as a whole is pointless then unless we\u0027re able to create our own goals. This would simply help in that regard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T00:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223517778\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221546838788\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022194534\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ruarc88\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 hours ago, Ruarc88 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess \u0022contract\u0022 may not be the right term for what I\u0027m suggesting,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, that\u0027s where you confused me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, this might be a cool mod or feature.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Somewhere in mission control, A really in depth mission planning screen, where you can set planned orbits, maneuver nodes, etc etc.\u00A0 You can then assign that mission plan to a vessel so that you can try to fly the mission as planned.\u00A0 As we used to say in the SCUBA world, \u0022Plan your dive, dive your plan\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T00:20:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically what I thought Missions were going to be when they first announced Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still a bit sad they\u0027re not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-08T03:29:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223518234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221546906819\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically what I thought Missions were going to be when they first announced Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still a bit sad they\u0027re not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe disappointment reached many of us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
