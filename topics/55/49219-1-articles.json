I propose that as the player unlocks more parts and gains more science ground crew/engineers/scientists in the VAB and SPH. At the start for example only a few little guys walking about, and as more are hired and the space program gains momentum many more appear. I presume the current scheme is just placing them randomly around and then just moving to key points around the rocket? Or is it a pre-made animation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T14:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting idea ... maybe the science complex could also grow with expanding science ... initally just a single building till, near the end of the tech tree, the complex we see now\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T15:41:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love modular improvements to the environment in and around KSC. Being able to see the fruits of your labor as you achieve things in game is an ego stroke that would encourage the player to keep going. I don\u0027t expect this to be implemented, since it is entirely polish and leaves a lot of the models and animations the developers worked hard to create invisible to the player for a good portion of the game. But I\u0027d still like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
