I don\u0027t think there will ever be any other planetary systems in KSP. The reason?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s start by assuming that in KSP all of the celestial bodies are more or less 10 times smaller than our Solar system real counterparts. You know, Kerbin has a radius of 600 km while Earth is 6,000 and so on. Then, if another system was ever added to KSP, it would be more or less 3 or 4 light years away from Kerbin, that distance divided by 10, just to keep things realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA light year is 9.4605284 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10^15 meters, so in ksp another system would be (3 or 4 light years /10) = from 2.838 x 10^15 to 3.784 x 10^15 meters from Kerbin. Now let\u0027s imagine you\u0027re travelling in a straight line towards that star at a constant speed of... make it 10 km/s. and using x100,000 time acceleration, of course. It would still take you from 2,838,000 to 3,784,000 real seconds, or from \u003Cstrong\u003E33 TO 44 REAL DAYS\u003C/strong\u003E to reach it.
