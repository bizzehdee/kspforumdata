This could be acheived (I\u0027m guessing) by making the fuel/ox/monoprop sliders manually adjustable, as they are in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. It would also be helpful to be able to lock liquid fuel and oxidiser together so you could transfer in the right ratio. Another option might be to be able to specify how much fuel you would like to transfer from tank A to tank B (eg manually enter a value\u00A0 - say 30 monoprop - to be transferred.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may already be a mod that does this, but as someone who tends to play stock, it would be nice if it was included in the main release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a stupendous game, good work devs!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MinimalMinmus","CreatedById":172387,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-13T23:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... and, adding to this thread, how \u0027bout some FASTER transfer? I mean, when you try to transfer from a tank to another, it is rather slow, there should be an option to make it substantially, at least 5 times faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-14T04:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTransfer should be based on crafts as well (not just single tanks). Like that fuel pipe transfer mod of DMagic. With big ships, its frustrating clicking on every single tank to fill up the ship\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoobTool","CreatedById":169803,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T16:30:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see the resource dropdown menu open the resource transfer window for tanks containing a specific resource, instead of just displaying the amount of resource in each tank (maybe only when the box next to the resource is checked). This would make fuel transfers on large vessels with many fuel tanks much less tedious than alt-clicking each individual tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
