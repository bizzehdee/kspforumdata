Boosting it\u0027s values would make them overpowered in sandbox without really providing that much extra benefit to those in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso worth noting, a lot of the part costs and balance is really really off. Perhaps in the future during a balance pass something like this could be addressed, but for now, \u0022balance\u0022 is a somewhat defunct term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T14:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell actually, if you compare the KSP NTR to the NERVA that was gonna be used on the Saturn V, the NTR is basically just a smaller version (with a drop in weight and thrust to compensate the size change); it\u0027s stats like TWR and Vac ISP are pretty similar... The only reall efficiency difference being that the Saturn V NERVA had an Atm ISP of 380... which is good, but in KSP Atm ISP hardly makes a difference in most cases, so this doesn\u0027t matter as such. The only thing I would like changed is that the NTR should use Liquid Hydrogen (or even just liquid fuel to make it simpler), and of course consumption of LF would be the same as the LFO consumption total...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T16:16:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lower atmo Isp only really matters if you\u0027re misguidedly trying to use them on an Eve ascent, on Kerbin they have a higher Isp than any chemical engine \u003Cem\u003Ein vacuum\u003C/em\u003E by the time they reach a bit over 1700m altitude, and they only get better from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe low TWR is a bit of a nerf, but I think it\u0027s a necessary to keep them from completely dominating all engines other than jets.
