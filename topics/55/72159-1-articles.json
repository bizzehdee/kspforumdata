Why, and what should we do?","CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T13:13:37Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T13:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two things I\u0027d like to put right up front in this post:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We all acknowledge that the game is still in development, that is why providing feedback now is good - while the game is still in development and ideas can still be incorporated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I think KSP is awesome (check my sig).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that out of the way, let me talk about repetition for a minute. Repetition isn\u0027t necessarily bad. All games are repetitive in some way or other:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In Doom (and all of its followers) you repetitively shoot monsters/enemies/targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In RTS games, you repetitively order units around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In racing games, you repetitively drive laps around a track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Even in monopoly, you repetitively roll the dice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In KSP you repetitively snap parts together to build rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why are these repetitive \u0022gameplay\u0022 elements not incredibly boring? Well, because \u003Cem\u003Ethe thing that is repetitive\u003C/em\u003E is somehow \u0022fun\u0022. But what *is* fun? Ah, there\u0027s the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, in FPS games, racing games and RTS games, and rocket building, you can get better at the thing you are doing repetitively. There are skills involved that can be improved upon. But what about monopoly? You can\u0027t get better at rolling the dice. Ah, but rolling the dice introduces am element of suspense and tension regarding what the value of the roll will be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s another element that is, perhaps, more important. Every time you perform one of these repetitive activities, the result has some effect on the immediate state of the game. A monster dies, or your vehicle enters a turn, or your units move into position, or your piece moves around the board, or your rocket gets a little bit bigger. Something has changed, and that change will have an impact on the game from that moment forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContrast this, now, with science collection in KSP. You click on EVA, then you click on \u0022EVA Report\u0022, then you click on \u0022keep\u0022 or \u0022discard\u0022, then you repeat this process until you have gathered all possible EVA reports. There\u0027s no skill to be learned here, nothing you can get better at... it\u0027s just clicking buttons. There\u0027s no element of risk. And there\u0027s no immediate change to the state of the game other than your pod\u0027s stored science points increasing a little. Yes, at some point down the line you will spend those points on new tech, but nothing about the gameplay has changed. In 30 seconds you will get out and do \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E the same thing again in the hope that maybe this time you are over a new biome. Or you\u0027ll fly to another planet and do exactly the same thing again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this gets at the heart of the problem with the current science mechanic. You can\u0027t get any better at it the more you do it because there\u0027s no skill to be learned, and the action has no effect on the state of the game or the gameplay. This is why it seems so \u0022grindy\u0022 (heck, at least in, say, WoW, the grinding usually involves using your combat skills).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, on reflecting upon these ideas, anyone feels they grok what I\u0027m getting at, then I wonder if anyone can offer ideas for a better mechanic. It seems what we need is ideally:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A mechanic that involves a skill you can improve upon, and/or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) A mechanic that has a more immediate effect on the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have at least a couple of ideas, but I\u0027m interested in what other people might suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s one other thing I want to make clear: I am aware that there are some mods that can help relieve the \u0022manual labour\u0022 component of science. One will, for example, tell you which biome you are over so you know when to get out and do an EVA report. I suppose someone might make one that lets you bind EVA reporting to a key press, or automatically throws away science you\u0027ve already collected so you don\u0027t get RSI shifting the mouse between the \u0022report\u0022 and \u0022discard\u0022 buttons. But what I\u0027m talking about here is not just to do with automating the existing repetition. I\u0027m saying we need a different *kind* of thing to do to collect science, and perhaps a different kind of result of performing the collection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T13:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, and if you want to actually \u003Cem\u003Ehear\u003C/em\u003E me rant about this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/MrqhNfMyLCs?t=6m50s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://youtu.be/MrqhNfMyLCs?t=6m50s\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T14:43:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efor something that would imeadiately affect gameplay, i suggested this \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79254-EVA-controls\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79254-EVA-controls\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T15:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting post, there\u0027s definitely an element of delayed gratification with science, you don\u0027t get the bonus until you return or at least broadcast and switch back to the space port.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a big fan of having the amount of science collected be influenced by the intelligence of the Kerbal (or Kerbals) aboard.

In same racing games with each passed lap you\u0027ll approach to the finish and eventually end of a game, because these games concentrated more on sportive aspects which are particular case of \u003Cem\u003Ecompetitive spirit in general, what demand results\u003C/em\u003E (and like other arcades are). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00C5\u00BEn the other hand games which are \u003Cem\u003Etrue simulators of something\u003C/em\u003E, like flight simulators or spaceflight simulators like KSP, do not have an explicit finishing point just because their main experience lay less in achievement of something than in emulating experience itself. People stop playing simulators when they had enough and play again when they want repeat that experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile, as i wrote, there\u0027s a bit of contrariety, the main theme make a reasonable point regarding work with reports and search for science experience. In the same RTS games, experience usually acquired automatically, from time to time \u0022bothering\u0022 a player by just a pop-up notifications of collecting. It sounds good until you recall that you have to choice between \u003Cem\u003Ekeep/lab/transmit;\u003C/em\u003E sometimes you know that you\u0027ll not bring that back and transmit data before your probe will be destroyed; sometimes you run out of electricity and cannot transmit anything so you keep your results in hope of bringing them back.
