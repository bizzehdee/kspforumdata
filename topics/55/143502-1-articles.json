I\u0027ve additionally modded the ISRU (can you point me to a thread where you\u0027ve already discussed your issues with stock ISRU?) to produce Xenon gas there (works in any atmosphere.. Xenon would be retained better than lighter gases after all). I\u0027ve put up some major infrastructure there so I can use it as a major hub. Tugs, Duna ISRU craft, Ike ISRU craft, surface research bases for duna and ike, orbiting labs for both as well. Reusable surface to orbit craft, which rely on repacking chutes. The outer planets still await (I\u0027ve got OPM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Yes, I don\u0027t like the exploding mechanic at all.

This mechanic needs work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I don\u0027t care so much about their cost, but the non retractable ones are less massive, and thats why I use them at times.

Larger craft: I go with gigantors often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time I want to retract anyway is just before landing to avoid them being damaged by a wobbly landing (can\u0027t eva to do that before, so it needs to either retract on its own or have more EC storage)... retract when docking because of worry about damage, or retract in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me it would still be an advantage to have them automatically retract without needing to send out an engineer to prep a craft for docking/landing/atmospheric travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s still the difference of heat tolerance. Even before deployment, those non retractable ones have a much lower heat tolerance (i guess the casing of the retractable ones is supposed to be their heat protection). Even if you could retract the non-retractable ones for aerobraking, they\u0027d probably still burn off if you try to aerocapture. So to me, there would still be plenty of difference even if engineers could eva to retract them.

I\u0027ve got a massive station in duna orbit. I\u0027ve additionally modded the ISRU (can you point me to a thread where you\u0027ve already discussed your issues with stock ISRU?) to produce Xenon gas there (works in any atmosphere.. Xenon would be retained better than lighter gases after all). I\u0027ve put up some major infrastructure there so I can use it as a major hub. Tugs, Duna ISRU craft, Ike ISRU craft, surface research bases for duna and ike, orbiting labs for both as well. Reusable surface to orbit craft, which rely on repacking chutes. The outer planets still await (I\u0027ve got OPM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Yes, I don\u0027t like the exploding mechanic at all. I\u0027m just saying, the wheel repair is still useful, but I\u0027ve never had a landing strut get damaged but not explode. This mechanic needs work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I don\u0027t care so much about their cost, but the non retractable ones are less massive, and thats why I use them at times. The only time I really care about that mass: small probes, when there won\u0027t be an engineer to retract them. Larger craft: I go with gigantors often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only time I want to retract anyway is just before landing to avoid them being damaged by a wobbly landing (can\u0027t eva to do that before, so it needs to either retract on its own or have more EC storage)... retract when docking because of worry about damage, or retract in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me it would still be an advantage to have them automatically retract without needing to send out an engineer to prep a craft for docking/landing/atmospheric travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s still the difference of heat tolerance. Even before deployment, those non retractable ones have a much lower heat tolerance (i guess the casing of the retractable ones is supposed to be their heat protection). Even if you could retract the non-retractable ones for aerobraking, they\u0027d probably still burn off if you try to aerocapture. So to me, there would still be plenty of difference even if engineers could eva to retract them. Plus they\u0027d be kind of a pain to have to eva to each of them and click on them, even if there were no other relevant differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn regards to cost, I didn\u0027t necessarily mean monetary cost, but overall cost.\u00A0 Mass is part of the cost of using the retractable part, heat tolerance is part of the cost in using the non-retractable part.\u00A0 Personally I like the distinction as they are.\u00A0 However, if you want them back to being fully automatic, I could write you a patch to do that.\u00A0 I can\u0027t do it EVA only though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-11T17:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyea, as they are now, its fine.
