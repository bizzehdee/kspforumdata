I actually acknowledge the fact that KSP is a peaceful\u00A0learning tool (for most people), and take back the comment I said previously. It is true, however, that a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of multiplayer servers will turn very violent just because of the possibility and sheer satisfaction of combat with a creation of your own. Even that, though, can be a source of education when combined with modifications such as Ferram Aerospace Research, as military aircraft have to meet very difficult requirements to meet their needs. That, of course, will never work with stock. Because of stock mechanics and aerodynamics, stock fighter aircraft are merely a matter of \u0022make it fly and shoot.\u0022 So, war in KSP should not be completely stood against, and, in fact, can be supported in various ways if the advantages of it are thought about (nevermind its uses in NASA). Finally, I expressed my opinion by use of a\u00A0nice, good, argument. You, on the other hand, should not be to general,\u00A0flatly rejecting the concept of war in KSP (I also shouldn\u0027t have, in my previous stupid comment). The game started out as a peaceful, space-based building game, but it has gradually turned into something more complicated. That is a good, \u0022healthy\u0022 (so to speak) change for KSP, and it should not be avoided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-16T16:20:56Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 073198681\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T17:04:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t begrudge anyone the way they like to play.
