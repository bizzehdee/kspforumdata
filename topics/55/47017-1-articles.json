But the game engine can only solve n-body problems where n=2. But there\u0027s a hack you could do that would let you have them without solving for n=3. All you need is a tiny object, less than a cubic meter in size. Position it at what would be the Lagrange point for a given two bodies. Then give it a gravity and SOI the size of the Lagrange point it is simulating. If the object were darkly colored, you couldn\u0027t see it. It would be unlikely for you to run into it without specifically aiming for it. While you could make it any shape, I would like to suggest a teapot in reference to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBertrand Russell.\u003C/a\u003E I have to admit, I just like the idea of dozens of invisible teapots flying around in space. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T20:38:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this topic is on the what not to suggest list, I believe there was a thread specifically about simulating it the way you suggested.
