Basically, a prototype component has great chances of failure and increases its reliability as it is tested and used. As the rocket becomes more complex and there are more steps in the space mission, the risk of failure increases exponentially. \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003EIn the real Apollo mission, they had to test every aspect of the mission to improve the reliability, the launch pad, lunar landing module, the docking sequence, a flight pass to the Moon, ... before Armstrong and Buzz step on the Moon.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-gb\u0022\u003EIn essence, you cannot play with big rockets, if you have not played with the smaller ones.
