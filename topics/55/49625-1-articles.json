But how about the parts that you unlock for research have different performance characteristics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE.g. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-engines may have points of failure: Start or restart failure, performance issue, explosion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-wheels: stuck on brake, stuck open or close etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-stabalization may fail, rcs thrusters .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything may start on low reliability but as you fly it it becomes more reliable. If it fails in a flight, you may have to exclude that part for a while while the root cause it analised or you can risk flying it again and it will become more unreliable if it fails again. maybe it can even be tied to the competence of the kerbal in the vehicle. If the little chap is not so smart, maybe things fail easier. And maybe if he has a lot of courage your ship doesnt damage as easily and can land without wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T09:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERandom failures are on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E.
