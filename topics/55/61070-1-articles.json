A qualitative example follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERound Intake: Good for up to Mach 1, low-altitude flight (\u0026lt;15km?). Intake efficiency drops precipitously when these parameters exceeded.(On a side note, what is Mach 1 at Kerbin sea level anyway?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERam Air Intake: Good for Mach 1 to 1.5 kps , High-altitude flight (15km - 23km). Intake efficiency severely compromised outside the operating envelope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine Nacelle: I don\u0027t really see how such a small intake provides enough air for anything, so if I had a say in this I would make it extend the Ram Air Intake\u0027s performance envelope and be completely useless on its own, much like the bleed inlet doors on the SR-71 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial Intake: Boy, I dunno. Performance crawls upward with velocity then peaks at around 2kps? Zero intake efficiency when stationary, just for laughs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that these \u0022intake efficiency values\u0022 would be multipliers on the various pressure-dependent IntakeAir values for intakes. Or something. Someone explain to me what all those intake stats mean! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will discourage airhogging by requiring ridiculous amounts and varieties of intakes for jets to be efficient at all altitudes and speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething tells me that this feature has already been implemented in some form though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease comment!
