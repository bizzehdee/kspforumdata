Also, the day-night cycle on kerbin is not the same as earth time, so in can not be synced with real time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-18T00:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe in-game timer is based on Earth-time, but a kerbal day passes in six hours realtime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I don\u0027t really see the appeal of doing such a thing.

Another idea of the same ilk would be KSP-controlled window-shutters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
