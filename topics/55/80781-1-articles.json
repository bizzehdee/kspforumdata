Some bugs are fine in mod, people can wait for updates and play a bit buggy or uninstall the mod, neither of these good if it is included in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecise node may well be a modification they take on board although it would be a case of them changing their code not adapting the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineer features things like Delta-V readouts that are specifically against the designers wishes for stock. I understand why people use it and squad is very good about not just allowing but helping modders but that doesn\u0027t mean they should change want they want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see no reason not to include chatterer other than the extra work (and that shouldn\u0027t be much) and it shouldn\u0027t need much if any upkeep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart Welding would very much make the game too easy. It removes the need for struts and makes ships almost indestructible and solid like a rock. Even real rockets have problems with bending and compression that can result in problems.

Granted, the mods are done already over our existing codebase, and that does make the initial integration easier, but there\u0027s more to it than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we had a complete game, and someone came up with an awesome new mod that \u003Cem\u003Eeverybody \u003C/em\u003Ewanted, and we had permission to fold it into the game (another issue in itself), that would probably be the end of the story... Assuming also that we wouldn\u0027t have to make any changes to the mod itself (another tall order, since mods are exactly meant to modify the game experience, by definition).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s obviously not the case here. The game is still growing, and as it grows, it\u0027s very common for us to come across bits of old code that now need to be refactored to make it work again. And that\u0027s with our own code. Now, consider how frequently mods become incompatible when we release a new update. We are blessed with a modding community here that is so solid, you\u0027re likely going to see your broken mods fixed in a short amount of time. That\u0027s done by the mod authors themselves, because they care about their projects and they put in a lot of effort to keep it nicely maintained. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow suppose we were to fold a mod into the game... That author support would now become our own burden, and given that we have our own systems to maintain as we develop already, imagine what it would be like if we started to suddenly plop down chunks containing thousands, or tens of thousands of new, unknown to us, lines of code. We\u0027d end up with an unmaintainable mess of code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, we\u0027re happiest as we are right now. The gist of the problem is that neither the game nor the mods are carven-in-stone, unchanging pieces of code. Both are living, evolving projects, which evolve alongside each other, and it takes the combined efforts of everyone to keep this organism alive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can put it like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bird needs a tree to nest in and survive...
