Not ones that are swept but a way to sweep them in flight to change the wing characteristics for low-high altitude changes. And preferably with multiple settings or even auto settings so it can adjust in flight to optimize flight somehow... Maybe based on setable criteria changing the outcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just enough to set them in flight and have preset positions or something. But that would then start requiring more keybinds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, that goes to adding the ability to have Shift\u002B1-0, CTRL\u002B1-0, Shift\u002BCTRL 1-0, and possibly alt with all combos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the wings or parts should make it so you can add parts and many any size wing. Which goes back to another concept. Allowing parts to be welded into one physics modeled part. Then I can add parts as one wing reducing parts count for more complex/compound parts. For example a wing have some parts that are fuel filled and others plane and even multi layered. Then weld them and maybe customize how it deals with the physics so it works correctly. And maybe some tools to help it work right and show or if wanted auto set to work correctly based on exposed surfaces. You could have a simple designator to show this. I would do it in a new building specialized for making items to save and then import from the existing custom item saves. But it could be saved changing more fundamental aspects of the parts like removing/modifying physics from a face so you can make new parts from existing ones and make more realistic parts multifaceted parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game coudl already turn off physics. Why not modify the individual facets of a part when joined together so there is no excess physics involved and have conjoined parts act as one where desired. You could even customize the welding to real world like strengths etc. Then it\u0027s more like real construction on a vehicle and not a simplified cheat. But I would think changing it so internals aren\u0027t hit by physics in an incorrect manner is key. then we can fully utilize the concept of putting parts together and saving them for import into builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this already exist on parts or would it need the parts overhauled again to add the appropriate qualities to modify?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, being able to make a massive customized wing and saving it as a custom part in the existing save thing would be great if it could turn it into a \u003Cstrong\u003Esingle\u003C/strong\u003E part with proper physics and bypass the parts limitations.
