There are many people wants this game but the language is pushing them away. So we are organizing a translation for KSP in Chinese, then more people can enjoy this great game (And that should means more sell, even we know there are many copyright problems in China). We are just volunteers and lack of technical support. Now we have found some slow way to do it, and made some progress(Look at the example picture from TimChen ), but every time you update the game we (possibly) need to redo that, even most of the strings are same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This one just shows the possibility of put Chinese into KSP and show them correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://bbs.deeptimes.org/data/attachment/forum/201312/20/225913jk4xrdrd3qiqxkom.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022225913jk4xrdrd3qiqxkom.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frighter","CreatedById":59183,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Well....\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:17:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt looks nice.
