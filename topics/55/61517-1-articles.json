If anything, I almost see it as more realistic. I mean, in real life, we know that there are Biomes on planets and we aim our missions at them when we send probes. I think that instead spoiling anything by knowing that you need a soil sample from the Minmus Polar Biome, it will give players something to work towards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe, have a condition for the science list, like an Orbital probe performs tests in space, and comes up with a list of biomes, which then gives you the list of things you need.
