I think instant replays would not only be fun, but they could also have a use (e.g., if your rocket starts to wobble and fall apart, you could use a replay to see exactly were it started breaking etc.), however as has already been mentioned, it would be very complex since it would have to basically save every physics calculation that happened (or do it again). One game that does this is FSX (Flight Simulator), but the replays are sometimes glitchy because of so many parameters which have to be recorded. And in that game, the planes are one \u0022part\u0022, now imagine KSP with a multiple hundred part ship!
