A lot of the recent Kerbal updates have focused on these sleek new designs for the Mk.3 parts (which are really cool). But a lot of the textures for previous parts (like the orange tank) seem out of date now. However- I do think there\u0027s a place for them still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see with each Tier update of the VAB to include additional part skins. For instance, I may start in Tier 1 VAB with an orange fuel tank, but upon leveling up to Tier 2 VAB I\u0027m given the option to right click on the fuel tank, and cycle through one or more additional skins. This would also make for a great opportunity to involve the community to produce custom skins that could be downloaded into the game and swapped out at anytime (much like the flag system currently does).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T23:37:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo we can make 3.75 meter orange tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T23:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVen\u0027s stock revamp needs to be made stock.

I enjoy the old designs of rockets with black and white stripes, or even the Russian matte green. Or how about some of the newer sleek designs of space x. It would awesome to click a button and swap out paint jobs essentially.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
