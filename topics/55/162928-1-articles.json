That is why not make the water biomes more interesting. The idea is that the KSP developers should add stock parts to build small science submersibles, and then make the terrain under water more interesting. This would add a lot more things to do in the game. Though some people might say that submersibles have nothing to do\u00A0 space and planet exploration, I disagree. My reasoning is that to planets (besides Kerbin) are at least 50% water (I know Laythe is more) Without anyway to explore under the water, Eve and Laythe are mostly barren planets as there is nothing to do on the water except float. And hey if it means that you can explore the ocean on Kerbin, that\u0027s just a bonus.
