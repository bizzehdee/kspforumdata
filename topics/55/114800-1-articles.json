But there is a lot that is good about this game. All the parts function as they should, the game modes offer a variety of playstyles for every different player and the game is challenging enough that it is hard but not so much that you can\u0027t get anything done. The contracts offer a nice variety for the players that choose to do them and there is enough to do and explore that you will rarely find yourself without a mission that needs completing. Really overall, this game is a knock out. 9.9/10 in my books. You guys have made a game that is on par with some of the best games in the industry. I wouldn\u0027t hesitate for a second to put KSP up there with the likes of Age of Empires II, Minecraft, Civilization, and of course my favorite Fallout. KSP has taken more hours from me than all of these games. But of course everything is not all flowers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of MINOR grievances:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe explore contracts, which IMO progress the player through career rather nicely, seem to work on their own set of rules. Sometimes they decide to show up, sometimes they don\u0027t. For the most part I can usually go into the debug menu and have them added but this seems kind of tacky and unnecessary. Other than that, if you can get the contracts to show up, I think the progression is great for players. Atmo-\u0026gt;orbit-\u0026gt;mun-\u0026gt;minmus-\u0026gt;duna-\u0026gt;ike, and then after that you could potentially have the rest of the planets pop up because if you understand how to get to Duna, there\u0027s nothing stopping you from going anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineer\u0027s report. I know this was implemented with the best intentions but it is for the most part, completely loony. It will tell me I have no ladders on an unmanned probe but nothing to speak of the antennae that I forgot. It gives me a warning that I am producing electric charge with panels but not using it on the very same probe? I understand why it is there and it has the potential to be a great tool for making sure I don\u0027t forget an antennae, solar panels, batteries, etc. But as it is, it is pretty much useless... I say pretty much because it still is there to remind to drain the mono from my command pod when I have no RCS.

I have played a lot and tried out a lot of mods and these are the only 2 I can say definitively deserve to be stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for taking the time to read, I hope this is not met with too much negative feedback, as I said I love this game and only want to see it improve, so hopefully my feedback will be helpful to someone. Now if you don\u0027t mind, I have some more rockets to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T22:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis pretty much sums it up for me too.
