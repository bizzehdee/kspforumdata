Not the modules itself, they are plenty powerful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like 0.24 brought an old issue back, afair from around 0.22. The first implementation of the new ASAS (post-UPDOWNLEFTRIGHTLEFTDOWNBOOM-era) wasn\u0027t aggressive enough. Engine vectoring could balance out ships to some degree, but generally imbalanced weight distribution would shift the heading, while manual control was more than able to spin your ship around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t know the effect: You can easily reproduce it with a craft with small fuel tank, a gimballocked engine/aerospike, and the stabilizer sas modul. Then put one of the bigger radial rcs-tanks on one side of the ship and look how it behaves in space. When flying straight, the ship has trouble keeping a stable course and swaying around. Then manually move the rocket for a short time, and the SAS often completely loose it\u0027s ability to stabilize the rocket after releasing controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning, I had some smaller ships with weaker gimbal/SAS (but manually more than powerful enough), where i had to constantly readjust orientation during a burn. Similarly space planes feel notably less stable, and often can\u0027t deal e.g. with slight instability or short physical judder. It\u0027s especially bad when using time-acceleration during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid Squad comment on trying to change SAS? Because atm it\u0027s unnecessary unpractical, especially on long plane-flights, for time-acceleration and less symmetric ships. I\u0027d really like to see a revert to a working state, or - even better - the option to manually set the agressiveness of SAS. Different ships work optimal under different SAS-settings, but to strong reactions are usually better than weak ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo explain it better, pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/HaSKv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This means that there will be craft unsuited for whatever values Squad pick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously, it was tuned to lock its heading as much as possible. This had the effect of oversteering, missing the heading, going past it, and then oversteering in the opposite direction, causing wobble and often craft destruction. More recent releases made the handling softer, reducing this wobble and craft destruction for the majority of designs, at the cost of accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree potential solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Retune SAS again to increase accuracy but also increase wobble.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add a variety of preset SAS settings selectable via either having a variety of different parts or tweakable menus on a single SAS part.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Allow users to customise the values for P, I and D for each craft via tweakables.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-12T14:40:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2014 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T15:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the explanation Pizzaoverhead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) sounds good to me.
