I hate having to put on two radial tanks just because the in-line is either too big or uses a medium mount size\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a half-length type-1 fuselage with fuel and also a structural version -- there are currently no structural parts that size other than the LT-200 fuel tank\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a very large girder segment shaped like the Eiffel Tower so that I can make a girder tower that can stand on its own without using insane part counts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* small fins, like the AV-8 but much smaller -- and big fins, about the size of the delta wing but with a large control surface area like a canard\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a bright wide-field light that I can use to light up my base without having 15\u002B lights using up all my processing power -- and a very narrow-beam light that can shine out a few km, for landing perhaps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* laser altimeter that would both give me a reading on its distance to the ground and would make a tiny red dot on the ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a dual-stage parachute with drogue and regular, for smoother parachuting when using only one chute -- or make it so I can attach a drogue onto the top of a regular chute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* large and small jet engines -- small for tiny SSTO probes, large for single-engine SSTOs with larger payloads, because single-engine is just so much easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* small rocket engine between the size of the small rockomax and the ant engine, maybe about 5-8 thrust (seriously the ant is too weak, also has terrible thrust to mass ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* large and small atomic and aerospike engines, especially large atomic because the mediums don\u0027t couple very well (they explode when activated)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* propellers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* medium (3x3) and large (9x9) static solar panels along with right triangle versions of these and the original for both better shaping and fewer parts use when coating things in panel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* right-triangle versions of structural panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* small radial decouplers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* large rover wheel. At current there are two mediums and an extra-large. I often want something bigger than the mediums but the huge ones are just far too big for anything I build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a 2-seater in-line cockpit like on fighter jets, with pilot in front and copilot in back, which has a small mount on the front and a mark-2 fuselage mount on the back -- or just any cockpit supporting mark 2 would be great\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a small-mount command pod that seats 1 Kerbal, with absolute minimum specs (very brittle, almost no torque or electricity storage), and it probably bulges out a bit -- for the lulz of course, or possibly useful somehow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* a robotic probe command pod that\u0027s bigger and heavier but comes with stronger torque and a larger battery -- mostly to save on parts and make building probes simpler, I\u0027d use it for making space station modules so that each module wasn\u0027t carrying fifteen excess parts with it, to keep station part count low\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027d like to request that you consider removing the thrust-vectoring from the Rockomax Mainsail. Not only does it seem out of place on such a large engine built entirely for maximum thrust output, but it causes the engine to buckle on the launchpad (or is that some weird bug?). Also it\u0027s weird that the LV-T is the only standard bell engine without thrust vectoring. I think the max thrust variant of each size (that being the mainsail, LV-T, and small rockomax) should lack thrust vectoring. But that\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T14:45:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat version of the game are you playing? it isn\u0027t 0.21 thats for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a quick of the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etheres the radial xenon tank now too. also 3 sizes of RCS tank including the narrowest size (is that 0.675m?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELarge fins can be made by putting control surfaces on the back of delta wings. easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etherse the radar altemetre in landing can cockpits if you care to use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe larger probe body (RC-L01) exists and satisfies your request except it doesnt have a large battery - try using it with the large battery (z-4k) if you want more electric storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mk2-to-size-1 adapter will help you fit the mk2 cockpit to a mk2 stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epropellers and parachutes and other aero requests will be sorted after the next aero improvement (in the works, eventually)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:39:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am playing 0.21.1. Yes there is a radial Xenon tank but it\u0027s about the same size as the in-line. There are three in-line RCS tanks and if you read what I wrote, you would see that the problem I have is with the largest one. It uses the large mount size and is entirely too big for most of my purposes. I want a large mount size RCS tank that\u0027s flatter like the 4K battery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I don\u0027t want to attach a battery and torque wheel to the probe core was mentioned above: trying to save on part count for physics reasons. The large probe core (which is what I usually use) has appallingly low torque and electricity storage. I don\u0027t ask for much, but 0.5 torque and 15 electricity is practically nothing. It takes very little more mass to add 20 torque and 100 electricity storage. I don\u0027t understand why the probe core can\u0027t be given 5 torque and 50 energy storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I can put control surfaces onto delta wings, but they give about as much control surface as a canard, while taking up two parts. Delta wings are only good for lift. Pivoting fins are very useful for keeping large rockets going straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is a Mk 2 to size 1 adapter, and it looks stupid.
