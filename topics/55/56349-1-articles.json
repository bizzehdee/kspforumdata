But this time acceleration also means anything that \u0022happens over time\u0022 in the game can, in fact, happen extremely quickly, and the \u0022over time\u0022 mechanic becomes meaningless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) For a craft to be active (for example, a mapping satellite actively mapping) it must be the focused craft. So you would have to sit there and watch your satellite perform its orbits (or, you know, go make a sandwitch). Being able to time warp doesn\u0027t actually solve this, because the problem is that this is quite explicitly \u0022not playing the game\u0022, and clearly we don\u0027t want to introduce a mechanic into the game that by definition prevents people from really playing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, has anyone seen any words from squad about whether this is a challenge on their radar? Or does anyone have any suggestions as to how we could have things like scanning/mapping/data collection satellites in a way that still allows the player to actually be playing the game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trivial suggestion would of course be to allow non-focused craft to do a certain set of things. But we forum users can\u0027t really know how hard that might be to implement, it might require fairly core engine changes, which is why I\u0027m wondering if there is any official comms about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CodatheSpaceFox","CreatedById":73847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually relevant to my own suggestion that would focus mostly on fitting many in game issues into a dynamic time frame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, with something like career, time should be valued as much as used to the players advantage. Such as in real events, while we steadily advance in our own technology, we still have satellites and probes in space from a time before a relevant advancement in the same technological field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as far as time skipping goes. I\u0027d personally leave it to the predicted difficulty system, and the player\u0027s preference combined to set the pace relative to certain transpiring events, I won\u0027t branch into too much detail, but this would in turn require simple events, such as mapping, passive research, and maybe even resource collecting in the future to be treated similarly to the rail system, by being steadily recorded with minimal requirement in the \u0022focused\u0022 event.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, leaving a mapping satellite over Minmus, while you prepare for your first trip to Duna, all the while leaving a standing mun site to collect research or materials. As time progresses, in theory, the game would only have to record simple adjustments to these objects as the game is in it\u0027s timed state. As the satellite moves, using light panels to maintain it\u0027s power, it will continue collecting real time data based around where it is, all the while judging by it\u0027s parts resource logic on it\u0027s ability to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, you could be managing your mun installation at the time, when you get a beep on some preset gui tool (representing your real time events, so probably by your mission timer.) Alerting you to another vehicle, by opening the map and hovering over the vehicle in question (that would be marked in some way) You\u0027d find that it\u0027s the mapping Satellite, and a small electric bolt icon would simply state that the vehicle is at a lack of sunlight, therefore power, and can not map until it\u0027s back in direct light. So you don\u0027t really need to attend to it, more as acknowledge an obvious event that has happened relative to the time it\u0027s been happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecoming back to how time warp will be affected, your Duna bound vessel is now leaving Kerbin\u0027s Soi, and you\u0027re in for a looooong travel. Of course, you could also leave this trip to it\u0027s own devices while you manage real time events, but in the event that you don\u0027t have anything else requiring your attention, or \u0022will\u0022 be requiring your attention in the span of the trip, you can activate extended time warp, and fast forward the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, say you left the satellite up? Well, even though it\u0027s due to constantly enter a powerless state, the rail logic would have to have known this to begin with, and therefor could simply treat it as a time when the satellite isn\u0027t mapping. As for the base, unless something specific happens, time could still be sped up to that point, allowing you to act appropriately to it, while shortening your Duna trip by that much of your own time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only an idea, and I\u0027m a bit skipped around in this post. But I\u0027m polishing the idea for my own suggestion on how to allow resources and other game mechanics fit within this rule of time for career.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I think this is pretty much along the lines of what I had in mind too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome kind of optional alert to break you out of warp when a different craft meets some kind of objective does seem like a good idea, and is something we have seen in the mods already (Kerbal alarm clock). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also toyed with an addition to this, which would be to make the kerbal universe time somehow matter. For example, right now let\u0027s say you miss your launch window to Duna. No biggie, just turn on 100,000 times warp and wait for the next launch window. There\u0027s no disadvantage to doing this, because right now \u0022kerbal time\u0022 is not really relevant. But imagine if there was some disadvantage. For example (again, clearly career mode focused), imagine if you had to get some kind of return from your space program within certain amounts of time or risk going bankrupt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.23 terms (just as a for instance) we might say that you need to acquire a certain amount of science data in a certain amount of time.

Perhaps you would need to scrape together another small mission with whatever budget you have left over to gather just a bit of science around Kerbin to keep your space program afloat. Or perhaps you can\u0027t wait for a Duna window, you need data now, better get a satellite Kerbal satellite or two up in the meantime. It does seem to add a lot of additional dynamic to the game and provides more continuity, which seems important to career mode.

There was also some mechanics with weeds and automatic removal of them. It sounded really cool and I started a project for breeding plants. However, the mechanics worked in such a way that you had to attend the plants every now and then, so whenever I decided to build an intercontinental railway or a castle or whatever, I had to take a break from my current project to tend the plants. Slowly, but steadily, I started disliking the plant breeding part because it always interfered with my other projects. In the end, I gave up on it altogether because it ruined the rest of my game experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point I\u0027m trying to make (and sorry about the round-about way of saying it) is that I fear introducing time as a valuable resource in itself to KSP, will have the same effect on my enjoyment of KSP as the plants had on my Minecraft Tekkit experience. I love the freedom that KSP (and Minecraft) provides for me to do whatever I like whenever I like. I can leave my Minecraft castle half-finished and come back to it later, or I can put my KSP plane project on hold and take a trip to Duna instead. However, if I were forced to halt my mission to Duna because I had to do a manned mission to Mun before the probe arrives at Duna instead, I\u0027m afraid it might remove some of the fun of KSP, at least for me.

I think the fun (for me) in KSP is overcoming the challenge of building a rocket (or plane/station/whatever) that is able to do what I\u0027ve set my mind to. Building a rocket that is able to win a race against time (like getting to Eve before life support runs out or whatever) is basically the same challenge. However, if all I want to do is go to Eeloo, then doing all kinds of other missions while waiting to get there might feel boring and take the fun out of those missions when they might have been my #1 priority if I could do them when I became excited about them instead of when I really wanted to do something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA way to please everyone (or at least almost everyone) might be to have several options when starting a Career game (or adjusting while playing).

If you\u0027re concerned that selecting a craft and pressing time-acceleration is \u0022not playing the game\u0022, then why aren\u0027t we already complaining about it when we fly interplanetary missions? The expense of using time-acceleration is that you may miss a transfer window.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually agree with this, the problem is not time acceleration as such, as I said that\u0027s a necessary mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like you to do in order to understand what I\u0027m saying is to think about how a player actually plays the game. I will continue using the example of a surface scanning satellite, because that seems like an obvious kind of mechanic we might want to have.(Aside: and not just for some abstract \u0022science points\u0022. You would want to do it in order to find good landing sites for your next mission. This is important. There\u0027s no need to add \u0022gimmicks\u0022 to make it fun and useful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player builds their rocket, sends it to Duna, puts the satellite in orbit and starts scanning. Now, this scanning process is going to take a long time... weeks or months of game time. So how are they going to achieve this? Well, clearly they\u0027re going to time accelerate. But while they are doing that, all they can do is watch the satellite orbit. They cannot go and launch another ship and do something else, because as soon as the player switches away from that craft it will stop functioning. I like the word CodatheSpaceFox used: there\u0027s a \u0022meanwhile\u0022 problem. All operations of your space program have to be performed serially, and the player is locked in to doing literally nothing for several minutes if they want to complete their scanning. This is what I talked about in my second point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, so the player might get bored being forced to do nothing for a few minutes, but at least time acceleration means they don\u0027t actually have to wait months of real life time for this to occur. But here\u0027s the thing: if the player does accept that they have to just warp through it and watch things happen, time in the kerbal universe is going to advance quite significantly. Their whole space program is essentially doing nothing for that duration. This brings me to the first point: at the moment there\u0027s no drawback to doing this. (Of course there couldn\u0027t be right now, because the player has no other choice, and punishing them for something they can\u0027t change would be silly).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let me switch to the example of the last mission I ran in 0.22 career mode. It was the first mission I launched in a new career, using just starting parts, and it earned over 5000 science. I gravity assisted my way around almost the whole Kerbal system. If I \u0022missed\u0022 a graivty assist it didn\u0027t matter, I just warped around until I had another opportunity. I planned maneuvers to get intercepts three or four orbits in advance to minimize delta V, and then just warped through to the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total, the mission took something like 20 in game years. But surely that doesn\u0027t make sense in terms of the realities of running a space program. I essentially exploited the fact that nothing in the game itself \u0022cares\u0022 how long it takes you to do something. When I eventually recovered my craft and went to build my next mission the fact that the first one had taken so long had no material impact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-17T08:04:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2013 08:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dartimos","CreatedById":97126,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T08:04:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn option is to make the player able to go back forth in time post-mission.

(Reputation). So exploiting a fixed monthly income by timewarping far into the future could easily be countered by a loss of reputation over the time period, making the monthly gains proportionally less until the practice of warping forward without doing anything is no longer viable. Along with this there can be an inflation mechanic applied to costs.

On it\u0027s own it\u0027s not a very elegant solution. I\u0027m starting to think that there will have to be a very fine balance between the speed at which science is gathered, and money is accumulated. We need enough money to continue launching, and successful missions should be rewarded with the means to launch again. The scientific equipment in the tech tree should maybe be well spread out so that you need to use it on many missions to many different places to reach the next technology tier (this might require bigger steps in the tree as well). You basically exhaust the science points available to a particular piece of scientific equipment at the locations you can reach with your current rocket technology at which point it becomes obsolete, and gets replaced with something better higher in the tree. Re-visiting places now gets you more science with the new science equipment, and better rocket parts let you reach more distant worlds. I guess it\u0027s a kind of layered approach that encourages you to be bold in spreading out as far as you can with what you have, but also makes it worthwhile to revisit places later. Players will have more concurrent missions, which do necessitate some time-warping, but I feel that this is more acceptable than time warping with no active missions just to reach some future date (be it a monthly budget replenishment or a transfer window).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
