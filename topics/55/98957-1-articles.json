It started when I was thinking about how to do real IVA\u0027s in which Kerbals could move from module to module without exiting the vehicle. The trouble is how do you view that? The spaces are so confined it seems it would be really difficult to both view and program wayfinding. My idea is that a new cutaway view could be added for vessels in the VAB and in flight, in which everything but interior cabins and working components (essentially things that give options when right-clicked) would be ghosted. You could then for instance very easily see and right-click two tanks to transfer fuel, or select and extend solar panels without doing mouse gymnastics. The other key thing you could do is control kerbals inside the vessel. They could sit up from seats and climb through the interior of the vessel, through docking ports, and later do more involved things in the science lab or ISRU processor, etc. This would involve some tricky programming I expect, creating a new kind of clipping to view only the interior surfaces of module interiors, and especially making connections between modules \u0027real\u0027 and navigable. In the end though on top of making vessels feel much more inhabited and cool I think it could make vehicle operations, especially the clumsy right-clicky kind, much simpler and more intuitive for the user.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-07T00:45:55Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T00:56:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I really like my computer dieing.

How did you do that! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell obviously I think this is a great idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks would need a \u0022crew tunnel\u0022 on off option in the tweekable menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this could be handled mostly through clever use of \u0022back face culling\u0022. Anyone ever play dungeon keeper 2? The tunnel roof was always there, but because you were looking down, it was facing away from you and was invisible. The back face was culled. Then when you go in to first person view the roof is rendered showing that you are in a tunnel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be part of a more detailed ship management view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing where I can see it not working is rovers built from larger ship parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

The tunnel thing is kind of a biggie. Not all of the parts seem to have them, but some do. Im sure this could be tweakable but then when a kerbal enters the tube I guess you grey them out so you can still show the tank? What about the radial attachment point? Can that serve as a tunnel entrance where there was none in the model? How does the animation for moving about the spaces work? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is by no means easy and I wouldn\u0027t expect it anytime soon. Maybe if there were a life-support expansion in the future. Still, it would be really handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
