In that respect the Poodle follows the same principal as the LV-N, which is usefull in spite of having even worse twr than the Poodle. Low engine twr becomes a problem only if the vessel that it propels has low mass to begin with, then an engine with lower isp but also significantly lower mass might provide more d-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the Poodle sort of lost its niche when some of the other engines were buffed. I\u0027m not sure what would be the best fix for the Poodle, but i think giving it high isp \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E high twr is not the right solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
