If you\u0027re doing Rockomax (2.5m) missions, it\u0027s both aesthetically correct, structurally correct (stronger attachment nodes, I believe), and quite possibly aerodynamically superior under the new system. The weight is no big deal for Mun and Minimus landings with a 16 tank and a Poodle, and certainly no big deal on top of a full 2.5m launch stack. If you\u0027re doing 2.5m stuff, why wouldn\u0027t you use it?

But lets address some points here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s only aesthetically correct on it\u0027s own, when you try to actually build a lander out of the thing (like an apollo style 2 man lander) you\u0027ll find the thing weighs so much that it becomes unwieldly. I may be a crap builder, but mine looks nothing like the superlight apollo LEM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 MK1 lander cans could also be considered structurally correct, since the considerably lighter pods wouldn\u0027t need as strong of a node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 2 Mk1 pods would cause less atmo drag, being 1.25 meter parts, they have a smaller cross section. Also, arguably both versions of the can are most optimal for non-atmo landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In my experiences (again, apollo style attempts) the weight is absolutely a big deal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It\u0027s not necessarily 4 times the material, it\u0027s only 4 times the volume, but since the wall thickness is presumably the same as the smaller version, given that they have the same crash tolerance, then the wall-to-space ratio of the area becomes smaller, meaning that the larger version would actually weigh less per amount of volume than the smaller pod, and only end up weighing slighty more overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:09:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the mk2 is just not ideal, particularly for anyone unwilling to make fairings that don\u0027t look reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s 2.66t and 0.16t is mono.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1 is 0.66t, and 0.06t is mono. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn AIS masses 0.1 for the same torque as the mk2, and the SIRW has 5 torque for 0.05t, 2 more torque than the mk1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 mk1 pods is 1.32t, and only differs by 10 mono, and 6 vs 15 torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStripped of unused parts and mono, the 2 mk1 pods would be 0.90t.
