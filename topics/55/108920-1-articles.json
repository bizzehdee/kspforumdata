The MK2 weighted a lot more than the MK1 but was more crash tolerant as well as having a larger size. We see this as well in the MK1 and MK1-2 Command pods even in the current update. It weighs more than the smaller ones tripled but has a much greater crash tolerance as well which balances it.\n\nBut now the MK1 and MK2 have the exact same crash tolerance and the MK2 weighs over twice as much as a doubled MK1! Why would you ever use it?\n\nI mean sure I guess it has bigger reaction wheels, but I can add an external one to get the same capability and it still weighs under half. Bigger diameter size? Maybe, but why does it weigh over TWICE as a doubled MK1 instead of like 125%-130% as much???"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T16:54:28Z","Content":"It has 2 seats, where the small one only has one. That\u0027s important if you want to level up your crew. If you\u0027re doing Rockomax (2.5m) missions, it\u0027s both aesthetically correct, structurally correct (stronger attachment nodes, I believe), and quite possibly aerodynamically superior under the new system. The weight is no big deal for Mun and Minimus landings with a 16 tank and a Poodle, and certainly no big deal on top of a full 2.5m launch stack. If you\u0027re doing 2.5m stuff, why wouldn\u0027t you use it? I certainly wouldn\u0027t dream of using the small one in any circumstances other than very early missions (before 2.5m stuff is properly unlocked in the tech tree), or very long range solo missions.\n\nThere\u0027s also basic maths. It\u0027s not twice the size, it\u0027s 4 times the size. Area = \u00C3\u00E2\u201A\u00ACr^2^. If anything, either it\u0027s not heavy enough, or the small can is too heavy, based on its size and structural capacity.\n\nIf crash tolerance is an issue, either your design or piloting skills are lacking. Crash tolerance should be irrelevant for it, due to the tanks, engine, and landing gear below it."},{"CreatedByName":"Keith_Bones","CreatedById":143851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:23:16Z","Content":"I think the point being made here is that even though the MK2 has 2 seats, it\u0027s actually more efficient just to stack and / or clip two of the smaller MK1 cans together to achieve crew capacity. But lets address some points here.\n\n- It\u0027s only aesthetically correct on it\u0027s own, when you try to actually build a lander out of the thing (like an apollo style 2 man lander) you\u0027ll find the thing weighs so much that it becomes unwieldly. I may be a crap builder, but mine looks nothing like the superlight apollo LEM.\n\n- 2 MK1 lander cans could also be considered structurally correct, since the considerably lighter pods wouldn\u0027t need as strong of a node.\n\n- 2 Mk1 pods would cause less atmo drag, being 1.25 meter parts, they have a smaller cross section. Also, arguably both versions of the can are most optimal for non-atmo landers.\n\n- In my experiences (again, apollo style attempts) the weight is absolutely a big deal\n\n- It\u0027s not necessarily 4 times the material, it\u0027s only 4 times the volume, but since the wall thickness is presumably the same as the smaller version, given that they have the same crash tolerance, then the wall-to-space ratio of the area becomes smaller, meaning that the larger version would actually weigh less per amount of volume than the smaller pod, and only end up weighing slighty more overall."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:09:18Z","Content":"Yeah, the mk2 is just not ideal, particularly for anyone unwilling to make fairings that don\u0027t look reasonable.\n\nIt\u0027s 2.66t and 0.16t is mono.\n\nMk1 is 0.66t, and 0.06t is mono. \n\nAn AIS masses 0.1 for the same torque as the mk2, and the SIRW has 5 torque for 0.05t, 2 more torque than the mk1.\n\n2 mk1 pods is 1.32t, and only differs by 10 mono, and 6 vs 15 torque.\n\nStripped of unused parts and mono, the 2 mk1 pods would be 0.90t.
