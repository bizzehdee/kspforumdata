Take a look at some ideas I have for the cockpits and probe cores in KSP, and tell me what you think. I also have suggestions for engines, fuel tanks, SAS, rover wheels, etc. but I will add those only after I get a few responses from the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAircraft Cockpits\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the torque, mass, and impact tolerances are pretty good on the aircraft cockpits (Mk1, Mk2, and Mk3), but the drag values don\u0027t make any sense. I think they should all be set to a value of 0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMk2 Lander Can\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lander can is ridiculously heavy for its statistics. I think that a mass of 1.1 tons would make it more balanced. My reasoning behind this is that two of Mk1 lander cans are usually better in every way than a Mk2 lander can. Two Mk1 cans total 1.2 tons, so making the Mk2 lander can a bit less than that makes sense. If 1.1 tons seems a bit overpowered, the impact tolerance could be lowered to perhaps 6 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECupola Module\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Cupola module could have two parameters changed to make it more balanced - mass and drag. It makes sense to me that the Cupola is kind of fragile and a bit heavy, but I think 4.5 tons is a bit overdone. That\u0027s even heavier than a 3-man command pod! 2.5 tons makes more sense to me. It\u0027s still pretty heavy, but not ridiculously heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbodobodyne QBE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn comparison to the OKTO2, the QBE is twice as heavy. It does have good impact tolerance, but to the honest, most of the time impact tolerance isn\u0027t that important for probe cores. Thus, since the QBE\u0027s description makes it sound like a high-tech probe, maybe it would use less electricity than the other probe cores (1.0 e/m).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProbodobodyne HECS and OKTO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince these probe cores are basically the same as the OKTO2 probe core, I think their masses should be reduced to 0.05 and their reaction torque reduced to 0.15.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESmall Remote Guidance Unit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems with this guidance unit is its low torque. It\u0027s very hard to rotate a 1.25m ship around with only this guidance unit, if this ship has any respectable size at all. I think giving it a reaction torque of 3 makes sense. The ASAS module has a reaction torque of 20. Twenty divided by 5 (since its mass is 0.5) gives 4. That means for a mass of 0.1, it would have a torque of 4. Thus, giving the Small Remote Guidance Unit a torque of 3 makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELarge Remote Guidance Unit\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same problem occurs with the large guidance unit as with the small one - it has a really tiny amount of torque. Giving the Large Remote Guidance Unit a torque of 15 makes sense, and is just an extrapolation from my calculations for the small guidance unit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keymaster89","CreatedById":100480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T16:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAircraft Cockpits: I think that a lower drag are well suited for this cockpits as they are AIRCRAFT cockpits, especially for mk1 and 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 Lander Can: Mk2 is a bit heavy indeed but u should consider this is suited for large size landers, where the mass of the lander compared to other large components is not that much and it also have 25% more torqe than 2 mk1 toghether (also 2 small cockpit on a large lander look terribly ugly if u ask me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECupola Module: the price of beauty, glass, glass everywhere, glass = MASS. \u0022 The PPD-12 was developed to provide a high visibility control room for ORBITAL STATIONS\u0022 u shoudn\u0027t really use that anywhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne QBE: i agree, but they should set the torqe to 0.1... how can u fit a effective rotation disk in a squared chasing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbodobodyne HECS and OKTO: OKTO2 is 1/3 their height, and u can\u0027t place things there effectly, so they\u0027re ok as they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall Remote Guidance Unit \u002B Large Remote Guidance Unit: both have low torqe because this not an cockpit-inlay reaction hybrid, but a cockpit-battery hybrid, they have triple energy storage compared to other cockpit. also, as they have a standard inline form, u can fit really easy a inlay reaction immidiatly on top or under them and solve the torqe problem...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T19:08:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with everything I don\u0027t note below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe cockpit drag is higher so that airplanes tend to keep their noses forward.
