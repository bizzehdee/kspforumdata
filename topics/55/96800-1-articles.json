The problem is when you dock the newly launched equipment with a preexisting station, the parts are marked as old.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of what I did to figure this out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a contract, got a station up and then took another contract that was for the same station, plus a science lab. The first module had space for 5 kerbals and all the equipment (it didn\u0027t need a science lab and didn\u0027t have one) while the second module had the same equipment and a science lab, but only had space for 2 kerbals instead of five. Launching the second module, the objectives for the newly launched power, antenna and docking port along with a science lab were completed. When the module docked with the first, the room for 5 kerbals objective also became completed, but the one for launching the new equipment became unchecked. I had to do another launch to dock a 3 man pod onto the second module and undock from the first module to get the contract completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a way to tell that a module docked to a station was launched after a contract was accepted, I think it would make it possible to keep using a same station to dock to and maybe result in contracts requiring more components on a station since you could already have some in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T23:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOther than being spammed with too many such contracts, I\u0027m not sure I have a problem with be contracted to add to existing stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T23:58:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes this seems like a bug rather than a feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
