I apologize in advance if I do though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing an avid SSTO spaceplane fan, I find it sad when one of my craft returns to the KSC and is stuck there with no fuel, even though the plane itself is entirely capable of reaching orbit again. I\u0027ve seen some people make creative fuel truck designs with docking ports, but I would love to see a more fleshed out version of this. Perhaps there could be an option to spawn fuel trucks of various sizes and fuel types, preferably costing resources in career mode, which could then be used to refuel and refit the spacecraft. Each fuel truck would have a hose which a Kerbal would have to manually attach to a player-placed fuel port on the ship in order to transfer fuel. This way, the same spaceplanes may be used to shuttle personnel and payloads to orbital stations without requiring a new mission. Even if the whole truck isn\u0027t implemented, if at least the hose and fuel port system is, it could be used by players to make their own fuel trucks and provide an easier refueling option than docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs well as the fuel truck, I would also love to see a fuel equalize button. For instance, some of my craft will have fuel imbalances which are difficult to manually transfer and manage. I propose in the fuel transfer screen, there be an \u0022equalize\u0022 button in addition to the \u0022in\u0022 and \u0022out\u0022 buttons. This would automatically split the difference of fuel in the tanks and save everyone a few minor headaches. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope everyone like the ideas and, again, I really hope they haven\u0027t been suggested a hundred times already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T22:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use a mobile fuel canister to refuel mine with a docking port.
