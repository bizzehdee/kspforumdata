In all the time ive used clipping (minus a few problematic parts like service bays or the claws that seem to go all crazy with any clipping), ive never had any issues except increased suceptibility to catastrophic fuselage explosion after being rammed or hit by a armor-piercing weapon. Provided none of the clipped parts get detached, you can have over 50 fuel tanks clipped into each other with no issues at all (for a time i had a fighter that had like 30 or so FLT-100s clipped together inside a mk2 cargo bay as no other fuel tank would fit there along with 2 missiles on each side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, on to the actual topic at hand, i am not fundamanetally against the new turbine part, but there are 2 things i do not like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne, the new turbine ONLY puts limits on aesthetic designs such as VTOLs (one of the most popular VTOL design that will be killed off is the turbojet inside a mk2 bay, now youll get a massive turbine sticking out of the top). Perhaps the new jumo-004 (maybee its just me but the first thing that came to mind when i saw that little thing was a me262 engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E) jet will work for VTOLs since the basic jet engine sucks for everything but career mode where you have nothing better off the bat. Again, whether VTOLs survive depends on whether that small new jet has both enough thrust to lift something ~10-30t without requiring more then say 10 of them, and whether it can fully fit inside a mk2 bay including that turbine thingy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, and this is more of a \u0022why bother\u0022 opinion, is that in 95% of cases, you will never ever see the internal unless you offset the engine to be outside of the fuselage (or make a VTOL the old fashioned way). SO aside from a few \u0022redneck\u0022 style planes with exposed jet engines, nobody will actually see the jet engine in the first place. And what i get out of this, is that it only adds extra polygons that wont even be seen (and while i know part count is the lag problem, extra polys when they are never even seen being rendered is just a waste of resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis change wont affect me too much, since virtually all of my aircraft are SSTOs (or should i say SSTLs, single stage to laythe and back). With those, the extra 2 tons of jet engine really kills the range, and if i have a design that can even carry 2 tons to laythe and back, id rather use it to bring actual payload with me. I used to be an avid fan of VTOL designs (in the old aero, they didnt really add much drag when exposed and sideways), but recently i kinda find those to be more of a gimmick, and for me, exclusive to ground attack craft that actually need to be able to hover to line up a shot on a enemy tank (and since i dont do combat on kerbin, that makes rockets mandatory for said VTOLs). Most of my jet powered builds will be fine whether its changed or not, at worst my few laythe optimized VTOLs will be dead (or need redesign). Im just of the opinion that it adds nothing to gameplay (and every realistic design will not have it visible anyways), and only limits those that want to make sci-fi and other non classic jet plane style craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T16:45:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s a bold statement what completely ignores the creativity of people other than you.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so people might find a way to use the turbine visibly in their designs.
