No idea. However, weather is listed on the [thread=36863]What Not to Suggest List[/thread]. As such, I\u0027m going to have to close this one, sorry. Please take the time to glance over what is on the list, and also note that if you wish to discuss potential implementations of a specific feature or part of a feature, you should do so under the [Discussion] tag, by either suggesting ways it could be done or simply asking how it might be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile your ideas for potential results of a weather implementation are sound, one must also consider things like the effect it will have on Career mode as a whole; whether it can delay rocket or spaceplane launches or completely destroy them; how different weather effects might be implemented, including simulation of things like wind, clouds, rain, lightning and more dramatic things; potentially even figuring out whether or not it is desirable to include rare yet devastating natural disasters like hurricanes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeather is a complex thing, so a two or three line suggestion isn\u0027t going to cover all of it, so it may be better suited to a discussion topic if you should choose to start one in future. If you do, just make sure you have a very specific idea of what you want to be discussing, since \u0022weather\u0022 is a very broad area of game mechanics and covers an awful lot of possibilities. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T12:32:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 12:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
