I\u0027m thinking something like a radar altimeter, and a bearing/navball-type indicator and potentially a resource amount for jetpack fuel and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was reading some threads about using your jetpack to get to orbit and I thought, every time I do it, I get frustrated having to constantly flick to the map view because I can\u0027t be certain where I\u0027m actually thrusting, etc, nor how high off the ground I am (which will help when I thrust straight up and need to slow down on the way back down!)..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts? I don\u0027t want a hugely cluttered GUI, but a couple of bits of info might be useful (perhaps if they were displayed in the corner as a kerbal\u0027s arm on an armband (ie: like a Quarterback)), but with electronic widgets to display the data...maybe more like a Pipboy or something \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but obviously it\u0027d only be small and in the bottom corner or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Further thinking makes me think that that kind of GUI would make more sense for a 1st person EVA GUI...which if it happened, we should also have heavy breathing noises \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T10:40:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 10:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmappedout\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-03T11:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean a HUD?
