Another option would be to have a station that you interplanetary missions can dock with, refuel, use a science lab to clean and reset experiments, and recrew as needed. My one concern is if done this way is that after it is done and I recover the vessel that say has been to Jool and all its moons do I get the orbit and landed on science on the one craft, or just the last one I do?
