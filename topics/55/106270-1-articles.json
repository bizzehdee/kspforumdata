For example, I want Jeb in the lower cockpit and he\u0027ll stay in there so I can obstruct the hatch as much as I like, leaving the top one clear for Olivia to enter. But, there\u0027s no way of really knowing which cockpit is which, you have to guess, basically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to use that fancy edge highlighting to highlight the cockpit when I mouse over it in the crew tab. Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yxCQs9H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yxCQs9H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease excuse the awful \u0027shop - I don\u0027t have the steadiest hand and none of my screenshot software captures the mouse so I had to use one from one of the 1.0 preview pics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T12:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this notion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this would be a nice QoL improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
