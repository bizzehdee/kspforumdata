All I\u0027m saying is that after u5 update is done then maybe squad could port the game to iOS and android. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong on the ram stuff.

No comparison. When I looked at a more in-depth comparison a few years back, the x86 CPUs were even also more powerful per Watt. It might be different today, because ARM use smaller scale of integration today, but the point is that ARM processors are used in mobile devices because of their small size and low \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Etotal \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003Epower consumption, not because of their efficiency.

Nope, it would be KSP only in name and theme. In other ways it would be a different game, and I suspect that the same will be true for the announced console games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-25T13:11:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would saturate your network connection, not to mention being an enormous technical undertaking on Squad\u0027s part; setting up a cloud computing architecture is a very large and complex task.
