Implementing one thing means not implementing something else. Adding this would be a fairly large feature, that has nothing to do with flying planes and spaceships. I can think of a lot of other features I\u0027d rather see before they spent time on this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royying","CreatedById":20591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T09:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr just add a launch location option in SPH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T10:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile they\u0027re at it, perhaps they could bring the runway at the island airport back down to sea level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was useful back in the day, forever ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T11:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it doesn\u0027t have to be a full-blown shipyard, but at least some way so we don\u0027t have to wheel our boats for half a mile just to get to water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be as simple as making a small lagoon or a bay in place of the grass next to the runway, so we can roll straight from the runway into the water.
