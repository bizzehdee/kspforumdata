The important part of it is that the question is not about how given individual player wants to play the game but how the game authors, designers and developers wanted people to play it. How, and why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is usually not a point with KSP. It is a single player game so cheating is only what you choose as cheating, be it quickload, revert, usage of certain mods, editing persistence file, modding parts or hacking the game code. But when it is about where the game should go further, I believe it becomes the central point again. It SHOULD become the central point. Because developing a game is not about blindly piling features one on top of another. \u003Cem\u003EEspecially\u003C/em\u003E if you\u0027re developing such an open game like KSP. It can be seen on KSP that it underwent such phase in its history and there are still many open ends waiting to be tied. But at least to me it appears that now the development team is going after some central idea again and my guess is that they\u0027re not going to let things get out of hand again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any of you who voted Yes tried to stop and think about such ethereal things like what might be the background idea or psychology of KSP? If such simple and easy to implement feature like dv readout is not in the game yet, what might be the reason why is that so? Would it really move the game in the direction where it is intended to go? Not intended by you, but intended by developers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is no. Each of you is playing their own game and you play it the way which requires deeper scientific approach than what the stock game offers. So you use MechJeb, KER, or other tools and mods which help you play it the way you prefer. \u003Cem\u003EThere\u0027s nothing wrong on that.\u003C/em\u003E But the question remains: \u003Cem\u003Ewas the game really intended to be played that way?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are massive problems with this. Yes, there\u0027s \u0022designer intent\u0022, but in the case of KSP, the intent seems downright schizophrenic. On the one hand, theres plenty of game flavor that can be generalized as \u0022Kerbalz r dum, lolz\u0022, and on the other, there are plenty of cases of advanced information provided (e.g. specific impulse) and relatively advanced physical concepts needed for basic gameplay (e.g. hohmann transfers).

Maybe just have it toggleable or something. Aside from the terribly over-padded GUI in Engineer, my biggest gripe is that I can\u0027t turn off the vessel simulation. I don\u0027t really care about in-flight delta-V (but I do want the altitude and orbit numbers!) since I tend to over-engineer and having a full-blown vessel simulation going while I\u0027m flying does impact performance (although Padishar has done some wonderful work to help).\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, most of my objection to having a delta-V window in KSP comes from nostalgia, the desire to see more important things fixed/added first, and performance concerns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I must have missed this one earlier. Yes, the vessel simulation does have an impact on performance (especially with large craft) but all you have to do to turn off the vessel simulation is to close the VES tab. This can be clearly seen by running something like Fraps to give an fps count and then opening and closing the VES window. On my dodgy laptop with a 379 part, 3500 ton rocket with 9 asparagus stages and a complex asteroid tug on top, I get about 11 fps on the launch pad looking straight up. If I open the VES window this drops to 8 with occasional drops to 5. On a faster computer the difference shouldn\u0027t be as significant but should still be easily measurable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis level of performance degradation is unacceptable and I will be working on this area very soon (i.e. as soon as my replacement machine arrives). I have a number of optimisations already planned and will also be adding an option to control the rate at which the simulation runs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speed of the simulation code depends most on the part count and the complexity of the fuel flow. I don\u0027t usually use the vessel tab much during flight. I almost never use it during launch (unless I\u0027m doing specific testing of KER) when the surface and orbit tabs are much more important.

The important part of it is that the question is not about how given individual player wants to play the game but how the game authors, designers and developers wanted people to play it. How, and why. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is usually not a point with KSP. It is a single player game so cheating is only what you choose as cheating, be it quickload, revert, usage of certain mods, editing persistence file, modding parts or hacking the game code. But when it is about where the game should go further, I believe it becomes the central point again. It SHOULD become the central point. Because developing a game is not about blindly piling features one on top of another. \u003Cem\u003EEspecially\u003C/em\u003E if you\u0027re developing such an open game like KSP. It can be seen on KSP that it underwent such phase in its history and there are still many open ends waiting to be tied. But at least to me it appears that now the development team is going after some central idea again and my guess is that they\u0027re not going to let things get out of hand again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave any of you who voted Yes tried to stop and think about such ethereal things like what might be the background idea or psychology of KSP? If such simple and easy to implement feature like dv readout is not in the game yet, what might be the reason why is that so? Would it really move the game in the direction where it is intended to go? Not intended by you, but intended by developers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is no. Each of you is playing their own game and you play it the way which requires deeper scientific approach than what the stock game offers. So you use MechJeb, KER, or other tools and mods which help you play it the way you prefer. \u003Cem\u003EThere\u0027s nothing wrong on that.\u003C/em\u003E But the question remains: \u003Cem\u003Ewas the game really intended to be played that way?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure any of us can speak authoritatively about how the developers intend the game to be played. Honestly, I think that\u0027s a moving target as their intentions change as the game develops. Sure, people point to posts by or interviews with the devs and squeeze every iota of meaning out of them and treat them as gospel, but that isn\u0027t so. The developers are people, their ideas of what the game should be are changing as it evolves, just like ours are. One of the major benefits of early release software is that the devs benefit from direct feedback from the players before the game\u0027s design is firmly cast, and that\u0027s what\u0027s going on in threads like this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the devs had a firm vision of the game that wasn\u0027t going to be affected by player feedback then why would they release it before completion? Why make the game so mod-friendly if not to see what features the community of players find desirable enough to develop?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the devs are going to make the game as they see fit. It is their game after all, and it isn\u0027t a democracy. But I cannot imagine that they completely ignore the feedback from the community and stick to some cast-in-stone plan. It is important for us, as an ancillary part of the development process, to give the devs our feedback on what we think of each release and where we think the game should go as it develops. It does them no good for us to withhold our opinions about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I had been asked if a dV calculator was necessary or even desirable back when Kerbin\u0027s SOI contained every landable body, I would have said no. I was playing happily without one at the time, and I seemed to be able to complete missions reasonably well despite my lack of physics training and mediocre piloting. But the game changed. Adding other planets meant there was a system full of other bodies to explore, and I didn\u0027t have the skills necessary to get to them. So I learned about delta-V, transfer windows and all that. I wrote spreadsheets, used online tools, and installed mods to make the complicated tasks of interplanetary travel accessible to someone of my modest skill. Are there players that can do these things without any tools? Definitely, but I\u0027m not one of them and I suspect that as the game becomes more mainstream, more and more non-rocket scientist types are playing who are in the same boat as me. So we\u0027re getting into a situation where the game contains a substantial amount of content (the other planets) that is nearly inaccessible to a larger and larger fraction of the player base. No one likes being made to feel stupid, and unfortunately KSP in its stock form has a way of doing that for those uninitiated in orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis cannot be good for the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that all of the tools that improve the chances of success are available, if you\u0027ve got the time to delve into the forums and find the mods or links to web tools that make rocket science palatable to the mathematically ungifted. I was patient and lucky enough to be able to do so. But I feel a game that requires these things of many players is lacking in accessibility. The game should provide the tools that give most players a reasonable chance of success, and I think a delta-V calculator is one of the most important of those tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to your main question \u0022How is the game meant to be played?\u0022, I have to answer that I think we are meant to explore all these worlds the devs have made for us. I hope that they provide the tools to help almost anyone have a chance at doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-29T08:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELets ignore right, wrong, realistic, and even good and bad gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are a game developer, your aim is to sell as many games as you can (obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E86% of the people in your forum have voted that they want something in the game and 13% have voted against.
