In most cases, at launch (usually at sea level) the rocket fire is huge, often as long as the rocket itself, and as it ascends into lower pressure\u00A0the flame spreads out and gets shorter\u00A0(and seemingly redder). In outer space, rocket fire is hardly even flamelike anymore; it spreads out very rapidly and is often almost invisible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe\u00A0something could be added\u00A0that makes the rocket fire spread and length\u00A0inversely proportional to the local atmospheric pressure or altitude;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat alone would make a huge difference to the realism of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow are pictures of rocket exhaust at low altitude, vacuum, and in ksp for comparison\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022falcon-heavy-blog.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://spacecoastlaunches.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/falcon-heavy-blog.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022512\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00226373217_orig.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.spaceflight101.net/uploads/6/4/0/6/6406961/6373217_orig.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022liftoff.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.scientificgamer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/liftoff.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thorn_Ike","CreatedById":182219,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T21:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if Squad is pursuing realistic plumes much, but I would recommend RealPlume:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed7342170003\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130576-14-realplume-stock-v120-30318-the-farewell-update/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:223px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s listed 1.4, but it works with 1.5 no problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
