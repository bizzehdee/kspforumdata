The first time I played was actually a demo about a year ago but I found the learning curve too steep and the user interface confusing\u00A0and I might not have played again if I hadn\u0027t rediscovered on youtube. I really love the game and want it to be even better. I\u0027ll try and be as constructive as possible and\u00A0give specific suggestions to the problems I see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Map mode or stage mode for getting into orbit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think the way these modes are split currently makes sense.

In map mode I can control throttle and see the orbit, but I can\u0027t stage or see my fuel. This means you have to switch back and forth. Why is it designed like that? Which mode is the player supposed to fly in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPossible solutions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Add values of apoapsis and periapsis to stage mode (like in KER) so that it can be flown from there\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Keep staging and fuel info in map mode so it can be flown from there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- (My preference) Unify the modes- why are they different anyway?\u00A0How if\u00A0you scroll out in stage mode\u00A0you see the trajectory for adding maneuver nodes etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Mystery/hidden\u00A0meat UI and features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The main space center view.

You click and drag the circle, is that clear? Why not\u00A0drag-able arrows either side?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fuel transfer? Jetpack? Collecting science from instruments on EVA?

Its funny after a while playing you tend to just get used to these things, its so helpful to have a fresh eye on this kind of stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I completely agree with your diagnosis, and yeah, switching back and forth can be a bit of a pain, but Im not sure a straight pan-out would solve it. I think in the end switching views is going to be somewhat necessary so you can keep an eye on stage separation (usually to correct later if anything goes wrong) and still be able to look at your trajectory arc to see that you\u0027re burning efficiently. What would be helpful is keeping basically all of the UI elements consistent across both views. It might also be nice if the map view defaulted for new flights panned reasonably out and facing north so you had an intuitive perspective on your launch. I generally find I have to manually set that view each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) I agree with basically all of this. Its really just a lot of missing labeling and mouse-over tool-tips.

It\u0027s been talked about a lot on this board, I don\u0027t blame the devs, between aerodynamics and resources and the Unity upgrade and everything else\u00A0they\u0027ve had a lot on their plate this year, but more than anything I\u0027d love to see this and a few other key game mechanics tackled next. I think you\u0027re on the right track with your feeling that experiments need to provide the player with important information thats useful\u00A0beyond unlocking the tech tree. I would suggest things like the thermometer enabling heat bars and the gravoli functioning as a biome mapper, but I agree about aerobrake prediction and spotting easter-eggs as cool things that experiments could provide.\u00A0\u00A0I\u0027ve posted my own thoughts on this a couple of times\u00A0(\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123974-lets-talk-about-how-science-can-be-improved/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2253234\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0if you\u0027re interested), but key among them would be to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Einvolve players in the act of experimenting\u003C/em\u003E. Make the barometer pay out not based on where its clicked, but how great a vertical swath it passes through while running. Atmospheric analysis could require holding speed and altitude for a few seconds. Seismometers could be impact experiments and Materials bays could be where surfaces samples get gathered and processed. If all an experiment requires of a player is to click it, it ought to simply be automatic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T21:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ain\u0027t going to lie I had pretty much ever issue you stated when I first started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also will have to say this game is very complex, its one of those games that hands down needs to be learned to be played. It isn\u0027t very use friendly, nor does it offer a way to learn everything directly in the game. But then hey this game is ROCKET SCIENCE right? There is plenty of room for improvement, and I wont say I like its current state as being unhelpful in terms of newer player experience, but then few games are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember there was a certain very popular game that offered no tutorial or anything for the longest time, and left the players to literally google guides for it, It called Minecraft, and if you didn\u0027t know how to make a pick in the first 20 mins of the game you were going to get blown up. No guides, no tutorials, no dialog, no hints, nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.KER or Kerbal Engineer Redux helps, and is pretty much a mainstay mod if you plan on playing this game with any seriousness. The reason why some of its key functions are stock\u00A0 is a mystery to me and I believe are design decisions. (Especially in the case of Delta-V)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gives AP, PE and time to both, thus allowing you to fly in normal view to orbit with no problems.

As most games are, especially complex simulation games there is no way to get through every single control without unnecessary amounts of dialogs or popups.

The idea of finding game play information from science experiments is something I\u0027ve never heard of and like. But there is also the issue of throwing numbers at your face, on top of numbers, and gathering numbers. You just mentioned how Science isn\u0027t well explained, adding in real science that can apply to missions is helpful to some, but for most it isn\u0027t necessary.

This is something I think that made the community of this game pretty strong. There are great mods out there because of it, namely mods such as Kerbal Engineer, great information and tutorials made by the community.

That trial and error stage is hugely valuable and kind of critical to the early stages of playing, where you\u0027re trying to get a sense of how much fuel you need for different stages, attempting to gain an intuitive knowledge of ISP and launch profiles. No matter what, this stage is going to be hard, and keeping things clean and uncluttered from information overload seems smart. This initial informationless stage to me really extends to a players first successful orbit. Next players naturally will be gunning for a Mun or Minmus mission. Even at this point they don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E need to worry too much about delta-V--just starting to get acquainted\u00A0with maneuvers and landing seems plenty. It\u0027s after this point as players start to move into mounting interplanetary missions that things like delta-V and transfer windows become really invaluable. There\u0027s no reason this kind of staged information growth couldn\u0027t\u00A0be managed through building upgrades--granting things like alarms and dV and mission planning at tiers 2 or 3 out of 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you\u0027ve said, this game is plenty hard. What should be the focus is \u003Cem\u003Ehelping players to improve\u003C/em\u003E. Trial and error is a big part of learning, but in the later stages of the game it can be a huge time suck, and draws players into laborious, repetitive gameplay rather than allowing them to focus on the elements of the game that are most fun. Think about it, if you were a new player\u00A0with no transfer window information how many probes would you have to send to Duna to figure out the optimum window? How many hours of gameplay would you spend trying to answer this one question? 2? 6? 10 hours? And that for each planet? That seems completely insane to ask of players, which is why people use KAC and olex to do it for them, because its not a good use of in-game time. If you run out of fuel trying to reach the Mun, no biggie, send a rescue mission. But if you\u0027re building a multi-launch, orbitally constructed Jool mission you\u0027re going to need a dV estimator or risk wasting an incredible amount of time.\u00A0This is the same reason I\u0027ve advocated making science experiments involve themselves in the act of flying or become automatic, so that in-game time can be spent learning, flying, and exploring, rather than endlessly clicking through parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore than that though, a game really ought to be at least a \u003Cem\u003Eself-contained playable experience\u003C/em\u003E. If stock players have to pause play, minimize the game, open a browser and search through online dV charts and transfer angle calculators something is wrong. Tools necessary to play the game should be \u003Cem\u003Ein the game,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eand not require pulling players out of the experience and wasting time searching online.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-09T04:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2016 04:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
