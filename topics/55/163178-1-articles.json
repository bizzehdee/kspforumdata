Thanks once again for the wondrous never-ending time-sink that is KSP. \u00A0=;o}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI build a lot of VERY asparagated ships. My current one has 26 stages, and the bottom stage has all 25 pairs of engines, plus the one in the central core, *PLUS* the additional radial-mounted engines on many of those stages, all firing at launch (This is because I\u0027m trying to achieve orbit from a launch\u00A0at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with the gravity hacked to 10G...

If I want to scroll up and check whether any pairs of engines have been accidentally added to the wrong stage, I first have to scroll through all of those icons, which - with so many parts of the ship making the game\u00A0very laggy (especially after an hour of playing), is a *slow process*! (I\u0027m on a modest 4GB machine, not able to upgrade any time soon.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d like to be able to right click on the orange icon with the stage number, and click \u0022collapse stage\u0022, so that stages I don\u0027t need to see in detail get shrunk to\u00A0a reduced, sub-grouped description\u00A0with a single icon for each *type* of part present, and a number alongside showing how many are there.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI.e., instead of:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[LAUNCH STABILISER ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[LAUNCH STABILISER ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[LAUNCH STABILISER ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON]\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\njust show me:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[ENGINE ICON] \u00A0 \u00A0\u0022 x 6\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0[LAUNCH STABILISER ICON] \u0022 x 3\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis should make checking the staging of large, complex ships much quicker and easier. It would also make moving parts from (say) stage 5 down to stage 26 much easier, since the intervening stages won\u0027t take up quite so much screen space (though obviously any stage with just a pair of speratrors/decouplers in is going to take up just as much space as before, the ones with several pairs of sepatrons in will shrink a bit.)\u00A0At present, I\u00A0have to scroll the source stage right to the top of my screen;\u00A0grab the engine to be moved;\u00A0drag it to whichever stage is at the bottom of the screen (there seems to be no auto-scrolling... or if there is, it fails!);\u00A0then scroll *that* stage up to the top;\u00A0locate the icon for the engine I\u0027m trying to move;\u00A0then drag it down... and repeat as many times as necessary! =:o\\\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, we would\u00A0also need to be able to re-expand selected stages (same method: Right-click and select \u0022expand\u0022) once the time comes to drill down into what a particular stage has in it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn\u00A0alternative (and possibly simpler to implement) option would be to collapse the selected stage to just the orange stage-icon, nothing else (i.e. forget about me \u0022reduced description\u0022 idea. Then all stages (however simple) could be reduced in screen height, which would again help a lot with moving parts up and down a long staging list...
