The way I see it, crew and EVA reports are like \u0027captains logs\u0027. What they did, what they saw, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather see an implementation that allows me to check in on manned flights from time to time and see how they\u0027re doing. Whenever my guys get in orbit around Kerbin, it would be prudent to send a report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to propose a change. Allow EVA and crew reports to generate \u0027data points\u0027 at a set rate based on their biome and number of crew members. Capsules can store data, and then you can transmit that data for a few science points when you have enough of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this way, rather than simply send one flight up once and get an instant EVA \u002B Report points in six seconds, you would allow for every flight to generate a few points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe diminishing returns should be featured on a per capsule / per crew member basis?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see the same thing for experiments as well - taking time to perform and requiring some effort, instead of instant completion every time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T09:27:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool if you had a log of your EVA / Crew reports that you could overview throughout the mission (and possibly even afterwards). I\u0027d even like to see some more specific ones like \u0022Why am I writing this down mid-launch? What am I doing here!?\u0022 for a non badass crew member during initial ascent, or \u0022Oh man, check out those flames!\u0022 during re-entry. Stuff like this could really pull the player further into the game and make it feel like you\u0027re actually *in* the world of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
