And it\u0027s not impressive to build a ship with end of the tech tree parts because... Sandbox mode. If you want to complete the tech tree by timewarping a ship for a million years, good on you - you might as well play sandbox; there are already folks who complete the tech tree with two epic voyages around the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: also, if it becomes possible to start \u0022spamming\u0022 science like you\u0027re worried about, people are going to start saying \u0022I completed the tech tree in 10 Kerbal Days\u0022 or something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, as career mode develops more there may be other factors that limit the utility of just timewarp spamming science. Maybe you lose reputation if you don\u0027t launch anything for a certain amount of time. Maybe it cost money to maintain a space station. Maybe missions pop up after certain periods of game time that you need to respond to. I don\u0027t know how it\u0027ll work, but there seems to me to be plenty of latitude in potential features to balance the game that timewarp spamming won\u0027t be as much of a problem as we think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot trying to be contrary, just optimistic! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KvickFlygarn87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA station would be classified as a vessel with at least:\u003Cp\u003E20 docking ports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 Hitchhiker cans\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 Gigantor solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10 docked vessels\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s quite a space station! There may be part requirements but I imagine they\u0027ll be more progressive than that list. Your first space station might just require a hitchhiker and docking port but maybe the VIP\u0027s will get uppity as time goes by and not care to stay anywhere with less than 3 hitchikers for their next trip. Or maybe you\u0027ll get more reputation the more hitchhikers on the VIP\u0027s station.
