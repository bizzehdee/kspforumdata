Not only would this provide an opportunity to see crossing lines (a new staging ring will often show up at the bottom of the list, and with lines going from a stage to the part in its own interface would make that explicit) between stages and parts, but this type of auditing interface would also be a pretty addition to the game (it could even take the form of a blueprint). Additionally, the Engineers Report could be placed more prominently in this new screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andersenman","CreatedById":61273,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T05:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnforced speedbumps are bad.

Sure, you could improve the stageing interface a bit - lines from staging icons to parts and/or stages highlighted in different colors - but I think taht would be better if made part of the regular VAB/SPH, not an extra dialog/window I have to skip when ready to launch. add a new button where the part/crew/action buttons are and give the (extended) staging Ui a left side panel, and it is fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is when you have an extra dialog for staging, then the next person will suggest the ame for crew assignment. and then the next person for all issues in the engineering report, and then the next person... you get it. keep the game easy and simply and unobtrusive.
