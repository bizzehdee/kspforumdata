I HIGHLY doubt the plane\u0027s the OP is having trouble with are Bonanzas or similar. They probably have extremely high TWR, engines inline with CoM, jet engines, and a relatively high wing loading. More like a fighter jet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, keep in mind that Cherokees and Bonanzas have only mild dihedral and no or minimal tail dihedral. A properly-designed plane can indeed require no corrections, but it\u0027s so slow at correcting itself as to be useless at it. You absolutely need the controls.
