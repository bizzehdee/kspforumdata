Often times the reason for the multiple docking port arrangement is to force the alignment to be oriented the way you want, which is hard to do by hand with one central docking port because the control over roll rotation is too touchy and you can\u0027t get it to stop where you want it (even with caps lock on). (i.e. you tap the \u0022Q\u0022 key for as short a time as is humanly possible and you\u0027re rotating too much to the left, then you tap the \u0022E\u0022 key for as short a time as is humanly possible and you\u0027re now rotating too much to the right. The controls are oversensitive and that makes it impossible to get the darn thing to fully stop. This stems from the fact that the keyboard controls are all or nothing. They don\u0027t have an analog \u0022push just a little bit\u0022 ability. It may be easier with a joystick.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at any rate the fix is to stop locking the roll rotation permanently when docked. Allow docking rings to have a small electric motor that slowly rotates on the roll axis, to bring the two ships to the exact alignment you want. Something like this: The right click menu would have a button for \u0022lock/unlock roll\u0022. When unlocked, the ports are still attached, but now you can rotate the attachment a bit, then lock it again when done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
