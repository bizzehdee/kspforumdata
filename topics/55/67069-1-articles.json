I very much like your idea of an astronomy department that assists with planning trajectories for mission, finding launch windows etc. Pendrin. Thinking about it, maybe a small amount of initial science could be gained by mapping moons and planets with the telescope, too. Not so much that you;d have to do telescopic mapping first, just enough to give a wee bit of a boost initially for those that want/need it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGeoninja","CreatedById":92271,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T08:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis could be implemented after .24 as an additional contract/mission which results in a science bonus if you land in a specific biome which could prove if the Astronomy dept\u0027s initial analyze was correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
