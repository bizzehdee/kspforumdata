The old asset loading system has many issues that need to be fixed, the biggest of them all being that loading all of the parts into the RAM causes huge amounts of it to be eaten, making the 32-bit limit easy to reach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA new asset loading system would have to solve these issues (Among others, feel free to contribute):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003Cstrong\u003EDecreased memory usage: \u003C/strong\u003E This one is a no-brainer. KSP\u0027s asset loader consumes large amounts of RAM; a better asset loader would solve this. Arguably the biggest issue with the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u003Cstrong\u003ESpeed: \u003C/strong\u003E KSP\u0027s current asset loading system is very slow, as all of the parts that are used in KSP are loaded at once. Especially noticeable when using mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u003Cstrong\u003EA better method: \u003C/strong\u003E KSP currently loads everything that is in the GameData folder into memory. This is very inefficient, as some components need not be loaded. This needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with these issues in mind, how should SQUAD go about improving the asset loader? What techniques should they implement?
