The concept is simple, it makes mutiple parts behave as one part, greatly lowering the physic calculation. This is also useful for ships that are to fragile and break apart easily. This should be included into stock somehow, but without the clumsy menu UI. This mod does the job of struts of holding stuff togteher, but is better as it also lowers lag and improve fps! Naturally we use should upgrade our struts with this technology!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T20:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm. I\u0027m not sure how kludgy this would feel in practice. Don\u0027t strutted parts still move independently? Removing that might make it too easily exploitable, but I would have to see it in practice to know that for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T21:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKJR is good as well.
