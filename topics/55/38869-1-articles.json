This is the best way I can put the idea in my head into yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou put a lander on the Mun with a special module that permits structure planning. Nearby you land a container full of scrap metal. You undock a welding rover and drive it over to the container. From the planner module, you designate a nearby proximity as a scrap dump. Your welder rover then can pick up as much scrap as it can hold, and you drive it over to the designated area. You begin construction on a series of low walls that prevent scrap stored within from moving about too much in the lower gravity. After so long in real time, the walls are done and now you can store a larger amount of scrap metal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou planned ahead and there\u0027s much scrap in reserve. You then designate and build a rover shop and a smelter. With the rover shop you design and build something that can both ferry around more scrap in a bucket and dig up the regolith to process. You carry it over to the smelter which you\u0027ve manned with a couple Kerbals. They then process that regolith into fine metals which you don\u0027t get the use of until they\u0027re done with it first. The end product is more \u0022scrap metal\u0022 which you get when they\u0027re done playing with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you\u0027ve got a means of supplying scrap that isn\u0027t wholly dependant on shipments off-world, you can begin in earnest. Comfort and health is a concern, so you construct a living space with airlocks. IVA shows a large internal room where Kerbals happily move about in the lower gravity. You add on a cafeteria which dispenses food and snacks. A sleeping pod where your Kerbals can get some much needed shut-eye. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you decide to make this a major production hub, as lifting off the Mun is less taxing than from Kerbin. You process even more regolith and build a new VAB plus liftoff pad. You name your new colony \u0022Selene\u0022 and you\u0027re in business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my idea, anyway. I know the idea is space exploration, but at the same time, isn\u0027t colonizing other places a major part of it? Even NASA has considered production on the Moon, and for making it a staging point for further excursions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T20:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like the Mars One program but more kerbal-centric. Sending down supplies and having rovers build them up before sending humans(or kerbals in this case) down there. Would be pretty good, I reckon, but maybe for a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey do have some kind of mining planned or something like that, though, says the wiki...so maybe it could be a mod/extension of that system?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, extensive planetary base(and even orbital station) building is very compelling and hopefully some of that makes it into the vanilla game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore functionality like this should at least somewhat be in the base game...then have various mods to tweak and expand upon it all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
