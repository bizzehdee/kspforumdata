A lot of people say that you sort of have to set your own goals and this would be a way of doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be a building to click on and a me he that shows current mission, past missions, or create new. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example would be my current project of launching 20 fuel drones into LKO.
