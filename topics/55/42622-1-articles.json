If you are taking rocket to orbit the separated part would not be in game engine rendering range for too long wouldn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou launch a rocket. First stage decouples. After few seconds of the decoupling the retroburners turn on, gracefully separating the stages hopefully without killing too many kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(yes, I know you can just set the retroburners to fire instantaneously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that the separated first stage could automatically set the parachute etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to set multiple payloads in to orbit. You could strap maybe 4 payloads around the rocket. After decoupling small separation rockets fire to set the payloads away from the main rocket. After those have burned, secondary burn could activate automatically sending the payloads to different orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeparation at 0:15.. burn at 0:19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ot4-AZ3l1ZY?start=14\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there would be a lot of possibilities..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAVIDESCOTT","CreatedById":77876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T18:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could probably design parts that delay their stages. So your retro burners are set to fire the moment you decouple but take a moment to engage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for launching multiple payloads what is needed there is some facility to automate objects that are not the focus. Some way to let a MechJeb like tool (or a trained kerbalnaut) control an object when you are not focused on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would solve a lot of problems.
