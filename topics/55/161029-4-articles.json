If I timewarp, it will continue your trajectory, and make checks to see when our times cross, and it will update your location accordingly.. it\u0027s actually kind of hard to explain.. best way to try it is to set up DMP with a friend and try it out.

It\u0027s not perfect by any means, but knowing our best current option will sharpen your questions immensely. It will also lend credibility to your thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very disappointed with how MP appears to have fallen through the cracks. I too am one of those people who have been waiting on it for a long time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo the naysayers, why do you think nobody would use such a feature? This is like telling people something like multiplayer for Minecraft is a waste of time. Multiplayer almost invariably makes sandbox games far more interesting. And those saying it\u0027s a waste of time are looking at ONLY their narrow vision of what they could possibly use it for. What\u0027s MP for? Whatever the individual wants to do with it. Whether they want to have a collab space agency, a resource war, lunar rover races, or a Kerbal love shack on Eeloo, that\u0027s all up to them. And there has been a demand for this since the very beginning. There are groups of players who trade savegame files back and forth for the sake of doing turn-based MP, which is a very tedious method for achieving something that could be handled through much simpler means. I remember a real-time competitive combat game developed using complex AI which would allow players to design war machines, load them all into a single game, and then let them battle it out on auto -- you really think they\u0027re not itching to manually fly these vessels against each other? There are also roleplayers who love the additional immersion aspect of EACH playable unit being controlled by a different human. There are PLENTY of reasons to have a multiplayer system and it\u0027s one of those features (like having a mod community in the first place) that will \u0027automatically\u0027 produce additional game content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the nature of modding has become a hindrance as well as a help. The more integral a feature is, the less it should be left up to modders to handle. One thing I absolutely hate is becoming \u0027dependent\u0027 upon a mod with the knowledge that it\u0027s just going to abruptly stop working when the build number changes, and the developer is no longer working on it, and then the \u0022feature\u0022 is lost forever. I can put up with that if it\u0027s a few random ship parts, but something like MP? That\u0027s just ridiculous.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd now, based on what I\u0027ve read in this thread, the dev team is moving (albeit very slowly) towards a not-so-thinly-veiled microtransaction model. New ship parts as a DLC? That feels like a bad sign to me. That\u0027s the kind of thing you sell when you expand the solar system, offer a permanent graphics upgrade, or... you know... multiplayer servers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-13T03:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/13/2017 03:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-13T12:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223083925\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496859288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002282249\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Elthore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/7/2017 at 7:14 PM, Elthore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am also very saddened and appalled by the false promise of multiplayer.
