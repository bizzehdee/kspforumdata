Rockets also become more difficult to fly, as you can only turn several degrees at a time. Because KSP calculates gravity in the same way it\u0027s done in the real world, this means that the most efficient fashion to make orbit is the same way NASA does it: in small but constant incremental course changes using computers. MechJeb does this, but causes KSP to lose some of its loveable haphazardness in both engineering and piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD used to list on its wiki that it intends to eventually automate crew functions, but this has \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features#Not_happening\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Enow been removed\u003C/a\u003E.
