No? Well I have. It\u0027s so weird how using the exact same spacesuit works, from Moho, where the surface temperature can get up to about 300\u00B0. This is where this suggestion comes in: upgrading suits. It would be kinda realistic if you start out on Science/Career mode with a very low level suit. Similar to ones we had during the Apollo era, that was only capable of going to the M\u00FCn/Moon, this would be a Tier I suit. This is where upgrades come in handy. When you upgrade your suits, more durability comes with it, for example: upgrading your suit from Tier I to Tier II makes you able to go to Duna, where it\u0027s pretty cold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would be able to upgrade your suit in the astronaut residence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just my suggestion for suits, if anyone would make this a mod, I would be glad :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a nice day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cortwade","CreatedById":182896,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T20:55:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood idea! It\u0027s kinda odd that we can get from a 300 degree planet to a frozen wasteland using the same suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T09:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would apply only for warmer environments (read as Moho) because if you can go EVA in space (close to 0K) you can survive on every other planet, basically. Duna is much warmer than the Mun. And the Mun at night has basically same temperature as Eeloo at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-04T03:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegolith is similar to shattered/powdered glass. Very abrasive and the Moon suits did a great job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been spamming the thermometer for more science and google is telling me that in space the shadows are around -270c and in the sunlight it\u0027s nearly \u002B270c. Seems like they have that covered, all that is left is to improve is Kerbal dexterity and more efficient duration in space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I do agree with what you are saying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of having different coloured suits for each level of Kerban ability... but I don\u0027t want to see an in game \u0022skins\u0022 transaction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
