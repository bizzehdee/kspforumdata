If scanning/mapping were added to stock, un-scanned terrain could create a situation where your instruments (speed, altitude, orbital period) provide a \u0022range\u0022 of speed.

Your probe/vessel could be represented as an orange disc/sphere within the path/tube, providing some idea of where you are, but not an exact measurement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zeel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zeel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe fundamental problem with the concept is that the Kerbol system is immutable (accept asteroids), and therefore anyone who has played it before, or just checks the wiki, will no longer need to research everything before a mission. You can\u0027t reliably aerobrake over Jool if you don\u0027t know the thickness of the atmosphere - but once you know that number it won\u0027t matter if the game is aware that you know it. Since nothing changes subsequent playthroughs lose challenge, and many players would just cheat and check the wiki.\u003Cp\u003EThe solution would be for some variables to be introduced - mass, atmosphere, etc - that are randomized for each game. Thus you actually need to investigate your version of the Kerbol system. Unfortunately topography would be an issue, doing that procedurally would probably be insane, so each surface would probably be identical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the Kerbol system being immutable, the starting positions of the planets could be options (t = year 0, 10, 30). I think I heard something about the game requiring the planets to be in position X at t=0 and that the mass/atmospheres are fundamental\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for this to work, I think the game would need to identify they surface of the planet with the orbital trajectory. How challenging is this coding-wise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I\u0027ve been playing since 0.17. I\u0027ve started a dozen career/sandbox modes for different projects. I don\u0027t think long term players would just jump to the wiki. I think most would relish \u0027rediscovering\u0027 the Kerbol System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SaturnV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SaturnV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETrue, that\u0027s why I want a REASON for kerbals.
