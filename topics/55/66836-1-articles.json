Up until now, the alignment of the thrust vector, center of mass and center of lift have to be eyeballed - it would be nice if those vectors and points could be aligned with the visual aid easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MC.STEEL","CreatedById":89456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T20:03:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea its a bit hard aligning it when you make some wacky planes,but i think it has been suggested before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI too have an idea about this, there could be a small text box that gives you a numerical value about how much your COM and COL are misaligned.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike the Mechanic","CreatedById":94998,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T21:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MC.STEEL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MC.STEEL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYea its a bit hard aligning it when you make some wacky planes,but i think it has been suggested before.\u003Cp\u003EI too have an idea about this, there could be a small text box that gives you a numerical value about how much your COM and COL are misaligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it has, I just have not seen it yet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a \u0022blueprint mode\u0022 you can switch to - it would basically display your craft from the main axes and some stats, com, col etc. That would be cool actually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T22:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mike the Mechanic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mike the Mechanic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow about a \u0022blueprint mode\u0022 you can switch to - it would basically display your craft from the main axes and some stats, com, col etc. That would be cool actually.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn \u0022exploded view\u0022 schematic still appears on the planned features wiki page, not sure if that information is still accurate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prime flux","CreatedById":57347,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T23:00:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd while we are at it, why don\u0027t We wish for a measurement tool or ability to move components with coordinates? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould make some things like trying to place balanced RCS easier \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
