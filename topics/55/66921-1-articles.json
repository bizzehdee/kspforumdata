I know I can see mass from Launch Pad but it is so uncomfortably to launch unfinished ships to see how much it weights. And when parts go off limits (about 300-320 for my computer) the Game is freezing and even may crush, so I always have to know a number of used parts. And, if there will be economics (parts already have prices, so I think it will), then I hope to see a Full Price indicator in hangars too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb gives you a bunch of info, and so does Kerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"comham","CreatedById":43245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:43:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is something that really ought to be stock, though, it\u0027s so basic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T21:24:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d need the price indicator once budget comes in at least\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Your program cannot afford this launch vessel\u0022 (as long as there is no Clippy, you look like you\u0027re trying to build a rocket, would you like some DIE DIE DIE)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can get the part count in the load menu for a saved ship/plane/rover/thingy already, and the mass if you wheel it out to the launchpad and check the vessel information tab in the map view, but neither of those are particularly convenient even though the information is already available.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T00:27:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe part count should be put in, mass should also be put in, and whole whole cost should also be put in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only question is where in the UI would they place it?

I know that I can see mass on Launchpad and part counts in save/load screen. It\u0027s enough when you build your crafts with intuition only. But I\u0027m trying to use some math and physics, I think it\u0027s more interesting than to do a couple of crash launchs to know would your rocket fly or not. And in this case I need to see dynamic Mass and Parts counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have a Center-of-Mass, Center-of-Thrust, Center-of-Lift already. Also we have a lot of engineering info for parts - and game use them in simulation! - so why wouldn\u0027t we have a little bit more info on our current projects? Game already use them, so all you need is to show them to a player. I think it\u0027s very easy to add, saying, a small button near Center-bla-bla buttons and a small window with info in right upper corner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods is good option when the game is not in beta status and is not update offen. And even then I don\u0027t like to use them just because I don\u0027t really know what they have changed in my game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T10:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should give Kerbal Engineer a try, as mods go it\u0027s very unobtrusive and makes no changes to the underlying game, and the modders are very good about quickly updating to maintain compatibility with new KSP versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that it\u0027s a bit silly that none of this information is available directly in the stock game. Mass, delta-V and TWR are fundamental calculations for rocket design, we shouldn\u0027t have to resort to a mod or external calculation for them. Part count is critical to game performance and is given in game anyway, no reason it shouldn\u0027t be done in the VAB itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, IIRC the devs are reluctant to overload the game with hard numbers, so I\u0027m not sure this functionality will ever make it into the core game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
