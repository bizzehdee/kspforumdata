Obviously, I would like to burn the RCS fuel from the lower stages first. To do this, I disable the tanks of the higher stage. Once I\u0027ve separated, I then enable the RCS tanks on the upper stage. When I have several tanks, I\u0027d like to be able to switch them all on at one point. Unfortunately, it seems that I\u0027m unable to bind an action group enabling or disabling RCS fuel tanks. Have I missed something? If not, would this please be added to a future release?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Garrett\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T04:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy default, RCS will drain from the last-placed tank to the first-placed tank, unless it\u0027s changed from the last time I did a test on it.
