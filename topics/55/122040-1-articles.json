I do get your point, but disagree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL when rockets or aircraft are designed a lot is done with computer simulations before the first test flights and further on in development. Agreed it\u0027s not as good or \u0027realistic\u0027 as an actual flight, but it\u0027s quick and cheap and good enough to check that the thing flys and how it may behave in certain environments and to try out various settings without risk to crew or expensive kit. This becomes even more crucial when dealing with missions to the moon or Mars when flight times and lives are a very real issue A facility in stock to replicate that part of the process would be a good stock feature IMHO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think of it working like a sort of customisable \u0027hack gravity\u0027 where you can set the gravity and atmosphere to match what is known about the body in question with lower quality and/or monochrome graphics, and a facility to set orbit altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are certainly high priorities for the development team, especially atm, but that doesn\u0027t stop it being a nice thing to have or want in the stock game\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T22:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou talk about immersion which suggests realism but we don\u0027t get to fly to Mars and then say, \u0022Oh that was a simulation\u0022 in real life.
