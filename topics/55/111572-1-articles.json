Times have changed. Now with the new heat system, and thrust reduction related to ambient pressure... the LV-N feels a bit anemic to me. But, instead of nerfing heat production to make it a tad better, why not increase the amount of thrust in a vacuum? Say upping it to 100? Personally I think it would be more interesting to have the heat level be a bit excessive in addition to having high thrust to drive home the fact that you are having to manage a nuclear reactor and preventing it from going critical. And... if it were to go critical, it would be rather interesting to have an engine capable of destroying an entire spacecraft if it blows up as a result of overheating \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T05:13:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines don\u0027t work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause Nuclear Thermal Rocket Engines don\u0027t work that way.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that the LV-N has a \u0027start reactor\u0027 with a giant spool up time and lots of heat, and a \u0027Activate engine\u0027 which needs to have the reactor on, but cools it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T12:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed that Nerv needs slight buffing, but 100 could be overdoing it.

I do know they have to run very hot to get the best efficiency, and are capable of generating far higher temperatures than the materials used for the housing are capable of withstanding.

This system would encourage the user to activate the engine at the peak temperature in order to get the best ISP the NTR is capable of. It may be wise to integrate a temperature readout in the right click menu for the engine, and perhaps a \u0022current estimated ISP\u0022 to show the user what efficiency the engine would have at its current temperature level. This would require more planning ahead of maneuver nodes and it gives the method of operation for the Nerv a very different flavor than any other rocket in the game. I\u0027m all for more planning and management to get the most out of it as opposed to the simplistic operation of LFO\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T18:57:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 06:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Justicier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rath\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rath\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suggest that the LV-N has a \u0027start reactor\u0027 with a giant spool up time and lots of heat, and a \u0027Activate engine\u0027 which needs to have the reactor on, but cools it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121844-Rethinking-the-Nuke-for-real-this-time?p=1951570\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1951570\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy first post on the forum actually discussed this, but it seems it was ignored.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justicier","CreatedById":89671,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T19:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tankman101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tankman101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121844-Rethinking-the-Nuke-for-real-this-time?p=1951570\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1951570\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMy first post on the forum actually discussed this, but it seems it was ignored.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWish I had seen that thread earlier, whatever the source I still think it\u0027s an excellent idea.
