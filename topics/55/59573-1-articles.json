BUT we could do a simplified one using the existing sphere of influence setup to mimic the most important aspect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Lagrange_points2.svg/330px-Lagrange_points2.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022330px-Lagrange_points2.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, we introduce a small sphere of influence with a very tiny gravitational pull (near Null). Like only 100km radius. We set these at each of the locations where all five lagrange points are supposed to occur, and then set them on rails to the correct orbital period to match that of the Mun. Once a craft enters these areas, the speed will be relative to the Lagrange point and the goal will be to come to a dead stop within. Getting into them would be difficult due to the relative size of the sphere of influence, but once accomplished, you wouldn\u0027t have to worry about warp drift. Since this would be near the same orbital speed at that altitude for L3, L4, and L5, nothing else would need to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor L1 and L2, you would need to add a second, slightly larger sphere of influence with an inverse gravitational field, but still centered on the Lagrange point. One that pushes out away from the center and gets weaker the closer you get to the near null zone. Ideally, it would be right near or centered on the border of the mun\u0027s SOI so that once pushed out in that direction it would immediately enter the Mun\u0027s SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t give us true Lagrangian gravitational topography, but it would mimic the basic behavior. Once in the Kergangian points, your could place stations and crafts which would remained in place. Move too far from the center point, and your craft would eventually be pushed back out into Kerbin\u0027s or the Mun\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-10T22:38:56Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2014 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by BubbaWilkins\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T22:39:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean, for the debs to add, not for us to use to simulate Lagrange points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sof","CreatedById":65663,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T22:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the devs said no to phantom bodies as a work around for Lagrange points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xarian","CreatedById":69145,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T22:44:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TechnicalK3rbal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean, for the debs to add, not for us to use to simulate Lagrange points.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople other than devs can add features to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BubbaWilkins","CreatedById":57993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T23:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are several mods which add other planets and asteroids.
