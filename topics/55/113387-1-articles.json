So I\u0027ve got a pretty good feel for the game. Of course I love the game, I wouldn\u0027t have put this much time into it if I didn\u0027t. I\u0027ve achieved pretty much every feat that is supposed to be possible - I haven\u0027t ever \u0022landed\u0022 on Jool, but I\u0027ve done pretty much everything else, including [returning a Kerbal from the surface of Eve](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76012-Eve-Manned-Return-Mission), and [hauling a Class C asteroid into an orbit around Bop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105248-Why-you-should-always-read-the-missions-before-you-accept-them).\n\nSo here is my observation: the game loses focus at the end. After you finish the tech tree, there is really no incentive to do anything else. I mean, since KSP is a sandbox game, you can always continue, but every time I get to the end of the tech tree, I lose interest because there\u0027s nothing left to \u0022earn.\u0022 This kind of sucks, because when you get access to all the cool stuff, you should really want to put it all to use.\n\nOf course there are some (maybe even most) who don\u0027t have this problem, but I\u0027ve noticed it with me.\n\nSo my suggestion is that there should be kind of a final \u0022Grand Campaign.\u0022 This should be a series of missions that only true Steely-Eyed Missile Men will be able to achieve. Some ideas for this, just off the top of my head:\n\n1. Return a material sample from Eve. This will of course require landing a Kerbal on the surface.\n\n2. Return a material sample from Tylo. Landing on Tylo was the second hardest mission I ever did. The combination of Delta-V and TWR was really hard to pull off.\n\n3. Build a fully reuseable space plane that can ferry four Kerbals to an orbit of the Mun and return them.\n\nThese are just ideas. The point is, when you finish the tech tree, there should be some incentive to do something grand, rather than just \u0022oh, I guess I\u0027ll go land on Tylo... not sure why, but... meh...\u0022\n\nDoes this sound like a good idea? And what kinds of missions would you suggest?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T03:16:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 03:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T03:13:37Z","Content":"This suggestion has been moved to Suggestions."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T03:24:58Z","Content":"Like it or not, people unconsciously play to reward systems.

On my last playthrough, I completed the tech tree before leaving Kerbins SOI! This meant I really had no need to send any science-y type equipment to on any of my trips to other planets... great for my weight and fuel needs of course, but not great for maintaining the challenge. \n\nAs a consequence my suggestion would be some kind of tech tree endstate.... , very much inspired by Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest series, have some kind of future tech that you need a lot of science to unlock, like a \u0022warp drive\u0022. Essentially buying the tech just gets you a game over screen (although you can continue with the game). Maybe couple this with a building project the new tech would need to be built into.... ie have a ship with warp drive, room for X number of kerbals, power etc.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T03:33:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 03:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist**\n  \nhorrible grammer and spelling."},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T04:04:29Z","Content":"I feel like mods take care of this far more than stock ever could, and I even believe that the current late game is exactly where it should be. There can be no end, no game-over congratulations in order to hold some symbolism about neverending human endeavor or our eternal fascination with space, and the technologies last unlocked are satisfying enough for stock. It seems that the game just beckons for mods to be installed, with the player self-satisfied at completing the journey but unsure of what to do.

This has been well studied. The tech tree is THE reward system in KSP. Getting new missions doesn\u0027t help, as they have no reward.\n\nYes. As I, and a few others have long been saying, these two points are why the career mode design is fundamentally flawed.\n\nCareer mode\u0027s main features are things that will come to an end. Contracts keep going, but a lot of them feel like busywork, just there to let you earn the funds you need to do other things.\n\nA much better approach would have been to make gameplay more about sustaining, than completion. Yes, you\u0027d earn stuff and make new discoveries, but the main career mode challenge would come from management. Can I afford to keep restocking my research station? Do I need to hire more crew? What park of the solar system has not been investigated recently? \n\nFeedback would be telling you \u0022you\u0027re doing well in this area\u0022, rather than \u0022You\u0027ve done that bit! Good!\u0022, encouraging you to continually refine and improve.\n\n In addition to that, a lot more could be done to make it feel like you\u0027re actually exploring space. Visual enhancements would be one thing, but there actually being interesting things to do while on a planet\u0027s surface would add a whole other layer to gameplay. A great experience could be its own reward. At the moment, KSP shoots itself in the foot a little bit here, as it sets you up to want to get things ticked of fast, then move on to the next thing. \n\nSome of my best KSP memories come from times when I\u0027ve been taking it slow, absorbing the scenery, or investigating something for myself.\n\nI\u0027ve written more about alternate game set up ideas here, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3444-An-aproach-to-Time-based-funding](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3444-An-aproach-to-Time-based-funding) and here, if anyone\u0027s interested.
