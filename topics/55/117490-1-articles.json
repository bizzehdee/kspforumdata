I keep four installs of KSP in various states of modding, that\u0027s about 6GB of space wasted on duplicate files which hurts on an SSD."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T00:08:17Z","Content":"My main concern with this idea is that, to my knowledge, KSP isn\u0027t design to allow loading/unloading of plugins at runtime.\n\nIf this issue could be clarified/resolved, then the concept has merit."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:15:20Z","Content":"This would be awesome. I have a shortcut for my KSP directory, and a folder there for uninstalled mods, as I often need to remove them. This would be much more better."}]}
