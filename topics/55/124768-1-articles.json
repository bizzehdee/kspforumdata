True, while actually flying your rocket from the pad to orbit, or maneuvering between the celestial bodies, a joystick wont give you much. But when it comes to VTOL landers, or \u003Cu\u003Edocking\u003C/u\u003E (RCS also reacts to proprtional input), or EVA missions and such, a joystick is so much fun and gives you so much more control.
