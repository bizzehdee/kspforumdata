You could band-aid abandoned components for only so long. Animator is more work, but potentially much more powerful for KSP. Squad could, for example, standardize a set of variables that can be used in the state machine to drive animation behaviours. could completely replace all the animation modules.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T13:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to the appropriate subforum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think they would, honestly, especially not in the foreseeable future.
