But I think there should definitely be a building or list of famous kerbonauts for their outstanding bravery in missions. Or at least give them a medal for reaching milestones like first landing, first return trip, farthest distance travelled, most time in space, etc. To distuguish the grizzly vets from the knock-kneed rookies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would even be fine with a manually populated list, so long as the kerbals get the credit they deserve. Then you can send your favorite kerbals on the most dangerous missions and come back (or don\u0027t) a hero.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T07:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wouldn\u0027t really add anything to the game.

One big reason is because it is nice to know you are improving as a player, and so tracking yourself and possibly comparing yourself to other players is fun, at least it is when I check out what I have done compared to other people on the forums here. So I see tracking good flights/missions as adding something to the game. I also think that people are drawn to KSP because of the hilarious reactions of the Kerbals. The game wouldn\u0027t be the same without their reactions in the cockpit or their clumsy low-gravity stumbling. A HOF would be a way to please people who just launch virtual rockets recreationally, and pick their favorite Kerbal for tougher missions a lot like other videogames let you create a character. But who knows, maybe its already underway...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T23:20:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile its not exactly like a Hall of Fame, a similar feature can be had out of the Final Frontier mod. It gives individual kerbals achievement ribbons, such as being the first in space, first to step foot on Mun, etc etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E So I see tracking good flights/missions as adding something to the game.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see a Hall of Fame as a way of adding more persistence to your save games. Not only will you have the bits and bobs that you left behind to remind you of missions past, you could have records of those bits and bobs and the missions that put them where they rest. A fully realized HOF could not only display your achievements but also records of the missions that accomplished them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
