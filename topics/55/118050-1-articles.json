(forever ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif) alone)\n\nThis type of rocket would be extremely powerful, as well as the solid rockets, but controllable.\n\nSo, why not put this in the game (or in a mod)?\n\nIncidentally, this type of propulsion would require a new type of engine, more resistent, this also implies the ability to add new types of hybrid engines (Tripropellant or Air-fuel, Tripropellant or Bipropellant, etc).\n\nInformation sources:\n\nWikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripropellant\\_rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripropellant_rocket)\n\nNASA [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19690065139](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19690065139)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T16:43:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Angeltxilon**"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T04:23:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E NASA [http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19690065139](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19690065139)\n\nI think I found the pdf referred to: [Lithium-Fluorine-Hydrogen Propellant Investigation PDF](https://ia800304.us.archive.org/20/items/nasa_techdoc_19700018655/19700018655.pdf) And notes on page 78(Page 86 of the PDF), that a VAC ISP of 510s - 520s was observed.\n\n[Russia also tested a hybrid engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-701) that burned a combination RP-1/LH \u002B O2.

Altough they mostly have a decent TWR, they are so inefficient that you can only use them in the first stages. The good thing in them is that they are dirt cheap. So, it would mean another whole set of high-TWR-engines, and another array of expensive fuel tanks to propel them?
