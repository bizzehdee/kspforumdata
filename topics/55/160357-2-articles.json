Bonus points if those contracts happen in any sort of logical progression. Maybe the Comsat market has been largely cornered by another company, so Probodobodyne decide to contract you to set up their spiffy Munar mapping cluster. Then they progress to offering you targeted landing missions to drop their ore detecting landers at strategic spots. Assuming you choose to do that for them, they team up with another company to build mining facilities - and start offering appropriate contracts for those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL: DR - make me believe there\u0027s more to Kerbin than a field, a handful of buildings and a string of random requests from Gene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T00:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to see physics added that could make for some really cool KSp mission reports/ image stories.
