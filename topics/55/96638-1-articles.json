I think it makes the mental math of \u0027how much will I have left\u0027 just a tad bit longer to take since the ones/tens/etc don\u0027t line up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I prefer the classic, white flip-card with black numbers style as opposed to the green, pixelated numbers. If the current design cost font is a shade of red, it would contrast it to the total funds and give the impression of a balance sheet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also love to see a \u0027cost of fuel\u0027 and \u0027cost of parts\u0027. It could help people see what percentage of their craft is fuel, helping to judge TWR or design efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T14:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep. It would be much easier to compare the numbers if they were, at the very least, aligned properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
