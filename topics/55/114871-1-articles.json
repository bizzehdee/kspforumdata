It would be wonderful !\n\nBy the way there is another issue with the sun light shader when in space.\n\nThe light is occulted by objects but the way the light disappear is very strange: First it is like the light is not obstructed (like the sun light goes through Kerbin for example) and then the sun is going smaller and smaller but always visible and finally it disappear.\n\nHere is a picture of this visual glitch:\n\n![sun_glitch.png](http://kidosoraki.eu/random/sun_glitch.png)\n\nThis glitch is easily reproducible by going to the space map and move the camera so Kerbin is in front of the sun.\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nBye.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T16:24:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kido\\_SoraKi**\n  \nadding content"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:04:31Z","Content":"The yellow color always bothered me."},{"CreatedByName":"Mr_Brain","CreatedById":33487,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:48:14Z","Content":"Consider that the kerbals\u0027 Sun is not our Sun.

The ambient light in space kind of bothers me. If we got rid of that, then lights would become actually useful and some performance could be saved.\n\nI actually liked what NovaSilisko did in his Alternis Kerbol.
