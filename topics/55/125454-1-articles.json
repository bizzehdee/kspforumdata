Idealy the science and parts unlocked would reflect real world progression, specifically materials science since it is so crucial to all industrial and scientific applications. Other areas of science as well, geophysics is an area I would love to see represented, aerospace research, chemistry, biology, astronomy, as individual sciences with Kerbals able to train for operating specific experiments in each field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very cool if the science in the game reflected the human races progression in understanding of the material world, as such it should start with geology and optics, and then once both are researched unlock chemistry, physics and biology, from which everything would spread out up a science tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example: game start with core sample drills, basic rocketry, one would need to train Bob in geology (which would lead to Geophysics, branches to other areas of science). He would need to sample a few biomes for mineral properties on Kerbin and the Mun to unlock better tech nodes and parts, specifically \u0027discover\u0027 a list of rare earth (kerbin) minerals to unlock micro electronics and some engine technologies. So the player would have to get to the Mun using basicly 1960\u0027s technology just as humans did. They would need to send up satellites with unlocked optics experiments to identify biomes and minerals on Kerbin that would be sampled and through sampling unlock parts that relate to rare earth mineral using technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Al Pacino says in Scarface \u0027First you get the mineral samples, then you get the new engine materials...\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like science separated into data and results, sort of what the lab does but applied to all science with a main lab at KSC to process any experiments returned. A higher level scientist Kerbal operating that main lab will return more \u0027results\u0027 per amount of \u0027data\u0027 than a lower level one. New motivation for running missions and leveling up more scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientist Kerbals should need to operate experiments for an amount of time, a few minutes to a few days or more depending on its real world counterpart. They would gain experience in the field of science they are trained for and currently using real time, without need to return to KSC. But returning to KSC would allow unlocking new more advanced fields of study through a \u0027Kerbonaut Training Facility\u0027 and/or \u0027Kerbal International University\u0027 at or near KSC. Scientists would need to conduct specific experiments in order to unlock the ability to run the next in the specific field of science, which could happen on site. To start a new field of science they would need to go to KSC and train for its first basic entry part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts would be unlocked based on science specific to the innovations needed. Fuels through chemistry and physics. Electronics through physics and computer science, needed for showing more detailed orbital information.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngineers would be part of the crucial process of innovation, better structures (max heat, radiator capacity, crash tolerance) through structural engineering \u0027programs\u0027 that would require engineers to run analysis on parts before, during, and after flights. The next part would need experience with the previous, bypassing only where somewhat realistic. One could not save up generic science and unlock a few nodes. Pad testing would account for a bit of the needed experience though, so one would not need to launch to orbit for all the \u0027engineering data\u0027 for every part. Capsules would require at least some orbital testing to gain full upgrades and unlock related technologies. Ion engines and other engines that do not operate in atmosphere would need to be used in space to unlock the next, but not SRB\u0027s or low ISP lift engines that operate mostly in atmosphere that realistically can be tested on the ground. Struts and material structure would upgrade parts values as experience is gained by actually analyzing used spacecraft at KSC. No single mission to everywhere, collect all the early stock science experiments, and unlock far to much of the game in one flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a theme for a change in how the game treats science, not a complete list of specifics to implement this concept. It would need to be fine tuned and applied evenly across the game, with an expanded need and use for pilots, who should be able to have a secondary specialty and collect science or engineering data at a lower rate, but not process data into final results. The main benefit of the change would be a more realistic crossover to real world science, enhancing one of the games major strengths. It would provide more motivation and immersion for the players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot that the game is \u0027wrong\u0027 in any way for not being like this, it is a balance of many things, but it could better represent the realities of scientific discovery. Hopefully in Unity 5 it will have some room to grow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-14T20:52:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2015 08:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by interface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Cloud","CreatedById":117808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T13:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm, I think there\u0027s some nice ideas here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think they go into the group of ideas from those people who want to see a more meaningful career, as opposed to the space engineers who excel at the actual spaceflight part of the game are happy to just build \u0026amp; play.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI love the idea of more meaningful science.

Launching uncrewed could also make the early game more meaningfull - you only get very small engines and tanks - limiting you to suborital trajectories and you would have to do training flights \u0026amp; assignments with your pilots first before they become usefull (otherwise basically tourists) - basically making them plane test pilots before they become Kerbonauts, the same goes later\u00A0for engineers and scientists.
