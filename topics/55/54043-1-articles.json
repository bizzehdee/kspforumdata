But having more stringent costs would certainly add another dimension of choosing parts more carefully (and getting rid of unnecessary parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond of all: a use for reusability. I think that every part you manage to get back to Kerbin without exploding (landers, science labs, SRBs even if you put parachutes on them) should be able to be reused again at no part cost. HOWEVER, that doesn\u0027t mean they should have no cost at all. Since we can recover crafts/parts landed on Kerbin. Retrieval of craft by the tracking station should accrue a cost specified by their locations on Kerbin, and how heavy/difficult it would be to transport. I\u0027m thinking something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0-50 cost for something within 100 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50-1000 cost for same continent\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(50-1000) x2 for something in the ocean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1000-2000 for something on another continent/really far away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally then, reusability could be useful if you land in a location not totally cost-ineffective to retrieve something from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a cost formula: C = (d x m)/constant \u002B C if in an ocean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere C = cost, d = distance, m = mass, and C is doubled if the craft/part lands in an ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood for thought!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T00:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m gonna go ahead and uhh... nudge nudge bump bump\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T00:49:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart cost?
