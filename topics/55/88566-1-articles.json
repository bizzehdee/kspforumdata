And be able to add more buildings, like you start with a VAB, Launchpad, Basic Tracking Station only tracking things on kerbin, R\u0026amp;D and Mission Control. You have to build the rest. For Example, to unlock strategies, build the administration building. To unlock spaceplanes, build the Hangar. And etc. Also with multiple space centers, and multiple building per space center. For example. With one VAB, you can only build one craft at once, also, add a craft building mechanic, where you have to build rockets/planes before you can launch, and it will take some time, week or a month at the start of the career mode. Each VAB adding 20% to building speed, and the ability to be able to build one more craft at once, with a amount of max 3 VAB\u0027s or SPH\u0027s at one KSC, so having more KSC\u0027s with each being specialised at one thing would be beneficial. Let us place the buildings wherever we want. Also, add benefits to having multiple R\u0026amp;D\u0027s at once and like that.
