It\u0027s more advantageous to simply repeat experiments and retransmit ad-nauseum until the full pool for that experiment is exhausted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to tweak how the transmission loss is applied. Instead of X% to the amount of Science gained, make transmitted science treat the cap for that experiment as X% of the full value. This means that only X% of the experiment\u0027s pool can actually ever be earned by transmission, locking the remainder away for return missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative approach would to make sure a particular experiment in a particular location can only be done once per science part per mission, but it could get difficult to determine exactly what a \u0022mission\u0022 is. The approach above has no ambiguities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
