I was building a ship using the Mk1-2 pod in an Apollo CSM style setup, and the launch stage was a bunch of FL-T800s, and I realized how cool that is, and that it would be awesome to encourage that kind of building during earlier tech levels. Mk1 Lander can and a 2-man Gemini-style pod could be unlocked a bit earlier, and the Mk2 lander can around the same time as the Mainsail.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlkBltChemie","CreatedById":135033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T17:19:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI definitely agree that the Mk1 Lander Can needs to come earlier (Tier 1 R\u0026amp;D) and a 2-Kerbal rocket capsule (i.e. other than the spaceplane) would be fantastic. I don\u0027t really have an opinion about the Mk1-2 pod because I can\u0027t recall where it unlocks at the moment, but I also agree that the Mk2 lander can should come sooner, but after the Mk1-2 pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done something similar with the FL-T800s using a Tricoupler. I think it makes for a really cool looking launch stage. Although the other day I did a TWR calculation and using 3 LV-T30s (3.75 tons, 645 kN total) in that setup gives a lower TWR than 1 Skipper (3 tons, 650 kN) for the same ISP. I still use my Tricoupler though because it just looks great in my opinion and it really isn\u0027t that much less anyway (just the engines, no fuel gives a TWR 17.5 vs 22, respectively.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T18:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that almost all KSP tech occurred nearly simultaneously in RL. This is largely due to the fact that technology was/is invented to fill needs, not because we\u0027ve learned something new. You want an Apollo style mun mission? You\u0027d put out specs for that, and that;s what you\u0027d get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T18:50:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the matter, ever since Kerbonaut now come in 3 class I\u0027m wondering how to bring 2 kerbals (pilot/scientist) on the Mun with a cool looking craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mk1 work but isn\u0027t as sleek as I would like.
