Because of the way different mods can approach the same issue, sometimes you wind up with redundancies and incompatibilities: mods that introduce things like nuclear reactors might have the same resource concept - enriched uranium, for example - but use unique versions of enriched uranium that only work with their specific mod counterparts. Another example are mods that introduce the concept of life support - like TAC LS and Civilian Populations - which approach the same issue with dramatically different resources and processes and as such require quite a bit of jiggery-buggery to get them working together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn light of these sorts of clashes, then, it might be worthwhile to set standards for many of the more common resources that pop up in mods such to ease these sorts of conflicts - and should Squad decide they want to integrate those kinds of functions into later updates, they\u0027ll then already have some of the fundamentals already mapped out.
