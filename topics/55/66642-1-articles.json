Up until a few versions ago, you\u0027d never know which crafts might have become unusable (due to missing parts) by the latest game or mod updates until you actually tried to load them. This has been changed, but now it\u0027s even worse: ships are marked as unusable in the list, but there\u0027s no longer a way to find out which parts are actually missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe loading dialogue should be reworked, perhaps similarly to the launch dialogues that open up if you click the launchpad or runway from the space center overview. It should open in a larger window, and more compact rows. It should show the infotext to a craft. It should be possible to see a list of unloadable parts on a ship. Choosing whether they\u0027re ordered by name or by date would be useful. So would a search function. And finally, a way to organize them into folders would be nice; that would make it possible to group together different versions of a craft, or different crafts used for one mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-31T01:52:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2014 01:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Hurry, Starfish!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T02:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe devs reported there will be an improved GUI in 0.24.
