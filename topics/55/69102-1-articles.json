NASA wanted to put a realistic practical launch system in the game. So the future SLS is what we get, the Shuttle as we all know was practically a failure and didn\u0027t reach expectations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally would LOVE the Shuttle Engines. The way they added the engines goes with how they wanted the new parts to replace more part intensive older ways of getting things to orbit. So a giant engine cluster single part keeps players from using more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell i feel Kerbodyne will be bound to release a single variant of the RS-25 engines for SHUTTLE DESIGNS! That is once Squad gets back around to giving some love to Shuttle Systems.
