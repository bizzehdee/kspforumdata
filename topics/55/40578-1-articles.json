The TT18-A Stability enhancer. Because of the way the model extends, at certain points, the center struts are visually disconnected from the top part of the model. Either the model should extend from the bottom or a wrap around strut could be added to the top to fix this tiny, tiny, thing I noticed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething more fun; I\u0027d like to see the buttons in the IVA animate, maybe some of them actually do something. At the very least I\u0027d like to hear a clicky sound when they are pressed, even if they do nothing. Or maybe clicking them to much does do something, for instance and unlabeled button may initially do nothing but pressing it to many times could blow a random tank or set off a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
