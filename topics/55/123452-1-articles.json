For instance it\u0027s not really accurate to say a part is better on Duna or Eve, just some might have better TWR or Isp or lift rating, so it\u0027s pretty hard for me to see how you would unlock hundreds of parts in this way or what the intuitive reason you would need to say go to Ike to unlock this or that ladder would be. The points, while general, offer a flexible way to navigate a tech tree that most gamers are familiar with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally tend to think the issue isn\u0027t with the tech tree, but with the clicky nature of conducting science itself. I could see, for instance, the barometer paying out in science not just for being clicked in this or that biome, but for how great a swath of air it passed through while continuously running. I could also see having an entire air column measured unlocking a pilot\u0027s ability to predict flight paths in atmo and aerocaptures for that body. But as far as linking part unlocks to very specific tests I worry you could end up with a lot of grind and many, many one-off missions with not a lot of reward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
