I wantnto start a discussion about how those newly developed planets should look like, i wan\u0027t to know your ideas and maybe a developer could take a look here and say hey this is nice why don\u0027t we include this! So what i am suggesting as the look of one of the new planets is the following: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ULwuiQs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/ULwuiQs\u003C/a\u003E this is a recent false colour mosaic of saturn\u0027s moon titan. In my opinion this looks pretty awesome and as such i would really love to see one of the new planets look like that! Now i would like to hear your ideas about the looks of the upcomming planets!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E( to the forum controllers i remind you, not suggesting actual planets but filling in the looks since it has already been confirmed for ksp 1.0. If anything is still wrong here than pld contact me in a pm)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vetrox","CreatedById":69796,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T21:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoar lava!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T22:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vetrox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vetrox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoar lava!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlowing lava on laythe is a must, huge collums of volcanic smoke on the horizon as well.

Laythe\u0027s islands are volcanic in origin, with tidal forces from Jool, Tylo and Vall being the source of the volcanism (this is even confirmed via experiments in the game). The islands are already split into coastal sandy beaches and steep dark basalt (I think) mountains. Having some lava flow around those mountains wouldn\u0027t be that bad, the beaches are the safest place to land anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Laythe\u0027s livability is debatable considering how much radiation Jool is probably showering with it. I wouldn\u0027t risk taking off my EVA suit to get a tan on the beach, that\u0027s putting aside how cold laythe is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T09:22:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not continuing the current discussion in progress and regroup all the ideas in the same thread?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29807-Planet-Ideas-And-Names-For-The-Future-Of-Kerbal-Space-Program/page33\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29807-Planet-Ideas-And-Names-For-The-Future-Of-Kerbal-Space-Program/page33\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T10:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzerknoef\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzerknoef\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love the idea of procedural puddles on planets but i can\u0027t really agree with lava on laythe, the hole point of laythe being that it is a liveable world.
