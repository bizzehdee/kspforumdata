There\u0027s still plenty of stuff to add and sort out before 1.0, but it might be beneficial to produce a solid 1.0 release sooner rather than later, once the basic core game is feature complete, then moving to a more mature development phase where there would be a stable release version and a development version to add enhancements beyond the basic core game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess would be 1.0 in 1-2 years, 1.1 3-6 months after that, 2.0 maybe 1-2 years after 1.x is convincingly \u0022done\u0022 (or 3-6 months after the next major Unity release).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T15:47:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB9 isn\u0027t becoming stock, SP\u002B is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
