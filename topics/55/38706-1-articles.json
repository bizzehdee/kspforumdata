Got suggestions here. I hope they take notice as they\u0027re annoying and should be looked at;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Not forcing the game when launched, over your other windows during the pre-launch phase (the SQUAD logo). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, say I have a .txt file opened and Firefox running. The game makes sure it\u0027s on top of all of your other windows. Is there a way to fix this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The game window remembering where it last was after being closed or setting settings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to my first suggestion. I have a dual monitor setup, and I run the game through Windowed Mode. And it keeps appearing between the two windows on launch and when I save my settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Being able to set your settings ingame (the Pause screen), instead of at the main menu? Very inconvenient.
