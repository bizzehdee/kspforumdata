I\u0027ve been playing KSP everyday when I don\u0027t have responsibilities because I just downloaded the Mission Controller Extended mod. I heard that Squad will be implementing a contracts system in 0.24 (someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong), and I\u0027ve been using MCE in Career mode, which is kind of difficult for a relative novice like me. My biggest milestones so far has been to land on the Mun and return, and only land on Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my idea is this: In addition to contracts (which, if it works like the MCE contracts, I assume will be to complete a specific task or tasks for so-and-so company for a money reward, and possibly science), I think there should also be a mission track. The tech tree is cool and all, but I still feel kind of overwhelmed. So much science to be earned and I don\u0027t know where to begin. That\u0027s where the missions come in. Missions as simple as \u0022reach an altitude above 70km\u0022 or \u0022make a stable orbit between 80km and 120km\u0022 or \u0022make a stable Kerbin orbit, Mun transfer, Mun orbit, and Mun landing\u0022 and so on and so until you are doing some intense stuff. But, you can\u0027t do some missions until you have the necessary technology, thus you need to be doing experiments (which should also have a bit of a money reward). And, if you still are unable to do your missions, but are running low on funds, you will have the contracts to do as little \u0022side-quests\u0022. And then, after everything is 100% done, hopefully there will be community mission packs as well, or mission packs bundled with mods!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I understand that I can forge my own experience now with mods, I think if it comes like this vanilla, there will be better integration with budgets, rewards, science, and the tech tree, rather than each separate mod developer having to basically guess and wing it, if that makes sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea stems from my love of this game, my frustration with going in debt because I fail a mission because of inadequate parts, and my one vision of the infinite ways this game could be expanded. I mean, sure, I could just download mods for the experiences I want, but I think this would be a good setup for a true \u0022career\u0022 mode. So, if you are reading this, Squad devs, think about it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?

Like the first mission could be something simple like \u0022Launch a rocket above 70km and then land safely\u0022 and then could increase in difficulty to something like \u0022create a stable Kerbin orbit, transfer to Duna, create a stable Duna orbit, and land a rover on Duna\u0022 and so on and so on. You would be constrained by a budget, but then earn money and maybe some science for completing the mission. However, you may just want to earn money or just earn science, or might not have the parts available yet, so then you see what contracts are available, with their own set of parameters and requirements, and will result in a monetary or science reward. I\u0027m not sure if this is what they already had in mind, but it would be leaps and bounds more immersive for a campaign IMO because it challenges you to do things you may not have thought you could do, and teaches you how to be a better rocket or plane builder, which you could take to your sandbox excursions, or maybe MP if they ever come out with that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if that makes it a bit clearer.

I\u0027m just suggesting that Squad does something like missions AND contracts in the game, much like how MCE has it set up, but better integration with the money system and science. Since it is a mod, it can do a lot, but I\u0027m just saying I\u0027d like to see something like a career mode with both missions and contracts. I know that they plan to put contracts in the next update, though, so I just hope they take it further by putting a mission track in there too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter posting this thread, I did some searching an realized that someone already posted with a similar suggestion --\u0026gt;\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73225-Career-Mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73225-Career-Mode\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I think this player was going for ultimate realism and a little more than what I would expect from the career mode, but it is essentially the same idea that I had.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-22T19:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould be Squad will also make for mission tracks, if they see it fitting with career mode.

Make missions be the main focus (but they wouldn\u0027t have to be linear, as MCE demonstrates) and then you can also select contracts as a sort of \u0022side quest\u0022 for extra money and/or science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
