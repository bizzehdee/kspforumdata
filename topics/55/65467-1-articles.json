With that in mind, every ship will have lights. I would like to be able to stow the lights during launch. The old school incandescent lights could use a nice update to LED technology, and be flat panel, stow-able lights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVA always use tethers. It would be nice to default to a tether that could be released as necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the VAB it would be very useful to have the option to perform functional checks such as being able to deploy solar arrays or antennas (especially since you can\u0027t see the deployed array\u0027s/antenna\u0027s configuration unless you\u0027re in space) and other movable parts, to check for clearance etc. to other structure/parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It would also be VERY useful to be able to turn off the VAB lights for a functional check of the above mentioned vehicle lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I may not have found this feature yet but deploy-able \u0022hinges\u0022 would be a useful feature to basically be able to fold any structure/part for launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it for now. Very fun game/simulation! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJon\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T18:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re open to mods, Aviation Lights has a good selection of various colors of running lights.

I thought it\u0027d be cool if it was like an upgradable feature. The tether could be reeled in or out for maneuvering in space on a ladder, and would provide power for light and air, but with low technology, you wouldn\u0027t have RCS pack capabilities. Then with more science, you would be able to upgrade so your suit has the RCS pack in limited supply, and you could move off the ladders but still attached. Then with more science, you\u0027d be able to detach the cord and have suit oxygen and power, with extended fuel for RCS, but could reattach the cord for extended EVA, as well as being able to leave a Kerbal outside while you go launch another mission without the Kerbal floating away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my vision, but i\u0027d be perfectly happy with just a tether so i didn\u0027t have to worry about Kerbals floating away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
