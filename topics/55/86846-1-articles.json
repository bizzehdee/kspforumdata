I know it would add tons more data to the files, but just a thought.

Well, cities at least. News and other world reactions wouldn\u0027t be ridiculous though! You go to the news screen and see \u0022KSP rockets crash downtown, terrorize thousands!\u0022(big rep and funds drained from that crashed SSTO of yours) with a funny news page and cute, silly side stories. The side stories could even be things like \u0022Public losing interest in space\u0022 or \u0022Astronomy club finds potentially habitable planets\u0022 that affect funds/science/rep and gain of those resources. Or \u0022Researchers create more efficient aerospace construction techniques\u0022 or something similar that affects price of launches and other infrastructure! Tax rates? Adding a world to interact with would change so much!
