With the new aerodynamics model, it\u0027d be very useful.\n\n(To the layman, the Center of Pressure is essentially the center of drag; it\u0027s very hard to design a stable rocket without knowledge of the CoP, even if you know the CoM, as [G. Harry Stine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._Harry_Stine) notes in his exceptional book *The Handbook of Model Rocketry*, which taught me half of everything I know about aerodynamics.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T16:54:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 04:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg**"}]}
