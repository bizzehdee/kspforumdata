You set up a seismometer on the surface of a planet or moon. Then you crash something into that planet/moon and the seismometer records it. You can then get a blurb and science out of the seismometer. I think important aspects which make it engaging are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E1.

The impactor experiment has you set down one probe and then crash another probe or piece of debris into the same body. Each step is different. One has you soft land something and another has you make sure you crash into the planet (which can be a challenge if the lander and the impactor were the first craft before). One of the reasons that launching something into orbit is fun is because it has multiple steps and each step feels different: the liftoff, the gravity turn, the orbital insertion, detaching fairings, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2.

If your soft landed seismometer didn\u0027t land in one piece then the impactor is worthless and the experiment is a bust. If you don\u0027t pack enough fuel in the impactor to crash into the body the seismometer is on, the experiment has also failed.

For instance constructing a sufficient gravoli survey might give delta-v and TWR information about that world, taking a barometric reading of a world\u0027s air-column would allow you to see your flight path with drag factored in. This way you feel as if you\u0027re doing real applicable research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought on the Material\u0027s bay: if you did the surface features thing the samples you find could be added to the bays and reacted in different environments. Different samples could have different pay-outs, for instance Very Interesting Rocks would react more than Ice, and bacteria from stromata would react more than volcanic rock, giving extra incentives to visit these places. For simplicity the bay might only have 5 material slots. Samples from other places might also be possible, for instance the Atmospheric Sensor might be able to collect gasses from different world\u0027s atmospheres, and ocean and ground-scatter samples might be usable. They could be reloaded if you have an attached science lab, but only if those materials have been loaded onto the lab, making the transportation and coordination of material samples a real part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA way to make the Barometer more interesting might be that it isnt a point reading, but rather pays out based on how large a swath of the atmosphere it passes through while activated. This would make dropping small probes into atmospheric planets more fun and lucrative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId love to get the impactor experiment in stock.
