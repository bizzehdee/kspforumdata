One thing I find that I constantly do is switch from the game view to map view just to see the Apoapsis and Pereapsis. I tend to miss staging b/c of that plus I really like watching the the ship I built fly. Could those two values be included in the game view as well? Maybe as an toggle option in the settings to display it on screen or near the navigation ball? I know there are mods that will display that information but all of the ones I have found either support old versions or they display a lot more information than I currently want. Since the values are already in game it seems like it could be a relatively easy change to make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeggpold","CreatedById":74133,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T18:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re willing to add plugins, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54533-0-23-5-VOID-Vessel-Orbital-Informational-Display\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EVOID plugin\u003C/a\u003E provides Pe and Ap information (along with a lot of other useful information) in the HUD (heads up display).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T19:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m flying most of my missions in map mode already because it provides all the vital information (not just Pe/Ap, but more importantly the shape of the orbit, nearest approaches, intercepts, gravity slingshots, ship position relative to next SOI change during time warp, etc etc. There\u0027s only time to appreciate the \u0022normal\u0022 view when the ship is not burning (or is in the middle of a substantial burn) or time warping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, both ascent and landing are a problem and require more or less frequent switching between the two modes.
