When in flight and looking down at their windows in the lower right, you just have to remember which is pilot, etc.,. It would be nice if say their middle initial was there job, so a pilot would have P and Bob who in my current game would have an S for scientist (Bob S Kermen). Then add a number the end or R# for their rank (skill level). That makes it a lot easier to quickly glance and see who to send out on EVA for Science, or who to send over to repack the shutes or fix a flat."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:17:19Z","Content":"Having their specialisation denoted by a middle initial in their full name is a little jarring; instead, there should be a separate field (or even a graphical icon) accompanying the Kerbal\u0027s name (e.g. Jebediah Kerman, Pilot or Jebediah Kerman [Pilot\u0027s wings symbol].\n\nAlso, instead of a R#, USAF-style chervons would look nicer."},{"CreatedByName":"Kibble","CreatedById":131042,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:22:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, instead of a R#, USAF-style chervons would look nicer.\n\nYou don\u0027t wanna make it too military though - my Kerbals are *peacefully* exploring space!"},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T22:59:07Z","Content":"They already all have the same last name, so what would be wrong with their middle intl being their specialization?
