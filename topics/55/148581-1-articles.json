Please do a round of part-balancing. Mainly of the weights of structural parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example: The weight of a \u0022Rockomax Hubmax\u0022 (1.5Tonne) is WAY heavy compared to just a cross 3 \u0022structural fuselages\u0022 (0.1 Tonne each) and then provide the same function. Thus, I -never- use the Hubmax, but always use structural fuselages. Make the structural fuselage heavyer or the hub lighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI-Beams are way heavy too, compared to small octagonal struts... Thus I use -many- octagonal struts (only increasing part count) and I never ever have used an I-beam for anything... Oh yeah, and the octagonals have fuel crossfead too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can go on and on and on, but the mass of most parts make no sense...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-24T21:32:24Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2016 09:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Chris_2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T08:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if it was better, I still would never use the hudmax, cause its so\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eugly\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-25T13:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222773519\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148581\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474810961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101028\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WildLynx\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 minutes ago, WildLynx said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can use similar hub from Nertia\u0027s Stockalike Station Parts.

I only play stock because I want to be able to share my crafts easily with other people. And the stock game should be balanced, and right now there are many parts that I never use because they are unbalanced. They should have done this balancing a long time ago because it will break existing crafts (at least change the performance of crafts)...
