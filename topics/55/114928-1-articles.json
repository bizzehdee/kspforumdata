Additionally the engineers could weld things based on their skill.\n\nIVA movement isn\u0027t really needed IMO. We already can transfer crew, and inside movement would probably be only RAM-eating eye candy.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T16:45:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"}]}
