It is not. In a gyroscope the wheel spins at a high angular velocity to keep constant orientation. In the Cubli we use reaction torques to balance. These torques are what the Cubli\u0027s structure \u0027feels\u0027 when the three motors attached to it accelerate or decelerate the wheels. In fact, Cubli\u0027s controller tries to minimize wheel velocities in addition to keeping the structure upright. This method is more reactive to external disturbances and reduces vibrations and sensor noise.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T20:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SaturnV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SaturnV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI found this.
