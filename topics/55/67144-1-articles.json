I\u0027ve been madly obsessed with this game the last few months since I first downloaded it, point being I\u0027m new and even though I\u0027ve read the Forum Rules and looked for this in a previous post and think this post is new and not a repeat, if I\u0027m not following rules correctly or you have any advice for me oh how to post please let me know! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my suggestion is that it would be cool if the Kerbal on the Mun in the start screen was interactive, like his eyes followed your mouse and if you clicked on him he waved. Hit the space bar and he jumps, or if you move your cursor in a circle quickly he gets dizzy and falls. My idea was inspired by old Nintendo 64 games like Star Fox and Mario, so if you\u0027ve played those you\u0027ll know what I\u0027m getting at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks glad to be a \u003Cstrong\u003ENEW \u003C/strong\u003Emember of this awesome kommunity! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaptain","CreatedById":72984,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T03:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol, awesome idea.
