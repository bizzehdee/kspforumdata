That\u0027s not really enough to sell it on part count benefit.

In the real world, the outer tube of the rocket *is* the logitudinal structural member, regardless of the size and strength of the interior parts (in this case, the engine(s))\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It only saves 1 part, by effectively combining fairing base and decoupler (which may well be a good idea)\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nTwo. (1) The fairing base and decoupler are merged. (2) The engine shroud \u0022parts\u0022 go away. These may be non-persistent and do not contribute to debris build-up, but they are not physicsless. There are many threads on this forum describing the NERV shrouds in particular hanging on each other and having to be burned off at the expense of dV or crashing into other parts and damaging them.\n\nThe new fairing system allows the old engine shroud system to be replaced with no work at all on Squad\u0027s part other than to disable those models/modules, since the fairing system is already implemented. More flexible too. Autostrut functionality would be more work, but the strut system itself is already present as well."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:25:50Z","Content":"I posted a similar thread. Stock fairings don\u0027t reliably make interstages (I tried a couple times more than I should have to, then installed PF which simply works). PF autostruts, which as was said above makes sense since the fairing/shroud IS the structural linkage (ksp acts like the rocket is balanced on the engine bell). I also use KJR for the same reason (and to lower part counts to delay my inevitable crash after x minutes of play)."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T15:36:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The new fairing system allows the old engine shroud system to be replaced with no work at all on Squad\u0027s part other than to disable those models/modules, since the fairing system is already implemented.

It would be at least some work to remove the existing engine shrouds. It would also require significant new work to make the new fairings adequately replace the engine shrouds, so that the correct simple default is created for the simple case of clipping a stack together. It\u0027s not an acceptable replacement unless it has that. Throwing together a quick simple stack needs to be no slower or more complex than it already is."}]}
