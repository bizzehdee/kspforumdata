Usually I send them to the lab for analysis and then transmit or keep them. However when I have started to send data to the lab there is the risk of the screen from the lab treated data popping up while I am sending something else to the lab leading me to unintentionally store that data. This in turn forces me to look through all my experiments to find the one I accidentally stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to fix/mitigate this I suggest that one of the following solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Elocking the buttons on the experimental data screen so that keep/transmit/recycle are always in the same positions even if the data has already been to the lab \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELocking the buttons for 1s or so after a new experiment pops up to prevent misclicking \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emaking the experimental data screen a queue rather than a stack if the experiment wasn\u0027t activated triggered manually (ie by clicking log data on it as compared to binding all instruments to a hotkey). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
