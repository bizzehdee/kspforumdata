I rarely have trouble when I attach them to the fuselage itself, only the underside of wings... If there is a mod or a fix for this already, I have not found it yet. If one exists, please post a link!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T18:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can do is lowering the plane to the SPH ground, you\u0027ll see which wheels touch the ground first, and some landing gears (the stock one mostly, it might be related to collider) also shows suspension \u0022working\u0022 as it supposed to be (they move up before wheel enter the ground), it\u0027s quite good enough, for now at least, to have as little as possible height difference between wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neamerjell","CreatedById":86054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T15:38:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGetting them even with each other is not the problem, it is getting them parallel to the fuselage. I\u0027m talking about toe in and toe out alignment, like on your car. When trying to attach landing gear to the underside of B9 wings or Procedural wings, the wheels are always toe out and cause the plane to wobble down the runway, veer off to one side or just simply crash.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
