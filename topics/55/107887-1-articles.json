While it is very possible to scoop something into a cargo bay and have it captured inside you can\u0027t go into timewarp or whatever you just collected will just drift though the cargo bay walls (and woe betide you if you drop out of warp while it\u0027s still part way through your craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027d like is this; if you have captured something inside a cargo bay and closed the bay it remains a \u0022loose\u0022 object as it currently does, but when you go into time warp (on rails) it is \u0022magically\u0022 docked with the craft and the moment you come out of timewarp it is undocked. The thing in the cargo bay doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be in contact with the bay walls, it could just behave like a part that is offset from the cargo bay.
