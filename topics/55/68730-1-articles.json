Your post seemed quite reasonable n stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed the opposition to procedural parts is pretty much \u0022Things would be too easy and the best craft builders would be less special as a result\u0022 (I know that\u0060s not exactly what you were saying but I\u0060m mixing a lot of things I have read and reading a little into all of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree that having restrictions improves gameplay but I don\u0060t agree that having a limited range of parts is the best way to do that. That is only a sandbox solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECash money or some form of earned scientific credit to buy the parts is what is needed. Then the super-duper part that does everything simply can\u0060t be used for everything because it is too expensive in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives the building freedom people crave whilst at the same time not eradicating the gameplay that makes the game fun (both very very important).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0060Sure, you can repurpose that orange tank to hold RCS but it will cost you about the same as building a whole rocket.\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0060Sure, you can have a custom shaped micro fuel tank smaller than an oscar but it will cost more than a huge standard tank\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0060Sure, you can have structural panels that are half size but they are twice the price\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0060Sure, you can have a super duper ridiculous sized fuel tank but it costs a super duper ridiculous amount of cash and science\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox would then be totally blue sky building. Whatever you think can be built with hardly any restrictions but in the \u0060real\u0060 game there would be all the restrictions as to what can be put on a rocket that are needed to maintain a good level of gameplay (because that is the \u0060game\u0060 as opposed to sandbox which is not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople need to move away from \u0060the restricted part list is what enables good gameplay and I only play sandbox\u0060 to \u0060Career is the actual game and the financial and scientific considerations enable good gameplay\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel the game is being held back by the stock purists and the established builders who both resist new parts, especially procedural ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the game Total Annihilation for example there was a tech tree (a lot of the main game was working through the tech tree) and many robots which were good at certain points in the game but not in the endgame (because they were too underpowered compared to tech3 robots) existed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were not made worthless by the tech 3 robots \u003Cstrong\u003Eexcept when you played sandbox\u003C/strong\u003E (unlocked skirmish) at which point the tech 3 robots were the only robots worth building and in a similar way, procedural parts will not affect gameplay \u003Cstrong\u003Eexcept in sandbox\u003C/strong\u003E where they will be the only parts worth using due to the lack of financial or other considerations. In the \u0060real\u0060 game there will be restrictions in place to balance the gameplay and keep it fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT : Myself I would suggest the price should be a multiplier to the standard cost based on how much you changed the original item. If you make it half or twice the size, it costs twice as much. Four times the size? four times the cost. Then the prices are related to the item cost and also take into account the amount of bespoke work done to alter it to be the part you want.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-10T13:07:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2014 01:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeTIos","CreatedById":17032,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T13:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou gotta press CTRL\u002BShift on your keyboard \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But yeah I agree with you there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T17:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022 data-cite=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReduce-wall-of-text-edit\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis very much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel that the addition of money (soon I hope) will change alot of ballance issues people are having, and force everyone to concider all ballance suggestions differently\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
