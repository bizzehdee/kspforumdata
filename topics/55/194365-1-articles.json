(although honestly, given where player base opinion is right now on DLC, how basic this functionality is of having larger legs, and how many people have been fiscally harmed by Covid-19: now is probably NOT the time for this to be another DLC: it would be better to add this \u0022free\u0022 and sell other new parts/features later...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-01T15:28:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2020 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-01T15:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re on the topic of more parts, can Squad just fill the gaps in the array of stock parts that many mods have fixed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-01T18:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKRE is a great mod, but I would be thrilled to see some larger legs in stock instead of needing a mod.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe BG robotics can somewhat fill that role, but\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) they can be twitchy (I\u0027m currently dealing with issues with locks being ignored and/or not changing state between locked \u0026amp; unlocked on multiple craft)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) It\u0027s extra paid content that some people may not be able to afford or may not want and\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) robotic parts can quickly skyrocket your part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T17:12:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat\u0027s needed are parts that are \u0022scalable\u0022 or \u0022tweakable\u0022 or \u0022procedural in a limited range\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-05T23:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s needed are larger landing legs.
