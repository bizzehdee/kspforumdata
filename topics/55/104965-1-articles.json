But I think that just refuelling isn\u0027t fun enough. I am suggesting that they should add the ability to sell ore in career mode for a little bit of extra cash. Imagine having a massive M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn base deticated to mining and have transportation landers that bring tonnes of ore to Kerbin in a blaze of glory only to sell it so you can do it all over again and even more!
