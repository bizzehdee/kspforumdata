I recently bought Kerble and love the game. But I noticed that its running in 32bit. I didn\u0027t give it much thought until I started modding Kerble. I soon ran out of ram when Kerble used about 1.5gb of ram witch is about how much a 32bit game is allocated to use. Kerble running by itself with no mods at 32bit runs perfectly fine,and I don\u0027t think we would be having this discussion if there was not a modding community.I have done some research and understand the unity(witch is the game engine the Kerble uses) does not support 64bit builds. I am wondering when there will be an update to Kerble and or Unity allowing builds in 64bit. I am also wondering when Kerble will support multi core CPUs as I have an 8-core processor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T00:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, 64-bit support is a commonly requested feature.
