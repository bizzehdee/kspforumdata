At the moment, there\u0027s no way to rest a node to it\u0027s \u0027default\u0027 value of 0 m/s - the only way is to delete the node entirely and make a new one. While I would normally be able to cope with this, the fact remains that placing nodes can be extremely buggy/haphazard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry and place a node on a new orbit after an encounter but the new orbit is very similar to the current (so they\u0027re close together). 90% of the time, I\u0027ve not been able to. Or placing nodes on orbits that are extremely non-eccentric - not only does the AP/PE wobble around (I can deal with that) but trying to place a node on such wobbliness is trying, to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, something like \u0027when the node editor symbols are visible, Spacebar resets the node to 0 so you can start again without deleting and replacing\u0027, similar to how pressing space in the editors while holding a part will reset it to it\u0027s default position/rotation (though, that may be a function of EditorExtensions, I can\u0027t remember EDIT: Apparently, it\u0027s not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain I go with the waffling so yeah, thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-24T12:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2014 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T23:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace in the VAB indeed resets to default\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedPine","CreatedById":95532,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T08:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe MechJeb has a Maneuver Node Editor.
