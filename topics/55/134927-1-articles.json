I cant give you any rational reason for this - it\u00B4s just i really dont like to massively timewarp outside ongoing missions. What i often do instead is to keep the game running in the background at some medium warp-level, just to cut down on the waiting period a bit, while still having the impression of time actually elapsing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what i have often found myself wishing for is \u003Cstrong\u003Ea tick-box in the loadgame-dialogue, that would allow the game to add the elapsed realtime since the latest alteration of the savefile\u003C/strong\u003E (as obtainable by OS-standards - so save-format would not have to be changed) to the saved gametime. This way, i\u00B4d not even have to start my computer in order to have the planets move. If you played your save last time two days (48 hours) ago and tick that box (which is always off by default) upon loading it, those 48 hours will be added to your gametime, just as if you\u00B4d have had the game running in real time for the entire time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to make this work, the game would have to \u0022cheat\u0022 a little, since, of course, it would still have to\u003Cstrong\u003E process that elapsed time\u003C/strong\u003E with its flight-paths at some point. That should be done, \u003Cstrong\u003Eas fast as CPU allows, in the background\u003C/strong\u003E (maybe give a process massage on screeen),\u003Cstrong\u003E during the loading process \u003C/strong\u003E(assuming the box is ticked), before the KSC appears on screen. Else than that, implementation should be super-simple: One control-element (the labeled tick-box), two data-grabs (current system time \u002B time of latest change to savefile), a substraction (the former - the later) and an addition (add result to gametime).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would enhance the \u0022off-line experience\u0022 of KSP tremendously - even if your computer is not even on, you\u00B4d still have that warm feeling of your latest mission being on its way, while you are really, i dunno, standing at the conveyer belt sorting out the faulty socks, or whatnot. \u0022On wednesday, around 20:00h, Jeb will enter minmus\u00B4 SOI\u0022 and you\u00B4d be looking forward to it all the way through monday and tuesday (on which days, you are pre-occupied and cant play anyways). Sure, you can do this, now, too, but you\u00B4d have to waste a lot of energy for it, by having your comp run all the way through. With this, you could send your mission on its way and shut down the entire game for the duration of the flight and it would have arrived when you load the save (just be carefull you dont miss it - use out-of-game scheduling for that - an alarm-clock, f.e.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: I am fully aware, that a lot of people will not see the point in this. You can time-warp after all. That feels different though. That\u00B4s what it is all about. Nothing rational, but more emotional. To just know, that the world of KSP continues, while i am not playing it (even if that\u00B4s achieved only by a \u0022trick\u0022), would go a long way to make me think of it, even when i am doing something completely different and the enjoyment of it, would surpass the hours logged on steam (if i had bought it via steam, that is), by a good margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T12:49:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t really know how I feel about this, especially for players like me who only have time to play once a month or so, it might not be great to have to plan everything out in advance in real life just\u00A0to make sure you don\u0027t miss your ship\u0027s next SOI change. Of course, if it\u0027s a togglable option, that\u0027s not really an issue. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I think having 1:1 scaling\u00A0is a little bit pointless. Missions within Kerbin\u0027s SOI do fit quite nicely (although I can see the 6-hour Mun transfer causing issues with sleep \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E), taking days rather than weeks. But beyond that, it seems like you would never really even notice it. Even an Eve transfer takes months to complete, which seems far beyond fun - I\u0027m not sure I would even remember much about the mission after that long. It might be noticeable somewhere like Jool, where there\u0027s some relatively short transfer times, but otherwise I can\u0027t see it affecting much. Even if you do scale it up so that interplanetary transfers take days rather than months, that basically removes the ability to use this within SOIs, with a Mun transfer taking just minutes, which probably isn\u0027t the effect you were going for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, an interesting idea. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T13:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, months is okay. I play KSP in \u00B4bursts\u00B4 mostly, meaning, i may play nothing but KSP for like 3 days, and then, after i completed what i set out to do (this time around, it was my first mining contract) i may well end up not playing it for a month or two (but still fire it up occassionaly, just to let some time pass on slow warps). To have time elapse in between would go a long way for me - even for inter-planetary transfers and launch windows. I think it would be really nice, if i could optionally keep a real date in my mind, when my Duna-probe is going to arrive. That doesnt mean, i wont touch the game until then - there a lot of other stuff to do, after all - but each time i would use warp in the meantime, i\u00B4d have to adjust the real arrival date of that probe. No biggie. On the other hand, i would be almost guranteed to play KSP on that date, when it finally comes, and the days prior i would get hyped - like it was real, sort of...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, i feel like i am sort of missing out, whenever i dont have KSP running, even if it would just be for the sake of having time elapse in its world. With that option, i would feel like i was progressing (and by virtue of keeping the dates in mind and waiting them out at least partially, deserving that progression) in the game, even when i am not playing it. As said - it\u00B4s mostly about emotional attachment for when you are NOT playing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS: Maybe there should be a safeguard extra auto-save whenever you load a game with that tick-box enabled so that if you \u00B4overshot\u00B4, but didnt think you did, you can still roll back to before all that time elapsed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-26T15:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, definitely an interesting idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see the appeal, but I guess for most of us real life would prevent us from getting to the computer at the right time to execute the crucial manoeuvre, especially several weeks ahead that we just can\u0027t plan to\u00A0that level of detail. \u00A0 That, and I personally would not like to have to wait 2 years to drop my probe into Jool\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the idea itself does have some merit, so perhaps a mod that gives that kind of function, with some control options to cater for players\u0027 real life circumstances could be interesting,\u00A0but not really something I would use\u00A0personally.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
