My suggestion is that we have an in-game calculator we can access from any screen. Maybe in the future it could be specialized for easier calculations in Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you already have one, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T18:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want just a normal calculator, you can play KSP windowed.
