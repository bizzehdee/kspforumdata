This would be much more realistic that what happens currently. One way of doing this is that every planet and moon could have some cone of darkness that points exactly in the opposite direction of the sun at all times. When this falls onto an object, it could apply the correct amount of dimming to it, as well as a certain pattern, being that the shadow gradually disappears as it reaches the edge of the covered area. This would even enable players to view planets transiting the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T00:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elittle things like this lead to a more complete game. hope this is added at some point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T01:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hope that this happens eventually, and it does happen now to an extent with a nonvisual effect.

All they prolly do is draw a line to the core of the sun, measure the distance (how much power you make) and whether or not that line crosses anything (blocked by thing). Lighting is so much more complex than that. I dunno how this game does it, but it must be more than just \u0027is thing in the way?\u0027. And if planetary shadows were done like that, there wouldn\u0027t be a shadow cast on it. It would just instantly turn completely dark as soon as the eclipse started, and stay like that \u0027till it ends.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T01:53:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vaporo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vaporo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif (direct_line_to_sun=1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{Sunlight==0;}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I only know some basic c\u002B\u002B, and know nothing about KSP code or Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed solar panels getting blocked by celestial bodies, and I\u0027m fairly sure it\u0027s a recent-ish development.
