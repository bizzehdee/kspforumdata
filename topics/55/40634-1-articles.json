So on initial vessel load all parts would be loaded and then everything in the fairing (e.g. marked by being in the stages above the fairing decouple) would be frozen in that load constellation and handled as one part, making the physics simulation a lot lighter. When the fairing is decoupled the freeze on the parts is lifted and they are then handled as they normally are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I don\u0027t know much about programming and the code underlying KSP: does anyone out there know whether this possible and feasible? Perhaps this could even be handled in a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, let me know what you guys think about this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benjiful9000","CreatedById":38135,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T11:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[closed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-04T19:13:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2021 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by benjiful9000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T12:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with doing this is that it leads to potential for misuse - I can imagine strapping up a fuel tank in between fairings which would draw fuel but not change CoM (due to no physics calculations), for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s a lot more potential for abuse of it that I\u0027ve not managed to think of - I think the idea is noble, but suspending physics just leads to a potential for abuse, or at least a lack of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, you could end up with a horrific lag spike when the fairings decouple and your 1,000 part monstrosity is unleashed on the dark cold ink blot of space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T14:29:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens if the stress on the fairing is too high?

For example CoM-shift due to relocating fuel makes it possible to travel without using any fuel (there\u0027s a Scott Manley video about this...). Also: the CoM calculation would still be made, but the part (the payload) would only be one single part. So it would basically be the same thing as using a double fuel-tank instead of two singles (here the CoM shift is also only computed for one part, instead of two), which I wouldn\u0027t consider \u0022abusing\u0022 the systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmappedout\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmappedout\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlus, you could end up with a horrific lag spike when the fairings decouple and your 1,000 part monstrosity is unleashed on the dark cold ink blot of space \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but 1) you\u0027d be hard pressed to fit 1000 parts under a single fairing (though I\u0027m sure many would try...), 2) the lag spike would be the same \u0022hiccup\u0022 you experience on the launchpad, when the entire vessel is loaded - the difference is only, that you don\u0027t experience the lag for the entire flight between initial load and fairing decouple, and 3) this lag-spike could be the ingame explanation for creating an event horizon which allows us to travel to other solar systems ;-D!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"martscht","CreatedById":29513,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T16:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Psycix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Psycix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suggested a similar concept just recently.
