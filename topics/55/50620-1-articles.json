This would be awesome, and almost just as awesome would be to have the tire smoke as well, as you don\u0027t really know when you\u0027ve touched down, of course, with both of these, that problem is eliminated. Anyway, I just really want both of these things in the game, I don\u0027t really care if they are in the vanilla game or a mod, of course a mod would probably be better, because then the people complaining about performance issues would annoy the devs into making it an option. I think these would be valuable to the game, and if anyone wants to make a mod for it, then please post a link here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank You in Advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Espresso\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
