Give us more of those. A couple dozen more. They don\u0027t have to be named intelligently. They don\u0027t have to be connected to anything. They don\u0027t need to have new icons. They don\u0027t have to be positioned in any specific location or pattern or order. Can be as copypasta as you want.

We cannot add these nodes ourselves with this mod though, and there is no other functional tech tree editor for .25\u002B available.
