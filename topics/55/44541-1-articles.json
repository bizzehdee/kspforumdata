This is not really an auto pilot unless you program it to be. It\u0027s a programmable computer for KSP. I think it has access to most of the variables you are talking about.

The idea is that you\u0027ll have to figure out how to program routines for the craft to handle those cases where a faster response time than lightspeed delays will allow is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a case where I think it should remain as a mod-only optional thing and not become part of the stock game. The ability to immediately control unmanned craft without software controls on board and without lightspeed delay is unrealistic, but most players of the game won\u0027t be programmers and won\u0027t find it fun to have to script the program, so it\u0027s an unrealism that is probably necessary for sales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, I think anyone in this forum that responds to a request with \u0022it already exists, here\u0027s the mod for it\u0022 should also include a justification for why they think it needs to remain OUT of the stock game and only be in a mod as I did above. Otherwise the existence of the mod is not REALLY a reason to dismiss the request. If Squad never implemented anything that a modder had previously implemented, the game development would be more severely curtailed the more mods there are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ernest3.14","CreatedById":75412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T04:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMHO, this is a part of realism that is important enough to be included in stock.

I could sort of accept that it if it was trying to emulate older programming languages for the sake of the old-skool feel of the game (i.e. can you make an autopilot using the same primitive tools that were available to the Apollo Program instead of using a modern easier language?). But the problem I have is that it\u0027s NOT for that reason that it\u0027s got some syntax problems. It\u0027s just because the designer wanted something different and make up a new language thats a bit sloppy and messy. Also, it puts up unnecessary obstacles like making you have to type the code inside the game and not allowing you to just have it read it off a text file on the hard drive (allowing you to edit the code in whatever external text editor you like). This is one of those cases where the program trying to do *LESS* would actually make it more versatile and useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T22:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eagain, like i say in a lot of these threads, it would probably be more user friendly if it was a drag and drop interface, much like scratch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harguinxx","CreatedById":76917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T11:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edrag and drop simple computer would be awesome, imagine detach a fuel tank and it automatically deploys a parachute when there is enough atmosphere.... would be awesome!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, the 2km of loading area can be a problem, maybe a a computer shut down system could solve it if you say that all ships with a computer active must be loaded even if they aren\u0027t in the 2km range... use too many of them would be laggy, but I think that the idea is awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
