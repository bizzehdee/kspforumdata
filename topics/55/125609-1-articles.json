I\u0026#39;m accidentally triggering it all the time, and it\u0026#39;s incredibly jarring every time I do. I never trigger it on purpose, because it\u0026#39;s a completely useless feature to me. If I want to rotate the camera, I hold the mouse button down. I don\u0026#39;t want it to rotate when I\u0026#39;m not holding a mouse button, because that stops me from clicking on all the things I need to click.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0026#39;s actively interfering with my gameplay and I see no way to turn it off. I desperately wish they would get rid of this feature (or at least add a UI option somewhere to disable it).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yet, I assume Squad must have had some reason for adding the feature. Maybe other people have more of a use for it than I do?

I can\u0026#39;t speak for others, but as a new player to a new game, the first thing I do is pour over all the settings. The only time I run into trouble is when something gets added like this, and it won\u0026#39;t be long before all existing players know about it, so I don\u0026#39;t think it\u0026#39;s a big deal.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kevin Kyle","CreatedById":110492,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T18:21:52Z","Content":"\nIm sure I read that it could be disabled and forgot but its gone as soon as I get home to shut it off. Causes all kinds of grief when using Precise node. Similar to other issues I have at times when scrolling with the mouse wheel changing my zoom when all I really wanted to do was scroll a list.
