Many people ask for things like \u0022a proper feel for re-usability\u0022 instead of just relaunching a vehicle, however for most of the time there are no ideas for how this will work. This is my idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It revolves around a new building for which I am going to call the Vehicle storage building (VSB), when you create a vehicle in the VAB or SPH these will become \u0022blueprints\u0022 so to speak, instead of a launch button there will be a build button and a display showing the price of the rocket (linking into currency). Once clicked you will lose however much it cost to build it and one of said vehicle will be built and placed in the VSB, here you cannot edit the vehicle, only place in pilots. There will be a launch button here which will of course launch either your plane or rocket. Once launched the vehicle cannot be reclaimed in the sense that it will be placed in storage, you can recover it to get the science plus crew but the craft is overall disposed of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E However what if you wanted the craft back, well in the VAB or SPH there would be a selection button [Expendable or Reusable], in early game expendable would be the only option available and would be free. After going through a few tiers of science you would eventually unlock reusable craft, this would cost more money to build (but could be worth it if the craft is good). If a craft was reusable then when it launch\u0027s, does it\u0027s mission and lands, whatever survives such as a capsule or spaceplane can be reclaimed. The surviving parts would be in the VSB where you could click a \u0022refurbish\u0022 button, this would rebuild and refuel the craft for whatever the price of the missing peices was. Then you can go and fly again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give an example of this in-game: I design an american shuttle in the VAB, I click the reusable button and click build (imagine this costs $100,000, $60,000 for the booster and $40,000 the shuttle). This is built and stored in the VSB, I enter the VSB and scroll down my list of ships and find my shuttle. Very simply I load Jeb into the ship and launch discarding the booster along the way (this explodes on the ground and cant be recovered). I do the mission and land on kerbin, I click the reclaim button and get the science I made, when I click on the VSB again my shuttle is there without the booster, I click refurbish and lose $60,000 to rebuild the booster. I then launch again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn total this gives the player a sense that it\u0027s the same ship, adds more depth to the game and can be a way to save money. Thank you for reading, please discuss below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: sorry if this was bad, this is my first idea post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taribu","CreatedById":99819,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T16:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a wonderfull idea. I had similar thoughts about this. The thing I would change is that \u0022refurbish\u0022 thing - i think every part that lands safely on the ground, for example used tanks equipped with parachutes, should automatically show up in the VSB. And if you are building a vehicle, you have the choice to use recovered parts, similar to how you use subassemblies. This gives you the ability to combine recovered assemblies or add new parts to recovered assemblies/ships. This also enables you to use different and new payloads in recovered vehicles, for example shuttles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem that parts(like empty tanks) unload in 2.3 km distance could be solved with a \u0022speculative\u0022 algorithm, for example if you ditch a part while in an suborbital trajectory(Or if you \u0022push\u0022 the periapsis of that part inside the atmosphere with sepatrons), the game automatically looks for activated parachutes on that part and checks if that part could land savely with its mass/drag(parachute) ratio. So the game can automatically recover the part after a certain time, even if that part is unloaded at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xenomorph555","CreatedById":103080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T18:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was actually the plan for all stuff that lands safely to be reclaimed (I should have wrote it better, oh well).
