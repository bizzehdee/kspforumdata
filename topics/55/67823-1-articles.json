There is, another KSC on kerbin, and It uses the old models and textures. I was thinking, (Open to suggestions) that maybe we could implement that as the first KSC. After a while of researching *OLD PARTS!* You get to Research The KSC That was updated in .21/.22, and you start researching all the new parts! Not only does nostalga roll in, It also Makes use of the Easter egg KSC! And it allows you to switch from the old parts *Before .18 with the new part modeling engine* to the new parts! *ARM included*. I think nostalga would make the game more popular an- Wait, also, if you try to access the new KSC before you research it, All you will see is a construction site and a UI will say, Sorry, we arn\u0027t done yet. Come back another time! This makes use of the old parts *disregarding the smallest SRBs* and is a good idea. Now, if you want to add to this idea, or you want to rate it and tell me what you think, Add it to the comments below.
