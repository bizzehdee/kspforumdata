On the other hand, auto-saves tend to happen so frequently that going back to the last one might not be nearly far enough back to fix the problem that just killed your crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn between those two extremes, we have the \u0022revert to launch\u0022 and \u0022revert to construction\u0022 options, which are the only points (unless you keep detailed notes with your third hand while flying eh ship with the other two!) at which you know exactly what state you will revert.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to be able to have save points created automatically at certain key stages of each mission, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - When dropping any stage (or when dropping any stage using more than one decoupler - so that the last \u0022asparagus split point\u0022 of my heavy lifter gets saved before I beuatifully finalise my parking orbit, and then totally screw up my escape burn to Minmus... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E );\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Whenever entering or leaving an atmosphere;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Whenever entering or leaving a body\u0027s SOI;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Whenever crossing any of the altitude thresholds that govern time-warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe examples I\u0027ve picked here are all points at which the game has to \u0022change mode\u0022 already, which avoids the performance overhead of having an extra set of conditions to check at every moment of play. It may be possible to let players set arbitrary parameterised conditions such as \u0022when altitude exceeds 2736481m\u0022, or \u0022when altitude is below 1km and rate of descent increases beyond 30m/s\u0022, but that probably isn\u0027t desirable from either a game play or a \u0022keeping things challenging\u0022 standpoint. The main thing I want to is avoid having to re-play the most boring 10 to 15 minutes of each mission (you know, that long slow haul up out of the atmosphere, with a game that\u0027s lagged to blazes by the number of parts on my massive and complex lifter! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) just \u0027cos I botched the timing of my de-orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor players to get the best benefit from this, though, rather than just being able to revert to the \u0022last autosave\u0022 or even \u0022last scheduled save\u0022, it would also be useful to be able to select from a list of the last *several* saves. The saves would each need to be identified by a time-stamp and a brief description (e.g. \u0022Activating stage: 3\u0022; \u0022Entering atmosphere: Kerbin\u0022; \u0022Leaving SOI: Minmus\u0022; or the two existing options \u0022Manual Quick-save\u0022 and \u0022Auto-save\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?

Yes, the quicksave system needs a bit of a sanity check, so people don\u0027t load up a quicksave from last year by accident, but... if you haven\u0027t done a quicksave and confirmed it quicksaved properly, why would you be using the quickload anyway? Quicksave already does everything you\u0027re asking of this system, \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E multiple saves... which could be the single part of it which might actually solve something. Rather than have the game keep six autosaves at every damn point in the game, you could just keep the last few quicksaves. That way, you also don\u0027t have the extra performance hit of being forced to make a save right when the game is changing state, which can often give a reasonably noticeable stutter anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zepi","CreatedById":67941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T22:27:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy accident or by misunderstanding the autosave / quick save functionality. I just lost dozens of hours of gameplay over a week of IRL time because I held F9 for too long.

If you find yourself at a truly critical point you can manually quicksave. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with zepi, right now it\u0027s WAAAYYY too easy to get mixed up and end up accidently erasing a ton of work. If nothing else, a timestamp simmilar to the one you get when you revert a flight is needed. Or perhaps when you load a save, have the game automatically save at the point your loading from, so if you find you went back to far you can always reload and go back to where you came from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad this happen to me once or twice, very annoying and like zepi said can make people so frustrated they will quit, luckly mine weren\u0027t too bad but something, even something minor, should be done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
