Is there any chance that you could either make the brakes into regenerative brakes, or add that as an action group item? There are times when you face a looooong downhill, and you just don\u0027t want to hit the brakes. Regenerative brakes would be of great use there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T21:32:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this suggestion, as it could also solve the problem of too abrupt braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough you would have to make a distinction between :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Hard braking, when you must absolutely stop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Regenerative braking, when you would like to retrieve some energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps : do we bet someone will try to make a perpetual motion machine of the third kind ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T21:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kegereneku\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kegereneku\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E-snip-\u003Cp\u003Eps : do we bet someone will try to make a perpetual motion machine of the third kind ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the regenerative braking is correctly balanced, this should not be possible unless gravitational acceleration (going downhill) is used to add energy back into the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"a.g.","CreatedById":59470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-26T06:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActivating the motor opposite to the current direction of movement should generate energy.
