I\u0027ve spent over 1000 hours playing the game since I discovered it in July 2013, and it just keeps getting better with every update. So hats off to HarvesteR and the whole team for their brilliant work! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver the past few weeks I\u0027ve invested around 100 hours into a stock KSP 0.90.0 career on Normal difficulty to get a good feel for the new update. (Hey, it\u0027s the holidays after all!) In the course of playing, I\u0027ve noted down a few simple suggestions which I think would greatly improve balance and functionality of the game. I\u0027m sure most of these things have been mentioned before, but I thought it would be nice to compile a whole bunch in one thread.
