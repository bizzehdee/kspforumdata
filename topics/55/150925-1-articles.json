Extra Large too, please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are currently doomed to try make do with just the medium gear as steerable option for crafts of sizes/masses that require the large/extra large as main gears. Aside from the very visible and ridiculous size/height mismatch, it\u0027s also always quite a job to get the respective gear height adjusted to each other without having one almost floating under the craft by itself while the other simultaneously sticking out through the top somewhere. Combinations of XL/medium in particular are very hard to get to look and work right, the size difference is just too extreme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn top of that, and due to the height mismatch often causing such craft to have to lean heavily on the nose (or the tail with taildraggers), the medium size gear ends up overstressed and very prone to exploding during take off and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve ended up way too many times just forfeiting a steering option completely because of this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is nothing about the large gear model that would prevent it from realistically have steering. I imagine that the longer 3x2 assembly like the XL may be more problematic from an engineering point of view, but then at least provide a steerable 2x2 more matching to the XL size and with appropriately adapted weight tolerances (a simple resized copy of the large gear would do nicely... once it\u0027s been made steerable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-27T04:52:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2016 04:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E4x2 != 2x2\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T06:35:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Boeing 747, including the 747-8\u00A0has steerable body gear (center main gear), but that landing gear is only capable of 20 degrees of pivot. \u00A0The nosewheel is more akin to our medium landing gear than heavy gear. \u00A0The A380 has no steerable main landing gear. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA fully steerable heavy landing gear sort of feels like an over powered part, but, properly set up it may have some value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
