If you right-click on the wheels at this point, the first line of the tooltip tells you whether the wheel is being blocked. If you do the same in the VAB/SPH, that entry isn\u0027t present on the tooltip.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo my suggestion is simply to activate this part of the tooltip inside the VAB/SPH. This would allow you to see and solve the problem without having to leave the editor after every tiny adjustment to check whether you\u0027ve made enough room yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-27T16:33:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2016 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adelaar","CreatedById":150794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-28T13:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood suggestion! Alternatively you could use the info box which also displays other potential issues. I was suprised to find out that the \u0022blocked Wheel\u0022 issue isn\u0027t displayed there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
