My reasons for doing this are off-topic, so PM me if you really want to know. Anyway, they are awesome to behold, but really, really slow - like, 12 hours full-throttle cruising to get to the next continent slow. I\u0027m not unhappy with the speed - 10m/s is pretty ok by RL standards. What I am unhappy with is the fact I have to leave my computer running overnight just to move the ship to anything like close to it\u0027s destination. (before anyone says it, fuel\u0027s not an issue - they\u0027re electric!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to do is leave my boat running while I go off to Mun, or develop my next Jool mission, and then check back a bit later when it\u0027s closer to target. In theory, this could be applied to UAVs and rovers as much as naval ships - leave them driving/flying/sailing around while you get on with something else (rovers might need waypoints to avoid obstacles, but you get the idea).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my thinking is this - the issue is that when you return to KSC, the game needs to stop calculating physics for the vessels that are no longer active or in range of the active vessel. But what if an \u0027autopilot\u0027 took over the active vessel and kept those physics calculations running in the background? In theory, if you have the computer power, you could have a handful of autopiloted vessels floating, driving and gliding around while you\u0027re tinkering with your latest VTOL project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDMP allows client instances to connect to a host server and update vessel locations etc, basically making multiple active vessels possible. If this was combined with something like Romfarer\u0027s Lazor autopilot, MechJeb, etc, couldn\u0027t this do more or less what I\u0027m describing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a modder, and I realise that DMP isn\u0027t exactly your bog standard mod. Still, this wouldn\u0027t need all the features of DMP, just a background script or something to work out how far the vessel/rover had moved on its appointed route and update the game with it\u0027s new location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should work, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Before any smartass mod shuts me down for suggesting \u0027autopilot\u0027, please note that really isn\u0027t what I\u0027m suggesting at all.
