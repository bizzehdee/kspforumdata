Excuse me if I am wrong, but isn\u0027t that the opposite of how it works? The rhino seems to have it a bit better.

KSP pretty much has it the wrong way round. Engines were designed this way with little regard for real-life performance (KSP engines are pretty much magic anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully support the idea of having more realistic engine models, regarding expansion ratios, but mind that changing the size of engines for an update will most likely break many crafts. For this reason there are limits to how big nozzles can be made to fit in the current model. The Poodle uses a twin-nozzle design which allows to solve this problem, and removing\u00A0powerheads from the models altogether could help gaining some space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, I don\u0027t think a\u00A0rocket\u00A0engines revamp is still planned.

Perhaps in a futuristic KsP 2.0. If they were to do it now people would complain. Usually by doing such things later you can get away by argumenting that the game will get a large overhaul to meet some modern gaming standards and then you can put a 2.0 sticker on it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175317-skylon/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175317\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175317-skylon/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Skylon\u003C/a\u003E I to hope this will happen one day though.
