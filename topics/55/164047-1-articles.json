This put it\u0027s orbit to where it could make contact with Jool at some point and it did. It actually ended up becoming captured by Jool by making a close pass by of Jool, then Tylo.\u00A0The\u00A0idea it gave me was instead of having several premade moons orbiting the gas planet of KSP, it would be more interesting to see randomly generated asteroids (possibly larger than the ones we have in game now) orbiting Jool as\u00A0pseudo moons.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Jool\u0027s IRL counterpart (Jupiter) having 60\u002B moons and most of the being very small bodies this would make sense. it could also be neat to see Eeloo have very small moons (smaller than Gilly even) to have analogs for Pluto\u0027s moons Hydra and Nix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually decided to visit this new moon of Jool. I named it \u0022The odyssey\u0022. I was super afraid of it being ejected from the Jool system so I moved it\u0027s orbit past that of Tylo\u0027s and below Bop\u0027s. It also was extremely annoying to visit as it orbits in the opposite direction that Jool rotates and the other moon\u0027s orbit. Also ignore the cloud mod I have for Jool in the 2nd image, I did not install any mods that changed the asteroids to spawn around Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/a/Ut7r5\u0022 style=\u0022height:458px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HighFructose","CreatedById":180349,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-04T01:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be actually really cool!
