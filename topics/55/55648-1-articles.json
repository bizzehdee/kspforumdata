Each record would hold data about where the mission went, what planets if any it landed on, what the Kerbals did (EVAs, died, picnic). Possibly also you would be able to view the entire path the mission took in the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I have no idea what something like this would require and if the data stored would be too large (surely each mission record should be no more than a couple dozen kilobytes, if that), but I personally think it would be interesting to have, especially as a way of keeping track of your progression throughout the game and being able to look back at how awful you were that you couldn\u0027t even break Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, something to think about far down the road perhaps.

I also want to be in charge of when a given flight counts as a new mission, with a different number, and when it is just a refuelling mission for a ship being assembled in orbit.
