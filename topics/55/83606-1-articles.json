Ignore that it falls apart. Press Alt\u002BF12 and click the button Hack Gravity. Then revert to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso consider using Hyperedit.

When you\u0027re done you\u0027d just revert to VAB/SPH without the test having any effect on your campaign.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T07:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this has been raised quite a few times before. My preferred solution would be some sort of simulator with a slider that lets you vary things like atmosphere density, gravity, etc. This way, you\u0027d have some ability to test things without spoiling the experience of landing something on the planet for the first time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, I use hyperedit\u0027s planet editor setting to do something similar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to test multiple ships in something like this might be nice, but currently, hack gravity is the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
