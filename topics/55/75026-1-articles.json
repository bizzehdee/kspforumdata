To that end, I suggest that you add a new part:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe RovCo Rover Science Storage Box Model III\u003C/strong\u003E - adapted from the finest recycled fishing tackle boxes. With it you can store not one, not two, but THREE of each science data type. No more running back to the lander with every pebble you pick up! Storage of graviton readings, temperatures and even seismic readouts are a snap! The RSSB III is the answer to your mobile data storage needs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpanded versions of the RSSB are under development. The RSSB Model V is expected to store five of each type of reading and the capacious Model X will store 10, more than you\u0027ll ever likely use!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA smaller RCS storage device, similar to the ROUND-8 Toroidal Fuel Tank, would be nice for small rovers and micro sats. Some similarly small control jets would be welcome as well, especially ones designed to help keep your rover firmly on the planet/moon it\u0027s exploring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case anyone from MechJeb reads this: It would also be nice if MechJeb were to introduce a more compact version of their marvelous tool that can easily be tucked away in space-limited rover and micro-sat designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be nice to add a way to transfer science from one ship to another when the two are docked. Having to do a spacewalk every time gets old after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T14:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf scientific sensors become as expensive as they should with the advent of budgets I can see how having a cheap generic data storage part would be a good idea. Currently it would just seem redundant to adding more sensors to the rover since they\u0027re not really heavy or large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T14:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean something like this? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thanatoscorp","CreatedById":112612,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T14:47:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea ! with an opening system resembling shielded docking port\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vindelle_Sunveam","CreatedById":70755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T14:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean something like this? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, but STOCK, and this is why this isn\u0027t a mod request, but a dev thread.
