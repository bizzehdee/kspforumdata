However, now that heat shields have came out it really bothers me. Why are parachutes in \u0022utility\u0022 and not considered an aerodynamic part. I always click on the wrong tab because parachutes obviously work aerodynamically. It seems like heat shields are more of a utility than parachutes because they work mostly on thermodynamics but they are in the aero section. It\u0027s far from game breaking so I guess I\u0027m just being picky but if I got to pick, I would imagine the aero tab having heat shields and parachutes and wings etc. Regardless, way to go Squad, Kerbal is a great game overall."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T03:38:54Z","Content":"With that logic air intakes would be in the aero tab.

They do belong in aero, IMO.\n\nReally we should split out wing parts into their own tab from aero, and electrical stuff from utility into its own tab, too."}]}
