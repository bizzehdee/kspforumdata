However, now that heat shields have came out it really bothers me. Why are parachutes in \u0022utility\u0022 and not considered an aerodynamic part. I always click on the wrong tab because parachutes obviously work aerodynamically. It seems like heat shields are more of a utility than parachutes because they work mostly on thermodynamics but they are in the aero section. It\u0027s far from game breaking so I guess I\u0027m just being picky but if I got to pick, I would imagine the aero tab having heat shields and parachutes and wings etc. Regardless, way to go Squad, Kerbal is a great game overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T03:38:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that logic air intakes would be in the aero tab.
