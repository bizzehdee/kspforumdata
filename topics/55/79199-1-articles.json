We have to remember that you need only so much science to complete the entire tech-tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if we make the science-pool of those instrument finite to solve the problem, then what would be the point ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason I see for such instrument would be to justify satellite, but they can be justified by other means.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJoab","CreatedById":78834,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T18:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had thought about those problems too. My answer to Sceince spamming would be to make the accumulation of points taper off exponentially. The game wouldn\u0027t have to track the instruments real time, just simply record the time the experiment started and run the exponential equasion when the science is requested. They could also make an instrumen only capable of recording data for a limited amount of time... maybe a year... then if the data isn\u0027t retrieved in that time it would be lost. And you can only retrieve data once from an instrument, so you wouldn\u0027t simply have science points ticking in...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T20:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr, we could do something else: we use the same system as the other experiment(even for the part where you lose science when transmitting) BUT the experiment take some time to be realized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way, you can\u0027t spam science!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
