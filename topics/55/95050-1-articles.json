A custom made ramp and posibly elevator pad with clamps or some temporary holding device for a small rover. And a deployable unfoldable/refoldable ramp system to get to the ground and back in the cargo bay(basically I want to install it in the cargo bay and customize it to make it fit in the sides and bottom or where needed for it\u0027s purpose). This requires sheets of metal the right size(might exist) and some form of electric powered hinges etc and other parts to construct smaller devices. I was hoping for one I could custom design the ramp so it could deploy at various heights and circumstances based on the environment! But a lot of smaller parts would be needed to allow the creation of such things. Let alone casings and things to store it neatly in the cargo bay or other places for when it\u0027s used. There are way to many small things in this game missing. they should stop trying to precreate things and make means to let people build their own more from a smaller perspective. A whole range of things could be added for this. Would add a lot to the game. We need a mechanical/electronic suite of parts made and a tab area for using and constructing those smaller parts. What is going to the moon and space without the ability to make robot like miniature things to go with you. Wether it\u0027s manned or not we need the base parts! 8) Maybe a miniature robotics pack. It should include stuff to improvise most of what i mentioned and more though. It needs full mechanical creation abilities. All the fundementals. Maybe a new tool to shrink parts and make them miniature giveing more use to existing parts also. That would make less work on the programmer and give more power to the users. The ability to cut down current parts also would be good. Then you could just make a sheet of metal and let players mod it. Both of those tools would give near limitless potential with minimal work. Shrink/grow(AKA resize) and cutting along a player determined plane or planes. Simplifies the game design tremendously potentially. Also the ability to make player made parts like my own electric based hinges and add them to the parts list from in game tools.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the ability to power these devices with electricity or other means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso hydrolics and other lift devices. A full suite of mechanical devices and resize/cut etc would be great for the game. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EIf I could even stuck stuff to the end of ladders it would help alot..\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Any way I can post this into my old thread and delete this thread? I forgot it was there and it\u0027s the same idea basically. But this is more specific in some regards.
