In real life, the first vital sign remote monitoring system was actually developed for space program. If there should be a similar system, I think there should be ECG, SpO2, Non-Invasive Blood Pressure, Breath Rate and Heart Rate. The crew will respond to the flight status, such as Gs, spinning, and also some mental stress. You will also be very careful choosing kerbonaut then. It could be funny if you have a medical emergency on space station, and require rescue mission.\n\nI am a huge fan and I have been in medical device industry for 10\u002B years. 4 years ago, I started up a company called Warp United Scientific to develop Medical Recorder. It\u0027s basically a medical Tricorder from Star Trek, but unfortunately, CBS did send me a warning letter, we are not allowed to use the name \u0022Tricorder\u0022... Anyway, my point being, we should introduce some medical and vital sign into KSP, and make it more, well, fun."},{"CreatedByName":"The_8th_Bit","CreatedById":136735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T04:39:18Z","Content":"Life support has been discussed a lot and there are several mods. However, I like the idea of monitoring vitals, it would be amusing to see Jeb\u0027s heart rate or blood pressure increase as his ship explodes around him. This raises the question though, do kerbals have hearts?\n\nBy the way, welcome to the forums:)"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T04:44:25Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ll be moving this to Suggestions and Development, since that\u0027s where this sort of discussion is typically supposed to go.\n\nNormally, Life Support suggestions aren\u0027t encouraged here, since they\u0027ve been suggested and rehashed so much in the past that we\u0027ve put them on our [official What Not To Suggest list](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest) to clear the air for other topics.
