What we\u0027ve got now are a couple of missions that are dependable on our progress throughout the game and as soon as we lunch more difficult missions we are forced to travel great distances. Moreover it is hard to focus on one planet and then move to the other as missions available are requiring us to travel to many different places. For example we move to Duna and next missions will be about Eve etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be great if we could have a seperations for missions; for example we can have 5 for Kerbin 5 for Mun 5 for Minimus 5 for Duna 5 for Gilly etc. you get the idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it could make our exploration more fun and also will leave us with possibility to go where we really want to and also will not leave us with some useless rocket or plane projects that were useful for Kerbin/Mun but we cannot use them because we have many missions focusing on other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think having more missions that could be seperated to different tabs (just like the way or a similar way we have in Research and Development archieve) would be a much better way to distribute missions to players as I personally miss some trivial missions that I could find in the beginning and every time I want to do some of these I start a new career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso as we discover new planets and get some science points and discover new parts I think it could be great to have an opportunity to use them on more trivial missions around Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-29T23:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscussion of this has happened a few times before. A very welcome part of a career mode overhaul would be the ability to have missions and rewards\u00A0bound to specified planets, such as: if you have mod engines that run on a fancy resource, the tech tree node for them can only be opened by bringing home some of that resource, or a sample from a specific biome on a specific planet as opposed to just throwing science points at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T03:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, Foxy, welcome to the board. You\u0027ve hit upon something that has long been a central\u00A0issue with the game, which is a lack of visual\u00A0structure to career mode. Exploring each body actually is split up into 4 different missions. Right now as things are the main sequence of the game, that is executing flybys, orbits, landings, and planting flags on the various worlds, have been held back in World First contracts. They\u0027re almost entirely linear, with only one appearing in Mission Control at any given time, which is, I think, what you are seeing and what is understandably giving you a bit of heartburn. The first thing to know is not to worry--you can go anywhere, anytime, and flyby, orbit, and land as you wish and you will get spontaneous rewards. Go forth and prosper. The way Mission Control is structured, however, will give you no indication that this is true. This main quest to the game is almost entirely invisible to the player which is the main problem. These headline World First missions, where they have visited and to what extent, should be up-front and center and visible to the player when they open the game so they can track their real progress.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxy1992","CreatedById":182477,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T10:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your kind responses.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving the ability to choose on variety \u00A0of\u00A0missions that would allow us to visit places we want to go would be a great improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that I can always go wherever I want but it will not be profitable.

Yeah it depends on what you want to do. Like if you\u0027ve flown by the Mun or Minmus but haven\u0027t landed then landing will still get you money whether there\u0027s an open contract or not, but once you\u0027ve planted a flag and returned home\u00A0that world is\u00A0\u0027complete\u0027 with respect to world firsts. Usually though contracts to send tourists and collect science and plant flags will re-occur for the moons. I\u0027ve also accidentally prolonged the period in which they\u0027re focusing on moon exploration by using a re-usable lander. If your lander returns to a space station rather than going all the way home (you can transfer the crew and whatever science you\u0027ve collected\u00A0with a shuttle) then the world first for landing and returning never completes and the game wont move on to the other planets. You can hold these open as long as you like. Its a little janky but it works!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxy1992","CreatedById":182477,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-30T23:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey! A very cool idea!
