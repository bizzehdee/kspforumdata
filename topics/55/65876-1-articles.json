Yes, the implementation is not extremely realistic but KSP is a game and it is supposed to be fun and reasonably simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1/ there is no guarantee each torque part contains only one reaction wheel. The ASAS unit model suggests that, but that is the only part where we can see the inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ there is already some kind of gyro saturation as you cannot make your module spinning at any speed with torque.

But right now I just don\u0027t need them anymore. On smaller ships the capsule torque is strong enough to handle everything and on larger ones I use RCS. Maybe that\u0027s just me, but reaction wheels feel kinda useless to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if torque (capsule torque at least) were to be nerfed, it would give them a purpose again, it would stop capsules being able to breakdance (maybe), and it shouldn\u0027t be too frustrating for new players, considering in past versions, to get any SAS at all, we\u0027d have to attach one anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
