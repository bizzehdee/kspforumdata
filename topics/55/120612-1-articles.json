When you recover a vessel you only get science from one type of situation under the heading \u0022a vessel returned from...\u0022 I think you should get it from each situation the vessel has been in on it\u0027s trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In the particular situation I experienced I was doing a flyby of Eve, I recovered the vessel, and the on science listed was ~ 3 science for \u0022a vessel returned from orbit of the sun\u0022. I had previously sent 1 flight just out of kerbins SOI and back. So I sent another trip, and I got 0.1 science for \u0022a vessel returned from orbit of the sun\u0022. I haven\u0027t done a 3rd eve flyby yet, I am hoping now that I collected all the \u0022orbit of the sun\u0022 science I can return science from a flyby, or orbit of other planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tweeker","CreatedById":101796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-15T20:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done 5 flybys of Eve now, and still no science for returning a vessel from there, always \u00220 science for a vessel returned from orbit of the sun\u0022 Maybe this situation isn\u0027t implemented yet?
