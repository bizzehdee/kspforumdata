With more complicated missions of several dockable sub-units, that fraction can easily balloon to 15%, with RCS being the main culprit. And yes, it matters whether a vessel has 180 parts or 200.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible that probe cores could have significant battery capacity, or that every solar panel and RTG also includes a small battery? One doesn\u0027t need much, but most core\u0027s capacity is just too damn little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe cores should have torque according to their size and weight. The bigger ones leave much to be desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery probe core should also include a monoprop tank. Even if empty by default, just having it available would help a good deal (not only with part count -- even the smallest tanks in the game are quite heavy and have tremendous capacity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf the RCS thruster block had a fifth nozzle pointing straight out, I could often do with half as many.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wonder if some automatic welding would be an option, like fusing batteries and maybe even reaction wheels to the part they\u0027re attached to. This might even reduce the need for struts. Then again, there\u0027s not many parts where welding would even be possible: static solar panels each need their individual sense of direction and occlusion, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T16:08:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA sort of stock welding mod...

Sturdier connections would require fewer struts. But both of that has been discussed to death already. I\u0027m going after something different: pick up any non-trivial vessel and count the parts. Make a tally of how many of them are struts, and how many are these odd tiny pieces, that are often weight- and physicsless, yet increase the part count just the same. You\u0027ll be amazed at how much batteries and RCS thrusters contribute to part count. Not as bad as struts, granted, but bad enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pellinor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pellinor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAutomated welding already exists with the physicsSignificance flag.

There are many mods that add 5-nozzle RCS blocks. For the most stock-styled, look to RLA stockalike. Better probe cores? If size is not an issue, there\u0027s some really good large probe cores in Nertea\u0027s Station Parts Expansion. Also, someone updated Ubiozur\u0027s welding mod and it works like a charm.
