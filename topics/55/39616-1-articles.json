Typically when docking you point everything in the north-south direction, because that\u0027s orbit normal and anti-normal (so it doesn\u0027t change throughout your orbit, whereas the radial/anti-radial and prograde/retrograde directions rotate as you move through your orbit). The problem is, there\u0027s no clear indication on the navball of the normal direction except in equatorial orbits (and to a slightly more limited extent in polar orbits as well). In an equatorial orbit, pointing north along the horizon on the navball is orbit normal. If you\u0027re in an inclined orbit, there is no one reference spot on the navball for orbit normal, you kind of have to guess by watching very closely for when the prograde and retrograde markers switch sides (this can be tricky because they\u0027re mostly hidden by the edges of the navball). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you can\u0027t simply aim 30 degrees east of north if you\u0027re in an orbit that\u0027s inclined 30 degrees from equatorial. There\u0027s exactly two spots in your orbit where orbit \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1normal will be 30 degrees from north and that\u0027s at the ascending and descending nodes and at one node you\u0027ll be pointing east of north and the other will have you pointing west of north. In between those points your normal direction will swing through north or south. I mentioned polar orbits earlier and that\u0027s because they\u0027re a somewhat degenerate case here. Their reference direction flips from east to west and vice versa each time you cross a pole, so orientation is workable there, but it gets wonky at the poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been trying to avoid external views and use mostly IVA for approach and docking, and I think I\u0027ll get it eventually (I\u0027m sticking to equatorial orbits at the moment tho).

If I have to line my docking ports up with orbit normal (which as I pointed out above is not always trivial to find), then there\u0027s 3 different orientations I have to put the station in to attach the various pieces.

And, the typical docking procedure would be to first line up the direction you\u0027re pointing with the orientation marker, so most of the time it\u0027s not something you really have to pay attention to. But putting that aside I\u0027m reminded of previous suggestions to have the navball horizon align itself with the target docking port. I feel that\u0027s a bit confusing (and I would argue that it might even be an easy thing to miss), but it does avoid the \u00223 things\u0022 complaint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with using a marker on the edge is that it\u0027s only capable of displaying one rotational degree of freedom and, in order to dock, you need at minimum two rotational degrees of freedom to line up with the docking port axis; 3 would be nice so we could get the roll stuff lined up as well, but strictly speaking it\u0027s not necessary to do that to dock successfully (and it\u0027s also not what we\u0027re talking about). A marker at the edge would be fine for doing the roll orientation, but you don\u0027t \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E that to dock. You do \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E to line up with the docking axis, which is where the whole orbit normal thing comes from: it\u0027s a convenient axis that\u0027s invariant throughout the orbit, so rather than actually aligning the spacecraft with one another, we actually align them with some other axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, aligning things with orbit normal also requires that you be able to control the target vessel and, while that\u0027s usually the case, I think it\u0027s an unnecessary limitation.

Not so sure about the moving dot however, really nice idea but I am afraid that it will be hard to properly align the dot to the centre of the ring. Our eyes could misjudge centrality and that would be enough to miss the docking port. I would suggest the Purple ring to have a small dot in the centre while Par\u002B indicator would be a bigger purple dot.

The actual navball icons right now are quite large and cartoonish, fits the style of the game very well but they do take up somewhat more space than they need to and their thickness is what makes things look a bit cluttered. I also play DCS (flight sim) and the amount of information and iconography packed into an equally small space is much much higher. So it\u0027s not the overall amount of information that is the problem, it\u0027s just that the icons need to be cleaned up slightly, made a bit sharper, so you can more easily use them when they are overlayed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, if by \u0022miss centrality\u0022 you mean it would be difficult to judge where the centre of the purple circle is... that\u0027s no different from now. Right now you have to align your nose (a dot) in the velocity vector (a ring) as part of the process. That\u0027s partly why I suggested aligning the rings (velocity vector to target ring)... easy to tell when those are over each other, and similarly with the two dots.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-29T17:52:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2013 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"filami","CreatedById":60217,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T18:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, you got a good point there.

This is exactly the concept, and I apologize for any confusion. Yes, one can point your heading directly towards the other docking node, but that is no guarantee of the two being parallel (coaxial, etc, etc), and this is an issue that comes into play very much when maneuvering bulky craft -- even in general, a trivial craft needs to be fairly well aligned to dock easily. While the quoted implementation might not be ideal, it\u0027s a step in the right direction, I think.

And I think the problem can be solved without really crowding up the nav ball with any more iconography. We can just extend the functionality of the existing navball icons slightly, by making the centre dot of the target reticle represent a position arbitrarily far behind the target docking point along the docking point normal, like so:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/20pyDP0.png\u0022 alt=\u002220pyDP0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this iconography, if you align the \u0022ring\u0022 icons (target and velocity vector) and also align the \u0022dot\u0022 icons (target rear normal and craft nose) then you will hit the target with the docking ports properly aligned.
