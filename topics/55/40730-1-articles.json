Kethane and electricity are also universal resources. The way these are coded means they draw from all sources evenly. I agree, this way is not the most convenient and bottom up would be better but unfortunately, there isn\u0027t much you can do because of the nature of how the game handles different resource types.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T23:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of mono propellant as a tank of compressed gas (which is pretty much what it is).

I mean, if we\u0027re going to be able to fill tanks with whatever fuel we like in whatever proportions we like, I would expect them all to flow the same way.

Even better would be a system that allowed the user to choose from say three options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Even draw from all tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.
