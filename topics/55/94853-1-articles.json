They can use so much waist and grow food and use water. Then devices could recycle water and space stations and habitalbe objects could be designed for long term space travel! some deluxe very expensive or very big items could have everything at some efficiency. But smaller objects could be made for lots of customization and for the added challenges of oxygen/food/waste needs if added to the game. And making a colony ship and deep space ship could be fun. They would be needed enough for long trips out to planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-29T06:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-3%29-2014-12-27\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79588-0-90-USI-Kolonization-Systems-%28MKS-OKS%29-%280-22-3%29-2014-12-27\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
