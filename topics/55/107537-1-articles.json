I think I came up with an idea for a solution. We need 3 parts that fit the following description:\n\n1. Thin rings, similar to the [TR-XL Stack Separator](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TR-XL_Stack_Separator).\n\n2. Have attachment nodes on top and bottom.\n\n3. Completely structural, no staging actions.\n\n4. Completely hollow, we want to be able to pull things through them, unlike decouplers which have things in the way.\n\n5. Can have fairings \u0022closed\u0022 on them.\n\n6. One for each size fairing.\n\n8. Make sure we can attach struts to them, since you can\u0027t attach the first part of a strut to the fairing bases.\n\n7. Call it an \u0022Interstage Ring\u0022.\n\nThis will solve our problem of not being able to do [TD\u0026E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition,_docking,_and_extraction) maneuvers using the new fairings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T23:06:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:05:16Z","Content":"fairly clever workaround part, I like it."},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T23:08:07Z","Content":"This also gets my vote.

It then turned around and docked with the exposed LM and pulled it the rest of the way out.

I am suggesting a ring you have a whole fairing drawn out there. It shouldn\u0027t be that tall, not any taller than the fairing base and no angled side walls, you can do that with the fairing itself. This idea is NOT to make an engine fairing, it is to make an TD\u0026E fairing.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think that can be done if someone edits the way fairings work.\n\nNo, the fairings wouldn\u0027t have to be edited with this idea. You just place a fairing base at the bottom of your payload and the interstage ring at the top and draw your fairing from the base to the ring.\n\nSorry guys but you are over complicating the idea.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T19:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 07:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"}]}
