How about \u0022So... hi guys... Here\u0027s a screenshot - this is me landing on Duna... 104th time. Cause you know, I play it for over a year now...\u0022 Why won\u0027t they implement world SEED? If you want to use the standard one, use it; if you\u0027re bored with landing on same planets over and over - generate random. I BET there would be more discussions then. And sharing world seeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is still in development and I\u0027m already getting bored. Don\u0027t get me wrong - that\u0027s still the greatest game I\u0027ve ever played, but... That\u0027s not really a big difference if I land on Duna with some new recently added part. I\u0027ve already been there. I \u0022conquered\u0022 this world. They don\u0027t want to implement systems which will give you for example delta-v info, cause they want us to find it ourselves. Well, guess what... I DO know how much trust my ship should have to get to any planet or moon. Everyone can also find that info on the internet. Random planets would make a BIG difference here. They want \u0022trial and error\u0022, yet they want us to play in the same Solar system again and again... It seems like they can\u0027t make their minds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I\u0027m not up-to-date, but I can\u0027t find more info...

They will share screenshots and encourage people to do the same thing - sharing worlds and playing on best of these.
