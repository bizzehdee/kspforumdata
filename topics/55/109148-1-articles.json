Thing is he\u0027s in a retrograde orbit while the other rescue mission is in a prograde one. I still can do the mission but it\u0027ll take a separate ship... \n\nThis is why i\u0027m not accepting rescue missions around the sun.

They absolutely should be shown there.\n\nHaving said that, I don\u0027t see any problem in the scenario you describe, at least on normal difficulty. Rescuing someone from Mun orbit costs me about 25\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015330k, using the small pod on a 1.25m launcher with a probe core to get it out there. The taxi contracts pay at least 100\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153150k from the Mun, if memory serves (I\u0027ve not had one for a while). Seems just fine to me, doesn\u0027t require doubling up to make it viable or worthwhile. It\u0027s one of the more profitable contracts either singly or doubly. You can also try to add on a science survey contract or something, for yet more profit from single launch cost. I normally don\u0027t wait to double up with other contracts for Mun and Minimus, but will double up when the opportunity is at hand.\n\nOr, take some extra fuel and you can still do both in one trip, even with a 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination difference between the orbits. After picking the first up, raise Ap to something suitably high (but still inside Mun\u0027s SoI). Change orbit at Ap for fairly low cost.\n\nI.e. what you describe is no big deal in the first place.\n\nN.B. You can also accept the contract, look at the orbit, then cancel it without the failure penalty (you just have to repay the advance)."},{"CreatedByName":"Cocox","CreatedById":108646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T09:43:37Z","Content":"Also, dunno about you guys but for me all stranded astronauts are female. \n\nI know that sometimes women have trouble with orientation (probably no more or less than men), but for example, my wife never got disoriented so badly that she called for help from orbit.."},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T10:27:02Z","Content":"Hehe, I got only males ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat said though - I rarely do more than 1 rescue mission per playthrough.

In every other case, no big deal, as long as you do check the orbits before launching. It does beg the question of how the hell they got into a retro-orbit around the sun in the first place?!? Just how many boosters did Jeb sell them?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know.

Right now, I might earn 100k from a rescue mission, but the net benefit is over 500k, and growing larger as your operation expands. Once I\u0027ve got about 7 new recruits rescued, I send them on a group tour of Mun and Minimus, to skill them up."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:42:56Z","Content":"With hiring costs, rescue contracts are pretty powerful.\n\nI\u0027m trying to save up enough to do the last upgrade of the R\u0026D building and my main activity (that I tailor which contracts I accept around) is building science stations and collecting science in and around Kerbin/Mun/Minmus. The problem is a fully operations science station requires three scientists, two to operate the lab and one to biome hop and collect experiments. So I need lots of scientists (and luckily, I\u0027ve rescued mostly scientists (and mostly female)).\n\nSo given how valuable scientists are to me right now, even though I\u0027d LOVE to see the orbit before I accept a contract, it feels balanced to me. Now, rescuing someone in retrograde around the sun, or really in any non-Kerbin like orbit around the sun would KILL me. I wouldn\u0027t want to waste that much money on a rocket if I could even build something sufficient. And I would hate to accept the contract and then abandon the poor dear. But that\u0027s just me.\n\nSo, given my particular play style, they feel balanced. But it is surprising that you\u0027re not given more information about the orbit. The information \\*feels\\* missing. It wouldn\u0027t have to be specific, even if it said something like High/Low orbit, Inclined, Eccentric, whatever."},{"CreatedByName":"moronwrocket","CreatedById":134908,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:50:47Z","Content":"Just send up a Mun lander: Pick up kerbal 1, land, liftoff, pick up kerbal 2, journey home. \n\nBeen doing this for my rescue contracts - send a pilot from KSC if they need the XP, vacuum up one or two in LKO, get whoever is in Mun/Minmus orbit, head home."}]}
