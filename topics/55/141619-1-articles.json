The progression, tho, I agree, it\u0027s completely ridiculous. I started a new savegame on career hard plus some tweaks (KCT \u002B USI-LS mostly) and I\u0027m getting bored by the grind, and just looking at what I have to unlock to actually get to what I want, which feels totally unrelated to the other parts, doesn\u0027t help. There are some better techtrees out there, but unfortunately for me most of them focus too much on mod parts and leave too many empty spaces on a mostly stock install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T17:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was hoping for something even more complex, which involved going through the nonsense that NASA has to deal with (politics).
