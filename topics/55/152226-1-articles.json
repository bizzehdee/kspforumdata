Witch is certainly a handy thing, but is just not enough when it comes to big builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCause when you do big builds (big lifters, super detailed replicas, naval vessels, etc.), the chance of your game crashing mid build is quite high. Also the chance of your craft file getting corrupted is there, causing you to klick the save button every now and then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you think that will eliminate the problem, well...it doesn\u0027t. What iv\u0027e noticed is, is that once everything gets laggy enough in the editor, all the buttons like save, launch etc become inoperable. So sometimes, when you klick the save button, it wont really do anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake for example, my KN-225 project. While building it, my game crashed 20-30 times, and because of this my craft file got corrupted 2 times, causing me to have to rebuild huge chunks of the plane just to get where i was before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ED7SZ4b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ED7SZ4b.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there is today\u0027s project, a Kerbal scaled replica of the SMS K\u00F6nigsberg (1927 one). My game crashed mid build and also corrupted the craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zysFMog.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022564\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zysFMog.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had gotten way further into the project than what is shown in this pick of the corrupted craft (most of the superstructure, all the funnels, torptubes, main mast).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the KN-225 i was at least able to save the cockpit and most of the mid fuselage from the corrupted craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut with this one, nada, nothing is salvageable, meaning i have to start all over \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;.;\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea, sure, i can use this as an opportunity to fix and improve some bits i got wrong while i was building it\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (in this case i had to extend the hull mid build).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it\u0027s not that nice knowing that i have to remember that how i even built it in the first place \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis i why i would like to see an improved autosave feature that would be able to save the craft mid build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically make it so, that you could go into the options menu and set the time between each save. Like for example every 5 minutes or so it would make an autosave of it that would be it\u0027s own separate craft. So even if the craft itself got corrupted, you would still have the autosave of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s pretty rare for this to happen anyway \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. (Since this is only the second time in my 1800 hours of KSP that my craft has gotten corrupted).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it would still be nice to not have to worry about these kinds of things every time i build something big. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-19T04:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is because of the lack of this feature that I have taken to making multiple saves of my crafts (especially my replicas) every time I add a section to them.
