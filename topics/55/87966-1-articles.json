But as it has 4 attachment points, it could be made to allow 4x symmetry. It simply needs its own unique rule defined to allow that and to place the 4 objects properly on the 4 nodes it has. This would save a lot of time and effort building radially-symmetrical objects with the hub at the center, not only in initial mounting but further in design as the objects attached to the nodes had more objects attached to them, radiating outward, or when applying struts to the object. The Not-Rockomax Micronode perhaps could also use the same treatment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T10:44:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also want this.
