They\u0027re called \u0022radio buttons\u0022 after the old car radio preset buttons where when you pushed in one to change to the station it\u0027s set to, any other button that was pushed in pops out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheckboxes are square or square-ish and use either an X or check-mark to denote they\u0027ve been selected, and any or all of them in a group may be selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, some programmers have at various times figured out how to use radio buttons like check boxes and check boxes like radio buttons, either by hacking the programming environment they\u0027re using, or simply ignoring the instructions, or by using custom graphics to subvert the design convention that *everyone knows how to use*. Even worse is when a program makes no visual distinction between radio buttons and checkboxes, or uses a singular radio button which when selected cannot be *unselected* except by exiting or canceling the dialog box. If there\u0027s only *one* on/off choice use a checkbox. The Ascent Path Editor is using a checkbox, though graphically distorted into a sort of mashup of a checkbox and radio button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy go to so much extra effort to confuse people about how the user interface for your software works? The base concept of the GUI was to have *common* functions across various programs look and function the same, the goal being to make it easier to learn multiple programs because once a user learns the UI functions, those things are already known for any new program. Unless the program authors think they have a \u0027better way\u0027 and decide to not follow the convention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn excellent resource on UI design is this older copy of Apple\u0027s Human Interface Guidelines (from before they decided to toss it all with the horrible UI of Quicktime, followed by other screwups in early OS X versions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://interface.free.fr/Archives/Apple_HIGuidelines.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://interface.free.fr/Archives/Apple_HIGuidelines.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother common problem in KSP is buttons that toggle a state yet do not indicate the state. One example is Control From Here. Click that all you want, you get *no indication* that it has actually done anything - unless the orientation of the control part you have changed to is different from the one changed from AND if you have the navball visible. The navball rotation will change. What should happen is the Control From Here buttons should toggle, staying depressed on the part that has control - or an indicator next to the button should appear.

Thank you for posting that very interesting Apple Guidelines article, I have saved that PDF to my PC for future reading. Very interesting read on user interfaces. It looks dated but still practical for today. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I happen to be a Unity developer myself, well used to be anyway. At the time KSP came out, I may be mistaken, but the early versions of Unity did not have many \u0022assets\u0022 available for creating simple user interfaces, eg. checkboxes, radio buttons, and etc. These features were added on later as assets. If I\u0027m not mistaken, they significantly improved that area over the years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, speaking as someone who has done tons of game programming in the past, creating UI\u0027s for video games is VERY complicated. At the core, you want to make a fun and exciting video game and make the gameplay most important. Often times when doing that, it is easy to skip or overlook the UI. In KSP\u0027s case, I feel this is probably what happened. They focused on gameplay more than interface, which is a good thing. The game does have a rather clunky interface and is difficult to understand for newcomers. M\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking UI features is complicated and time consuming, especially things like buttons. You have to literally program every aspect of it, the up and hover positions, a click position when clicked if wanted, attach sound effects, and then even have it scale appropriately when the screen is different sizes. They are a HUGE pain in the rear end to do correctly. One of the hardest things to create are health bars. Health bars are the absolute hardest to program. Resizing sprites/textures as health goes down. Personally I think one of the video games that has the best UI\u0027s out there is Diablo III. Yes, a commercial game, but I hugely compliment blizzard on the interface of that game. It is one of the best ever created IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T05:18:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat Apple document predates OS X, it also predates Quicktime 4, which heralded Apple\u0027s abandonment of much of the standard conventions and ease of use conventions they played a major part in defining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used and worked on and fixed computers since 1983, so I\u0027ve experienced the full range from command line to various ANSI and graphical shells and the various Windows and Mac versions plus some others.

The operating system GUI should provide just about every common dialog box (that\u0027s why they\u0027re called common) any program will require - yet programmers persist in coding as if they\u0027re writing a DOS program that had to do *everything* with its own code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, some of the worst at not using the built in stuff provided to make creating a program easier are Microsoft and Apple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the \u0022Modern\u0022 Start Screen in Windows 8.x and the UI of current Windows Phone, it\u0027s a throwback to Windows 1.0. What\u0027s so similar? They both have non-overlapping tiles with active content. Win 8 has higher resolution and can display more colors and more tiles, but the overall UI has reverted to the square corners, flat and saturated colors and zero \u00223D\u0022 effect of Windows 1.0 through 3.0. The adverts for Windows phone show tiles with a heavy use of Cyan, White, Magenta and Black - the exact colors as the default palette of a CGA video card. Rotate a WinPhone 90 degrees clockwise so the bar up the right side is along the bottom and it\u0027s even more like Windows 1.0 with its command line across the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only piece of design style not harking back to Win 1.0 are the square cornered buttons. Win 1.0 had round cornered buttons and a heavy outline line indicating which button Enter would activate - almost a pixel perfect copy from Macintosh. After the lawsuit, Windows had no round corners anywhere and the indicator line became a thin dotted one. We\u0027ve come a long way for Microsoft to copy the style of a GUI they made 30 years ago, that failed to set the computing world on fire. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how hard it\u0027d be to create a GUI for Windows 1.0 mimicking the style of Win 8.x\u0027s Modern screen, and have it run in a virtual machine with the ability to run in higher resolution with more colors?
