The purpose of this thread is not to bring the bug to the devs\u0026#39; attention (I\u0026#39;m fairly certain it\u0026#39;s already known), or to advocate that it be fixed more quickly, it is simply to suggest a possible workaround should a fix be technically unfeasible (assuming that the workaround isn\u0026#39;t unfeasible for the same reasons as the fix) or lower priority than other bugfixes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy idea is basically to add a button on some options screen, or maybe a keybinding, that causes the game to reinitialize its joystick code. Assuming that the user has centered all axes, this would then cause the joystick to behave correctly without necessitating a full restart (the caveat being that if the reinitialization button were pressed with the joystick off-center, it would then cause the joystick to misbehave).\n"}]}
