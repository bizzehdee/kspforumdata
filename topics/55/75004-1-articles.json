Contracts are already implemented, actually, and I suspect budget is too by this point (i.e. basic implementation down, subject to change). I\u0027m assuming, then, that this is a suggestion for a \u003Cem\u003Especific\u003C/em\u003E budget/contract system. With that, some points to keep in mind:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* First, a budgetary system can require \u003Cem\u003Eheavy\u003C/em\u003E tweaking. Every single thing incentivizes some playstyles over others. It\u0027s not always clear what effects they\u0027ll have, so they \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E tweaking after the fact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Second, because this requires experimentation, Squad isn\u0027t likely to (and shouldn\u0027t) just take numbers from anywhere for it. My point is, you should explain \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E you came up with the numbers you did; just saying \u0022this is how much money you get for doing thing Y\u0022 isn\u0027t very useful, but saying \u0022The budgetary system should encourage players to do X by providing Y contract\u0022 \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E potentially useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system you propose seem seriously flawed. First, it makes interplanetary missions effectively impossible in career, and makes \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E impossible for people who like to play a whole mission through at once (instead of switching between many missions at a time). If you want to run a whole mission at once, tough luck - the timewarping to get even to the Mun will kill a bunch of science output. Interplanetary? You literally won\u0027t be able to get to Eeloo if you launch the day 0.24 is released and want to arrive before 0.25, and waiting for launch windows means you\u0027ll get at most a couple interplanetary missions off in that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: Recovery of parts as parts means that past a certain point, money becomes far less relevant. A player who builds an SSTO spaceplane never even has to *look* at a budget again; all the budget constrains is fuel costs ($5/unit, which is kinda low) and simultaneous missions. Since the no-timewarp-if-you-want-to-get-anything means you have to run simultaneous missions, that means you have two features fighting each other, one requiring multitasking and the other setting a hard cap on it. Even then, all you have to do is have a massively overbuilt SSTO, use a cheap high-ISP engine and the very cheap fuel, and deploy the upper stage from the SSTO. Boom, lifter budgets cease to matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: The contracts you propose are \u0022Do X, earn Y\u0022 in perpetuity. There\u0027s no variation; it\u0027s not really much deeper than \u0022Press X for money\u0022. This is a problem any proposed contract system has to deal with; one way Squad\u0027s doing it, for instance, is experimental parts. There, accepting a contract gives you a part you haven\u0027t unlocked yet that you\u0027re supposed to test; even if the actual test is \u0022Do X in Y orbit around Z\u0022, you have a serious choice: you can use the experimental part in other craft, but have to recover it if you want to do so, as losing all of your finite supply will make you fail the contract; the question then is \u0022Do I feel comfortable risking the part in this unrelated mission, or should I save it?\u0022 and \u0022Hm, when should I actually do the contract, after which I\u0027ll lose access to the part?\u0022 Those contracts are interesting because they introduce choices for the player. \u0022Put payload X in orbit Y\u0022 doesn\u0027t, really - the player might pick his launch infrastructure, but there\u0027s no meaningful difference between any 2 such contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mstrfalco","CreatedById":73805,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T17:30:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with cpast.
