Maybe the original guys from Squad weren\u0027t the best net coders.

It would be great to coop things like that without having to hop on each other\u0027s computers or transfer save files. Another thing: having a space race thing, but then go on to do missions that require partnerships with each other. Say one of us focused on certain areas of the tech tree and the other focused on another area. We could to coop missions that we couldn\u0027t do alone, and both get SCIENCE from them. Finally, things like using the same stations as staging points for missions, having to buy fuel from your competitor\u0027s station to get back home, paying them to launch a spacecraft on a rocket that\u0027s more efficient than your own launcher. That would be pretty cool. I don\u0027t know how it work from a code standpoint, especially with more than two or three players, but I\u0027d love to try it.
