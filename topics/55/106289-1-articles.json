The visual model matches its old purpose, which was a small pack of electronics, under the long gone old SAS system. You can see the small bulge which would be the processor pack. The model wasn\u0027t updated to reflect the new contents of large, heavy, spinning wheels (which would require lots of supporting structure, to transmit the torque, even if they didn\u0027t take up most of the space, leaving none for filling it with random stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to cheat by clipping something into something that wouldn\u0027t be possible in reality, then yeah, putting stuff inside the 2.5m torque module is cheating. Other than something like contests, where it would be up to the contest judges to decide, it\u0027s 100% down to you individually to choose to cheat or not to cheat. There\u0027s absolutely nothing wrong with cheating in a non-competitive, offline, single player game; as long as you are actually honest with yourself, as it\u0027s just silly (and arguably damaging to your long term mental state) to cheat and deny it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
