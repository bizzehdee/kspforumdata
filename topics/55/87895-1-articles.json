Switch symmetry mode to 2, put radial RCS tanks on a rocket body. Change symmetry to 4, put RCS thrutsers on the rocket. Pick the RCS tanks to re-locate them. Their symmetry mode becomes 4, you change it to 2, place them. Pick RCS thrusters and move them. Symmetry mode was 2, and if you forget this, you\u0027ll put only 2 RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a constant annoyance in the editor that you have to switch symmetry mode or sometimes forget and place 1 asymmetric part or what\u0027s worse, relocate a fuel duct in asparagus, without noticing that symmetry changed, and you placed it only on one side. The deffect then is discoverable only 1-2 minutes into the flight when the rocket goes out of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this can be fixed in 0.26.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T15:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice suggestion, and something I never thought of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t count the number of times I\u0027ve gotten to my destination and found I only have 2 landing legs, or during launch I find my rocket\u0027s off center due to only having one goo container.
