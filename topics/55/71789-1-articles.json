That\u0027s not the problem. The problem is that the Unity API is not thread-safe. That means a single task cannot be splitted across multiple cores, but multiple cores can be used to accomplish multiple different tasks. Namely, physics calculations, are by far, the biggest thread, and it\u0027s big enough to clog up a full core on it\u0027s own.
