Instead of a historically accurate time-line for scientific equipment, they\u0027ve gone for a structure more similar to the time line in which the parts were added to the game. Personally, I do not like this decision very much, but I am in no way demanding them to change it. At the very least, I would like the order in which the tech tree items appear to be easily mod-able so that people can change it to better suit their own style of game play]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter watching different people play through update 0.22 during the livestream marathon, there have been some parts of the tech tree (as well as the science gathering mechanic) that I would like to see tweaking of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-For the initial starting items, players should not have access to liquid fueled rockets or tanks. Instead, they should start with all the solid rocket sizes (including sepatrons), as well as vertical decouplers (Not having decouplers doesn\u0027t really add much challenge, instead it just requires you to start your burns right before the previous stage runs out of fuel, which is something that a new player might get confused with), and all of the structural parts. It\u0027s rather silly that Kerbals can\u0027t put bits of metal on their spacecraft, even though they\u0027ve already built huge buildings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main point for this is, instead of the wonky looking rockets I\u0027ve seen people start with so far, I would like to be able to start off with a rocket similar to EJ_SA\u0027s LADEE recreation, which uses the structural panels as fairings, and sold rockets/sepatrons for propellant. A rocket like this better resembles the missile-like launch stages of the 60s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry I couldn\u0027t get an image of this, but all of the recordings of his rocket on twitch TV were erased from the twitch database.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I agree with the decision to have players start with manned missions, but unmanned probes should come much earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rover wheels should also come earlier, I would like to be able to make a Duna rover after doing a Mun landing and return. It\u0027s pretty ridiculous that these come an entire tier after NERVAs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Airplane parts should earlier in the tech tree, and also come mostly at once. (except for maybe the better turbojet engine and the advanced intake)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, you should be able to do science in sandbox mode. Even though it wouldn\u0027t matter, it would still be cool to see the messages and see how much science you can store up over time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
