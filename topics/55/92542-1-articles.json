It\u0027s not rly ruining anything. To me it\u0027s more about how the gameplay is kinda devided into the planing/testing process and the actual mission. I prefer the given info in flight to be minimalistic, whileI like to have as much data as possible during the design process. Maybe it\u0027s more of a personal preference, but once I leave LKO it\u0027s just an \u0022all in\u0022 situatuion to me and I like the to be reminded that it\u0027s hard to predict anything. It\u0027s fun to fail once in a while and to not get a solution for a mistake during the design process that easily. It keeps the feeling of being in space and thus being far away from any help or theoretical solution. I have to improvise and use the little info and ressources on site or accept failure.
