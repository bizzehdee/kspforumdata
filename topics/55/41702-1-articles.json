I would be nice if the game had an option for two different setups and allowed you to switch between them with a button press depending on what type of craft your kerbin was currently piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue i run into is that the most joysticks allow for a rotation movement which is perfect for rotating/spin rockets and the other two axis would be to lean rocket forward/back and left/right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut when i switch to a plane the rotate is the same as banking left and right. which doesnt make sense to do it that way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
