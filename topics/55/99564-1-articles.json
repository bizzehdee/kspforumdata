This has the problem of editing the part for all ships using the part, however (unless you duplicate the part, but then you\u0027ve two copies of the same part...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some kind of integrated painting system, one could repaint the FL-T800 white, making it fit in better with the overall design - perhaps with the ability to save the new paintscheme for future use, or simply have it cover the one craft. Beyond making rockets look more coherent, I\u0027m sure someone out there just wants a space-station painted in all sorts of crazy colours, or to camouflage their fighter jets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see some problems with it, both in that some parts may not fit being repainted very well, and in that it may detract from the overall style of the game (where rockets are clearly assembled of differing parts, rather than looking entirely consistent on the outside.), but I\u0027m interested in what others think nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf going for realism, perhaps paint could induce a slight weight penalty.
