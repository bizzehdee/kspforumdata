Could you add something along those lines in the next update?

Actually, the thing I crashed was also a (untested in the water)\u00A0boat, but i crashed it into a large two seater rover (made to be transported by plane) (no, the boat was not nearly big enough to carry the rover, and anyways there was no cargo space at all in it) because i was messing around lol. the boat used a wheesley (so that it could move in reverse), seated 8 kerbals, and was strutted to hell,but fell to so many different parts i didnt bother counting. (the 2 kerbals i had put in some of the seats [i thought putting all 8 in would be too time consuming] survived. The rover stayed in mostly one piece but had only a few struts to keep the structural plates from flopping around.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003EHow does that work?(rhetorical)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
