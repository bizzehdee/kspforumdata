A quick close option from the pause menu wouldn\u0027t be unheard of, it exists in many other games. A quick close option from the space center view would also help those who are either playing in fullscreen mode or don\u0027t want to force close an application (any application, I just don\u0027t like doing it), or those who don\u0027t know that Alt \u002B F4 can be used to close the \u0022top window\u0022 (eg.

With a bit of optimization in the save function, this could easily be reduced by 10 or 15%. So, when you click the Exit Game button while in flight, the \u0022Please Wait...\u0022 status would just be the autosave function renamed to Please Wait. So it could say something like, \u0022Please wait while saving...\u0022. But basically, all the code is there. They just have to tie in the autosave to the exit button and have it close the application after it preforms the autosave. It would be very simple to code. The most complicated part about it is the added GUI element. They would likely have to redesign the pause menu to add an exit game button.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T21:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by leptoon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T13:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the real incentive behind this request is an annoyance at the fact that each menu screen takes time to load up, and therefore backing out properly through the menus takes a bit of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are in an active vessel, and want to quit without losing your progress, you currently do it through the following menu path:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEsc -\u0026gt; pick \u0022space center\u0022 (___wait for space center to load___) -\u0026gt; pick exit button from space center (___wait for start campaign menu to load___) -\u0026gt; pick \u0022back\u0022 -\u0026gt; (__wait for animation to slide over to the main menu__) -\u0026gt; pick \u0022quit\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly suspect that it\u0027s those wait times that cause this request to show up from time to time in this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople aren\u0027t annoyed at having to back out through several menus to get out.
