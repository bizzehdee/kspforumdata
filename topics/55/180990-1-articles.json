Mods that\u00A0use interfaces that didn\u0027t change would still work. While the game version is changes arbitrarily and the only difference may by texture update or adding new parts, which has no impact on mods, it can disable mods the user has installed. A nightmare is that when a mod defines some parts, no ship containing these parts can even be loaded. They disappear in the game. If the interfaces were versioned, mods would still be loaded, parts displayed\u00A0ships could be edited and even fly - some part would cease function yet they still could be targets of a rescue missions - in worst case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-30T20:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou overestimate the community.
