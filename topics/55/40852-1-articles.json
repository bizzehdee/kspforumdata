Its absolutely perfect for this game. Then I discovered that all the music was created be Kevin MacLeod. Next I found Kevin\u0027s website and download a bunch of his other stuff.

I think a new kerbanot should be added to the astronaut complex named Kevin Kerman or MacLeod Kerman in tribute to this great musician.
