However, these parts, rather than follow a singular art design, follow a very diverse \u0022style\u0022. For example, the fuel tanks come in four sizes. There\u0027s the 0.65m tank, which has its own distinct texture style, while the 1.25m tanks look completely different. The 1.25m tanks look consistent with each other, but look completely different from the \u0022trashcan\u0022 look of the smaller of the 2.5m tanks, and also from the \u0022cryogenic\u0022 look of the Orange tank. And all of these tanks look entirely different from the new SLS parts, which have a very professional, \u0022NASA\u0022ish feel to them. Similarly, the small 0.65m engines have a completely different look from the larger 1.25m engines and the 2.5m engines, while the 3.75m engines look entirely different from either of these. The SAS parts look very different from each other, although their purpose is the same. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd not only do the parts differ in style, they also differ in quality. The parts introduced in the science updates appear more well modelled and textured than the older parts to me, for example. The older parts sometimes have blurrier textures, and models that don\u0027t quite match up to the quality of the newer parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you people like there to be a patch that cleans up the part list into a list with a consistent art style and quality, or do you think that the current design is good, and the developers should focus their attention on more important features like implementing economy in the career mode and such? Or do you have any other ideas/suggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T07:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould it be that the older parts were textured at a lower resolution, and just need to be updated?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T13:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t say it\u0027s such a big deal with the parts themselves, but more of a problem with the decouplers, adapters and especially the mainsail engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand different styles for different sizes of parts is a useful way to distinguish stuff in the VAB right now, in future though I think that the devs need to put the power to paint rockets differently into our hands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, each tank would have 4 styles (NASA, Original, Shiny and Matte), for texturing and in the two latter cases colour choices could be made which would affect the whole tank.
