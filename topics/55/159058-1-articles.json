They are pretty small to Alt-click\u00A0to copy them and it would be quite handy to have this essential part directly on hand, instead of having to click through the editor list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razorforce7","CreatedById":94677,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T10:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175019-lukaskerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022175019\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/175019-lukaskerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@LukasKerman\u003C/a\u003EEuhm, do know that since version 1.2 of ksp we got something like \u0022autostruts\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to activate the \u0022advanced tweakables\u0022 in the ksp game settings which allows this feature in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E by right clicking on a part.

If you put certain parts together the way they are supposed to go together, they should be auto-strutted based on this context.
