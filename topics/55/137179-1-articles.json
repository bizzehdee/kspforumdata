Quality issues are probably the No. 1 cause of death for software companies, including some famous gaming companies (e.g. Maxis). Of\u00A0course it is\u00A0extremely\u00A0difficult to judge this from the outside, but I think I see several indicators that the development process slowly got out of hand:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nsteadily increasing maintenance effort (growing QA, beta phases become longer and longer, most developers are primarily occupied with fixing bugs)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsteadily longer increment phases (apparently harder and harder to make changes to the game)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRegular major breaks (i.e. long phases necessary to stabilize a product that was stable before)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRegular big and time consuming refactorings (switching to Unity, multiple big overhauls of core game mechanics)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nsemi-reliable builds (multiple developer complaints about slow and brittle builds)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis all hints to rising technical debt, which makes developing and maintaining more and more frustrating, and at some point too expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what to do? Please find some help. Someone who really understands quality in agile development. Don\u0027t be one of these companies that keep telling themselves that everything is gonna be alright if you just keep working a little harder through the weekends. Because it won\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-17T22:32:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuality issues didn\u0027t kill Maxis, being purchased by EA killed Maxis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad is doing fine, I see no reason for concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-18T00:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222519248\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460932340\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuality issues didn\u0027t kill Maxis, being purchased by EA killed Maxis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad is doing fine, I see no reason for concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo so true EA do sports well but just never get any game that doesn\u0027t have the competitive nature of sports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just not in the DNA. look at the travesty they made of SimCity.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
