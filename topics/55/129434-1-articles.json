KSP does all of that, while potentially giving the option to take your uncomfortable VR mask off and work on your new ship behind your flatscreen. This unique feature to the game can create a balance between prolonged play-ability and being overwhelmed by your imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am no programmer, but lets assume that incorporating VR has huge programming issues.

I have to disagree with everyone who doesn\u0027t think this is an awesome idea. I have been wanting this since it has first been even hinted it way back. I think the modding community will get behind it once the new Oculus hits. There have already been people who have done it with the old ones, and head tracking is available from KerbTrack already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally though, the thing that will make it all fit together will be Oculus CV1 with the head tracking, and the Touch controllers. I imagine doing moon landings from the lander can, and leaning forward to see better out the window just how much farther the ground is. I imagine my hands being turned into Kerbal hands sitting in the cockpit, moving the throttle, actually reaching out to touch the buttons on my rasterprop monitors, flicking switches. Imagine being EVA in first person, and the Touch controllers are your RCS control. You could rotate your wrist to get your translation/rotation due to the constellation/accelerometer tracking.\u00A0 To me, that is what is going to give the immersion and make it worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be even possible to build your ship entirely in the new Rift using the Touch controllers. All of functions for accurate placement could be there. It would be nearly Ironman-esque. Reach out and place a part, spin it around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be so cool to not only design your own rocket, but then to get to really fly it and do the mission. It would completely enhance pure IVA flight. I think it would add a capability and depth to the game that can\u0027t be matched. Anyone who has ever played pure IVA nows how much of a pain it is to keep clicking around just to move the camera. Zoom in, check that screen, zoom out, move camera, zoom in check that gauge...etc. Instead just move your head, lean in to see closer, reach out and touch the button you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd there is no reason it should not be even MORE possible with 1.1 with Unity 5s direct support for VR. As I understand it, it can be as simple as a checkbox. The Touch integration would definately take some work. But I\u0027m sure its nothing this community can\u0027t handle. Kerbal stuff was down for less than 8 hours and new plans were being organized, and within 48 a new site up, and now its almost like nothing ever happened. So I can\u0027t agree that it won\u0027t happen or is a dumb idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarManta","CreatedById":57805,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T23:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStart thinking of (and suggesting) the prerequisites that would be needed for such a thing to be viable. Most significantly:\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EIVA Improvements out the wazoo\u003C/strong\u003E. KSP\u0027s IVA is nowhere near ready to be an exclusive gameplay mode. Yes, some Youtubers have done it, and we\u0027re so in awe of them \u003Cem\u003Eprecisely because KSP makes it so hard\u003C/em\u003E. (and every single one of those videos was done on a tried and true spacecraft and very simple, straightforward flight plan - never\u00A0one they\u0027re trying for the first time in that view, and never anything harder than landing on the Mun)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Most or all of the IVA views simply don\u0027t offer enough information in a readable way. A lack of map view is key. No fuel gauge\u00A0or staging views. No overheating status warnings. The navball doesn\u0027t show sufficient information either, if you can\u0027t augment it with the external view.\u00A0In short,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe need a lot of different ways to view information in IVA\u003C/strong\u003E. Basically we need little screens in the IVA that we can change to show whatever we need at any given time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- As a corollary to this,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe definitely, absolutely\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eneed external mountable cameras that can be viewed in the IVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- It would be very jarring, I would think, to have the IVA throttle in one position in VR but your actual throttle is in a different place (and having a hardware throttle/joystick is still going to be the best way to control this - those general-purpose 3D controllers aren\u0027t going to cut it for precision maneuvers.) So we need\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe ability to create our own IVA layout\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0to match our cockpit to what\u0027s on our desk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Many components\u00A0are impossible to control in certain scenarios without right-clicking on them in external view and choosing stuff from the menu.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EWe need to be able to control\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0things like science experiments, air intakes, fuel transfers, docking nodes, and so on from buttons in the cockpit.

Only drawback being no spring/active feedback. But you could really just put the one controller down and use the joystick for the maneuver. Maybe by putting down your right Touch controller it can detect that and your ingame hand moves to the ingame joystick in the cockpit. Little to no cognitive dissonance. The Touch controllers also have touch sensors on the pointer and thumb, make it so when touching them, \u0022joystick\u0022 controls are active.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that the map view is a special case.

Even node handling could be done with the Touch controllers. Imagine reaching out to tease your node bigger or smaller. Having a hard time seeing that anti-normal arm because radial is in the way?? don\u0027t click and drag to move the view, move your head. OR, instead of trying to click those stupid little symbols, just reach out into free space and click and pull the controllers and they can tell which one you are trying to modify by hand orientation.
