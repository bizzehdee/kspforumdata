The core of Jupiter is thought to have a rocky or icy core. Maybe Jool does have a rocky core, but the gas becomes too thick for a spacecraft to go through so it crashes at ASL of 0.

Now then when you compress hydrogen into a small enough space it creates \u0022liquid hydrogen\u0022 there are other ways of making liquid hydrogen but this is one way. also a \u0022rocky core\u0022 doesn\u0027t involve being made out of basalt or granite or any other type of rock when you say a \u0022rock\u0022 in scientific terms it can range from \u0022normal rock\u0022 to iron nickel ect.. now then gasses tend not to be very heavy even if there is a lot of it. it is very hard for it to come together. If there is too much it turns into a star if it isn\u0027t enough it turns into nothing and if its in between it turns into a brown dwarf. Modern theory suggests that a normal earth sized planet attracted or even stole some gas from its parent star. Accual calculations suggest that if there was only gas to begin with first of all Jupiter wouldn\u0027t be as big as it is and secondly it is very rare that high enough concentrations of gas were left around when the star was formed. This cant be a rare phenomena as there are 2 gas giants in our solar system and there are gas giants in every solar system(almost). my last proof is the materials in the clouds of jupiter there are much heavier elements in the clouds other then helium and hydrogen if it was made out of gas completely planet collision wouldnt have been possible thus the high amount of other resources in the clouds of jupiter would be impossible as a planet would just pass through it and leave very little resources\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-09T21:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2013 09:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by FEichinger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eremoved harassment\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T20:56:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, did I just start WW3?
