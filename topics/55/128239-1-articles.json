Take for example, the work of Porkjet. Some of his stuff is now stock, which is nice, fewer mods for me to worry about, but some other mods, say, Procedural Fairings by edog \u0026lt;or so it says on kerbalstuff.com\u0026gt; is not, and we have a \u0022procedural fairing\u0022 that, lets be fair here, isnt all that intuitive and creates some nasty confetti when used. Now, this is just my 2 cents here, I think Proc Fairings by edog should have been made stock instead of what happened, but, again, thats me. But, still, it begs the asking, why are some mods being made stock, yet others seem to get ignored? I know, it is what it is, but, its still a valid question I think.
