And it is one of few things I really have to go and edit every time a new release comes out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason is, while the current limit of 3 seems to be sufficient for most purposes, it becomes totally wrecking if you\u0027re planning a transfer burn and Mun, Ike, or Tylo appear in the way. The trajectory just ends at SOI boundary and you have no idea where you\u0027ll be flying after that. While in reality, getting a gravity kick off Ike or Tylo might be welcome reduction of dv necessary to make the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I have very good experience with value of 6 and that\u0027s what I suggest as the new default.

This has been vastly improved with 0.23.5 release though and trajectories are way more stable since then. Also each SOI crossing adds some numerical inaccuracy, as the resulting trajectory is affected by time warp level you use to pass the boundary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, even before the 0.23.5 vast improvement, more than 3 patches were needed to play the game seriously. Physics-induced inaccuracy is visible - you can see the trajectory is shaking after certain point. It\u0027s pointless to put maneuvers on that shaking end. But you can still see the general direction in which you are going, you can affect it by RCS bursts for negligible amounts of fuel and you can get rid of the inaccuracy with corrections as you get closer. While if you can\u0027t see where you\u0027re going at all, it\u0027s a disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T19:23:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes i\u0027d like to see this too, higher default and added to options is the way to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coccalime","CreatedById":29574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T19:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re totally right, i just think a small warning should be put next to the option if it is added to the settings menu, that way people wont just turn it up to 20 patches and complain that the trajectory was wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
