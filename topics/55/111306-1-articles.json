However, it\u0027d be even better if the game\u0027s memory leaks were fixed (ex: tweakables currently leak memory) and if the age-old clickthrough bug with various UIs (including the brand new overwrite popup we got in 1.0), though this seems like it should be fixed with the UI rewrite of the next update.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T20:09:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T21:04:28Z","Content":"Unhelpful thread has been closed."}]}
