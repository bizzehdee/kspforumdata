It is convenient currently for not blocking much of the view, but inconvenient for trying to do maneouvres as it is too small to see detail easily. I now dock almost entirely using the navball to line up markers and close on the target. I can dock quicker than any of the plugins do it, and waste less mono. But the hunching over to see the tiny ball and markers and the eye strain is a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"automcdonough","CreatedById":12249,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s in the options. you just can\u0027t do it during the mission. that would be nice though..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
