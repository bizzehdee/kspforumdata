(and it looks awsome, always a plus!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is just my two cents, i hope Squad might consider my proposal and i would like some imput from the community about their thoughts on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and if anyone knows a modmanager config to do this in the mean time that man/woman/kerbal would be my hero)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: fixed spelling and typo\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T08:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thahat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\u0026#039;s..\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T08:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, possible workaround here, use the offset tool to move the docking port up so it visually contacts the heat shield, so when the fairing vanishes it looks presentable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, the heat shield fairing will sort of hide the docking port a bit (while it\u0027s still there anyway) and the whole thing will look more compact and tidy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, possible workaround here, use the offset tool to move the docking port up so it visually contacts the heat shield, so when the fairing vanishes it looks presentable.\u003Cp\u003EAs a bonus, the heat shield fairing will sort of hide the docking port a bit (while it\u0027s still there anyway) and the whole thing will look more compact and tidy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou sir, are a genius, thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat are your thoughts on fixing this without clipping though?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: that trick also works nicely to hide decouplers inside fusalages and tanks, so you dont end up with those ugly studs all over your spaceplane..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T13:39:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thahat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
