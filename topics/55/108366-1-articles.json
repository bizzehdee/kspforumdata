(and it looks awsome, always a plus!)\n\nthis is just my two cents, i hope Squad might consider my proposal and i would like some imput from the community about their thoughts on this.\n\n(and if anyone knows a modmanager config to do this in the mean time that man/woman/kerbal would be my hero)\n\nEDIT: fixed spelling and typo\u0027s\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T08:12:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 08:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thahat**\n  \ntypo\u0027s.."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T08:41:39Z","Content":"Okay, possible workaround here, use the offset tool to move the docking port up so it visually contacts the heat shield, so when the fairing vanishes it looks presentable.\n\nAs a bonus, the heat shield fairing will sort of hide the docking port a bit (while it\u0027s still there anyway) and the whole thing will look more compact and tidy."},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:20:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, possible workaround here, use the offset tool to move the docking port up so it visually contacts the heat shield, so when the fairing vanishes it looks presentable.\n\u003E As a bonus, the heat shield fairing will sort of hide the docking port a bit (while it\u0027s still there anyway) and the whole thing will look more compact and tidy.\n\nyou sir, are a genius, thank you.\n\nwhat are your thoughts on fixing this without clipping though?\n\nEDIT: that trick also works nicely to hide decouplers inside fusalages and tanks, so you dont end up with those ugly studs all over your spaceplane..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T13:39:00Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thahat**"}]}
