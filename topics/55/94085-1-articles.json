Career is finally challenging for me and the upgradable buildings are a step in the right direction. It was mentioned that the devs were working on changing the tiers a bit, and I want to give them a few suggestions from my experience so far in .90. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOverall:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: When one scrolls over a building\u0027s upgrade button, give them a preview of what it will look like upgraded a tier, this could be useful if the size of the runway changes based on tier (read runway suggestion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Be able to skip tiers on buildings and make it *slightly* cheaper to upgrade. For me at least, this would be useful for the admin building or hangar, both of which there isn\u0027t much point to upgrading early game. This might also affect the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: To make more use of the spaceplane hangar and runway, perhaps add plane-only contracts requiring to stay in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts in General:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: make station and outpost missions have longer \u0022maintain\u0022 times, perhaps more than a couple days. Though gameplay-wise there wouldn\u0027t be much difference (timewarp!) it would make more sense to give time for the kerbals to \u0022Run Experiments\u0022 or do the mission (Eat snacks). The hindrance to this would be calculating station keeping in case the user switched to another craft, depending how the code is setup now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Add speed record contracts. Not necessarily space program related, but it would be neat to get a contract to get fast land-speed or water speed goals (or in-atmo speed). This is reasonable because Kerbals associate rockets with speed and would want to make things go fast and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Make a \u0022return surface sample from\u0022 contract that relies on biomes. This would encourage accurate landings and also not require science experiments to drag along. Another benefit of this is that one could have contracts to collect surface samples on kerbin, encouraging runway and sph use. NOTE: I\u0027m not sure, this may be implemented already and I haven\u0027t come across one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHangar:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: The Hangar is nearly useless for the first few hours of gameplay, and only becomes truly useful once Survey missions start popping-up, likewise for the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Solution: As soon as tech-tree unlocks plane parts, start offering kerbin survey missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERunway:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: The base tier is too bumpy to be useful, I end up taxiing off into the very much smoother grass beside the runway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Solution: Make the first tier runway a shaded grass area (many small airports have grass runways), fairly smooth, with a couple bumps (kind of like the tier 2 except grass). Tier 2 could then be upgraded to and be completely flat, albeit short and narrow compared to tier 3. If tiers are added (the Barn tier anyone?) a grass runway would be a good fit, followed by the dirt which needs to be less bumpy, but can be short/narrow compared to tier 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELaunchpad:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Make it easier/harder to destroy based on tier (tier 1 is dirt so it\u0027s hard to destroy, tier 2 should be more fragile?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: Too small a limit on weight on Tier 1, it was upgraded after 1st contract completed. I\u0027d like to play more with the dirt tier because it looks awesome too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Solution: Make it Barn tier level\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVAB:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Add more tiers, each tier having a bigger/better building which can support a taller rocket based on door size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdmin Building:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Make strategies reap better rewards as tier increases, starting at semi-crappy exchange rates at tier 1. This makes sense because at lower tiers, a company (or space program) has less staff and less prestige in the industry, as they get better buildings they can hire more people and have presumably done impressive things, leading to better bargaining power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: Once a strategy is set, it\u0027s commitment level cannot be changed without un-selecting the strategy and re-selecting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Solution: Make strategy commitment level variable while you\u0027re already committed to the strategy, with an \u0022Apply\u0022 button or something to confirm the change. Also have a setup cost for change in commitment level, you could charge based on % changed, regardless of less or more commitment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAstronaut Complex:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Train Kerbals based on vocation, not as XP giving as experience and costs money, but you could grind out some top tier guys with enough $ and time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Cross-Training could occur with a \u0022training\u0022 system. Kerbals could never exceed 1/3? the experience of anything besides their main specialty (i.e. Pilot could be 5 star pilot, 2 star scientist and engineer). This makes sense because real people can learn things beyond their primary vocation, but excel in what they specialize in (WAIT, THIS ISN\u0027T A SIMULATOR?!?!!? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: Doing the same thing multiple times with a kerbal does not increase experience. For example if I launch a kerbal and have them navigate to the mun then return, and send them again, they would definitely still learn from the second trip, albeit not as much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Solution: SOI changes and landings (even orbits?) could be logged each time the kerbal returns home and contribute logarithmically, to avoid exploits like flying in and out of an soi just for experience (scaling each time, not necessarily logarithmic).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem: All Kerbals level based solely on where they have been (ok, flag planting is a bit different).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Have Kerbals level based on vocation. Pilots level by flying missions, engineers from repairing parts, scientists from gathering and analyzing science. For engineers, they could start out being able to do most of the things at the base level, with a chance of permanently breaking the part (a new part state would need to be added) or fixing it, depending on how high level they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Have more limited/complicated contracts available based on tier. Tier 1 could be only plant flags, test parts, achieve records and do surveys (crew/eva reports). Tier 2 could add orbital bases, satellite contracts and complex science surveys. Tier 3 could add surface bases, asteroid grabs and more complicated things. The reasoning behind this is that you can conduct larger/more complex missions with a larger staff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETracking Station:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Add more tiers. Tier could limit how many soi changes ahead you can see, maybe add a limit to tracking range based on raw distance for non-radio equipped craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Building:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: Add more tiers. Make contracts that are required to get specific science nodes, like space testing contracts for engines, drain testing tanks, living in habitable modules for a couple days etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, love the game and I\u0027m not trying to criticize it, just improve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to add your own suggested fixes to these problems below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuzz66boy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T04:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 04:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by buzz66boy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded a few things\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T07:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem with the buildings is that Tier 0 buildings are... not good. I enjoyed the challenge of flying without Patched Conics, and seeing how far I could fly with an 18t limit etc. but they are restrictive. After upgrading almost all of them, I don\u0027t actually feel like I really need to do it again any time soon (255 parts is probably plenty for almost anything, I can\u0027t remember the launchpad mass limit, but it\u0027s high, unowned object tracking isn\u0027t that important, 12 Kerbals on mission is manageable, strategies... meh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there should be cheaper, but more tech levels. the total cost of fully upgrading may be the same, but there should be more of a gradual increase than a spike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the problem with engineers is that very few parts get damaged. They could be given other abilities, for example only engineers can alter thrust limiting during flight. Alternatively, overheating engines or re-entry into atmosphere could have effects on the fuel efficiency of engines. They might lose thrust for the same mass flow rate, or could start leaking and have a higher mass flow rate without gaining any extra thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T13:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rusty6899\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rusty6899\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can\u0027t remember the launchpad mass limit, but it\u0027s high\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s 140 tonnes, which is enough for most 1-man missions, but if you want to launch, say, a multiple-landing Mun mission - namely reusable lander, science lab, fuel tank - you need the top tier launchpad. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Some of the harder \u0022Build a base on ___\u0022 contracts can\u0027t be done without upgrading it either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T20:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like Rusty6899\u0027s ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think perhaps a better way to do the runway would be to make it shorter and smooth it out a bit.
