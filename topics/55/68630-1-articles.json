I know, aliens aren\u0027t going to be a part of the game, but it would still be a great way to get more science once you\u0027ve worked your way up to high in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, you would start with a probe using a scanner of some kind to look for areas with an ocean underneath (Think similar to how Kethane detectors work). You would send probes into orbit around various ice worlds (Minmus, Eeloo, parts of Dres, maybe more if other planets and moons are added) to scan for evidence of sub-surface oceans. Once you find a suitable target, you would then build a drill to get through the ice into the ocean and collect science from the ice and water it finds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I don\u0027t know if the game engine would support drilling like this, but if it\u0027s possible, it could present an interesting challenge to players and a good way to make science.

The temeprature is below freezing, which means that it\u0027s not JUST water. I always thought of Laythe as a friendlier version of Titan, where there are surface oceans of liquid methane instead of water. There is also the element of exploration that would drive for going to icy places.
