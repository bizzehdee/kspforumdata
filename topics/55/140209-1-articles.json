At the time it was asking what people would most like to see from 1.2, but given that development of the new dish array\u00A0and transmission system and possibly a rocket overhaul are already in the works I\u0027m going to guess that 1.2 planning is probably baked in.

I am sorry to all the multiplayer fanboys out there, but, this is NOT a game that lends itself to multiplayer. There are too many ways it can go wrong.

They need in order of priority of things that MUST be done:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Fix this constant crashing. IF you are not affected by it, I am happy for you, but there is an issue either in KSP itself or Unity \u0026lt;leading suspicion is Unity\u0026gt; that has problems with memory usage that is causing ntdll.dll to yell out in frustration.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.

Polish career mode: as in, make it make SENSE, give people a reason to play it, give us an emotional investment.

Add GP 2 and have Eeloo finally become the moon we know it is.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Polish graphics, add in the warm fuzzy fluffy stuff like clouds and city lights. yes, i know mods blah blah, im talkin all this as stock!\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Double Check everything is kosher and smooth across ALL platforms, PC, Mac, PS4 and XBONE.\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. Find solutions to ALL POTENTIAL issues that WILL come up in multiplayer. Timewarp, part counts, mods, trolls, trolls, trolls, trolls, trolls, malware.\u003Cbr\u003E\n8.

In 2-3 years this game MAY be able to have multiplayer, its too young, too unfinished for multiplayer to be even remotely considered. No, Multiplayer needs to take the same amount of time resources did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T11:47:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHighest on my wish list is a more moddable KSC.

Just something interesting to visit on every planet, something that isn\u0027t an easter egg.
