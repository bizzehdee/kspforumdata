Example, you really need a docking port or you forgot an antenna, you would be able to launch a craft that has parts in it for later attachment to your main vehicle. Obviously this would only be for small things, it doesn\u0027t really make sense to have an EVA kerbal attaching the big orange tanks, but just small things that you may have forgotten or overlooked in the VAB. This also falls under enhance eva activities but I thought I would expand on it.
