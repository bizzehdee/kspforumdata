The one thing I\u0027ve notices is that if I could possibly pick them from the sidebar(staging bars) and then select the settings in the shortcut section I want much more easily if it was an option(or is it and I missed it?). And no I can\u0027t redo the engines more conveniently for both aesthetics an practical purposes given the space. They are already layed out where you would think you can select them, but the way you have to select a part of the surface of the engine can drown out several parts from selection requiring you to move parts to select others making a big and often nearly un-reversable problem. Especially in the middle of others in a radial pattern! This is usually with Ion engines for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other things I would find useful would be a shortcut in the shortcuts window, or beyond, allowing you to select all of the same parts type by clicking on one. I\u0027d recommend it used alt/mod \u002B left or right click along with a deselect. Possibly with features recognizing a plane like the bottom of the craft vs the top of the craft(maybe based on radial vs mirror and how many facets creating the number of recognized planes.) I often use large amounts of solar panels and use separate shortcuts to the ones I can use on the runway without moving the plane and a separate set for those I would not use on the runway while still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: Selecting top and bottom of the craft would then be using radial set to two facets for top and bottom. Mirror with 2 facets could be left and right. Then for instance and have it increase to geometric facets as you go 3/4/6/8 if those have an application.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could help with a lot of things in game. Including helping when you run out of shorcuts to close things like air intakes if you have alot or opening solar panels in flight. A select all would be insanely useful for all parts of the game. Or did i miss this again and it is already a feature. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-28T00:24:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2015 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
