Combine that with the questionable wheels and dampers that sometimes become reactionless propulsion whenever they feel like it (Seriously these things crack me up sending me from a dead stop to flying in a hyperbolic trajectory at 30m/s on the mun) and 9/10 times your only viable option is just to say **** it and plaster on dead weight in the form of chutes whenever you want to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat all said; there\u0027s a fantastic dev blog buried somewhere that details why making the runway longer/wider is a hell of a lot more work than it sounds.
