It would also add to the things to do with the Kerbals when down on each world/moon that isn\u0027t just there for utility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t necessary for the game, just something I think would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T19:38:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m always in favor of features that can let you further customize your missions, kerbals, rockets or pretty much anything else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be totally okay with taking a screenshot from within the game and maybe using a simple crop tool to cut out a section of it for plaques and things. I think posting a full screenshot might wind up being too big, though and different aspect rations might wind up being a bit wonky, but cropping a square section out of a screenshot you took would be good, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like for there to be cameras you can take with you, maybe have some that mount onto your craft or some that your kerbal holds. Maybe they could have like a helmet cam or something, for when/if they come out with first-person EVAs. They could be used for just taking cool screenshots or for gathering a bit of science data. Would be good, methinks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
