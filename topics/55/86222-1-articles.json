Maybe add a \u0022Part Edit\u0022 toggle to the top of the screen which will allow you to see where in your GameData folder a certain part is when you hover over it, and have an button pop up to permanently delete it. The game would unload the part from memory and delete the files associated with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would come especially handy for someone like me who wants to SEE and play with a part before I decide if I want it or will ever use it. Then I can download NovaPunch, KWR, B9 etc, and sort through the parts in-game instead of going through all the folders one-by-one. I do this often because there are great mod packs, but there\u0027s also tons of parts I don\u0027t need, and some are repeated. I do not need 8 different kinds of struts...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1of6Billion","CreatedById":46191,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T11:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes! There even are a bunch of stock parts I could do without. Deleting stuff from within the game would be awesome. You could even provide a warning when the part happens to be in use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBedla","CreatedById":69025,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T12:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh yes please. As I cherry-pick from a bunch of different mods, and have deleted a lot of stock parts already (no use for stock tanks if you go procedural), it would be a godsend.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
