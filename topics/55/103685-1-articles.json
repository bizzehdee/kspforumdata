Also, some quick facts:\n\nThe Magic Boulder orbited Ike in a 15km polar orbit.\n\nIt was a grey boulder with green stripes running through it.\n\nThere was a monolith on it which had text on it that was a reference to Pet Rock, a toy from the 70\u0027s that was very popular.\n\nYes, the fact above means that the Magic Boulder was the ultimate Pet Rock.\n\nAnd to quote NovaSilisko, a former dev for KSP, the Magic Boulder was made of:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Common volcanic basalt, with unusually high concentrations of love.\n\nNow, armed with these facts and a love for the Magic Boulder, let\u0027s get it back into KSP!\n\nEDIT: And kudos to this thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115087-What-is-Magic-Boulder-Made-Of](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115087-What-is-Magic-Boulder-Made-Of)\n\nEDIT2: A vid by Scott Manley that explains everything:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJBSea-3DHs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nEDIT3: Just noticed that the text on the Magic Boulder told us a lot more about the kerbal universe than anything else anywhere.\n\n![XQQHsF3.png](http://i.imgur.com/XQQHsF3.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-08T21:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2015 09:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RAINCRAFTER**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T15:03:57Z","Content":"Why it was removed?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T15:05:00Z","Content":"I want it back too!

I like some unique things, and i have to say of everything, having to 100% MANUALLY spot/aim at something in an odd orbit is a feat of itself.\n\nNow, while we are at it, i would love the current easter eggs to be fixed, many are underground and unaccessible period (if you cant get to it, then remove the entire thing, as its extra textures/models that are for all intents and purposes impossible to even see normally). Please fix this in 1.1 or whatever update is after 1.0, since its a major annoyance to finally make a ship able to get to these locations, only to find uot you cant get to it as its underground.\n\nAnyways, if its not possible to get the boulder (or other easter eggs) back, i am fine with it (the amount of content in just .90 alone makes up for the broken easter eggs), but itd be nice to have more of these things around."}]}
