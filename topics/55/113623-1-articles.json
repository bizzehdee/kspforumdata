I think this helps to continues the sense of progression after the tech tree has been completely unlocked, and would offer an alternative to income from completing contracts. Since after the tech tree is finished career mode is effectively a cash limited sandbox, this would allow you to focus more of the sandbox part and not feel the need to do (often tedious) contracts should you not want to.\n\nThoughts?"}]}
