You\u0027d have to be making a deliberately suicidal reentry to have any chance of toasting one now.\n\nMy observation has been that heating behaves strangely in the thinnest parts of the atmosphere. Aerobraking (even only a few thousand meters deep) at a reasonable planetary system entry speed (say 3000-4000 m/s at periapsis) has resulted in virtually instantaneous combustion, particularly of struts. Even return to kerbin from minmus took about six passes and a strong retrograde burn to keep the struts from failing. Regular parts however do seem fairly reasonable."},{"CreatedByName":"Zeo","CreatedById":147045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T00:55:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E IIRC, the space shuttle\u0027s ceramic tiles were not ablative, and were to be replaced after a few flights or if they sustained damage.
