For example, if you have a space station in orbit around a specific planet, a tourist could want to go on vacation there for a certain period of time, and you would have to return them home after a certain time - if you leave them there for too long (or take them home too early), you don\u0027t fulfil all the contract\u0027s parameters.

That way you don\u0027t have to worry about the contract seeing, say, a shuttlecraft on its way to Minmus and deciding you have to keep it in Kerbal\u0027s SoI for the next month - you can just put a new station into orbit that meets the same requirements."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T17:03:34Z","Content":"Squad needs to alter the \u0022Administration\u0022 building to provide sliders for actual strategies, instead of what they call strategies.

I imagine tourists would want a worth while stay (rather than just ticking off that they\u0027ve been somewhere), and having a base or station set up as a destination proves you\u0027re able to accommodate them.\n\nSo yeah, this sort of tourism would be good.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Space Exploration (your own KSC) (these would be many pure science \u0022contracts\u0022 we have now, stripped of the 3d party request (Kerbodyne won\u0027t want you to plant a flag, *your program* wants to do that).\n\nI still say if it benifits your space program directly, there should be no need to select any contracts before you do it. It makes more sense to earn money from external sources than from yourself somehow. Other than that, the ability to influence what contracts you get would be a good strategy to include.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-18T17:08:42Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2015 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T18:14:26Z","Content":"\u0022From yourself\u0022 would be budget, really.

I wouldn\u0027t mind that \u0022Contract Filter\u0022 of yours but I consider it utterly insignificant (*being dramatic here*) compared to what refiltering contract-generation would achieve, cosmetic even, equivalent to (I wish) replacing all industry-logo and generated-text by Clean logo\u0026text telling exactly what the mission is (rescue, survey, exploration, satellite...etc).\n\n...however it replacing strategy would be a downgrade.\n\nThe Strategy of the Administration building we have now ARE in fact more Strategies than your suggestion. They have just been balanced out into oblivions in the process of making them failsafe, like how you can\u0027t possibly fail contracts or get stuck in R\u0026D.\n\nThe system we have right now allow to consider each contracts as \u0022projects\u0022 toward which you choose technological, funding \u0026 reputation means.\n\nLike how \u0022Manned presence on the surface of Mars\u0022 was a \u0022project\u0022 toward which NASA and SpaceX choose strategy (which are not based on filtering what contract they get but the means to accomplish any of them)\n\nTo give an analogy, SpaceX isn\u0027t clawing its way by \u0022doing Commercial Service\u0022 over \u0022Exploration\u0022, all agency/company do both ([illustrative link](http://www.bgr.in/news/nasa-certifies-spacex-to-launch-big-ticket-science-probes/)).\n\nSpaceX is making itself relevant by its choice of investing in Reusable engine/stage rather than reducing the cost of purpose-built rocket (or say making spaceplane).\n\nAs for \u0022budget\u0022, be it periodic or not, I never believed in market-driven Private-Venture, even SpaceX need backers and subvention and even a \u0022National Space Program\u0022 need a job/reason for existence, amounting them to roughly the same thing. In result, to me \u0022Budget\u0022 is more of a nondescript balance mechanism to keep a player able to rebound without making Contract impossible to fail (and obviously a lever to play on with reputation/funding).\n\nSo basically, as I keep saying :\n\n- Contracts are not reliable enough, not to make them OP or failsafe.\n\n- Administration strategies don\u0027t make meaningful difference.\n\n- R\u0026D is based on grinding rather than experience-based decision.\n\nBut otherwise, **KSP don\u0027t need to change that much** (though, balancing a game can be harder than coding the features as demonstrated by the Aero-change)\n\nPs : The above is quite a long answer to a topic that specific.
