Hello! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSandbox, Science, Career. My Impression: **Sandbox** gives you everything, you just have to figure how to make it work. **Science Mode** requires you make scientific discoveries to advance the program. Money is not an issue.\n\n**Career Mode**, IMO is an odd notion from the developer that a space program can be profitable from the start. Contracts can be fulfilled with challenges to earn revenue. When I look at the cost of upgrading facilities (up to and over $1M) I wonder what the heck? Consequently my current choice is to play in Science Mode. However, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d still love to have Contracts/Challenges offering incentive to earn money, reputation, and gain skills. I think Contracts should be included in Science Mode to give some guidance and goals to the player. Visual surveys and milestones seem very applicable to the science aspect of the game. In Science Mode, specific exercises such as these would be a nice addition. The difference is that progress is not really dependent on money, but on skills, knowledge, and milestones.\n\nWhat do you think? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T18:09:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Huntn**"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T08:59:40Z","Content":"Hi.

Are you saying edit Contract mode or Science mode? I assume to see Contracts, Career Mode must be chosen. How are such edits achieved? Thanks!"}]}
