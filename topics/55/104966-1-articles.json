They won\u0027t reply to any of my questions and suggestions even if I\u0027m the first poster in a Dev note. Good luck getting your point across to them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First page of a devnote:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E - The Round8 Toroidal Fuel Tank was repurposed as a 1.25m inline Xenon Tank.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E That is going to screw a lot of designs up. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) Why not just make a new 1.25m xenon tank and add a 1.25m electric thruster (doesn\u0027t have to be the same type as the current 0.625m one)?\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Look, even the creator of the tank believes that it should stay as it is:\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E I will miss the toroidal tank. That was my favorite tank for compact landers...\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E And while you guys are at it, could you please add more 0.625m parts? The smaller sized parts have been neglected for many updates and 1.0 could potentially make the problem worse. Smaller jet engines, intakes, long 0.625m fuel tanks, and a better nosecone (the current one is outdated and weights 0.1t) would be great.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I feel that SQUAD lacks testers that like to build aesthetically, that this, a builder who utilizes a variety of parts to create something \u0022unconventionally\u0022, [like the creations in this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43086-Open-Source-Construction-Techniques-for-Craft-Aesthetics). Many of those creations use the toroidal tank as an important part of the design and would not function if the part was changed, and a skilled craft builder would would\u0027ve noticed the consequences of the change immediately. Just look at all the complaints throughout this thread. Adding new parts has no real downside, and it gives us builders more tools to play with. The aforementioned 0.625m parts would allow for a plethora of great new designs and would benefit everyone would plays the game.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E **Don\u0027t let me down, SQUAD!**\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \u003E There has been a lot more work put into balancing and tuning the aero system too. The jet engines have had another pass with respect to their characteristics. For those that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know, the airflow through jet engines (and thus fuel flow, and thus thrust) is now a function of mach and of air density giving them more interesting limitations and effects.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E If jet engine behavior is going to be changed, a ramjet/scramjet would be nice to have too. It would allow for more realistic jet engines that aren\u0027t overpowered, and sits nicely between turbojets and rockets. RAPIERs would be more useful as convential turbojets won\u0027t be enough for SSTOs. \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Another addition for the turbojet could an afterburner. The dry thrust of the engines should be lowered, and the afterburner could be used to reach the current thrust levels. Of course, activating the after burner would consume much more fuel, but it would make the jet engines more balanced and allow for some cool glowing exhaust plumes on jets. Who wouldn\u0027t want that? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nope, nothing. Although there was enough community uproar that they did end up reverting the changes to the torodial tank. Ramjets would work marvelously with the new jet engine behavior, but obviously SQUAD didn\u0027t think so. ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E First reply to the 0.90 Q\u0026A:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I have a few questions:\n\u003E \u003E 1: Can the OKTO2, QBE and Stayputnik probe cores have at least some troque? 0.15 or 0.2 would be enough, but not none at all. Many of my probes use the OKTO2 and they\u0027re all unless without reaction wheel troque. \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 2: The cost of most of the parts are not realistic. Some engines (e.g. LV-1R, O-10 monoprop engine) are too expensive while the other engines like the LV-T30 is not expensive enough. There are many other stat changes I would like to see that I don\u0027t have room to mention here. \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 3: Are the radial decouplers finally fixed? Those things have been blowing up a whole bunch of my rockets.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 4: Also, will larger landing gears be including in 0.90.1 or do we have to wait \u0027til the next major update? \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E 5: Finally, are you guys planning on adding engines with larger gimbal ranges (maybe a standalone KS-25 and/or increase the gimbal range of the LV-T45 to 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0?) and larger SRBs (2m to 2.5m would work) to accommodate the new Mk3 parts? Would make building shuttles and larger rockets a lot easier.\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E I\u0027ve been trying to be one of the first posters in posts like this for several updates in a (so far futile) effort to get a Dev to respond. Maybe fifth time\u0027s the charm. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E BTW Thanks for the update guys.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Couldn\u0027t even get an answer in the questions and answers thread. sigh. \n\u003E \n\u003E There are a couple more but you guys get the point.
