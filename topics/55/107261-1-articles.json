I mean that some contracts do actually give science on a certain difficulty, but when played on a harder difficulty with less percentage science reward, it gets rounded down to 0. Meaning that in stead of science (in normal difficulty) adding up to 20, it now adds up to 0, since all contracts that would normally give less than 5 science will give 0 science now.\n\nI\u0027m not talking about the 0 science contracts. And even with a decimal number it would be 0.0 So that wouldn\u0027t change anything."}]}
