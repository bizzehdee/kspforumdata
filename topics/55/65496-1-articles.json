I remember seeing all kinds of historical craft in air and space museums when i was a kid, and space capsules like those from the Apollo missions were especially striking. I loved being able to see the advancements in technology and purpose. I could see things from the Mercury missions, then Gemini missions, and then the Apollo missions, and then go and see things from the Shuttle age, and fantastic planes like the SR-71 Blackbird. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is what i\u0027m thinking. At KSC, there could be another building for a museum. It could have like 10 places for rockets or capsules, and then another area for like 8 space planes, and another section for satellites and rovers or something. Each one could have a plaque like the flags do, with a description you put, and it could list information about that craft that you choose. It could pull that information from the log of the flight (max velocity, distance traveled, max G\u0027s, time flown) if you choose to (of course you would then have to have a function to save a flight log) as well as things like cost (when cost comes into play), number of parts, and weight. Also, it could have the missions flag behind it or in front of it or something, or maybe just choose a flag. I think another good feature could be the ability to assign screenshots you took from the mission to that display, and access them with descriptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the best way to do this would be to be able to go to the VAB, or the SPH, disassemble the rocket to just the capsule, or leave the whole rocket, or whatever you would want on display, save it, and then go into the museum and load your save and assign it into one of the slots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith career mode coming into life, this would be a great way to catalog your space program through time. You would have things like your first Munar Lander, or your first communications satellite, or your first Duna rover, or your first extra-planetary glider, as well as things you think as historical, like a space craft that underwent a rapid unplanned disassembly, and you still managed to get the crew home safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA final feature i think would be necessary would be the ability to walk around and interact with things, as well as there being other Kerbals walking around looking at the displays.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think?
