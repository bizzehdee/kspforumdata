They feel so empty aside from the VAB/SPH and the one kerbal we see in each building (and four in Admin building). Wouldn\u0027t it be cool if there were actual Kerbals roaming throughout the various space center building U.I.s?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that even the ones with 2D renders for scenes could still have 3D Kerbals walking around, just use the 2D scene as a background texture, and draw flat sprites in front of certain areas, like when you want Kerbals to be seen behind things like pool tables. Though really it might be prettier and easier just to make it an actual 3D scene.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVAB/SPH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s already Kerbals walking around here. Just one thing: Where are the female Kerbals? Are there no KSC engineers and scientists of the female gender?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETracking Station \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, this one is different than the others. It doesn\u0027t really need to have Kerbals working there, but I think it should have at least one Kerbal.

By that I mean she has a little box connected to the Info-Database with a sort of speech-bubble thing. Just a small thing but it would give representation of the female kerbals in the head staff of KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAstronaut Complex\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has the potential for a lot of cool stuff. I\u0027ve talked of the idea of having \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114377-A-fun-idea-I-had\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecoinop games\u003C/a\u003E to function as pseudo-tutorials before. But this is different. What if the Kerbals and recruits could walk around the astronaut complex floor, talking with each other, holding suspiciously green sodas, looking at their digital watches, etc. The Kerbals shown would correspond to the Kerbals in the U.I. If you were to hire a Kerbal recruit, they might have a little animation of joy: something like \u0022Yay! I\u0027ve been accepted!\u0022 They may also change into a flight suit next time you enter the building. Some kind of visual clue to tell the recruits apart from the astronauts. Maybe just a medal on their chest or something, corresponding to their level as an astronaut.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome Kerbals in the background sitting at the computers, looking around and chatting.
