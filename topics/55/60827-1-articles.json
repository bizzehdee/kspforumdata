I could theoretically launch a vessel using only action groups, and be able to perform tasks not available to staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially this means that stages, the main method for sequencing the vehicle, is more limited than action groups, a secondary tool. This seems wrong, and imbalanced, to me. It would seem to make common sense to allow both methods to perform all actions, giving greater flexibility when on missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples could be actions for extending solar panels when reaching orbit, lowering and raising landing gear, deactivating engines, lowering ladders, starting experiments, turning on and off lights etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T14:04:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA space bar is nice to use to separate main stages, but it kind of feels cool to press different buttons and see it do things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T15:04:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehave been wanting them to add this for a while. make staging more like a flight plan. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edragging and dropping action groups in to the staging list would be perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T15:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess so, which is why I\u0027m not suggesting action groups should go, however I also think it would be cool to watch my payload detach from my launch vehicle and see the solar panels automatically open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems a bit weird to purposely limit staging when I would assume that the mechanism behind staging and action groups is almost the same. Why not simply allow \u0027everything everywhere\u0027. This gives players the greatest choice and flexibility and it doesn\u0027t feel like it would be that complicated to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
