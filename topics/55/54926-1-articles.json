What sizes are \u0022suitable\u0022 for material bays? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to argue for any of those parts, but trying to demonstrate that there are other part gaps due to size, and we as players have to design around these gaps. To me, not having the perfect part for every application is not only part of the challenge of the game, but part of the \u0022right kind of challenge\u0022 of the game. In fact, working around these kinds of limitations has led me to design better rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, again, we don\u0027t need every part in every size, because not having a perfect part for every application \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E kind of the point of game that incorporates design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-03T03:29:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2013 03:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by LethalDose\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T03:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, it\u0027s almost 0.23, and we are still using the saves from 0.20 and 0.19?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T04:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KASASpace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KASASpace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOkay, it\u0027s almost 0.23, and we are still using the saves from 0.20 and 0.19?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything to say that people won\u0027t still be using saves, craft files, etc, from 0.20? Even if they are not using any from back then, saves and craft files from 0.22 legitimately include the IAS. I know that I have a number of ships out in space which include it, saved craft files including it, and it\u0027s used on the bundled stock craft. There\u0027s no reason to believe that the IAS is any less widely used than the IRW in 0.22, certainly not to the point of insignificance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Halsfury","CreatedById":54576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T17:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion makes perfect sense to me and it would make probe building easier since I can never get just the right amount of torque, it\u0027s always overkill and always too heavy! what I would really like is a part with a lot less mass doing the same thing because all the probes I build in campaign are massive cause I like to stick the Jr. Science bay on them so I need a reaction wheel but they are massive so I need a massive engine and a massive RCS system and etc. etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou see where this is going...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
