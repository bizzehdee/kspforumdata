Although my suggestion fit within the scope of that thread, I decided it would give it more room to breath if I left it here to be fleshed out. The original post went something (okay, exactly) like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou know, I was brainstorming this earlier. I think the way I\u0027d do it if I wanted to make a distant binary system would be to have two stars located very far apart. For the purposes of this discussion I\u0027ll use the names Kerbol (starting star) and Alternis (the second star, whose name I stole from NovaSilisko\u0027s excellent planet pack). Let\u0027s say that when you are closer to Kerbol, you are effectively in its SOI. When you are closer to Alternis, you are in its SOI. When you get halfway between the two, they alternate.\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are in Kerbol\u0027s SOI, Alternis orbits Kerbol. When you switch to Alternis\u0027 SOI, Kerbol starts orbiting it in the opposite direction. Because there are no other points of reference (this approach limits the entire game to exactly two star systems), you would not be able to tell this switch had occurred: the skybox would give nothing away. You could further sell this illusion by hacking out the orbit lines in the map mode. Because the stars would be so far apart, relative motion would be very difficult to detect. The orbits would be so wide that in the time it took you to go from one to the other, it would appear as though they were moving in straight lines if at all, making navigating it very easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis addresses both primary developer concerns:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Because you could make the argument of this as a binary system, the devs (or modders) would be able to allow a combination of conventional propulsion and high time warp to make transit times reasonable (I would say several minutes - up to 15 at max warp is reasonable) without the need for warp. This would open the market for mod makers to implement their own warp ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Since there\u0027s only one other star system there is no need to make it randomized. The devs could use a fixed seed to procedurally generate its planets and that would solve the issue of gameplay being different for different players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA solution like this is something I feel would make everybody happy. It would be the other star system many people on this forum including myself have advocated, it would adhere to the loose standards of realism required by the devs, and it would be close enough to be reachable on conventional means yet far away enough to present a true interstellar challenge to anyone who wants it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that post adequately covers it, but in the interest of adding something new to the conversation I created this useful graphic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FEOlkVz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FEOlkVz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T07:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think an implementation of the Barycenter system discussed in this thread almost a year ago, now, (link in my sig) would be a better approach than the more ad-hoc method of handling the SOI\u0027s that you describe here.

I was actually thinking about that whole conversation as I was brainstorming. It certainly would apply here! However, there\u0027d be no real need for outer SOI limits since there\u0027d only be two stars. Kind of like how Kerbol\u0027s SOI extends outward to infinity right now. Allowing for at least the possibility of outer limits might make it possible for a third, more distant star to orbit both Alternis and Kerbol, not unlike how Alpha Centauri C orbits its companions A and B (which are orbiting each other)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Is there any way you could pull up those old graphs?
