Also, when building it the VAB, it is difficult to make sure rover wheels are at the same height, so it may be helpful to have a \u0022vertical snap\u0022 just like angle snap for putting parts at the same height.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T23:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps SQUAD could take a page out of the Firespitter mod, and integrate the latter\u0027s in-editor animation toggles*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Basically, parts with the Firespitter animation module can have their animations toggled within the VAB/SPH.
