In other words, when the mouse pointer hoovers over the list, the wheel operation shouldn\u0027t effect the map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreets,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T22:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like the location of the exit button to be consistent between all screens.
