Ideally, we would have something that looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kqjpQDX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kqjpQDX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the teal indicators are the trim indicators and the regular orange ones are the current inputs. The trim indicators could also change color (or simply disappaer) when the trim is set to zero, which would help people who accidentally set trim figure out why their vehicle is tumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomewhat related, for most space shuttle designs, we use SAS to hold an orientation while keeping the engines firing through the CoM. However, any time we go to change the orientation of the shuttle (example: when flying a gravity turn) SAS has to reset to the \u0022zero input\u0022 position and rebalance from there; obviously using trim would fix that, but without a GUI trim indicator trim can\u0027t be set. However, it\u0027s obvious that the player would try to set the trim settings to what SAS was holding even if they had the GUI indicator. Therefore, it would make sense to add an option to set trim from the SAS rather than ask a player to try and chase the SAS setting manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoriW","CreatedById":57866,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T23:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, good suggestion ferram.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T00:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this a lot! Possibly it should have an option to not just instantly copy SAS to trim, but to have SAS constantly update the trim whenever it has settled onto a new attitude, so that the trim should generally be correct every time you disengage SAS, as long as it was holding a steady attitude at the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T10:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note, an option to remap/reassign the trim keys would be also apperciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dazoe","CreatedById":100450,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T04:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your still looking this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a very simple plugin to add TrimIndicators\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/trimindicators/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESpaceport link\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceGremlin","CreatedById":65961,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T14:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds amazing.
