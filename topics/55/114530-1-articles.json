They do need a fairly substantial temperature differential to work as they are constrained by the law of thermodynamics still could be good. Potential add on part to the new radiators.\n\nMaybe the radiators could have active, passive, and generator modes, where they either take in electricity to cool the part using a heat pump, maybe a peltier unit, radiate passively like a plain old heat sink like they do now, or generate electricity from the temperature differential but conduct slightly more slowly, like a peltier unit used as a generator? \n\nI don\u0027t know how this fits in with the current parts though- it kind of creates the need for a heat generating part, but we already have parts that create electricity directly from light, fuel, and fission, so what could this do that they can\u0027t? I suppose it could be more powerful per area than solar but heavier, more powerful per mass than fuel cells but less efficient per unit fuel, and as far as fission, a 1m part could generate the heat, but maybe since it would conduct to the rest of the craft, if you don\u0027t radiate the heat well enough the control rods automatically get shoved in and it shuts down to avoid a meltdown. The regular generators are small and weak but would be lighter and run without external radiators. \n\nAs far as heat mechanics go, if it doesn\u0027t already do this it should conduct in air or water better than vacuum and it should also conduct more heat and generate electricity more efficiently the greater the temperature difference."},{"CreatedByName":"austincurr","CreatedById":31939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T16:58:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe the radiators could have active, passive, and generator modes, where they either take in electricity to cool the part using a heat pump, maybe a peltier unit, radiate passively like a plain old heat sink like they do now, or generate electricity from the temperature differential but conduct slightly more slowly, like a peltier unit used as a generator? \n\u003E I don\u0027t know how this fits in with the current parts though- it kind of creates the need for a heat generating part, but we already have parts that create electricity directly from light, fuel, and fission, so what could this do that they can\u0027t?

What about adding a thermal jet/prop engine? Runs on heat and intakeair, like that one mod.

If electric, fuel-buring, and stitling motors were added, it would open up a lot of possibilities, and it would be possible to put together, say, a plane powered by a nuclear plant generating heat that runs a stirling engine that turns a propellor. Maybe that\u0027s too much to do all at once, but I think that\u0027s be a nice goal to aim for?\n\nI think other than motors turning parts attached to their nodes, we can do most of this stuff. Infernal robotics has the motors, config editing can make generators turn whatever into whatever, the hardest part would be tying it in with the heat system, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T12:49:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe the radiators could have active, passive, and generator modes, where they either take in electricity to cool the part using a heat pump, maybe a peltier unit, radiate passively like a plain old heat sink like they do now, or generate electricity from the temperature differential but conduct slightly more slowly, like a peltier unit used as a generator? \n\u003E I don\u0027t know how this fits in with the current parts though- it kind of creates the need for a heat generating part, but we already have parts that create electricity directly from light, fuel, and fission, so what could this do that they can\u0027t?
