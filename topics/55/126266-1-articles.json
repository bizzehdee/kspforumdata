With a vacuum TWR of 17,2 and a sea level TWR of 16, it falls behind most engines in the game. What\u0026#39;s more, it doesn\u0026#39;t even have a gimbal. For the Reliant to be worthwhile after the point it is your only rocket engine, I think it should have the TWR of the LFB KR-1x2, which is 30,769230769... and let\u0026#39;s just round that down to 30 since this is a 1.25m engine. At its mass of 1.25 tons, it should then have a thrust of 375kN at vacuum. Sea level thrust is automatically calculated via Isp. So wait, why do I think the starting liquid fuel engine should have one of the best TWRs in the game!? Well, you see, it doesn\u0026#39;t have a gimbal which puts it in a rather unique position. Its ISP is also less than that of the LFB KR-1x2, and I couldn\u0026#39;t think of a better engine to compare this engine to. The booster doesn\u0026#39;t have bottom attachment points, and the Reliant can\u0026#39;t gimbal. They\u0026#39;re both engines that don\u0026#39;t fit any slots in your typical upper-middle-first stage engine configuration where weight, TWR, thrust and Isp scale with rhyme and reason. At 375kn vacuum thrust, the Reliant should be strong enough to be worthwhile in various situations, especially with a better TWR than the Vector. Overpowered? Probably not, low Isp and all.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne concern there may be is that it kind of does replace the Aerospike especially considering their sea level Isps aren\u0026#39;t that different, but we\u0026#39;ll get there.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSwivel:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis one is a bit tricky. Swivel is actually \u0022usable\u0022, as in you go for this if you have a 1.25m stack. Sure, AV-R8 Winglet can make the Reliant just as good, but that\u0026#39;s quite the expensive among other things like added drag, mass and not working at higher altitudes so that should be expected. I\u0026#39;d make it more like the Skipper actually. The Isp values actually confirm this already, with the Swivel having the same vacuum Isp but a 10 less surface Isp, which is fine by me. Skipper gets a TWR of 21,666666667 so once again rounding down for diameter balance reasons rather than how you should actually be rounding values, we get an ideal TWR of 21 for the Swivel. Which translates to a 315 kN vacuum thrust for the Swivel. I\u0026#39;m personally not very comfortable with how close that is to the reliant, but that is because the Swivel is more massive. Any ideas?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAerospike:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Aerospike is... weird. My version of Reliant definitely puts it to shame except as a high thrust vacuum engine, which is really a role the Aerospike doesn\u0026#39;t feel like it should have. Its description says that its almost equally effective at all altitudes, but it has some of the largest Isp change between sea level and vacuum with the lack of a gimbal. So here\u0026#39;s what I\u0026#39;d do with it; compare it to the Rhino. Rhino has roughly 22 for its TWR, a great gimbal range and 255-340 Isp. So here\u0026#39;s where we do some rationalizing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRhino has a great gimbal range with poor surface to vacuum Isp but Aerospike is supposed to be the opposite. Quoting the trivia section for the aerospike engine at the KSP wiki: \u0022An aerospike provides comparable performance to a De Laval nozzle in space, but at lower altitudes it can be 20-30% more efficient.\u0022 20% higher than the Rhino puts the lower end of Aerospike at 306, and lets round that up to 310 since we like neat numbers. 310-340 seems like a fair Isp range for a gimballess, bottom nodeless engine eh? Another thing is that the aerospike is supposed to be heavier yet it is the second lightest stack attacked 1.25m engine. Vector is rather nuts with mass for a 1.25m engine, so let\u0026#39;s just make this the second highest at 2 tons. The end result is 440 kn for 2 tons and an Isp range of 310-340. Pretty formidable! \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKickback:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe best SRB in the game is rather wimpy. A gimbal would probably solve the issue though.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T14:44:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 02:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by More Boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T14:11:09Z","Content":"\natmTWR30 would be extremely overpowered.

If that was their role, then we\u0026#39;d really just want a more massive LV-909 with more thrust. - side note: not a bad idea, we lack high thrust vacuum optimized engines. We always get low thrust (for the part diameter) and low mass paired with the good vacuum Isp... with the KR-2L being the only exception... sort of... ite vacuum Isp is good, but not as good as the 909 or poodle... and its atmo Isp is bad, but not nearly as bad as the 909/poodle\u003Cbr\u003E\nwhere is my poodle with half the thrust of a mainsail (ie, what I want the skipper to be... make the skipper a smaller KR-2L), or my LV-909 with half the thrust of a LV-T30.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe point of an aerospike is that it is nearly optimal for all atmospheric pressures.
