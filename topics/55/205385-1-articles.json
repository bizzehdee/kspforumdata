It does its best to give an introduction to all these concepts, but either because of its engine limitations or out of fear of scaring away its customers, it can\u0027t do everything accurately.\u00A0 Now, I understand that the game is simpler than how real life rocketry works in some ways, and I feel like reaction wheels are no exception to one of the shortcuts they\u0027ve taken when cheating the laws of physics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter some Googling, there doesn\u0027t seem to be much offered in the way of mods that have been updated to the latest version. Is that because the authors have moved on or because the latest version has only been recently released? They don\u0027t make sense to me, for the little I understand about reaction wheels, I still paid a little attention in physics class. I know there is a lot of complexity to them that\u0027s missing here, like how they become saturated and where the torque gets dumped and how, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve done in my current vanilla game is just lower the wheel authority to 10% to better simulate how they\u0027d function. Do you have any recommendations on any other quick changes I could make? Should they stay as they are because they function as intended in the Kerbal environment. I tend to forget the scale of things in 1/10th of real life, so maybe they\u0027re fine, and I\u0027m just not used to it... thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a long time KSP fan, thanks for the community input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-26T14:14:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2021 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Krazy_Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-26T14:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, KSP reaction wheels are not realistic.\u00A0 I think the reason they are so powerful is to make the game playable by more people.\u00A0 \u00A0I find it fun to play with them weakened, as you have done, using fins to steer the rocket in the atmosphere, and then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters outside the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are mods, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200480-*/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Esaturable reaction wheels\u003C/a\u003E and\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154658-*/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emandatory \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, which I have not tried, but which you might like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have also used the \u0027Breaking Ground\u0027 mod from Squad to build \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/OHara/Real-Reaction-Wheels\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecraft \u003C/a\u003Ethat use the robotic parts to build realistic reaction wheels, which is fun for the building part, but awkward to do all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe past several revisions of KSP1 have allowed many mods to work without no change, so it is worth trying your mods with later versions than they advertise, maybe after checking the mod-thread to see what other users have tested already.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204163-*/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emight decide\u003C/a\u003E that your favourite version of KSP1 is not the latest, but maybe 1.8.1 or 1.10.1 or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krazy_Kerbal","CreatedById":170617,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-26T15:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you so much.
