You should go reading it now, its interesting. Any who, I started to question why there was no mention of bug fixes that were being implemented, and only new features. I commented on the article, and wanted to post it as a thread in an attempt to get more eyes on it. Here is it below:\n\n\u0022I mean yea this {the relay game mechanics} is cool, sounds like a good addition to the game.\n\nBut in my opinion, I wish more focus was put into de-bugging.\n\nI\u0027ve got to restart my career yet again due to the nullreferenceexception bug; its got something to do with the \u0022claw\u0022 part, one of the buggiest parts in the game, and long story short it freezes parts of you craft/space-station while in orbit, tearing it {expensive space stations} apart. It has been named the Glue Kraken. One you get it, re-loading a save before the nonsense will not help you and however many hours you put into your career go down the drain. \n\nThe game is awesome, and I do want to start again, but one of the things i want to do is move asteroids to space stations so they can have fuel for a good while. Its a fantastic expansion of the game, but if I try to do it again, will I have to restart everything all over? \n\nWill this new update of relays add another bad bug? I just want the game to work correctly. Bugs that don\u0027t crash you game file are overlook-able, but if I have to keep restarting my career and going back to square one after tens of hours of game time and ship designing, because of a stupid bug i may encounter again..... Sigh, I don\u0027t know what else to say.\n\nI\u0027m quite torn\u0022\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? \n\n\\*I\u0027ve known of the Bust thread started by Claw about the Glue Kraken and the glitchy-ness of the grabbing unit; the Glue Kraken is currently the bane of my career\u0027s existence. You should go read that now to. I will try to recreate the glitch and add to the discussion when I have a moment. First I need to find the will to start another career again. Should I even do that or wait for 1.1?![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nIn the end, I trust and hope Squad knows best\n\nEDIT - I would like to add I do not use mods and do not plan using them either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-29T04:43:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2015 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274**"},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T21:42:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ve said in more than one other thread that I hoped they\u0027d focus on improving current features and squashing bugs, rather than focusing on new features.

I agree that you shouldn\u0027t have to do this, but this would be good damage control.
