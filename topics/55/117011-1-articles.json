You should go reading it now, its interesting. Any who, I started to question why there was no mention of bug fixes that were being implemented, and only new features. I commented on the article, and wanted to post it as a thread in an attempt to get more eyes on it. Here is it below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I mean yea this {the relay game mechanics} is cool, sounds like a good addition to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in my opinion, I wish more focus was put into de-bugging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got to restart my career yet again due to the nullreferenceexception bug; its got something to do with the \u0022claw\u0022 part, one of the buggiest parts in the game, and long story short it freezes parts of you craft/space-station while in orbit, tearing it {expensive space stations} apart. It has been named the Glue Kraken. One you get it, re-loading a save before the nonsense will not help you and however many hours you put into your career go down the drain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game is awesome, and I do want to start again, but one of the things i want to do is move asteroids to space stations so they can have fuel for a good while. Its a fantastic expansion of the game, but if I try to do it again, will I have to restart everything all over? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill this new update of relays add another bad bug? I just want the game to work correctly. Bugs that don\u0027t crash you game file are overlook-able, but if I have to keep restarting my career and going back to square one after tens of hours of game time and ship designing, because of a stupid bug i may encounter again.....

You should go read that now to. I will try to recreate the glitch and add to the discussion when I have a moment. First I need to find the will to start another career again.

I gave credit to Squad for making an amazing game, but in my opinion squashing serious bugs\u0026gt;adding features. It would seem from the info Sal gave us earlier in the thread that Squad is able to do both quality control and expansion; in my opinion it would be nice to see 100% of game development be devoted to polishing up the bugs, even if only for a short while. But hey if they say they can do both and moving to unity 5 is the best thing to do right now, I trust they are right and wish for much success on their part for the sake of all of us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mrclucks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mrclucks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Verdana;\u0022\u003ESo shut up, sit down, and enjoy what we have while other people continue making it better at no cost to us\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not tell us to shut up, sit down, and enjoy what we (or at least I) \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E have.
