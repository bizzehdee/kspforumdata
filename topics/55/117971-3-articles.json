Very well thought-out, but not too complicated. \n\nHowever, there is one thing that I think should be removed, and a few small things that should be added:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Radiation** might affect the crew in certain environments. Either in EVA, or in your pod. If a kerbonaut recieves radiation that exceeds a limit, he might take permanent damage (lowered condition) until he\u0027s healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). Over a certain limit, he might *die.* To avoid this, either *hide your lander/spacecraft\\** in an area where the radiation is lower (maybe in an abyss? or behind a mountain?), use radiation-protected pods, and in EVA, *go for short EVAs\\**, or reinforce the suits of certain kerbonauts with a radiation-protection. Radiation is not a problem on the beginner-friendly moons of Kerbin, but it can be a factor to increase the difficulity of certain celestial bodies\n\nRadiation seems out of place, and too complicated. I think that should be removed.\n\nAs for what should be added:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Condition** determines how quickly they move, and how much they consume from the life support rescoures. Having a realy low condition might cause the kerbonaut to fail performing his *tasks.* Taking damage such as hitting the kerbonaut or his pod might lower this permanently, unless healed (astronaut complex?medbay?). After upgrading the astronaut complex, your applicants will not only have starting XP, but they will have a higher condition (due to the advanced training). Condition might be lowered permadently during many-year-long interplanetary missions, and increased by *gee forces\\*.*\n\nI like the \u0022Condition\u0022 variable. Simple, but realistic.\n\nYou mentioned in the OP that applicants\u0027 Condition and XP would increase as the astronaut complex is levelled up. \n\nI think that perhaps instead of increasing the condition and XP of applicants, levelling up the astronaut complex could instead allow you to \u0022train\u0022 existing astronauts, by clicking a \u0022train\u0022 button on each one\u0027s bar. This would cost large sums of money in career mode. While training, which could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, the astronuat will be unavailable to be selected for missions. Each \u0022training session\u0022 would increase the selected astronaut\u0027s level by one, and would become increasingly more expensive as the astronaut levels up. \n\nAs for using the astronaut complex to improve returning astronauts\u0027 condition, I simply think that any astronaut that returns to kerbin and is recovered will immediately have their condition replenished back to maximum values. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E **Morale** determines how effectively they perform their *tasks* as a pilot, engineer, and scientist. Of course, they don\u0027t have so much tasks currently. Kerbonauts should have vital tasks so that a low morale would pull back the mission. I have another suggestion to do that, but I will suggest that on another day. Rapidly performing tasks, not having any action for long times (long timewarps), and losing crewmembers might lower this. Having actions such as passing a celestial body, landing, going on EVA there, docking, or meeting a new crew (crew replacement) might increase this. Morale is largely drained during many-year-long interplanetary missions.\n\nI also have something to add concerning the \u0022Morale\u0022 variable. \n\nIn the astronaut complex, each astronaut has their own \u0022Courage\u0022 and \u0022Stupidity\u0022 values. These values could effect how the astronaut hold up in certain situations.\n\nHigher \u0022Courage\u0022 levels slow down the rate at which the astronaut loses Morale.\n\nHigher \u0022Stupidity\u0022 levels decrease the astronaut\u0027s overall ability to perform tasks.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E To add to the debate, as I don\u0027t know if its been mentioned: I really really don\u0027t want large RCS-tank sized parts for life support.

I have never heard of EVA propellant being in any way tied to the animations. The very fact that mods that change this to monoprop and/or add more resources to EVA kerbals kinda points to this as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Trust me when I say that a massless life support resource is a really bad idea.\n\nI really thought SQUAD once said something about extra mass breaking the animations...\n\nBut now I can\u0027t find anything.\n\nMaybe someone just said why they think squad might have made EVA propellant a separate resource from monopropellant.

Which is a mechanic I dig, feeling mass efficient and futuristic at the same time. \n\nTAC (With 3rd party extensions) was a blast for having lots of ways to get each of the three components, and making in situ farms a lot more challenging. I agree something closer to USILS is what stock should look like since it\u0027s a lot simpler, and still has 95% the fun. I do miss harvesting Duna\u0027s C02 for farms though.\n\nActually I bet a tiny extension to add C02 as a requirement to the MKS Cultivator would be all I need..."},{"CreatedByName":"MedwedianPresident","CreatedById":12212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T19:57:27Z","Content":"Oxygen, Water and Food are of course the three must-have components for a life support system.
