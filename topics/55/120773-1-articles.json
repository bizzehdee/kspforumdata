The ones that you complete by strapping on a bunch of stuff to a rocket?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I had an idea to make those a bit more interesting. If you have not researched the part that the contract wants you to test, there should be a good chance that the part will fail or blow up. That way, not only is there a risk to abusing those contracts for higher-tier parts, but you can\u0027t just strap on a bunch of nonsense on a rocket and do all these contracts in one go. However, if the part is already researched, it will not fail, so people that would rather not deal with random part failures otherwise (like me) won\u0027t have to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like this should be a suggestion for the stock game and not for a mod because test contracts are honestly too easy to abuse and complete. I\u0027m not really suggesting something that would make the game harder, just make exploitation harder and contracts a bit more balanced. And just to clarify once again; \u003Cstrong\u003EI am not suggesting to have random part failures for parts in general, just for \u0022experimental\u0022 parts that you have not researched yet but are tied to \u0022testing\u0022 contracts\u003C/strong\u003E. I know Squad doesn\u0027t want random failures or malfunctions, and honestly neither do I (that should be something added via mods, not stock), but I think it\u0027s fair for parts that you\u0027re supposed to \u0022test\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologize in advance if this has already been suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T10:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I would love to have random failures in stock.
