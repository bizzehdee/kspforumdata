I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only one. I currently have a big ship with 64 LT-2 and it\u0027s not enough. It\u0027s also not long enough(and adding more parts is not a good idea to extend them). Having and LT-3 and LT-4 could be really nice. They should be longer and have up to say 900 -1200 impact tolerance or whatever the relative value is compared to the LT-2. Really large ships could really use them to get adequate landing. Let alone emergency landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso anyone want more. And what stats do people think they should have. I\u0027m no up on the math for landing gear. I assume the Landing impact total divided by the planets gravity and compare to the actual weight in tons. But I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if this has nothing to do with how it actually works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy vessel has a max designated weight of 5760 tons without boosters or any gear to get it in orbit initially from Kerban. It\u0027s designed to land on smaller bodies but I want to get as big of a range as possible. It is also basically a flying space station. Part of it\u0027s role potentially is to mine get in to orbit and use the ore as a means to keep the fuel up for refueling. And send vehicles/probe off for missions etc. So it could use as much help as it can get for landing. It\u0027s also nice to be able to land it safely in case of emergencies or various user stupidity and not be stuck in orbit in case of a really bad situation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-14T17:27:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2015 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sam.johnson841","CreatedById":104846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T19:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure we need two new legs, but one bigger one is defiantly needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Sam\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T22:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude, the legs have like a 12 meter per sec impact tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T22:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImpact tolerance shouldn\u0027t change with size.
