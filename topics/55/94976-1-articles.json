Because with it in there, it causes a heap of problems.

Then I built some test rockets of all stock parts to see if the problem only manifested through scaling up some stock parts. Nope, same exact problem all stock.

It will only cure a bunch of problems people may experience using the TR-38-D in anything but a straight up single stack, or single asparagus stacks. If a TVR-2160C Mk2 is involved, it has its own little bug that can combine with the TR-38-D\u0027s as-shipped part.cfg to do some very strange things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Going to rebuild that test craft since I\u0027ve altered it significantly due to it turning out to be a good base for a heavy launcher.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T11:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWHat\u0027s the problem exactly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T11:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think we\u0027ve ever heard an official explanation of the reasoning behind many parts being physicsless.

It has its own curious bug, which seems to cascade down to parts connected below it. Note that when staging the tanks off the top of the Kerbodyne side boosters, only one goes instead of all four and a lot of force is projected downward, destroying the tank below. The TR-38-D\u0027s are mounted upside down so their weight goes with the fuel tanks - if the physics line is changed to 0 or commented out or deleted. Without being \u0022massless\u0022 the TR-38-D works in either orientation, just like all the other stack decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/xPHeUM64\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/xPHeUM64\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDemonstration of the same craft, with the TR-38-D\u0027s right side up, which without the Physics Significance line would leave an extra 3.2t weight on the rocket.

It\u0027s one crazy weird bug in that part and it\u0027s been there since at least .21 Want weirder? Sepratrons are not affected by the bug.
