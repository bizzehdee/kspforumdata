I can see it making a difference for resource consumption, but other than that I like my universal time and it would get confusing fast to have each ship on relative mission clocks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELorentz contraction would be pretty awesome. Unfortunately while going at that speed there probably wouldn\u0027t be a lot to see, so it would be sort of silly to include.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelativistic effects are so cool to think about. However I can\u0027t really see them playing a role in KSP.
