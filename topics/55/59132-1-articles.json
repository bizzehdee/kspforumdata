The telescope has two big features. The one based on career mode is that you will gain a certain amount of extra science per mission. The telescope facility requires 300 science to build. It is pre-built in sandbox mode. It can also be upgraded. It has 3 upgrade paths: Distance, quality, and filtering. Distance is (obviously) how far you can see. The first upgrade costs 20 science, and it costs \u002B10 science added onto the previous amount for each upgrade. Each upgrade increases the distance it can see by 40 km. It starts off by seeing 40 km farther then with eyes. Quality is how clear the images are. This path is limited. In fact, the only endless upgrade path is distance. The upgrades start by costing 10 science but they increase by 50 science each upgrade. There are 10 total quality upgrades available. The last type of upgrade is filtering. Filtering has two purposes. Dimming sunlight and letting you see past other spacecraft. There are 5 total upgrades for filtering. The top dimming upgrade also makes other stars 50% dimmer so you can see planets and moon, aswell as other objects easier. The dimming upgrades start at 20, and increase by 80 each time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETelescopes are basically floating telescope facilities but without upgrades. There will be a series of lenses and other telescope materials in the part selection area while building ships. Telescopes have 2 purposes. The first one is similar to telescope facilities. You can see farther through your telescope depending on what lenses and how many you used. The other feature lets you gain .5 science per minute for every telescope you have in orbit. Telescopes on land only earn you .2 science per minute. If your kerbals have access to telescopes or the telescope facility, they can write telescope reports.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, tell me what you think about the idea of telescopes! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, telescopes will have their own appearance on the orbit map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheKerbonaut","CreatedById":100003,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T00:26:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually a good idea!

I think there should be a few different orbital telescope parts at different powers, different spectrum, etc. Each one could return a different set of images and each one would return science for those images. This would be repeatable until the image bank runs out.
