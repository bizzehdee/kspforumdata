Please note, if there is voodoo suggestions, I don\u0027t know them. So I apologize in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESettings access from all menus\u003C/strong\u003E- you should be able to access the settings (i.e, volume control) from all settings, such as the VAB, SPH, MC, TS, and so on. It bugs me I need to mute ALL sounds on my computer just to mute KSP... or go to the toolbar and mute KSP completely. Sometimes I\u0027ll have music on myself and I want to just hear the rumbling of the engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELarger Mk3 wings\u003C/strong\u003E- The Mk3 wings are nice, but they\u0027re pitiful in size in comparison to the main body. When using the shuttle style wings, I have to make the body shorter to accommodate and in doing so it ends up looking like a Buran and not an American Space Shuttle. Plus, more creativity! We have like 7 new wings for the mk3 parts. There are like 30 for the mk2... its almost a 3:1, 4:1 (whatever) ratio of parts. Open it up! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine fairing toggle\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like the ability to toggle engine fairings on and off. I have a Saturn V replica which is 100% perfect aside from a minor fairing issue where the SPS engine will stick to the docking port of the LM... it\u0027s annoying. Moreover, in a more normal problem, the fairing can attach to any docking port. If you have an unmanned (uncontrolled) spacecraft attached via docking port or decoupler, you end up with this fairing in your face. It doesn\u0027t prevent docking, but it does stick to the craft... Annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInline 1m/2m monopropellant engine\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like a 1m and 2m inline monopropellant engine since the radial ones are nice, but I find very little use for them (efficiency is something that keeps me off, but that\u0027s a personal factor). I would like it if I could manage them more inline, it makes it easier to angle and position them when I do use them. The 2m variant is based off the SPS, especially the stock KW version which burns monopropellant. It makes it more realistic and also opens the use of monopropellant engines as a whole. Since it would be nice to have my fuel source and my maneuvering/docking propellant all being the same. Part reduction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInflatable Heatshields\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like a set of inflatable heatshields (such as the NASA LDSD). I would like one which can inflate to 2m, 5m, and 10m. Since if you have a station in transit moving towards Jool, and you need to slow down so you can put it into orbit around (for example) Laythe, if the station is massive, you will need a larger heatshield, and moreover, it will be a challenge to put the 5m heatshield into space since even with a fairing, its a giant block... not very aerodynamic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EControl surface responses reverse toggle\u003C/strong\u003E- It occasionally becomes an issue when making an aircraft when you try to test launch it and 1 (or all) of your control surfaces respond in reverse, now admittly you can\u0027t program for EVERY possible placement and use of the winglets, so, I suggest that you make it possible to toggle reverse response. Meaning, it reverses the control\u0027s response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAirbrakes on the larger control surfaces\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like it if you added airbrakes on the larger control surfaces (such as the large mk3 control surface, aeroplane tail fin, and space shuttle tail fin. I would reduce part count and be more realistic, as well as effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStronger LES\u003C/strong\u003E- As it stands, with my basic design for a LES blast cover, chutes, docking port and capsule, the LES cannot sufficiently work. Either it doesn\u0027t burn long enough, or it\u0027s too weak. Since it carries the forementioned stack 25ms(ish) from the rocket... not 100m, or anything close to what a real LES could do in reality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew IVA for the mk2 cockpits\u003C/strong\u003E- As it stands, the cockpits for the mk2 parts are identical... I have read the description and I say it isn\u0027t a sufficient excuse for it. It deserves to be different. People experiment, they make monsters just to see EVERY cockpit... and it IS a disappointment to them to find out that the mk2 parts are identical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERover Mount\u003C/strong\u003E- As it stands, rovers are a serious, serious, serious pain to work with. Great science collectors, and a fantastic way to complete contracts, but if you play ironman mode, then theyre too risky to use since they require constant testing and work (and that\u0027s just to get them to drive). Lastly, you have to find a way to get them on the surface, which your two best options are either a skycrane, parachutes or a landing pad (basically the rover on top of a LM descent stage). A skycrane is hard to make, especially since you have to fit the rover under the skycrane (and balance the CoM/CoT), and it\u0027s one of the safest options, \u003Cstrong\u003EIF\u003C/strong\u003E you land safely. If you come in too fast, your wheels are doomed and the mission is lost. You could go with parachutes, easiest option, but on Duna, they are not enough and you will surely smash into the surface at 300m/s\u002B. You could lastly make a landing pad, which is the easiest to make work, but you have to balance the CoM and CoT, and that isn\u0027t the biggest issue. The bigger issue is that it cannot be underneath any other spacecraft, meaning if you want to launch a massive interplanetary mission, the rover has to come up on it\u0027s own and not with the rest of the crafts, even if the launcher could manage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImpact Craters\u003C/strong\u003E- It would be cool to have craters form wherever and whenever you crash into a surface at say \u002B100m/s. It could just be a randomly generated crater image (like normal ground scatter) which is physics less. It could be deloaded when you leave the scene or loading area like ground scatter. It would just be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2m/5m SRBs, SRB segments\u003C/strong\u003E- KSP lacks 2m/5m SRBs... which is not only an issue, but also lacking. It makes SRBs that much less desirable (noting that they provide no benefit except on a launch stage, which is already limited). The biggest issue with even the large NASA ARM SRB (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E oohh the acronyms!) it isn\u0027t strong enough for the larger launchers. I would be tempted to MAKE my single stage, single engine launchers to be SRBs as it would reduce part count and also make it simpler. If Squad worries they are not realistic, then they should consider the Titan IIIC\u0027s SRBs which are of equal size to the core LFO tank. Also, the game should have SRBs segments, or SRB fuel tanks. They can also open up the use of SRBs since some are what you need, but they burn out way too early. Again, for realism, I point to NASA\u0027s shuttle SRB which has been converted into a 5..6(?) segment boaster. Case and point, the boaster has been lengthened. This should be achievable in stock KSP as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Emk3 probe core\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like a mk3 probe core since its the only part size without one. Moreover, the UAV used by the USAF, is unmanned and probe controlled (hence \u003Cstrong\u003EUA\u003C/strong\u003EV).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInflatable wings\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like to see a set of wings that could expand. This is a desirable feature so that A, you can recover boasters (hence \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vwh8hjjzAKs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E video) and B, create gliders for other atmospheric bodies without having to make a fairing and boaster design that looks ridiculous.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERadial attachment to the ISRU converter\u003C/strong\u003E- I don\u0027t know why, but as it stands, the ISRU converter cannot have anything attached. I don\u0027t know why this is, but considering the size of the converter I would think it should be possible. Maybe this is unintended... still.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEditor page scrolling\u003C/strong\u003E- I would like to see it possible to scroll through the part pages in the editor by scrolling... it is much easier than clicking. I think the developers would agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuggy Airbrakes/Airbrakes acting like control surfaces\u003C/strong\u003E- The airbrakes need to be fixed. The toggling option for action groups don\u0027t work and for some odd reason when decoupled they refuse to operate. Moreover, the airbrakes should not be working as control surfaces. I commend the developers for making it a possibility, but it should be left by default with all controls disabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStarting with EVA seats, manned\u003C/strong\u003E- The game should always have the external command seats mannable at start. The fact they can\u0027t be a is a SERIOUS deterrent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods that I feel should become stock: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EValVisor\u003C/strong\u003E- It should be stock since it should\u0027ve been stock. A tiny edit for something that oddly should\u0027ve been there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickScroll- As mentioned above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuickmute- AS mentioned above\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPortraitStats- I makes for knowing your Kerbals easier and better. I can tell at a glance whos a pilot and whos an engineer. If I am about to drive a rover across Duna, I want an engineer, which amongst a crew of 12, can be troubling. Same for pilots, if I want to launch a rocket back into orbit above Duna, I don\u0027t want the scientist flying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Joint Reinforcement (KJR)- This makes parts stronger and more realistic which with larger wings (to accommodate the mk3 parts and their lacking mk3 wing sizes) and rocket fairings, everything wobbles and breaks under normal loads. KJR not only removes the physics load crush, but also makes things realistically stronger. Which is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEditorTime- Maybe just me, but I find it a cool idea that time actually passes in the VAB/SPH. Gives more meaning to your build times, gives you a realistic deadline. However, a pause feature might be needed (maybe in conjunction with a settings menu?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELights Out- It has been day light in the VAB since day 1. It needs to show what\u0027s really going on outside. So the VAB should show darkness in the background when it\u0027s night instead of instantly become daylight. The VAB should have lights which turn on after a set time of day. So the rockets look the same but the background changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMenuStabilizer- I love the new camera wobble, but chasing the menu sucks and can ruin your mission fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroidDay- Do I honestly need to explain why this needs to be added?.. Yes? Well it should be added since it has several features would be nice to have stock. It\u0027s made by the developers \u003Cem\u003Ethemselves\u003C/em\u003E, and lastly the new solar panels, telescope and probe body are awesome. The solar panels have been needed for a long time. This mod is just a must have, and it should be stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtomicAge- This mod adds several engines which should become stock. Namely the .5m nuclear engine and the 2m nuclear engine. The air breathing nuclear engine is awesome, but admittly overpowered. So I suggest adding it as well, but it burns some radioactive element to keep the engine alight. This element should also be in the RTGs, and it slowly decays overtime reducing the overpoweredness of the RTG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVAEnchancement- This needs to be added since I\u0027m tired of having my Kerbals perpendicular to their spacecraft when I\u0027m trying to return them to their ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS/KIS- This is a cool feature which adds an awesome game feature. As the game is, rovers as is are very impractical. This mod lets you build rovers and such! Which is awesome. This can also be expanded to allow for more EVA activities since as it is, you can only perform an EVA report, soil sample and plant a flag. Otherwise it\u0027s pointless to perform an EVA. (pretty much only for posterity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalMechanics, Dangit, Entropy (etc)- This adds a greater level of realism as parts fail (like in reality). KM breaks stuff but makes it repairable (pushing the EVA front even further). It also makes it more of an engineering challenge. If you make the failure rate set to 0% (i.e disable it) then it could be a legitimate feature which I would enjoy and it would be awesome to actually have a use for the LES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPTips- A useful mod which new players would greatly appreciate and (in my opinion) is done in a very Kerbal fashion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E . I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESerious Kerbal Buisness/Stratagem (SKB)- This adds new strategies to the admin building which is somewhat lacking. I feel it just completes the admin building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermometer- It should be a stock feature that when you right click on something that it tells you its temperature. It\u0027s always useful info. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContractPacks- These add several contract packs which make the game far more interesting and diverse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T14:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T15:03:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esetting access from all menus -- agreed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elarger wings -- I disagree. even more parts?

The fact remains, it should be disabled by default. It\u0027s just an annoying factor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be OP? Sure. But then again the ISRU on Kerbin is OP since I can create a rocket for 350,000 but reduce the cost to 300,000 since its without fuel, then I can get it from the ground and move it to the launch pad and gain free fuel. Its almost cheating but its possible in game. It\u0027s less OP than that. So it should be a thing. Besides the Take Command mod and dozens of requests speak for themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
