Career mode is supposed to be a challenge of its own, but the addition of mods and add ons might alter the challenge offered by career mode. Some makes it easier, some harder, and some provide completely new ways of doing things. What are your thoughts on this? Should add ons be allowed in the final version of career mode, and if yes, how?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T19:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd ons should absolutely be allowed in career mode. As you stated some people like the game harder and some like it easier, and that\u0027s all right. They should be allowed to play the game the way they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Babycheesus","CreatedById":91556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T20:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAddons now like KW Rocketry for example have it\u0027s items spread in the tech tree, so it\u0027s up to the creators of the mods when to unlock the items. Since KSP is a single player game it doesn\u0027t really affect me if someone plays with big orange tanks and mainsails as the first unlocks so if someone wants to cheat like that, that\u0027s up to them. I will try to finish career without mods the first time I play through when the game is officially complete, but add-ons/mods will help keep it fresh when I replay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LtHeckard","CreatedById":83627,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T20:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that Mods in career mode should work just fine, just the modders will have to put the parts in the tech tree in the correct order so it doesn\u0027t get all buggy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueGothic","CreatedById":91715,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T04:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to see more scientific instruments for research possibilities. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I was thinking of that would require some work would be a telescope, much like Hubble. You can even have an arc come out from it that can show what direction its viewing. Maybe have different biomes this way of things outside of the system that you\u0027re looking for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother great one which I\u0027m sure you can put your own Kerbal kind of description for is an impact device. I\u0027m thinking of that probe send to the comet, to watch another probe sent with it impact the body to see what it did. I thought they did some similar experiments on the Moon. (Edit: Deep Impact mission, reference NASA.gov)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen what about a crane or small arm that could take soil samples instead of a kerbal? Much like the current rover on mars? I know somewhere in the .23 notes someone mentioned a mobile lab that can process experiments better, so you can have that lab requiring to be manned, and then be able to send out a rover to collect samples and bring them back to base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, can we have internal capsules for payload storage? I know that there are addons, but will there be anything stock coming in down the road?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then NASA just completed a project involving a probe on the moon sending a signal back with a laser instead of Radar. 20% reduction in power, and lighter payload too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that you have radar devices pointed at the surface by a probe from orbit, x-ray detectors, gamma ray detectors, even a basic camera (I know you can make some funny stuff for the science results for this), and a radio receiver that could work much like the telescope (Again, I know you can make some funny remarks about some random transmissions received).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T11:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOfcourse mods should be allowed.
