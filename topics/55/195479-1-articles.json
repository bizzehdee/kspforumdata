You could toggle which ones you wanted in it and that would change its weight and cost accordingly. There would also be an option to use a flat or 1.25 meter (for mounting in science jr.) back. In science mode it would be obviously better and in career it could add cost but be more resilient to heat. However, the main purpose is to reduce post count and clutter, so ships are less laggy and you dont have to click on multiple parts to run their experiments. This would also make rockets prettier, albeit less Kerbal. But the game has been moving in a less Kerbal more QOL direction for years (maneuver nodes and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E display are the ones I usually think of.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-09T03:08:23Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2020 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by catloaf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
