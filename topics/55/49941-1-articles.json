Most of them are fairly minor, but the one that really sticks out for me is just the sheer amount of clicking involved. To get the full value out of an experiment, you need to transfer it anywhere from 50 to 500 times, depending on how much science it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to make it so that experiments return 100% each time, just like crew reports, so you only need to generate and send them a few times, maybe a dozen at most for the really high-value ones. Of course, to keep things balanced, the amount of data that needs to be sent back for each experiment should be increased hugely as well, so that it takes roughly the same amount of time and electricity to make the transfer as before, just with far less clicking.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T21:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by AgentPaper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Terran","CreatedById":89165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T22:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy, then, would we have any reason to recover the craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeel","CreatedById":89647,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T22:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiving 100% science is not balanced, you just need to be able to actually perform the science without as much hassle, so. . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the science to a control group!
