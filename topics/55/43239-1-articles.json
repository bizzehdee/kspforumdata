It has the potential to make space travel significantly cheaper. It is a simplified, very low-budget magnetic sail. It can be used either to accelerate or brake an orbiting spacecraft. When direct current is pumped through the tether, it exerts a Lorentz force against the magnetic field, and the tether accelerates the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 2012, the company Star Technology and Research was awarded a $1.9 million contract to qualify a tether propulsion system for an orbital debris removal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
