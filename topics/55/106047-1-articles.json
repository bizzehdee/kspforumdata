Kerbin is 2nd to sun. 1st is Jool, that\u0027s being orbited by Mun, Minmus and Ike. 3rd one is Eeloo with Pol etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience values should be changed then: lower values on 3-moon Kerbin system and bigger ones on one-moon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:36:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey intentionally made the solar system the same, so that everyone would know what Duna or Jool is, not just that you have gone to some planet that looks like mars and is as big as venus or something. Procedural worlds are not bad, as long as all players use the same seed. All of the planetary bodies (save for Jool and the Sun) have some procedural elements, but they are all the same seeds for every player. You could take this one further. In Space Engine, the entire galaxy is procedural, but it has the same seed, so if you follow directions from one star to another, you will find the same stuff across different games. Kerbal Space Program may be able to use procedural planets for interstellar exploration if that ever becomes a thing, but they should have the same seed for any player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor game design however, custom-building planets and moons allows for more interesting places to be built. Maybe they could be based on something cool from Space Engine, as many of the planet-modding people would agree with, but the actual parameters are usually defined by the creator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PatPL","CreatedById":115556,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T18:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Random\u0022 option would me mainly for more advanced players - that\u0027s why \u0022Stock\u0022 should be left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be very nice option, that would increase difficulty, if stock one is becoming too easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
