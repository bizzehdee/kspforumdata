Not sure if this possibility has been covered already or if I\u0027m posting in the right area - so advance apologies if so.\n\nI was watching a video about Mercury on YouTube just now - Crash Course\u0027s\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtPAJr1ysd5yGIyiSFuh0mIL\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n- and the guy mentioned deep \u0027holes\u0027 at Mercury\u0027s poles that I though must have been the inspiration for the Moholes. He says the parts of these holes that are in constant shadow get cold enough to allow water ice from comet impacts, etc to stick around. That led me to think, \u0027hey, water ice in the moholes\u0027. Then to think that \u0027hey, good old H20 is a perfect universal resource\u0027. H20, can be broken into Hydrogen which can be used for fuel, and oxygen for the oxidizer and/or breathable air (possible usage in Life Support!). It\u0027s so simple; I don\u0027t think its much of a stretch of the imagination to find a resource like that all over the Kerbol System.\nNow, granted, I\u0027m pretty sure breaking H20 into its component elements is a rather inefficient proposition IRL, and I don\u0027t know for sure if Kerbals breath Oxygen. For that matter I\u0027m not sure any of these \u0027Real Life\u0027 elements - or their properties - exist in the KSP universe. Still, it was such a revelation I thought I had to share it. What do yall think?\n\n-Simpleton\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T19:25:19Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by simpleton876**\n  \ngrammar; clarity"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T19:20:05Z","Content":"Personally, I think it\u0027s a great idea just to replace the word \u0027ore\u0027 with the word \u0027water\u0027 and go at it.
