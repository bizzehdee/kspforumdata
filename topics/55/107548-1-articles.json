I imagine memory is an issue to adding entire planets, so I would speculate Squad would want to see how much resource (computer resource) usage is required to run the new Unity 5 or get a 64-bit version stable first, before adding more \u0022stuff\u0022 to it.\n\nI am purely speculating on this, I have no real idea if they even intend to add new planets in the future. Even if they don\u0027t intend to, they may change their minds later like they did with multiplayer. In any case, I wouldn\u0027t expect it in the near term."}]}
