Each module is given more distinct use-cases, which means the rocket design for a certain type of science collection changes depending on what you want to collect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, gravity scan is per-biome and at high and low space only. Seismic detection is for surface landings only. Temperature and atmosphere are high, low and surface, but biomes are not used. Mystery Goo and Surface Samples /must/ be returned to kerbin for analysis, which makes them higher difficulty and higher reward \u0027missions\u0027 effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt opens up more options; can make things like a gravity-scan probe that loops around (maybe on your ScanSAT probe), or a very light lander probe that just gets a seismic reading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe splitting of probes vs manned vs collection missions works well, and removing the transmit penalty on research differentiates probes vs collections. The transmit penalty in vanilla makes it saddening to do anything but bring all the science back every time on a generic manned ship with all the modules attached - it\u0027s always the same style mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ERemoving some of the sillier science acquisitions - EVA reports at the launchpad, etc, reduce spamminess and make for better science rewards for the /actual/ science collection missions.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI think this sort of direction would improve the gameplay mechanics of career mode for 0.24, without being such a significant development cost.
