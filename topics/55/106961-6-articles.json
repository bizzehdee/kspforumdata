But I very much dislike how you, the topic starter, and some other people complain about this issue. It is very counter-productive to what you want. The main problem is that you do not have any parts to use as structural components anymore. Previously, you could use wings for that, because they generated too little lift, and so a ....ton of wings on a plane could actually be very beneficial, thus supporting designs like yours. Your problem now however is that wings work like intended, generating a lot more lift and drag. Thus the only components you could use as body panels for a more freeform approach to plane designing, now generate too much drag to be useful in this way. So, instead of saying everything is broken, why not get to the core of your problem? With the new aerodynamics, you have lost the only parts that allowed you more creative freedom in plane construction.
