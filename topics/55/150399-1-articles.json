Several people in that thread lamented the fact that the storage units pull from each other before they pull from science parts, which causes overwriting and limits the ability to collect multiple samples automatically. Although this can still be done by hand, it is very tedious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI searched the forum a few different ways and this topic has not been given much attention. Since the thread mentioned had its last post about a month ago (now closed), I was wondering if there were any updates on this. Is there a way around this, or a menu setting or something? Or are the developers working on changing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T10:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/11539\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/11539\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the bug is there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-24T17:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u0027t see why containers should pull from other science containers at all. You have an transfer function to move data between them. Should also not pull experiments from science labs.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing the collect all on any ship with an science lab would be bad as you are likely to have an storage of previously returned experiments you want to feed the lab with,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWonder if this could be fixed with an mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
