As my ship collection has gotten larger, it is sometimes difficult to remember how I set them up. When playing with the craft of others, I need to discover them. Currently, it\u0027s not possible to see a summary of action group assignments, each group much be checked individually in the action group editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to allow the renaming of each group in the editor by the player, and automatically insert a list of the keys and group names in the vessel description under the vessel name in the VAB/SPH. So after setting them up it might look like this, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Toggle Jets (38km)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Toggle Intakes \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Toggle Rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Toggle Panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - Toggle Cargo Bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 - Release Payload Docking Clamp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 - Activate Science Package\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBksp - Everything will be fine, I promise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points if this list can be made available in the in-flight GUI as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T13:11:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 01:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed numbering.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
