However, bigger payloads are a pain. Space station and interplanetary ship modules are enormous and heavy, and require massive skyscrapers of two-meter tanks and rockets to get to orbit. For these loads, we\u0027re going to need even larger rocket parts on the three-meter scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same goes for spaceplanes. Those small wings just don\u0027t provide enough lift for a heavyweight craft, and trying to construct large delta wings usually leaves the craft unstable and pretty ugly. This could be resolved with larger wings. We\u0027re talkin\u0027 jumbo-jet wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to pester the developers. Really, you guys have made the BEST game I have ever played, and I know that you guys are working really hard. We all love building bigger and bigger ships, and we\u0027re all excited to see what you guys will have for us in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
