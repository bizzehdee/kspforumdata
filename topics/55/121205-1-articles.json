It\u0027s basically a 1.25m superengine to rival the likes of the Rhino and the Mainsail made by the people at Jeb\u0027s Junkyard. It does, however, have a few problems: 1) it\u0027s 1.25m, 2) it doesn\u0027t function under 1/6 thrust, and 3) it\u0027s a fuel guzzler. How\u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E, if you\u0027re not a fan of/haven\u0027t unlocked Rockomax parts it\u0027s pretty darned useful. Besides, the (whatever the part of the engine is attached to the fuel tank) is a nice shade of mahogany. It might look a \u003Cem\u003Elittle \u003C/em\u003Eugly on a 2.5m or larger fuel tank, but there are such things as adapters. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s really the only idea I have right now: my brain ran out of fuel while circularizing orbit. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-19T00:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.625 meter SRBs?
