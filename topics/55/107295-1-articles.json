They increased it by almost 50% for 1.0.2 even. A high DragMultiplier makes it impossible for Kerbals to die from falling. Since Kerbals\u0027 aerodynamics cannot be modified this should be the baseline value. I find that \u003Cstrong\u003E4.5\u003C/strong\u003E is sensible value, there is a small chance for a Kerbal to bounce but overall most impacts with the ground will be certain death, without the terminal velocity being overly fast either. It is a good compromise value. As a bonus this also causes parachutes to behave much more realistically, gradually opening rather than coming to a stop. Having an opening altitude of at least 700-1000m is advisable, and the deployment feels satisfying. Downside: default opening value is always too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe default cubemultiplier of 0.06 seems fine, for regular parts this seems to override the dragmultiplier, causing most rockets to fly as you\u0027d expect even with the above dramatic change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAngularDragMultiplier\u003C/strong\u003E should probably be lowered a bit, 2.0 seems a bit stiff. \u003Cstrong\u003E1.6\u003C/strong\u003E feels more natural to how a plane should roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E#2 change to make:\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003ELiftMultiplier\u003C/strong\u003E - With the default value I feel like I can take off anything on a dime. Again this was upped in 1.0.2 causing the soupy feel. I find that instead a dramatic lowering to \u003Cstrong\u003E0.023\u003C/strong\u003E feels reasonably good for most of the airplanes I built. I have no math to back up what this value should be for certain wings, but I also doubt the lift values were balanced that carefully to begin with. Realism is for someone else to deal with. At this level you need to get some speed before the plane will take off on its own, but not too much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELiftDragMultiplier\u003C/strong\u003E I set to 0.032, a little higher than the lift. I have no idea what it should be, there\u0027s probably some ratio of lift to drag that is common for wings that you could use here but I do not know it. Maybe this is too low or maybe my jet is more aerodynamic than I thought. It seems that you can get up to some ludicrous speeds with this. If in doubt, leave at default. Though the 1.0.2. value almost slows you to a stop even with fast aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBodyLiftMultiplier\u003C/strong\u003E seems like it works best when matched with DragMultiplier, \u003Cstrong\u003E4.5\u003C/strong\u003E again. It\u0027s gentler than the default but will still flip an unstable rocket even against reaction wheels all the same. Seems to have virtually no effect on airplanes no matter how high you crank it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also recommend setting the convection values back to 1.0 levels and using the ablator heatshield fix, so that re-entry damage is actually possible again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal values look like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EdragMultiplier = 4.5\u003Cbr\u003EdragCubeMultiplier = 0.06\u003Cbr\u003EangularDragMultiplier = 1.6\u003Cbr\u003EliftMultiplier = 0.023\u003Cbr\u003EliftDragMultiplier = 0.032\u003Cbr\u003EbodyLiftMultiplier = 4.5\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:59:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the body lift, did you try Mk 2 parts?
