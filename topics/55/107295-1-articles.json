They increased it by almost 50% for 1.0.2 even. A high DragMultiplier makes it impossible for Kerbals to die from falling. Since Kerbals\u0027 aerodynamics cannot be modified this should be the baseline value. I find that **4.5** is sensible value, there is a small chance for a Kerbal to bounce but overall most impacts with the ground will be certain death, without the terminal velocity being overly fast either. It is a good compromise value. As a bonus this also causes parachutes to behave much more realistically, gradually opening rather than coming to a stop. Having an opening altitude of at least 700-1000m is advisable, and the deployment feels satisfying. Downside: default opening value is always too low.\n\nThe default cubemultiplier of 0.06 seems fine, for regular parts this seems to override the dragmultiplier, causing most rockets to fly as you\u0027d expect even with the above dramatic change.\n\n**AngularDragMultiplier** should probably be lowered a bit, 2.0 seems a bit stiff. **1.6** feels more natural to how a plane should roll.\n\n#2 change to make: **LiftMultiplier** - With the default value I feel like I can take off anything on a dime. Again this was upped in 1.0.2 causing the soupy feel. I find that instead a dramatic lowering to **0.023** feels reasonably good for most of the airplanes I built. I have no math to back up what this value should be for certain wings, but I also doubt the lift values were balanced that carefully to begin with. Realism is for someone else to deal with. At this level you need to get some speed before the plane will take off on its own, but not too much.\n\n**LiftDragMultiplier** I set to 0.032, a little higher than the lift. I have no idea what it should be, there\u0027s probably some ratio of lift to drag that is common for wings that you could use here but I do not know it. Maybe this is too low or maybe my jet is more aerodynamic than I thought. It seems that you can get up to some ludicrous speeds with this. If in doubt, leave at default. Though the 1.0.2. value almost slows you to a stop even with fast aircraft.\n\n**BodyLiftMultiplier** seems like it works best when matched with DragMultiplier, **4.5** again. It\u0027s gentler than the default but will still flip an unstable rocket even against reaction wheels all the same. Seems to have virtually no effect on airplanes no matter how high you crank it.\n\nI also recommend setting the convection values back to 1.0 levels and using the ablator heatshield fix, so that re-entry damage is actually possible again.\n\nFinal values look like this:\n\n    dragMultiplier = 4.5dragCubeMultiplier = 0.06angularDragMultiplier = 1.6liftMultiplier = 0.023liftDragMultiplier = 0.032bodyLiftMultiplier = 4.5"},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T03:59:21Z","Content":"For the body lift, did you try Mk 2 parts?

It does seem that those parts have wing lift also, which is not affected by the body lift value of course.\n\nAlso on further testing the 0.032 liftdrag value seems to be exactly right to match the speeds I was getting in 1.0 after all. Lucky guess! 0.036 can work for a bit more of a conservative choice also."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T04:56:27Z","Content":"So is the goal to choose the one config to rule them all, the convince squad to adapt that community playtested config as stock?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T05:25:13Z","Content":"Keep in mind that the more you cut drag to support spaceplanes, the higher terminal velocity for capsules will be.

It only applies to certain things like chutes and kerbals. At the very least the effect on parts is so small as to be pointless to consider. You also cannot edit the kerbal aerodynamics. 8.0 drag = immortal kerbals. In that case, it is preferable to edit every other part than to edit something that cannot be edited.
