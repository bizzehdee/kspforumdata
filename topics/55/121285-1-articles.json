Now, it\u0027s not an SSTO-engine. Many people claim that yes it is, because it\u0027s short, and it won\u0027t be smashed, but that\u0027s a far-fetched argument. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good thing in an aerospike is that it produces relatively constant thrust and isp, making it useful for EVE landers. However, I\u0027d like to make it a perfect spaceplane-engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe high atmospheric isp is useless, as there\u0027s nearly no atmospheric pressure on the altitudes where your jets flame-out. The good thing is that it offers a rather good efficiency even on orbit. Because on spaceplanes, you usually don\u0027t have many engine slots, but you have a large, heavy fuselage, high thrust is essential. What I would like: an aerospike, wich has nearly identical vacuum stats with the Poodle engine, but it\u0027s size 1. This would be awesome for spaceplanes. Maybe more mass, as aerospikes have high mass, not simply 1 ton... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the best idea, is that due to its pointy shape, it should have minimal drag! With spaceplanes, regular rocket motors produce a HUGE percentage of your drag! If the aerospike had less drag, it would be awesome for spaceplanes again! But if the aerospike is same as the Poodle in vacuum, and a lot better than it in atmo, why should we even use the Poodle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Cheaper\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Lower-tech\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Can be stack attached\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-When stack attached, it has less drag due to that fairing\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-Aerospike having higher mass (so that they are not identical) (Low TWR)\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022margin-left:2px;\u0022\u003E-It\u0027s rocket style\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut wait a second!

Not. How. It. Works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude-compensating nozzles are not magic fairy dust. All they do is lower (not even eliminate, just lower!) the penalty of using an engine at an altitude (i.e. ambient pressure) for which it was not optimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think it should provide the same Isp in vacuum and at sea level, I have a simple experiment for you. Make a compressed-air rocket motor (say, pump a soda bottle full of air). Now, measure how much thrust it provides in the air...and then measure it again underwater. That\u0027s about what we\u0027re talking about here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to remember that what makes an engine produce less thrust (i.e. have a lower Isp) at sea level is not some magic \u0022I hate you sea level!!!11one\u0022 force, but \u003Cem\u003Ethe pressure of air.\u003C/em\u003E No matter what your nozzle is, you\u0027re going to do remarkably better in vacuum than at sea level, because in vacuum there\u0027s 0 pascals of air pressure, and at sea level there\u0027s a hundred thousand pascals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this class of nozzle *does* do is eliminate the need for different engines at different altitudes. That means instead of needing a small bell at sea level (with relatively poor vacuum performance), and a large bell in vacuum (with utterly horrific sea-level performance), you get one nozzle that performs rather well at both. And so it does: the ingame Aerospike has better sea level Isp than most boosters, and better vac Isp than most upper stage engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EIn my suggestion, I didn\u0027t care about atm isp, I just state that it should have high vacuum isp.
