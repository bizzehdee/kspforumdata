Even more often the answer is: \u0022A simulation inside a simulation (game) is somehow stupid...\u0022. Well, both points are valid, but most people forget: we have an internal testing-site: SANDBOX-mode. I often use it for such testing purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday it occured to me: Why can\u0027t I transfer my designs from one save to the other - IN GAME? I know it is possible to fiddle in the directories and copy\u0027n\u0027paste a design from save A to B - but it would be better if that was possible inside the game - maybe with an additional check if the necessary parts are already unlocked (if transferring to a career-file). And in addition to that maybe a \u0022quick save game changer\u0022-feature to switch between two specific save-games (in my example a career and a sandbox-file)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I made my point clear, it is just a small suggestion for making a perfect game even more perfect (if that is possible).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T08:53:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by dyson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T09:47:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyep, i think a save as global checkbox or similar would be the best so the craft would be saved into a directory which is accessible from every game, like the pre-designed (stock) crafts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T10:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be cool.
