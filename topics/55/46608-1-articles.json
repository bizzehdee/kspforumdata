It\u0027s a big troublemaker between and during maneuvers. Can the game be convinced to hold the setting regardless of view, between ship switches, etc., until told otherwise? It would really help make complex craft more useable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T17:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first though is that it is resetting the navball alignment to the part you are IVAing from, which will usually be the core part as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you test with a cabin that is not the core part but has it\u0027s alignment flipped?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T17:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, this is bugging me, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be nice to manually set a \u0022default control part\u0022 while in VAB. could be incorporated into the action groups menue...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T04:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eswitching the point of control aligns the navball to the control source.
