WOW has an engineering trinket that acts like a telescope. It ignores the draw distance \u0026amp; de-clutter algos and uses a very narrow FOV camera to limit rendered geometry and deliver a telescope view of distant places. KSP could technically do something similar so pilots could get a good look at the surface and pick some interesting place to set down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface travel is very limited \u0026amp; \u0027flying around\u0027 is not very practical for most bodies - so this would add some desirable and engaging capability in a reasonable way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose once you have seen something interesting you\u0027d want to be able to \u0027put a pin in the map\u0027 to mark it as something interesting to come back to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T22:16:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhen in IVA you can zoom with the scroll wheel, you can also double click windows to get a better view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T22:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eonce zoomed in via mouse wheel you can also click and hold mouse 3 for an extra bit of zoom.

I took a quick look and will play around some more. I\u0027ll have to check out the DE mod also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder though, when in the \u0027iva window mode\u0027:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- they seem to \u0027zoom the sky box\u0027 or something, resulting in star splotches - it breaks the immersion, it would look better with the regular non iva mode skybox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the double click and regular \u0027look out the window\u0027 seem to have different orientations - almost like they were different windows altogether, is that on purpose for some reason I miss?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- is there more/finer surface geometry? ideally a telescope view would show you the finest detail surface geometry - might as well since it\u0027s \u0027there\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
