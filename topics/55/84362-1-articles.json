Imagine having your Kerbal giving a thumbs up to the camera after your first Mun landing, or striking a pose with an aircraft / rocket design you are proud of. On a related note, imagine what youtubers could do with a tool like this, it would be a huge storytelling tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my short stint as a KSP Youtuber I\u0027ve always found myself thinking about how cool would it be if Kerbals could emote, even a small set of movements and gestures could open a whole new level for creative people to squeeze stories, comedy and drama.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are what make this game different, without them this game would be another space flight simulator.

It would make them seem way more alive and fun. If they\u0027ve landed on a new planet or moon, there will be a high chance that some sort of happy animation will play.
