Not native to me and stuff. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I discovered seismometers in Career mode and started using it it really hit me hard. Current sience-generating is way off. The mentioned seismometer is a good example of it. A time-point observation really has a zero sientific value. The only way you can get some valuable observation is to collect data for some continious time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame with thermometers. Barometers. Weather-computers (which to be frank should include bothe thermometer amd barometers in it, but irrelevant...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I started to think of a system that would be easy to calculate and give more reasonable way of collecting sience... And piece by peice I got something together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the modules generate observations not on activation, but rather use activation as \u0022Start observation\u0022 point. And after this module will produce random location-specific observations that are then stored in crew-capsule memory (which also may be limited and expandable by ship modules) just like EVA-reports and surface sample are now. So instead of running same experiment several times you activate a module and wait for it to generate several observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an addition you may limit sience module resources and make those deplete while the module is active (like if you run out of goo you no longer can observe goo).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I mentioned there should be several observations in each location. And each observation is not guarateed to happen. They have probability. And by tweaking this probabilityes you divide your sience modules into several groups, like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Few observations with high probability (5-10%/second) each. - Goo-can, Materials lab. These modules are best used for \u0022hit and run\u0022 mission, where you get into the area for a short time and don\u0027t intend to return for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Several observations with low probability - Seismograph, Magnetometre, Gravitometre - These modules are best used for \u0022probe-style\u0022 surveys, when you leave them in area for extended time before recovering their results. Return them too fast - and high hancec you end up with no data of value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course ther might be some modules that have the combination of both. Like you get some data quickly. But this data has value only during first times you observe it. And by monitoring for extended time you get the chance to score some observation od anomalies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a bit of complicating, but making things more realistic you can attach those \u0022special observations\u0022 not to modules, but to locations. And as this thing happens in location active modules in this location register it.

I like that this makes a bigger event out of right-click, Science! and gives more results from a single mission. Starting the experiment and watching it generate multiple results would be fun. The requirement for the player to potentially wait much longer for each experiment sounds annoying, though. Not sure how to improve on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea that science instruments (and Kerbals?) could \u0022witness\u0022 and collect science from special phenomenon if they\u0027re in the right place at the right time. Some examples might be eclipses, aurora, periodic seismic events, volcano/geiser eruptions, weather patterns. I would try to reduce the random factor and make these events as predictable as possible, so that specific missions to explore these phenomenon are not prone to random failure through no fault of the player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-10T22:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to this.
