This behaviour is very very good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, on one square you might have copper, a pipe, an electrical wire, and a ladder. First click you select the copper and can choose an action to do with it, next click you select the pipe, then the wire, then the ladder. No item is unavailable to be clicked on, the only input from the user is a click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is needed in KSP, especially in the map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have two craft 3km from each other then you just cannot switch craft reliably. You are too far to use [ and ] and you are told to use the map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you use the map you cannot zoom in far enough for the craft to appear distinct so you cannot click on the other craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead you must exit the flight screen, go to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, enter the map view there, then select your craft from the list, then select to control it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just not good in any way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf multiple clicks cycled through possible results then you would click twice in the map view to select the other craft and switch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMuch better. More like the behaviour I would expect from a game that has been released...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT : This would also be handy if you have a manoeuvrer node and other items too close to separate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-22T10:46:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2018 10:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by John FX\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnailsAttack","CreatedById":184399,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T16:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I\u0027ve had problems like this \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan\u003Ea lot\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.
