Sometimes this can get pretty difficult when your trying to match up orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be nice if we could toggle them on or off, when they are toggled off you can only see the orbit path of the current selected ship, and another ship that is \u0022targeted\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways.. seems like it would be easy, and pretty handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T01:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProtip: If you hover your mouse towards the top of the screen while in map mode, you\u0027ll see a set of toggles you can click or right-click to determine whether or not a given category of craft will show up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T02:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should go in suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been raised before, and I agree there are situations when it would be useful. I used to have so much stuff in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, as long the things you\u0027re flying and targeting are different types of craft to the surrounding objects, turning of other craft types in map view is a good solution most of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T18:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick bump, and I know about the \u0022toggle for different craft\u0022 problem is, if I am flying up a refueler its labeled as a satellite, and 90% of the stuff I have around kerbin is a satellite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno, a toggle for everything but your current ship and the target ship would be nice.
