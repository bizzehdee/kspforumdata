I suggest a menu that comes up when you right click the SAS button and lets you select one of three modes: \u0022Auto\u0022, \u0022Damping\u0022, and \u0022Locked\u0022. This would allow us to manually choose the most useful mode for what we need to do, and it would also make troubleshooting \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E easier because it would let us see if the problem is from one of the specific modes, or from the logic for auto-switching modes. And as long as we\u0027re adding right-click menus, the RCS could use a similar one to toggle lever arms on, off, or auto.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing is that now that SAS lets you move while it\u0027s enabled, automatically switching off SAS when switching from LIN to ROT in docking mode is kind of useless. I\u0027d suggest letting LIN and ROT have independent settings for SAS and RCS that don\u0027t change when you switch between them. For example, sometimes I want to have RCS enabled only in LIN mode, but have SAS enabled in both modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T13:45:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by chaos_forge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
