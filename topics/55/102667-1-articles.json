Daze mentioned in the thread about one that had been stickied previously which was the first time I had seen another stickied suggestion. It seemed like the suggestion was promoted by a particular mod as no other mod had posted and the normal convention is a small post inside the thread when a mod stickies it saying why. This really seems like a good policy for wider adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad you stickied the suggestion as part of a new \u0027featured suggestion\u0027 section and actually posted that in the thread there would have been no discussion, disagreement or negative posts as there would have been no room for speculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no need to spit the dummy and not sticky suggestions, the description of your plan sounds actually good and would highlight suggestions but I must ask, why did you not use a similar format to \u0027threads of the month\u0027 on the main page if that was your plan?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would hope that is is plain that just stickying things without explanation will obviously lead to speculation and (possibly intense) discussion and that any changes in the way things are done should come with a little note saying what has changed and why. For months now the forum has just been asking to be kept informed of changes. This is a very good example of a case in point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is natural in the absence of other information to ask \u0027why did X get treatment Y when Z did not?\u0027. If the mod who stickies says \u0027This week/month I have decided to start featuring suggestions and stickying them for a bit\u0027 then pretty much everyone would go \u0027cool, I wonder what will be next\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would have replied in the stickied thread about sticky threads but that is locked and just seems to be a \u0027name and shame\u0027 post (to me at least, being one of the named) when a couple of PM\u0027s could have let me and raptor know if that was the intention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA generic post like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0027Due to the recent intense discussion regarding stickied suggestions I have decided to not continue the policy.
