It\u0027s just data either way, right? Why the science loss? I feel that datalogging type sensor devices should not only have a 100% return rate, but have an option to periodically/automatically transmit if power is available. This should be incentive to send an unmanned probe somewhere to collect readings before sending a manned mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEVA report, I suppose someone telling a story vs written account is debatable.. but crew report is 100%, why would EVA report be less? Not much issue here either way.
