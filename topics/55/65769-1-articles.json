It gives a reason for you not to treat your Kerbals as replacable crash-test dummies and would not just make multiple crew vehicles useful on their, it would also add an element of choosing which Kerbal to use for which action. Have a suicide mission? Choose the scientist Kerbal and leave your experienced Pilot out of harms way. I would argue that hard consequences such as being unable to move the ship without a Pilot is too drastic. Perhaps have roles simply influence how efficient an action can be done. A Scientist would return the most science when doing an EVA Report, but Pilots would still be able to them just not as well as Scientist. Conversely, a Scientist piloting a spacecraft would just not be able to handle it as responsively as a Pilot would. So you could still fly the craft, but it\u0027d react a bit like when you don\u0027t have enough torque on a spacecraft, i.e. slugglish.
