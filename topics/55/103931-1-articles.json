Navball numbers and Altimeter GUI are too washed out. I cannot see them good on my monitor. They can be made more crisp ?\n\nI agree, I use EnhancedNavBall mod to scale up the Navball (granted my eyesight is terrible), but I wish it was stock. I know you can scale the GUI in the settings but I don\u0027t want to scale the whole thing, just the parts with small text. Altimeter looks fine though, unless you are trying to read the analog version, but I have no idea why that is even there really. You can also use Texture Replacer to put a better NavBall texture. I use a [high contrast black \u0026 white navball](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/39748012114704884/FB5A91FB87D21C91646FC75017C70D63AA6D0E45/) which make it a lot easier to see.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. We need a default compass (N, S, E and V).\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t make much sense in space. Heading should be all you need. Just remember 0 = N, 90 = E, 180 = S, and 270 = W. The numbers on the runway indicate it\u0027s direction too btw. Heading / 10.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 3. Can we colect data from the debris, debris (ship parts etc.) that may degrade over time in space ? Debris may become smaller over time and thus degrade in space.\n\nYes, you can collect science data from any debris that is not destroyed by recovering it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 4.
