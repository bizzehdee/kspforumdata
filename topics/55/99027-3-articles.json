For a Minmus mission you\u0027d only need a small LS container, not much more to consider. You really only have to start thinking carefully about it as you start building space stations and interplanetary missions. The general idea is that the scrubbers and greenhouses greatly reduce the amount of raw storage you need, without eliminating the necessity to pre-plan. You could for instance mount a 6 kerbal Duna mission either with 2 medium LS tanks, a Waste-o-matic Sr. and an ISRU setup to regenerate LS and fuel, or just a hydroponics bay and a Waste-o-matic Jr. to fully recycle life support. That\u0027s just a couple of extra parts per mission, but at least you\u0027d have to carefully consider the options and integrate it into your larger mission strategy. Maybe one option is best for the payload and crew count you\u0027re shooting for, or perhaps you plan to leave some equipment on the surface as the start of a new colony, or maybe you need to extend things because you\u0027re visiting multiple worlds in the same mission; with just a few different options the process of optimizing and discerning becomes an integral part of the process of mission planning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T22:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt buffs probes, creates the importance of supply runs, opens doors for late game add-ons such as habitats, to grow food and thus keep a sustainable space base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut before late game can come, we need to figure out how to manage life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince life support is spent over time, it needs to be handled by keep track of time.
