I\u0027d recommend instead a \u0022Min Radar Altitude\u0022 activation setting. And a \u0022kPa per sq. cm\u0022 setting. This would cause the chutes to properly open only after you fall below the stress threshold of the parachute. Because a speed limit means nothing, when you\u0027re in the high atmo; and pressure is almost nil."}]}
