One time I saved a sub-assembly with the starting control piece (Command Pod Mk. 1) and when it saved it disappeared as expected but then I couldn\u0027t add it back to the sub-assembly. Since my initial control piece was missing, my building tree reset and I had to add a new one to be allowed to continue my rocket build.
