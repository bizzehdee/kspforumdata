Now, some may be asking, \u0022What do you mean?\u0022. I\u0027m going to explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow Politics in KSP Could Work Out\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is. You\u0027re the top director of a space agency. Now, how will politics factor in? For example, lets say PlayerA is starting a new game in career mode. After he/she makes his profile, he will have a option of countries to work for. These countries will be listed, and will have different tech-trees to accomadate different cultures, different attitudes, and different ways for these nations to slowly advance to the stars and beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Country A may be advanced in manned spaceflight, but very lacking in spaceplanes and probes, while Country B has a barely moving space program, but gives you probes and planes from the start of the tech tree, in the first few research science tiers. After selecting a country, the player is given the parts and the first tier. Now they\u0027ll launch and do their stuff. Easy, right? Not exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPolitics and Budgeting\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA successful flight (In terms of science recieved and wheter the Kerbals survived) means more funds, higher approval ratings from the press, better PR, and less chance of you recieveing a bad quarterly review from the leader of said country. For example, ket\u0027s say Player A goes to the Mun and back later in his career. Once he successfully recovers his ship, he will recieve a GUI explaining the impacts of the mission on the country and goverment, and will be given messages such as...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: \u0022Due to the success of Munshot-5, the President of the United Proviences would like to thank you for your services. The success of the mission has also prompted the United Provincal Parliament to authorize an further 500000 in funding for your agency. The 78 science earned from this mission has greatly pleased our scientists, and you are now permitted to go ahead with your Duna Exploration programmme.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: \u0022After the accident of Munshot-5 that has killed the astronauts Bill, Bob, and Jeb, the United Provincal Parliament has not authorized any further spending and ha ordered an cut of 5000 from your budget.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m just wondering. Maybe Politics would only be factored in at a certain level of difficullty (Lets say there are three levels. Easy, Normal, Hard. Politics are in Normal and Hard.)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"99TheCreator","CreatedById":31144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T21:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo. I control my space program, anyone who tries to mess with it gets an all expense paid flight straight into being a new crater on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T21:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, the way I see this game is: Kerbals \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Elike\u003C/span\u003E love exploring space, and therefore send 95 % of their global GDP into the space program.
