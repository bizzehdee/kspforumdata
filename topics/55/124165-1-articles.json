I don\u0027t know about XBox or Playstation but we don\u0027t have access to the file system on the Wii U, so Squad or Flying Tiger would have to add an import function. I doubt file format will be a big concern. It certainly would be nice to have that degree of flexibility though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother concern would be mods.
