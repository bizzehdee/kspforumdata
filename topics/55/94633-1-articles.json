But I did figure a way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou treat all warping as an instance. The If you warp ahead you do so and it sets what you did as an automatic thing in the game. others can see it and impact it and you can check it to make sure it\u0027s not affect in a bad way. It basically just sets it out ahead of time and puts in back in the game. then when done it\u0027s set up to happen like any other predetermined process. if it\u0027s affected it\u0027s can treat it like a flight plan and try to get back on schedule or it can be stopped. Basically treat it like an instanced add meneurver. but you leave the instance afterwords. It\u0027s a mode basically. After words it safed in a minimal form as a flight path and the computer tries to carry it out. If something stops it from being able to be carried out(fuel etc) you can be notified by message. Or you can be notified by message if you have the tech that would send such messages. Else you have to watch it.Then it\u0027s like everything else you leave in space floating around. Very simple!! 8) If you need to go back to it you simply go back to the ship in real time or you reinstance to redo it and leave the comp to run it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how would that work? any major flaws in the idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T03:23:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer is on the list of things not to suggest for several reasons, one of which is that they are already planning to implement it.
