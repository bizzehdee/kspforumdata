And they wont transmit any faster. Sure you might save some time if it didn\u0027t toggle but the solution is to use more antennas. I have 3 of them that way I can send data repeatedly from one goo pod and once science pod. Antennas will toggle and transmit in as they become available, no interaction needed. Probably how it was intended. Use more antennas and you wont have a problem and you can send more data at once. Its not like they are heave or anything plus the simplest once seems to work just as well as the more power hungry once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
