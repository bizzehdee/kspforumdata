Currently and in the past many new players would download the game and if they dislike the current state of the game it would be very rare for them to give it a second look later down the line. People don\u0027t tend to make the connection that an alpha game is something that will be much more refined once fully completed. This rough uncut version of KSP is still beautiful, but if squad wants to reap the rewards of this excellent piece of art they will also need to recognize that new customer base will come and a portion (however sad) will leave. The greatest addition of players needs to come at a point when not only the game is closest to completion but in a time when the community will be thriving. I believe the addition of multiplayer would be ideal for this. It would bring many more players that want to play together combined with everyone in this excellent community begging their friends to play with them. This would bring many new people into a complete bug free version of the game. Also with the addition of multiplayer connections through the community would skyrocket. All of this word of mouth would essentially be free advertising for KSP, which could come at no better time than the end of the alpha stage. I fear squad may jump the gun and implement multiplayer before all the seams are ironed out which could actually lead to a significant amount of people leaving who may not have left if the game was finely polished. I know that all of you reading this love KSP but the simple fact is that not everyone does. I just want as many people as possible to find Kerbal Space Program and I want them to enjoy themselves, go on to create challenges for each other, learn a bit of rocket science on the way, and add to the game whether that be through a youtube series or a great mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand many of you want multiplayer ASAP but I hope all of you should come to realize that making this game the best it can be is really the most amazing thing that can be done for the community. Expanding a great community would only improve KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not saying that squad should quit adding onto the game after completion, but as far as features go I do believe multiplayer should be the capstone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso this is an opinion.

Please don\u0027t take it as me dissing multiplayer per se, I just disagree with the sentiment that it\u0027s the single most important feature for the next release. Which is why it might be useful for someone to take an impartial poll to see for which percentage of the player base this is an important feature, how many think it\u0027s \u0022nice to have\u0022, and how many aren\u0027t interested at all.
