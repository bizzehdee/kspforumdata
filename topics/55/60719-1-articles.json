And so it happens that sometimes I accidentally rip off parts of a carefully staged asparagus design. Placing the parts back on the rocket in exactly the same place, and having all the fuel lines and struts back in the correct position takes more time than it should. Sometimes it just works, sometimes it just doesn\u0027t want to fit anymore. Therefore I would like to suggest these small improvements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEscape key cancels the current action and returns the state just as if I didn\u0027t rip the rocket in half\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUndo and Redo buttons and shortcuts (Ctrl Z, Ctrl Y)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
