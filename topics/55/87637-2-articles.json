Some of this may just be a repeat in different words, but hopefully it shows a little more insight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling should be reflective of real-life proposals for ISRU\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Players, new and old, draw inspiration from actual space activities and will want to imitate what they see (or should wind up engineering similar missions without realizing it). Having a mechanic that has no basis in reality will confuse players and break immersion. A \u0022YOU\u0027VE RUN OUT OF FUEL! PAY X FUNDS TO CONTINUE!\u0022 system would fail this need. (I don\u0027t really think this is where Squad is heading, but it is a possible implementation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling should be obvious in its usefulness and in its implementation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Similar to how the CLAW is immediately recognizable and can be used with no prerequisites for capturing asteroids (something in real life that would require much more complexity), \u003Cstrong\u003Ea DRILL could be a one part system for handling refueling\u003C/strong\u003E (handling the entirety of collecting the rocks, performing chemical processing, and pumping out desireables). It\u0027s use is immediately obvious and it\u0027s benefit (extracting fuel) and downsides (mass, power draw, possible durability considerations) are easily understood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExtraneous parts should be avoided\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A new tank (or 3 or 10) for containing rocks (or other raw resource) will not be immediately interesting and will imply that some amount of the player\u0027s time will be spent hauling rocks, which have no use on their own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A converter part immediately follows from having tanks of rocks to provide something to DO with the rocks. Since it is just a chain link between an extraction tool and a pair of tanks, a player will see this only as a requirement and not something that provides a benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe simplifying of refueling to a single part does not preclude complexity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Though the DRILL might be just one part, that part\u0027s behavior can be made interesting in dynamic ways. Using the DRILL in different places should yield different types of resources. Being able to drill not only on planets, but on asteroids, and maybe even parts (poor Bill!) opens up more places the DRILL could be utilized for fun and profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Just because there\u0027s no rock tanks and converters does not mean you don\u0027t still have to move around all that fuel! If building infrastructure is what a player wants to do, setting up drills in permanent places and creating fuel depots is definitely possible (and useful!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe DRILL sounds like it would be tempting to stick onto any landing vessel since, hey, free fuel!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The DRILL needs to require enough ElectricCharge, be massive enough, bulky enough, expensive enough, and high enough on the tech tree to avoid its use becoming too trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI can just get fuel wherever I land, right?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Spreading different resources out across different biomes would make the landing site for a mission crucially important (or necessitate roving solutions). Either by picking a biome that has access to multiple resources, or by straddling the border between biomes to ensure access to both\u0027s resources should be a consideration to a player. Liquid Fuel, Oxidizer, Monopropellant, and Xenon could potentially all be found at the same time in one rare biome, but more likely you\u0027d find 1 or 2 resources in each one (or find ZERO useful resources in some barren places). Minmus\u0027 flats could be veritable frozen lakes of Liquid Fuel with nothing else present, while MonoProp and Oxidizer could be found up on the midlands, and the slopes might be useless for extraction. Balance discussions now involve deciding which planets and where on them are easier to perform ISRU missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHaving a new mechanism in-game for distinguishing biomes would be useful for this!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If different biomes have different resources, players need to know they\u0027re landing in the right spot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, how do we know which biome to visit?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027m trying to avoid adding parts and repetitive activities, so I\u0027m hesitant to suggest a scanning mechanism like Kethane\u0027s... Instead, we could make use of our various science experiment parts to tell us about the composition of the biomes in question. Materials studies, mystery goo, gravioli detectors, etc. could reveal resources that could be extracted, and since we are already doing these experiments, it would not add any new tasks. It\u0027s worth mentioning that revealing the resource would be handy, but the biomes would likely always have the same resources throughout different saves and playthroughs so it\u0027s possible to just know ahead of time what will be where (especially if there is some logic to the placement of resources, i.e. Ice=Oxidizer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, how long is this gonna take?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The action of resource gathering should be instantaneous or at least on the level of solar panel/RTG rates of generation. Time-warping on the active vessel should have the same effect as with solar panel/RTG ElectricCharge generation, meaning that filling any fuel tank should take just seconds of the player\u0027s time, while also allowing for in-game time constraints to factor in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChemicals don\u0027t work this way! What is this magic fuel I\u0027m pulling out of the ground!?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hand-wavium mostly. Some simple flavor text in the DRILL\u0027s description could allude to the real-life equivalent chemical processes, but it\u0027s really just a game mechanic. Keeping it simple is preferable for the base game, with the possibility that modders can liven it up with realistic variations on the system as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMaybe I can drill some fuel near the space center and recover it for free money!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Overpowered exploits should be shut down whenever possible. Specifically it should not be profitable to bring fuel back to the space center (or it should take a reasonable effort to get enough resources home to be profitable). I think it would be enough to make the fuels themselves less significant in the overall pricing system, so bringing back a full tank of gas would only net you a little bit more funds than coming home empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003EJUST A DRILL? REALLY?\u003C/strong\u003E Ok, maybe you can have air and liquid scoops/filters also. They would provide a similar role, collecting fuels from the biomes associated with flying in atmosphere or splashed down. Placing these parts up and down the tech tree could also be a nice way to introduce ISRU abilities a little at a time since each part could be limited in what they could possibly generate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy just fuels? Can\u0027t we have oxygen and water, too?\u003C/strong\u003E If Squad brings in life support which requires resources, then sure, this system would work for that too (I personally want the Snacks! mod to be a thing, in which case a greenhouse part with biome requirements would be amazing). I don\u0027t know if life support will be implemented this way or at all in the stock game, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to everyone for good discussion. I don\u0027t disagree that there\u0027s more than one way to skin a cat, so feel free to point out further problems and solutions. It may not be that Felipe and crew will be taking ideas from this thread, but it\u0027s still great ideas for yet another resource mod...

I do hope Squad keeps it simple; the casual, arcade-style gameplay was what drew me to this in the first place, and what has helped my friends and coworkers get into KSP.

A simple novel hook sufficed, and while I might not be the \u0022average player on the forum\u0022, I think it\u0027s an important thing to keep in mind. Get new players in on the ground floor - more complex functions dealing with all the realism-ish elements some players might want can be better dealt with mods. Also, I fear if you try to make it too realistic, the standard of realism gets to be an untenable treadmill. (E.G.

One instrument to scan them all is fine (spectrometer, cosmic-ray-excitation detector, pertinent geological feature recognition...you don\u0027t have to explain how it does all this stuff). Some resource locations will be obvious on some planets/moons (water on Laythe, water ice in Duna\u0027s polar caps, water ice on icy bodies). Some won\u0027t be so obvious and will require scanning (water ice pockets on Mun and most other bodies...even polar regions on Moho). Have the scan show its results in Map view when toggled on -- different shading patterns for each feedstock resource, and cross-hatched in those nice spots where they overlap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB2) Fuel transfer hoses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease.

So...What is liquid fuel, oxidizer, monopropellant, etc.? And where do you get them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer: I assume this is liquid oxygen. We have such clunky, heavy tanks in KSP that I assume they are sufficiently insulated for the longterm storage of LOX. You can get this stuff wherever an oxygen-rich resource exists. Primarily, this would be liquid water or water ice. Water is a common chemical in the cosmos, so it should be available readily (polar subsurface deposits on Moho; oceans/lakes and subsurface deposits anywhere near oceans/lakes on Kerbin, Eve, Laythe; most of the crusts of Minmus, Vall, Pol, Eeloo; polar caps of Duna; scattered subsurface deposits on Mun, Gilly, Ike, Dres, Bop, Tylo, non-polar Duna regions, and some asteroids).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel: Judging from the tank volumes assigned to oxidizer and liquid fuel in KSP, liquid fuel can\u0027t be Hydrogen (and longtern storage of LH\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E is problematic, anyway). I\u0027m going to assume that liquid fuel is methane, and that the Kerbol system formed with lots of non-biogenic methane that can be found in subsurface deposits on almost all bodies (and even in lakes on a moon of GP II). Scan to find the spots...poke in the drill...suck it up...PROFIT! Also, liquid fuel can be made anywhere on Duna and Eve from the atmospheric CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E if you have water or water ice (it\u0027s supplying the hydrogen for the Sabatier process...but we don\u0027t need to specify that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonopropellant: Could be Hydrogen Peroxide, but I\u0027ll assume that it\u0027s Hydrazine. To make it you need water (water ice) feedstock and a nitrogen feedstock (atmospheric nitrogen on Eve, Duna, Laythe, Kerbin; ammonia ice deposits on cold moons...and on warmer moons, these could be subsurface deposits...or some other nitrates...we need not be too specific).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXenon: Can be separated out in TINY quantities from atmospheres, ices, or subsurface deposits of any of the other stuff...but you have to run through a lot of feedstock to get much Xenon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe refinery module should tell you how fast it can process each of the four finished products (oxidizer, liquid fuel, monopropellant, Xenon) at any given location.
