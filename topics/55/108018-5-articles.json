Whether (part of/a majority of) the community agreed or not, Squad released 1.0. My reaction: it\u0027s not as bad as I feared, nor as polished as I had hoped. I wish they had taken a bit more time to get it finished up, but it\u0027s here now. I haven\u0027t had much time to muck about in 1.0.2 yet.

Maybe there\u0027s rational reasons for the course of events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem some of us have is that Squad seems to be making some questionable decisions. They seemed to switch plans with regard to beta releases for no apparent reason. They showed signs of \u0022Go Fever\u0022, even though a lot of people wanted them to take time to test and polish the game. They went from \u0022alpha\u0022 to \u0022beta\u0022 to \u0022release\u0022 so fast, and with no apparent change in what they\u0027re doing. Squad decided they were going to put a lot of brand new material in the release version, which seems to go against the very idea of \u0022beta\u0022. They had to know that the aerodynamic system alone would require massive rebalancing to get working properly, not to mention integrating properly with new parts and systems like reentry heating. They told us repeatedly that they had full control of when the release was, even while they said they were dropping features to meet the release date. Less than a week after release, two patches were released to fix a number of bugs. The patches also changed features of the new aerodynamic system. And that release video, which seemed to be as close as they could get to \u003Cem\u003EChallenger\u003C/em\u003E, was kind of in bad taste, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne particular bug raises some questions. There are three basic phases of spaceflight. Launch/ascent, flight operations, and reentry/landing. In the released 1.0 version of the game, reentry didn\u0027t work with a capsule and heatshield. That\u0027s one third of spaceflight right there, not working, and in an extremely obvious way. As I said, I wasn\u0027t involved with any of it, so I don\u0027t know how it happened. Maybe that was something they didn\u0027t have time to fix. But when something that obvious makes it into release, people are going to question what happened to allow it in. Even though there could be a thousand other reasons, two possibilities are clear to anyone, and those raise some rather major concerns. Either the process was rushed, and there wasn\u0027t time to test properly, or no one cared enough to fix the bug. It also makes people wonder if something this visible got released, what other issues have slipped through?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t raise these criticisms because we just want to scream at someone on the internet. We do it because we care about the game. We see a lot of potential yet unrealized, and we want to see it grow into what it could be. Sometimes we can be a bit harsh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve said what I have to say. I\u0027m going to go check the mods I\u0027m waiting on and get as much enjoyment out of this game as I can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T07:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis thread is in the \u0027General KSP \u003Cem\u003Ediscussion\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 forum.

The current state of the game is not going to be the final state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of venting here, go participate in a discussion thread seeking to generate some constructive ideas Squad can use to improve the game going forwards. If you have the propensity for it, create or assist with a mod that addresses the aspects of the game that you feel need improvement. If necessary, take a break from KSP and play/do something else for a bit while the rough edges get ironed out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T23:14:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"herbal space program","CreatedById":112590,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T01:03:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat is really so \u0022bungled\u0022 about it?

They have a fantastic system of building and flying simulated spaceships, but in the end really very few interesting things out there in the Kerbolar system for you to go and explore. Moreover, the whole system of contracts, tech acquisition, and building upgrades has a slapped-together feel to it and just seems like an afterthought. It\u0027s based on incomplete development of all those features, which have been around for way less time than all the essential aspects of the simulation engine, that I feel like this release really shouldn\u0027t have been called 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T01:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 01:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
