I think Squad has done a fantastic job of delivering a stream of updates that give us an immensely fun game to play, while also staying very focused on getting systems in place that will allow them to push the game further. In fact I have to admit that my inspiration for this post was seeing Squad working on putting the last few pieces in place toward \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cbeta\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that I think will let them craft a game that can deliver a real taste of the depth and complexity of stories that we see played out in real aerospace development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest item I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love to see is for the development tree to provide a sequence of development struggles more like our own struggles to space. Now I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not somebody who thinks KSP needs to be a reality simulator. I love the unique little universe Squad has crafted and the ways it both parallels and differs from reality. But I think the stories of the 20th century give us a good model for how things could play out in KSP and feel very satisfying and true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting in the dusty days of the 50s, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love to see players start their manned efforts with jet and rocket-powered aircraft breaking barriers of speed and altitude (while getting experience for Kerbals that will someday be astronauts!), while performing the first unmanned experiments with solid and liquid sounding rockets (exploding more often than not at the start!), taking data at altitudes to scope the struggles ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving into the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cspace race\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 era of the 60s, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love to have players balance the money and time pressures of goals from big funding sources, figuring out how to deliver on short-term contracts (perhaps military or surveillance) while designing and building for long-term prestige goals (perhaps more scientific and pioneering). A combination of ground-breaking aircraft and orbital missions could meet objectives in different ways. Some funders may want proof-of-concept hardware like a mach 6 surveillance craft, some a specific mission objective like a flag on the moon, and some an ongoing mission presence or profile like a communications satellite constellation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then beyond, there is such a huge range of directions a player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s program could play out. There could be commercial launch programs to build and support, ambitious science goals to meet, and an ever expanding manned presence to build through stations and bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great thing is that I think KSP has (or will soon have) everything it needs for these things to just be choices, rather than new code! So I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very excited to play through the stockified Fine Print and the other things Squad is working on. But I might float a few specific ideas related to the above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe development tree could be re-sorted to give access to more aircraft-focused manned missions early on, with rocketry much more crude (and unreliable?) to start. I somewhat dislike the current tree where seemingly arbitrary things unlock late (ladders take research?).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also not 100% convinced that using \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscience\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to unlock everything is the best approach. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d like to somehow get access to better hardware by becoming familiar and confident in what I have.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERelated to #1, I think KSP could use just one or two aircraft-focused cockpits that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have reaction wheels, but are light weight and (ideally) provide an ejector seat, to support the flight and abort for test pilot missions. Also, perhaps an auto or assisted land function (perhaps in modes other than \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chard\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2) could be made available to not immediately throw new players into the difficulty of landing on their first manned missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPerhaps also a drop-launch function would make the early rocket-powered craft more straight-forward without forcing a player to build a B-52. Okay, enough about aircraft \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC moving on...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETest contracts are a cool way to preview later parts and give a sense of development, but these parts should be much less reliable during testing, requiring special consideration to emergency measures and avoidance of using them on meaningful missions. There were a LOT of failures in the beginning.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreating a diverse range of contracts will be enormous to creating a sense of struggle, achievement, and choice. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure Fine Print will go along way this direction, and I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t lay out specifics, but referring to the range of objectives in real aerospace programs (firsts in speed/altitude/travel, science, weapons, surveillance, communication, and more) provides a lot of inspiration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI wager this is already planned, but making the range and line-of-sight for communications would provide some very useful tension in mission planning and execution. Different orbits would have more meaning and missions to other bodies would have to start off less data-ambitious. Perhaps part of the KSC development might even be construction of a DSN (deep space network) with dishes located at different points on Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECameras. So many missions, both terrestrial and cosmic, military or scientific, center on gathering images.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOkay one more on planes. I feel like the balance of plane parts needs a bit of work. Aircraft designs do not have hulls full of jet fuel with tiny jet engines tacked on the back. Generally fuel is stored in/on the wings or in small fuselage tanks, with the engines taking up significant room and weight. In fact I notice that many aircraft designs currently end up needing more nose lift because there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s so much less weight in the engine at the back than there should be. Again, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not too reality obsessed, but I think hewing more towards reality here with very small changes would provide fun challenges for the player different from rocket design.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T08:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy personal opinion, but I strongly concur with most of the points you cleverly listed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP was born about manned (kerbal) space flight, there was no line about planes at the beginning. Now that we approach beta stage, so all features are in place, is time to reconsider how the progression in career should be. And that implies to redesign the techtree (as in your point #1). I can\u0027t find it right to have a MK1 pod available since start in career, and not something simpler like the stayputnik (comparable to HW available on Earth in 1961 and 1957 respectively). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, well, you\u0027re right not every part should require research (point #2), though an unlock mechanic should still exist to only make them available when other parts are.

We don\u0027t currently have parts so basic to be used for the early piloted atmospheric supersonic flights, and sure without that part of the program we would never have gained knowledge fundamental for the atmospheric parts of spaceflights (kerbals may risk their lives without much thinking, but nobody on Earth would have put a human on a capsule reentering at hypersonic speed, without first knowledge of supersonic flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout #5, agreed too. Experimental parts should not provide nominal performance (not yet perfected) and be more prone to troubles.

Yet without the context of both, a space race could never happen in-universe, and the road of space development might go very different... not to mention everything before it. It feels silly and unimaginative to try and press the Kerbals into the cold war space race template just because it\u0027s the only one we know.

The reason is simple - most items on your list can all be summed up under one umbrella: \u0022I am suggesting this extension/rework of an existing feature because I feel like the existing features are disjointed and lagging well behind their true potential. I want this game to truly shine.\u0022 That is usually the (commendable) motivation of 99% of the people who post in the Suggestions subforum. And that\u0027s unsurprising - I mean, this game is still in alpha. The devs have specifically stated that they\u0027re still busy implementing the game systems themselves. Both .23.5 and .24 horribly broke the tech tree through their inflationary handling of science points, and .24 is exploitable as all heck to boot... but the tech tree was not rebalanced to take this into account. Not because Squad doesn\u0027t care or thinks it is okay as it is, but rather because now is not the time to bother doing it. There are still game systems left to implement. Why fix the tech tree for .23.5 when you\u0027re going to break it again in .24? That is why all the features feel half-done: because they are. It is not yet time to finish them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been the tune for many years, but with .90 looming on the horizon, that\u0027s about to change. Once KSP enters beta, you\u0027re going to see a whole lot of system reworks. I\u0027m betting my trusty LV-T30 that the tech tree subsystem is going to be one of the things that will change the most. It\u0027s the oldest and most naive feature of career mode, it\u0027s a pain in the rear to mod, and it plays poorly with half the features added in the last year. It may not be the first thing that changes (that probably goes to the aerodynamics simulation, which is already confirmed to get reworked), but it definitely will get its pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that in mind, I think it\u0027s important to remember that we haven\u0027t even seen the finished puzzle - we just had the pieces dropped in front of us one by one from a box that is still obscured by a piece of cloth so we can\u0027t see the box-front art of how it all looks fully assembled. All we can do right now is guess how it will look, and that automatically makes us want to fill in the blanks. But there\u0027s already a finished vision under that piece of cloth, just waiting to be revealed, waiting for (quite literally) all the pieces to be in place. So I\u0027m of the opinion that before we try to completely rewrite what KSP is, we should at least give the devs a chance to \u003Cem\u003Eshow\u003C/em\u003E us what KSP is. How the game can be when all the half-completed systems we currently have actually start working in concert to deliver a streamlined experience. I think it\u0027s something worth waiting for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those that disagree with me and don\u0027t want to wait, meanwhile, there\u0027s mods like the excellent Realism Overhaul packs. NathanKell and ferram4 and many others have put an immense amount of work into it, and I absolutely recommend everyone to try it. It may not ultimately \u003Cem\u003Ebe\u003C/em\u003E for everyone, but at minimum it should give people a much more clear view of exactly how much realism they like in their KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T14:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am very much in agreement with most said in this thread, though I agree with Wallygator here that planes OR rockets (or both concurrently, of course) should be up to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tech Tree doesn\u0027t need to be quite so linear, with specific \u0027lines\u0027 of unlocking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T14:28:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs one gets familiarized with history of space exploration, the true cost of every design aspect of modern rockets and spacecrafts becomes visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those findings, tests, failures, deaths even.

I\u0027m mostly just providing the real world example of how the story played out to suggest that perhaps the tech tree and other things could be tuned a bit to give players more choice and maybe make them world a bit harder to get to orbit, however they choose to do it. I guess the way I see it, technologically speaking at the beginning of the game, planes should have the advantage of being manned (but more difficult to build and fly), and rockets should have the advantage of simplicity to get to orbit quickly (but in the beginning would be more unreliable and unmanned).

I like the idea of parallel lines of development, even possibly with two different starting nodes, but for one thing: planes in KSP are far harder to design than rockets. A new player who happened to pick the planes tree could get quickly overwhelmed. It was hard enough as a new player to even get to orbit. It wasn\u0027t until I read a spaceplane tutorial on these forums that I understood CoM and CoL and why my planes wouldn\u0027t take off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T04:51:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like the idea of parallel lines of development, even possibly with two different starting nodes, but for one thing: planes in KSP are far harder to design than rockets.

And perhaps for a beginner, the initial tutorials really should lead them primarily through the basics of unmanned rocketry up-front, due to the complexities of planes. The only reason I talk a lot about planes is it seems like they could be a satisfying (and realistic, not that that\u0027s the most important thing) path of development right from the start, for those who are so inclined, with just a few tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically to the topic of rocket-focused starting points: To be honest, when I was an absolute newbie starting out with KSP, it seemed really weird to me that I was dropped into a career with access to a manned command module, but no unmanned options at all and quite a lot of rocket motors. It felt to me like the game was saying \u0022you\u0027re going to start with a Gemini mission whether you like it or not, noob\u0022. I really would have enjoyed starting out with some very simple unmanned sounding rockets to get a feel for how the game operated, without having to worry about Kerbal lives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T01:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, for anybody coming across this thread, there is some more practical discussion on the kind of tech tree I had in mind when I posted this, as well as a mod I\u0027ve been working on to implement it, over at the threads in my sig.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T04:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1783: Montgolfier Brothers.
