In the Mk3 cockpit there are four windows on the rear of the pod to allow the pilots to look back into the cargo bay or the rear of the craft. Unlike all other windows in KSP these windows cannot be double-clicked on to focus the view through. I suggest that these windows be select-able to allow the player to focus the camera through them. In a side note this issue also extends to the windows in the science lab, as these also don\u0027t seem to be select-able.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T00:55:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please.
