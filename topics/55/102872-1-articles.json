Thus, rover wheels should have a tweakable similar to a thrust limiter that can be edited in-flight and limits how fast the rover wheels will go so that your rover/mobile base will not flip itself over when you try to drive it."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T20:26:41Z","Content":"I think it\u0027d be cool to have different \u0027gears\u0027 for the wheels (such as low-range for steep hills, high range for flats, etc.), but not really necessary.\n\nMaybe there\u0027s a mod that does this?"},{"CreatedByName":"Crusher48","CreatedById":135642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T21:53:11Z","Content":"Or, have your thrust level apply to rover wheels (so at 0 thrust you dont go anywhere, and at half thrust rover wheels dont spin as fast)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T00:07:13Z","Content":"\u002Btweakable suspension\n\n\u002Brep for you"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T00:37:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Or, have your thrust level apply to rover wheels (so at 0 thrust you dont go anywhere, and at half thrust rover wheels dont spin as fast)\n\nVery much, yes."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T03:35:31Z","Content":"My only problem with that is that I often build vehicles equipped with both rover wheels *and* rocket engines... but for most purposes I could just use action groups to turn the engines on and the wheels off or vice versa.\n\nSay, that reminds me... *can* rover wheels be activated/deactivated with action groups?

It should still work in 0.90 since there haven\u0027t been major changes to the rover wheels between 0.25 and 0.90. It lets you adjust motor torque, brake torque, and steering angle and I was eventually going to work on adding some functionality to adjust suspension.\n\nLink: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68530-0-25-Tweakable-Wheels-Adjustable-Brakes-Steering-and-Torque-for-Wheels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68530-0-25-Tweakable-Wheels-%28Adjustable-Brakes-Steering-and-Torque-for-Wheels%21%29)\n\nI won\u0027t be able to work on adding new stuff until at least May 10 or so, but if you want something added feel free to let me know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T19:52:57Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OrbitusII**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vector-5","CreatedById":120207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T20:05:40Z","Content":"Perhaps instead of power you could have an inverse relationship between speed and torque. It could work somewhat like what Crusher described about throttle dictating the \u0027gear\u0027 you are in. Also, another way to do this would be to have 3 settings: high torque, high speed, and mixed mode. High torque would be similar to gear 1-1 on a 21 gear bike. Mixed mode would be like 2-4, and high speed would be like 3-7. They could be toggleable through action groups \u0026 the right click menu. \n\n-Vec"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T21:36:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E snip\n\nIt\u0027s still part of my must install mods list."}]}
