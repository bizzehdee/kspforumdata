This is a scenario where there will always be people in the \u0022MoreFunds\u0022 camp and those in the \u0022SmallerRewards\u0022 camp. This is one of the reasons that makes the Difficulty settings and customization so great, so both camps can actually adjust their game as they see fit. That being said, contract payouts do need a bit more logic implemented. I, myself, am seeing a broad difference in payouts between the simplest of contracts without the slightest hint as to why one gets so much more a payday than another. I am tempted to say it is varying business practices between companies, but I have already seen two contracts for the same mission, offered by different companies that had the same enough payout to not have any difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t need to add more rules, as that is just putting band-aids on a damaged dam.

While KSP is corporate-funded and not government like NASA, there are still going to be times when money gets tight, such as when it becomes important to upgrade your facilities or when you want to get a multi-tiered mission going to Jool to take on many contracts there at once. If I can achieve that with a \u0022terrible\u0022 launcher and spammed high-mileage engines that are still going to cost me a lot, I sure as heck would prefer that than to have to grind out many smaller contracts which would increase the odds of a disaster and losing prestige and funds. If a \u0022terrible\u0022 launcher and spammed ion engines isn\u0027t your thing, that is fine. Plenty of other ways to get a rocket from point A to point B and other points beyond. The spacecraft exchange is a fine place to share such ideas. Though I am one to want to just observe and admire, or to build on such ideas. I am not one that is eager to see cookie-cutter designs in a game that offers so many different ways to get into space. Heck, with the right R\u0026amp;D choices, one can get a satellite into Kerbin orbit with a rocket built in the VAB using jets as the main launch platform. I know, as I have done just that, and it is fun as heck to pull off. Plus, it is certainly cheaper than conventional means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, on the other side of the coin, I will want that big lift-off, which means more engines, which will also mean more struts.

Any of those three alone would force players to restrict their designs so much they end up realizing they are just making cookie cutter rockets for every mission.

One or two really high payed contracts early in the game are really tempting and can, choosen wisely, close a gap in the gameplay\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T17:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure I got a contract to test the RAPIER in orbit once... for a high amount of funds, a bit of rep... \u003Cem\u003Eand 1,000 science\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T03:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CorBlimey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CorBlimey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem appears to me to be the conversion rate of reputation and funds to science in the Administration Building.

Consider this: You give up 40% of the payout for that (300,000) and get about 100 science in return. Is that not plenty for your money? Now consider giving up that science for cash.
