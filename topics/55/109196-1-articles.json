The length of time before freeze-up has been getting shorter and shorter with every recent version of KSP. Usually these freeze-ups occur between scene changes. Sometimes they are presaged by graphical weirdness (images can be found in the threads where we have been reporting this problem). Adding mods makes the playtime before freeze-up even shorter. Why does Squad keep letting this problem persist? It\u0027s the closest thing that comes to sucking the fun out of KSP for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Fix the embarrassingly sloppy SAS system that points the ship at prograde, retrograde, normal, etc. My ships often wildly overshoot the point, then wander back to overshoot again.

Besides it not being quite balanced for both plane and reentry yet, certain parts conduct heat far too readily. Stuff I have in service bays to keep safe is overheating, even when the bays are tucked safely behind other parts. In a real craft, insulation would be used to keep that from happening. I think the service bays need to be tweaked so they act as if they are heavily insulated, and do not conduct heat to or away from other parts nearly to the same degree they do now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T09:38:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll the bugs that are fixed by the Stock Bug Fix Modules have known solutions: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2d-2-14-May-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2d-2-14-May-15%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T15:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll the bugs that are fixed by the Stock Bug Fix Modules have known solutions: \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2d-2-14-May-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-2-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-2d-2-14-May-15%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m confused.
