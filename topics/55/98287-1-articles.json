It would be really cool if chutes had the same connection points like engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you put a part ontop of a chute, it gets enclosed like engines. If this connection is decoupled,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe enclosure gets pushed away like they do on engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way one can put a chute on alternative places on the rocket if the top is already otherwise used and two radial chutes are overkill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats all.
