This is annoying, as when you get rid of that node they could change a great deal to reflect what has actually gone on, not what the manoever would have done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding a second set of markers, to show what is actually happening (like what we have with orbits, the manoever displays a predicted encounter with Minmus but your actual orbit is still shown orbiting at 100km above Kerbin), would solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
