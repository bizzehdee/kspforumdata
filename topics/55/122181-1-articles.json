The University could be removed from being an actual building to being an actual menu that can be pulled in game to help a player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery much so like how games are started with pop-ups telling you how to do stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think its more helpful to have a help device in EVERY context, rather than just a place to learn stuff.

I dis-like the idea of categorizing ship as actual types. Since I can name ships what ever I want, and make them 100% different, even if they have a similar name. A manual more customizable version would be to allow players more control over how they save their crafts. Allowing them to create folders would keep things organized in any fashion a player chooses. Throw in a good search, combine VAB, SPH craft files and possible info dialogs on each craft and we would get a much more intuitive load/save than can help players stay organize and just be better than the current scroll-click-name system we have now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could save your crafts in a folder for their type, but different versions in that folder.

I like having the idea of a single building for browsing tutorials, maybe even launch a tutorial from within the game, if possible, but even just text data would be good. That serves a function. It also needs some upgrade advantage to fit in with the rest of the buildings, which I provided for University (leveling up Kerbal after Kerbal gets tedious in late game, so it\u0027s kind of needed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, each of the existing buildings has a functional purpose, as would your University. Opening a building like the museum to look a pre-rendered pieces of digital rock isn\u0027t very functional. It would just be filler, you could add them for decoration like the flag pole or the fuel tanks, but having a scene for something non-functional would take a lot of development time that each player would go look at once and then never again. Realistically this exists in the science archives in the R\u0026amp;D building and it serves it\u0027s purpose there. Maybe you could separate the science archives screen into it\u0027s own museum building, but then what would it\u0027s upgrade function be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to totally blast the idea.

The other Kerbals would be in the background, remaining stationary other than the occassional idle animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - A way to tie the Visitor Complex to gameplay even further would be (simplified) management of museum exhibits / policies.
