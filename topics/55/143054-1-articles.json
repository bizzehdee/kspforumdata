Honestly, once the devs get KSP rock-solid (at some point sooner rather than later, I hope), I would love it if they added stock support for multiple launch locations and In-Situ vessel manufacturing. (Then again, I would also like them to support persistent vessels between launches. The \u0022recover, rebuild, re-launch\u0022 method kinda irks me for some reason. I like the idea of investing fund in a vessel and\u00A0not being able\u00A0to convert the vessel back into funds as incentive to think of reusability.
