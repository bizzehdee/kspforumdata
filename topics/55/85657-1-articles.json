I was playing around with putting them on wingless rockets and they are IMO way too good for vertical takeoff. They should not be competitive with standard rocket engines for wingless, vertical takeoffs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaiier","CreatedById":22833,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T00:48:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a number of mods which do this. The main problem with doing this in stock is that it would make jet engines quite useless because the atmosphere is quite thick and soupy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
