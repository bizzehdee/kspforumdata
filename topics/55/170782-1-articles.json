I find that my tracking stations quickly gets clogged, especially since the CommNet was added and I have multiple communication satellites around the same body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027d be a fairly quick addition that would improve the QOL a lot for large save files. How I picture this: Either in the same window you rename vessels, or in a new interface in either tracking station or whilst controlling the vessel, you\u0027re able to give the vessel a tag. Then you can have a scroll-list in the tracking station where you can check a box on each tag you want to display in the tracking station. Similar to the existing \u0022type\u0022 icons, but as an additional layer. Say I have my mun missions consisting of multiple unmanned probes, a couple surface bases with some rovers. I\u0027d tag all of them \u0022Verne\u0022 (gotta honor\u00A0Jules Verne for his \u0022rocket \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E), and then have the ability to filter all of those away from the tracking station whilst I focus on colonizing Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother approach would be to have the ability to add \u0022folders\u0022 in the tracking station list, and drag and drop vessels into those folders, and simply being able to click on a folder to open it, displaying all vessel names in the list. This wouldn\u0027t hide their icons from the map view, but instead make it easier finding a specific vessel that you might need to re-position for a contract or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, the problem I\u0027m having is with the list on vessel names being difficult to sort in a good manner. I don\u0027t mind the world being cluttered with a lot of vessel icons too much though. Above are my two suggestions to solving this, but there are maybe better aproaches to this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep being awesome, I\u0027ve been enjoying KSP for over 6 years now!! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-11T21:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed\u00A0100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve said the same several\u00A0times before, as have many others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am no programmer, so can\u0027t\u00A0say with any authority how easy it would be to implement, but it doesn\u0027t strike me as a hugely difficult problem to solve as there are already sorting and categorizing tools anyway.\u00A0 And while\u00A0we\u0027re\u00A0at it, can we have a folder system for vessels\u00A0in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
