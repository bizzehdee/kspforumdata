Coincidentally, the game also thinks you reached orbit (and performs camera transition) when your periapsis passes 23 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason why such things disappear is that the game only runs one physics simulation and that simulation goes on in a sphere 5 km in diameter centered around active ship. Everything else is handled in a simplified way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresence of parachute does not automatically mean the ship will survive. The chute must be primed, it must be positioned well to not break the ship when it opens, it must be large enough to slow down the ship sufficiently. The result of the descent also depends on where you land, results of landing with the same chutes depend largely on altitude at which you land, slope on which you land, and whether you land in water. So I see no other correct way to handle that than to run full physics simulation of the descent which might be a problem for your CPU, but it might also turn to major annoyance if the game prevents you to use time warp because it needs to run physics simulation of some parts you dropped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present there is little reason to care about parts you dropped, if they disappear, you have less debris to care about.

If stage recovery is a thing when economics arrive, I do not want to babysit descending stages while the more interesting ascent is going on.

The other 49% is the re-entry, which is warp limited too (perhaps remove the 3x \u0026amp; 4x option). I don\u0027t think many are going to be too upset that it doesn\u0027t run full physics on dropped parts. after all, it\u0027s just a matter of whether or not it survives, (which it should if it has sufficient chute power stuff).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
