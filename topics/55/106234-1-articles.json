I deploy the decoupler. The fairing stays intact and is now basically a \u0022bucket\u0022. I want to get the payload straight out of there. I can\u0027t because the engine says \u0022can\u0027t activate while stowed\u0022. Even after I pull it out (RCS works, btw) with another craft, I STILL CAN\u0027T ACTIVATE THE ENGINE! Unless the fairing is deployed, anything that was inside will believe it is still there. \n\nMaybe this is the same issue as the \u0022Manleybug\u0022, but it makes a whole lot of design ideas (Apollo recreation for instance) useless.\n\nMy suggestion: \n\n- Fix the occlusion --\u003E parts outside a bay / fairing have to be \u0022free\u0022\n- Let us activate engines inside a cargo bay! (Because they work when you open the bay, fire the engine and then close the bay again)\n\nThank you for your attention."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T07:58:15Z","Content":"What happens if you stage/activate the fairing first, before the decoupler? Or both fairing and decoupler at the same time?\n\nIt does sound like there\u0027s probably something needing looked at, but the above 2 cases might have a workaround for now. It\u0027s unclear from your description if/when you\u0027re activating the fairing. I\u0027d guess it might be impossible to activate if you separate it from command pod/probe before trying to activate it, so is there something with command authority on the section with the fairing?."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:08:38Z","Content":"Activating fairing before activation decoupler: engine works.\n\nActivating decoupler/fairing at the same time: engine works.\n\nActivating fairing after decoupler: will test later\n\nDestroying / recovering vehicle after decoupling to see if occlusion state changes: will test later"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:18:51Z","Content":"You should be posting a proper bug report in the proper forum."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:31:34Z","Content":"Well my issue is a two part problem.
