Very intimidating. But when i kill a kerbal, i mean, when there is an accident and a kerbal dies, there is a penalty i think. But how much is it? What if you get a red icon, and a short report\u00A0explaining how much money you lost, when a craft crashes, and if a kerbal is inside, it shows how much reputation you lost as well. Just a suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/g4hP1Yl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/g4hP1Yl\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
