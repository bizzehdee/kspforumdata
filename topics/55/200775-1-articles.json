What a waste of time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHumans haven\u2019t gone beyond the Moon themselves, but probes have landed on Venus, Mars and Titan and visited every major planet in the solar system, a variety of moons, asteroids and comets and even returned material from some of those. A real probe has to balance the power and mass requirements of its various experiments and make them capable of surviving for long periods in\u00A0the harsh environments of space or whatever celestial object they end up on,\u00A0so the data it can generate is limited, but humans (or Kerbals) can bring much more sophisticated equipment and so generate more and better data from the same environment or sample. There\u2019s a reason sample return missions are such a big deal- a cutting edge research lab on Earth has no restrictions on the weight or power consumption of its equipment and so can do vastly more detailed and intensive studies on samples of, say, Mars or a comet than any spacecraft ever could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really want every experiment to generate and transmit all the possible science, try the science- full reward/full transmit mods; alternatively if you want something a bit more realistic, Kerbalism\u2019s science-only config will make experiments take time to complete but they also run automatically in the background. For a probe autopilot, MechJeb is the answer, or kOS if you feel like coding your own scripts (or using someone else\u2019s) and then there\u2019s RemoteTech to make flying probes \u2018realistic\u2019 with signal delay and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-04T12:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to do a surface recon with unmanned spacecraft before attempting crewed landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd rovers can operate, scan surface features without the need for a Kerbal to be present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-04T12:11:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2021 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by The Aziz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T01:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223935572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200775\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221614845520\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208489\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jastrone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, jastrone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni would suggest either making transmitting science more efficent\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh ha!
