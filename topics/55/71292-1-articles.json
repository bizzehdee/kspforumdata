I would really like to have some control over the contents of a fuel tank. For example a fuel tank that has liquid fuel and oxidizer, you could instead choose to have both tank sections filled with just liquid fuel. Or a section with mono propellant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResizable parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how difficult this would be, but it would be nifty to be able to hold down a modifier key, or simply click a size button on the parts list that would give you one step up, and one step down in size of the selected item. Of course only certain items would this make sense. Perhaps in 100% scale changes. Medium would be double the size of small, and large double that of medium. Or at maybe just 50% increments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Usage Order\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like to really make good rockets, more control over the order in which fuel tanks are consumed is really necessary. You can sort of do with with the fuel line attachment, but it would save time, aesthetics, and rocket performance by not needing an elaborate mess of fuel lines for advanced staging methods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
