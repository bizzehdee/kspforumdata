I would say the Whiplash is the best for this category, but don\u0027t froget the RAPIER. It\u0027s a single type of engine that takes you to orbit, and being high-tech, it won\u0027t need much fuel Couls be perfect for beginners. But I\u0027d feel guilty if our best current engine was made into a toy for beginners... So, I decided to have category 3 assigned to both engines, but only partially to the RAPIER, giving it a rather constant thrust until a point, after which it\u0027s hard to proceed. Masters won\u0027t have to switch mode after that point, being able to properly exploit the RAPIER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n4:Whiplash\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs said. Changes in point 3 would also strengthen its current position as an assistance for heavy planes mainly using other engines. With increased TWR and thrust strictly cutted earlier, it would greatly help in a hard phase of orbiting with a giant craft: the early ascend wouldn\u0027t be so hard and slow, but, as the thrust is suddenly cutted from these Whiplashes before reaching OP speeds, the part that makes a craft op is still only relying on your primary engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n5: An aerospike. Either a new one or the current one redone\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll description points towards an engine that\u0027s efficient, remains efficient at all altitudes, even on Eve, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ehas minimal drag, \u003C/strong\u003Ewhile having large thrust with a properly large mass, but a small radial size. Its weakpoint could be its cost, and no utility stuffs such as electricity, gimbal, or\u00A0 bottom attachment node, that would only able its usge with planes or bottom stages where cost doeasn\u0027t matter (EVE) And these kinds of nerfs are why a new 1m aerospike would be a better choice than redoing the current one, keeping which for shuttles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6\u002B8: New engine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything points towards a scramjet-type engine. An engine that has extremely good vel.curves, making it the most efficient of all, while having a low cost. Its weakpoint is that it\u0027s extremely hard to use, and you can only use it for cargo delivery to LKO. It could be hard to use if it had low atm.curves with those good vel.curves, not only making overheating crazy, but resulting an EXTREMELY difficult ascend path. Also, low TWR makes it hard to use as well. Not ableing it to pass LKO has several ways. One is the already mentioned low TWR. With a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge mass\u003C/strong\u003E, it\u0027s clearly not worth it to take them with you. Another one is not abling its craft to have efficient transfer engines, by having an ascend path that gives you only a little time to circularize, making an inefficient, high thrust engine necessary, while consuming even further engine slots by having more engines requied. This could be done by unabling the engine to run at low speeds, like a realistic scramjet. It would have to rely on other engines to accelerate the craft to supersonic speeds. So, you need strong engines until supersonic speeds, an individual rocket, and a vast ammout of scramjets. No more place for orbital engines. Also, the best thing about it is that it could able the basic jets and Panthers to have their part in orbiting, as Panthers help you to get to supersonic operational speeds, and, if scramjets could work inefficiently and weakly from subsonic speeds to supersonic operational speeds, Whesleys Junos and Goliaths could be used for orbiting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7\u002B9:RAPIER\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngine supporting the orbiting of long-range SSTOs. Expensive but efficient. Easy to fly until supersonic speeds, and after that, it\u0027s harder to proceed (suddenly changing stats requie a new ascend path)(I am uncertain about having this \u0027difficulity change\u0027 necessary, it could only serve beginners)\u00A0 As no additional engines are needed, only a few of them is enough for your craft, leaving space for nukes for interplanetary and ect. missions. This specialization could be strengthened by making them have a low mass, supporting long ranke missions again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-06T16:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2016 04:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T18:38:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPay to win doesn\u0027t matter because it will likely be recovered for 100% \u00A0No incentive to choose 8 over 9. \u00A0I would suggest giving engines a usable life span but that doesn\u0027t really add any value to the game. \u00A0Perhaps cap recovery at 50% other side of kerbin only recovers for 5%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T19:31:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222496459\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136132\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459881501\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145678\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nich\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n46 minutes ago, Nich said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPay to win doesn\u0027t matter because it will likely be recovered for 100% \u00A0No incentive to choose 8 over 9.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s completely true. 9 could be the same as 10 but with no hard difficulity, and high cost wouldn\u0027t matter with complete recovery.

Remember that plane parts look more shiny and beautyful because those textures were a mod originally, which got later integrated into the game. I absolutely agree with having \u0022too much spaceplane parts\u0022, in the meaning of being disturbing while constructing rockets -when I want rocket parts but half of them are plane parts. The same in the opposite direction. I wish we had a separate category for \u0022plane propulsion\u0022 with fuselages and jets in there. Anyway, if I want the revolutionization of plane parts, that could go here, so I\u0027ve added it. Also, I find the quantity of wing parts too much, as I\u0027d love to have stock P-wings. Of course, that\u0027s not likely to happen. On the other hand, one of the points of this suggestion is to make each spaceplane engine usable for orbiting. So guess what, if they were already useful for orbiting, I wouldn\u0027t suggest it. Also, I didn\u0027t desire strictly new engines, but the modification of current ones. I don\u0027t want generally /better/ plane parts, but ones that are better at X and weaker at Y. But I might agree with planes being a bit too op with the recovery cost.

Its also an engine for a horizontally flying plane that doesn\u0027t go to orbit... given that this is a game mostly about space, that role is somewhat limited. Right now in my career, almost every mission makes use of whiplashes or rapiers for getting to space depending if I have the patience for a horizontally launched and landed SSTO that day or not. I rarely use whiplashes in a purely suborbital regime... but I do on occassion. I considered sending whiplash powered things to laythe, but I didn\u0027t... how that I think about it, maybe I should have put a pair on my laythe ssto - uses 4 rapiers, but only really needs all their thrust for water takeoffs. It carries a lot of excess LF for suborbital jaunts to other biomers without kicking into closed cycle... a pair of whiplashes would provide even more takeoff thrust, and make better use of the LF for flying around before going back to orbit/the surface base... plus EC generation for sending those huge atmospheric analysis science transmissions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same problems are there for the goliath, wheesely and Juno - its a space game, and these engines are nearly useless for getting to space (I did manage a Juno \u0022SSTO\u0022 but it needs a launch dolly...
