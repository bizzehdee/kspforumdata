Or reorganize the menu some different way? I like the transition effect and would like it to stay, but it is true that going through this transition for something you are doing in the menu often is not very comfortable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T11:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always hit the red X from Space Center.
