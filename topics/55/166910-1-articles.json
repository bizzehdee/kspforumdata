It\u0027s good as it is, in most ways.

You mentioned this briefly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t objects in KSP have specified colliders to them? Isn\u0027t the part mechanism that is applied to a asteroid the roadblock that prevents direct reconfiguration during simulation? I can\u0027t poke a hole in my Mk1 crew cabin to put my beer inside, can I?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeaning, if you have a asteroid in which you can build it must be hollow in it\u0027s default state. Would the idea behind this involve drilling it out while having a preconfigured chamber? And if possible though, wouldn\u0027t one need countless bitmaps to animate excavatable asteroids? The exacticality of building inside it said way is more my own idea ofcourse since I don\u0027t know how you envision this part. But this is what I think about when approaching a method of building inside a asteroid. I hope it can get done though, because it seems kinda cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what happens to the matter when hollowing out a asteroid? Gifts of fuel resources, gemstones, loads of heat and expelled particles from a chime of some sort is my bet.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think there are many ideas in this regard. But building inside a asteroid involves excavating it, period. Seems tricky!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have a addition to your idea, hope you like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroid Merging.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething I would like to add is asteroid merging. Allow yourself to get 2, 3 or MOAR asteroids close to one another. When impacting at high enough velocity they will merge and loose some mass due to expelled debris (unpersistent debris a.k.a. fairing style).\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if the impact is to high it will scatter into tinier class A, B asteroids. (or c,d depending on the sizes ofcourse)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way you can make a asteroid the size you want it while having to do something for it. By said means I expect someone \u003Cu\u003Ebe able \u003C/u\u003Eto create a vesta sized asteroid, aheum aheum, I mean, Moon! (with a lot of grinding by becoming solitary in your basement if you don\u0027t already lol)\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou would probably still need to smash thousands of class \u0022G\u0022 ...., \u0022H\u0022 to get to Gilly sized dimensions, no mind Vesta. And asteroids that have the size of Gilly by default seems more planetoid to me then asteroid, even if it\u0027s still categorized as a asteroid on paper.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy the way, how does a part behave when it is larger then the max physics range? Will the universe still hold?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere should be a clear division in this game that divides flying rockets/planes and towing planetoids throughout the solar system.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I get your Sci-fi sentiment, and could be achieved in great extent. But the extent of towing gilly sized objects around even with interstellar propulsion systems seems a bit over Sci-fi\u0027d if you catch my drift.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting offtopic now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ESome general offtopic insight/complaints to KSP asteroids.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAsteroids don\u0027t go \u003Cu\u003Epoof\u003C/u\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I don\u0027t like about asteroids is what they do when reaching max heat/impact values. To much heat which is not hard to achieve and it goes poof, they\u0027re gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSilicates melt far below the heat tolerance number that asteroids can apparently survive. Assuming \u0022K\u0022 in ksp stands for Kelvin and not Kervin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nKnowing the composition of asteroids we can safely estimate the range to where heat tolerance should have a effect. When going over it the asteroid becomes glowy and melts, and doesn\u0027t go poof. Maybe loose actual gasses and thus mass while aerobraking or even explode.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want molten spheres of lava.

Something which KSP asteroids should do and at higher speeds due to the momentum (not slow down to 200 m/s or thereabout) above the surface only because the atmosphere in KSP is still a lesser wall and asteroids being a sack of feathers. Asteroids ain\u0027t heatshields and shouldn\u0027t have a lot of drag. This unrealistic drag effect is greatly extended when mining the asteroid first before landing. Hey, it is good advice for getting a asteroid down in KSP. But it\u0027s just stupid and unrealistic. By any means, mining should shrink the asteroid, thereby reducing it\u0027s cross section and drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo besides \u003Cu\u003Eadding\u003C/u\u003E things in the realm of KSP asteroids I would make a few \u003Cu\u003Echanges\u003C/u\u003E to them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EOh, and this isn\u0027t a hijack. \u003C/u\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut your giving a suggestion that I definitely like but on the basis of a game aspect (asteroids) that I find unfinished.
