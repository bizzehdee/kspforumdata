Of course you might not still find it challenging to get a zero-inclination near-circular orbit 6km above Minimus, but that is plenty challenging for plenty of players who have no incentive to ever bother - a one-way fly-by is just as good as a parking orbit, despite the fact that getting into orbit and back to Kerbin requires more fuel and better design considerations.\u003Cp\u003ESo, this would provide goals \u0026amp; incentive to new players, and the added benefit of speed for experts who can already \u0022do it all\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople already do those things in sandbox mode without even needing science or some other arbitrary reason to do it. And, again, when biomes are available in more places than Kerbin and the Mun there will be incentive to get into stable orbits and bring along Kerbals.
