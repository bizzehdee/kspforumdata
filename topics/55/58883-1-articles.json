So this is what im thinking ID like to see in .24. Some Kerbal love. What was the last update that added to the Kerbals themselves? What I want is reason to keep the little guys alive. Features that attach me to the individual Kerbal. Id like to see customization. But that\u0027s the least of it. I want medals and experience for my Kerbals. For instance Jeb gets a badge next to his name after returning from the Mun. Which would be added to his rep in the R\u0026amp;D building. Each kerbal should be able to build up a reputation and portfolio of past adventures. This way when we send these guys up on rockets we can actually worry about their well being. Making LES and testing all the more important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just throwing this out there.. A Kerbal Sim game would be nice to see at some point.
