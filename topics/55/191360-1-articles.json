It should be done like in OpenTTD. In OpenTTD, all the transport can be added to group and groups can be added to groups as well. But it should be possible to add vessel to multiple groups. For example: we have multiple static base modules, several rovers for moving stuff around, some kerbals at EVA and some bigger rovers landed at Eeloo, so we group them as this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n- Eeloo landed\n- - Rovers\n- - - [Eeloo rovers goes there]\n- - Base \u0022Alpha\u0022\n- - - Statics\n- - - - [statics goes there]\n- - - Mini\u00A0rovers\n- - - - [mini\u00A0rovers\u00A0goes there]\n- - - Kerbals\n- - - - [kerbals\u00A0goes there]\n- - - Rovers\n- - - - [rovers\u00A0goes there]\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we need vessel filtering based on vessel type then?
