So whenever you start a new game, you are given the choice of easy aerodynamics (stock) or simulation aerodynamics (FAR) with when you choose far you get a popup warning saying something like, \u0022this option is reccomended for players experienced in flight simulator games and aerodynamics, are you sure you want to pick simulator aerodynamics?\u0022 or somthimg . I think this would please everybody.
