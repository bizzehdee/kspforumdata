And if they have landed, they\u0027ll appear as debris in the tracking station, and by recovering them, they\u0027ll be available at building. Recovering may need a cost too, the higher ground distance the part travelled, the higher this cost could be to result an advantage for SSTO desgins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E-Add fuel costs\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It is noticable that fuel tanks have very high costs, maybe because they are pre-filled. I think they\u0027d be empty (resulting lower cost) and paying for fuel should be done separately. This is good because if you use your rocket and you can recover its parts for building a new rocket/loading one you could just reload the fuel needed, instead of replaceing empty tanks with filled ones. An understandable example: Rocket \u0027A\u0027 is launched, you recover its parts after the misssion, you load it to transport for example the secont modul of a station, and because all parts are available ( because of the recovering) you just have to pay for the fuel, and you can launch. This helps spaceplanes again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E-The more passengers, the more science\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We all know that doing the same experiment/report for the 60th time won\u0027t give much science. But repeating 5-6 times after the first time the experiment\u0027s done gives you the same science value. Maybe this is because collating the results is important in science to minimalize mistakes. Why couldn\u0027t this be done with kerbals? The more passengers you have, the more science you get for a crew report or doing an EVA-report could be repeated a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E-Remake the MPL-LG-2 Mobile processing lab\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E As I courrently undersanded the working of this device is that recovery gives you 10-20% bonus science after proccessing the samples in the lab. What the describing says is that proccesing the samples gives you the same science value as recovery. Or/and you can reset a science device after transmitting the results to do the experiment again. Of course this is not how this thing works. Another way how it could work is that it produces science on orbit/on different planets, wich makes no sense. One great way how it could be done is that experiments are desgined after reaching a new achivement and science is made after these experiments are transported to the lab and lots of electricity is available,under a long time. This science could be transmitted or recovered. These experiments could be transported to the lab in containers like the SC. 9001 Science Jr, acting as a fuel for the orbital-science-generator. This\u0027d give a great chance for small/tiny desgins to serve the stations. The described ways could mean more types of labs. As in real life, maybe some scientic divices could be operated from a lab, like telescopes, radiation-measurers, ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Additional tasks\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Smaller desgins are not really haveing any purpose.

There could be some other space programs competing with you, just like how it was in real life. They\u0027d be on other places, have launches, and you\u0027d recive feedback from their successes or incoming launches. Also, who wouldn\u0027t like to use tiny probes or separaton-projectiles launched from aircrafts to sabotage enemy launches? They\u0027d make intentional mistakes like frogetting to add parachutes, electricity-generation, ect. to give them failures. Also, they may recive additional tasks instead of you if you made several mistakes or they just have a better offer. And of course a surface sample or a flag is not as valuable if it is not the first. Competeing with them may requies to reach an achivement from one mission, making no saving even more dangerous. And of course an early failure may mean an irrecovable disadvantage. This is hardcore mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E-heatshields needed\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I know that they said they don\u0027t want re-entry heat, If I want that just get the mod, but why couldn\u0027t it be in a hardcore-mode? Just because you\u0027d may recover everithyng easily by adding parachutes. The need of heavy heatshields may increase the value of a recoverable vehicle, creating a need for shuttles and ssto planes. Or a smart heatshielded rocket would help a LOT in the race for offering the best offer for orbiting satellites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E-Cabin fever\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Isn\u0027t spending years in a Mk.1 command pod a bit too simple solution at hardcore mode? The human record of flying alone witouth getting mad/sick was only five days. the same could be with hardcore mode kerbals. Of course a m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or minmus exploration is easily possible with this limit, but no further journeys, like duna. The more of them is in the ship, the longer time they could survive. For exmple, a lot more time in a Mk.2 command pod because they can talk with each other. A PPD-10 Hitchhiker Storage Container and the PPD-12 Coupola Modul are the best long-term cabins with equipmentsm like board games and snacks. Addding them to a station producing science from experiments on orbit will result longer time a crew can work effectively. And replacing the crew could be done with the same mission as you reload the experiments as orbital-science generator fuel. Also, the Mk.2 and Mk.3 pits could have beds at a lower-floor, making them abled to keep kerbals healthy longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for incidental language mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-04T11:52:33Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2014 11:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T12:07:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou must be new here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebudgets/costs will be here with .24, and thats releasing within a week or so*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecovery for economic benefit is theoretically also coming with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso contracts are coming so that might cover your \u0022\u0022additional tasks\u0022 point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehardcore modes have been discussed ad naseum and most of your ideas are on the what not to suggest list. also there is a current thread running about no saving on page 2 of suggestions and development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour idea for a rival space program has been denied, there will be no sabotages or random failures in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*maybe\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:hope i dont come off as too rough.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-04T12:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2014 12:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T13:03:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou must be new here. \u003Cp\u003Ebudgets/costs will be here with .24, and thats releasing within a week or so*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erecovery for economic benefit is theoretically also coming with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso contracts are coming so that might cover your \u0022\u0022additional tasks\u0022 point\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehardcore modes have been discussed ad naseum and most of your ideas are on the what not to suggest list. also there is a current thread running about no saving on page 2 of suggestions and development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour idea for a rival space program has been denied, there will be no sabotages or random failures in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*maybe\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit:hope i dont come off as too rough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThan sorry, I didn\u0027t know that, and if the new patch\u0027s out in a week, you made me a very happy man.
