Apparently some of the devs have even hinted on it on Twitter of something...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the question is, what aerodynamic features would you like to see added to the model? Personally, I\u0027m a big fan of realism and there are quite a few features I would like to see added, but some of you may not agree with me on specific features. Thus, I wanted to break this down into a feature-by-feature discussion of what YOU want to see added that might be enlightening to SQUAD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this is \u003Cstrong\u003ENOT\u003C/strong\u003E the place to just shout \u0022Full Realism!\u0022, or \u0022I don\u0027t want to see ANYTHING added!\u0022. Instead, you should discuss *particular features*, and why you want to see \u003Cstrong\u003Ethem\u003C/strong\u003E added...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to start off this discussion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBallistic/Aerodynamic Shielding:\u003C/strong\u003E This may not be the correct term for this, but basically the idea is that part will not experience lift or drag when they are inside of other parts, such as Cargo Bays (which will be released in 0.25) or fairings (which SHOULD get added whenever SQUAD updates the aerodynamics model, IMHO- besides fairings just LOOK COOL when they break apart to expose a payload...) This will add to both realism and fun, and I can\u0027t possibly see a downside to adding this, aside from players being unable to hide wings inside cargo bays to illegitimately improve the lift of their spaceplanes... (most players consider this a \u0022cheat\u0022 anyways...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECross-Section Based Drag:\u003C/strong\u003E This is really not as big or scary a change as it sounds like. Basically it means that a rocket two fuel tanks high will only experience *SLIGHTLY* more drag than a rocket one fuel tank high (most drag is based on cross-sectional area in the prograde direction, rather than laminar drag), when flying in the prograde direction. When spinning about randomly, the rocket/plane will experience much more drag- but this will actually make the game EASIER by tending to slow down such spins, and isn\u0027t exactly the normal state of such things anyways... (if you\u0027re in a death-spin to begin with, why does it matter to you if you\u0027re experiencing extra drag?) \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis feature is also necessary for features enabling nosecones to have functionality.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (without it, how will you know that they are between the rocket and the airflow?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESkin Friction Drag:\u003C/strong\u003E This is mainly a balancing factor to complement cross-sectional drag. Without it, a rocket two fuel tanks high will experience *EXACTLY* the same atmospheric drag as a rocket one fuel tank high when flying in the prograde direction. This creates a bit of extra drag based on the increased exposed surface area, but does \u003Cstrong\u003ENOTHING\u003C/strong\u003E to destabilize a rocket. Basically, it helps prevent the game from becoming \u0022too easy\u0022 based on changing the basis of drag to ray-casting, while simultaneously increasing realism and making the game more intuitive (most people would \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEXPECT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a taller rocket to still experience more drag, in absolute terms).

It would cause nosecones to have function by rewarding more gradual transitions in cross-sectional area, while simultaneously working to destabilize/penalize pancake-rockets. It will make the game a bit \u0022harder\u0022, but not unreasonably so- and with just this feature alone you can still get pancake rockets to orbit. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is the reason nosecones are useful in real life!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E It is also one of the reasons fairings are useful (and fairings just look \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECOOL!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMach Effects on Absolute Drag:\u003C/strong\u003E In isolation, and without combination with some of the \u0022harder\u0022 aerodynamic features to follow, this doesn\u0027t actually make the game significantly harder. In fact, in many ways, it makes it \u0022easier\u0022- rockets and planes capable of breaking the sound barrier can travel at MUCH faster speeds with the same TWR than in a drag model lacking this feature. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat it means is, in a nutsehell, rockets/planes tend to gain very little velocity for additional thrust in the \u0022transonic\u0022 regime (from about Mach 0.85 to Mach 1.2), but gain a LOT MORE velocity for their thrust in the \u0022hypersonic\u0022 regime of speeds greater than this.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s the \u003Cstrong\u003E*other*\u003C/strong\u003E mach effects (to follow) that have actually scare many players off of mods like FAR... \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShould be configurable/able to be disabled on the Difficulty Levels screen at starting a new game, and probably only enabled by default on the higher difficulty levels...\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMach Effects on Stability:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is the mach effect that scares many players away from mods like FAR\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. What it basically means is that, when crossing the sound barrier (the \u0022transonic\u0022 regime between roughly Mach 0.85 and Mach 1.2), planes tend to experience wobble and some loss of control authority, that can potentially lead them to crash. \u003Cstrong\u003ESince these effects are directly related to exposed surface area and shape, they don\u0027t tend to affect rockets very strongly.\u003C/strong\u003E They can also be delayed (so they start closer to, say, Mach 1.00 instead of Mach 0.85) by sweeping the wings back into a \u0022Delta Wing\u0022 configuration- and in fact the majority of planes designed in stock already tend to follow this configuration. All in all, with a bit of thought into design and perhaps some extra reaction wheels to dampen the wobble, it really isn\u0027t all that hard to manage and deal with these effects. It also would be MUCH easier to minimize or avoid them altogether if SQUAD would consider adding a FAR-like informational display that could optionally be toggled in the SPH/VAB (paraps configurable as to whether even be available as an \u0022Advanced Option\u0022 on the Difficulty Level screen when starting a new game...), which would also be a GREAT place to display information like the available Delta-V of a plane/rocket... \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EShould be configurable/able to be disabled on the Difficulty Levels screen at starting a new game, and probably only enabled by default on the higher difficulty levels.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAerodynamic Failures:\u003C/strong\u003E This probably shouldn\u0027t occur nearly as easily as in FAR or real-life, but explosions and rockets breaking apart are !FUN! in KSP, and there should be a couple ways to cause them, based one aerodynamics. I\u0027ll leave the exact details of which types of aerodynamic failure (high G-loads based on lift/drag, localized pressure spots, localized overheating, etc.) should and should not be included up to debate, and in my opinion this is is something SQUAD could best determine through play-testing and user feedback in Experimentals (which team I *STILL* wan to join... sigh). \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis one should *DEFINITELY* be configurable/able to be disabled through the Difficulty Level screen on starting a new game (and, should only be enabled by default on the higher difficulty levels...)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBody Lift:\u003C/strong\u003E This feature gets an unfairly bad rep, and honestly I don\u0027t know why. What it basically means is that rockets and the fuselages of planes generate a certain amount of lift. With a properly-designed rocket (one that is wider at the bottom than at the top) this tends to actually \u003Cstrong\u003E*STABILIZE*\u003C/strong\u003E rockets (making flying them easier), and this only makes flying planes \u003Cstrong\u003EEASIER\u003C/strong\u003E as the lift generated by the plane becomes greater and slightly more intuitive to the shape (you don\u0027t have to distinguish between what is and is-not a \u0022wing\u0022 part- it all generates lift based on shape...) The ONLY downside of this feature is that it makes it significantly more difficult to lift large, draggy payloads (such as a section of a space station) to orbit without a payload fairing- which should be added to the game in whatever update improves aerodynamics anyways, if only for appearances... (\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Efairings just *look* COOL\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E) It absolutely SHOULD be part of the default difficulty level if made part of the game, and perhaps it is even not worth making it tweakable in Difficulty Levels at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERe-Entry Heat:\u003C/strong\u003E This isn\u0027t really a traditional aerodynamic feature, per-se, but it is so closely associated with aerodynamics that I felt it was worth including. Basically, the question here is whether the update that adds aerodynamics should also add re-entry heating. I waver on this question myself- and would be perfectly happy to see SQUAD delay it to an even later update... (so they can do a better job with focusing on just aerodynamics, especially from the coding/stability standpoint)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I have \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EINTENTIONALLY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E left out features many players of FAR, or real-life aerospace engineers, might be familiar with such as aerodynamic instability leading to things like \u0022Dutch Roll\u0022 and stalls. This is because I think such features are a little too advanced for most players (even experienced ones like myself tend to struggle with them occasionally), and should intentionally be left out of any initial aerodynamics update, perhaps to infinity (I would much rather see SQUAD focus on things like adding a difficulty option to upscale Kerbin 2-3x, or finally adding a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ebasic\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E ISRU system- either of which players could choose *NOT* to play with if they didn\u0027t like them, but ought to be part of scope-completion IMHO...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I re-named \u0022Ray-Cast Drag\u0022 to \u0022Cross-Section Based Drag\u0022, and \u0022Laminar Drag\u0022 to \u0022Skin Friction Drag\u0022 to more accurately capture the concepts I was trying to describe with the terminology.

What I *DO* know, is I want to see a MUCH improved aerodynamics model in stock, with as much realism as possible, without including some of the scarier features like aerodynamics instability that I think might overly frustrate some of the new players.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe open secret is that once you disconnect aerodynamic forces from mass you can have aerodynamic instability. The same forces, however, can cause aerodynamic stability. I don\u0027t think new players will be frustrated; they\u0027ll learn aerodynamics fine, just as they learn orbital mechanics now. The people who will really complain will be the experienced players who dislike becoming newbies again, because everything they have learned up until now is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe there\u0027s an easier solution to this involving the Difficulty Levels feature, or maybe I\u0027m under-estimating the new players (and they\u0027ll be perfectly capable of dealing with realistic instability issues), I just don\u0027t know. Keep in mind that when I first started playing KSP, I made it to orbit with maybe my 2nd or 3rd launch (once I got a good feel for the rate at which the engines burned fuel) after reading through maybe one or two very basic tutorials on the Wiki, and the Mun *very* soon after that (with only a couple failed attempts- this time while I got a feel for how early/late I needed to start my final landing burn). So I didn\u0027t go through the frustration of struggling just to get a rocket into orbit many new players do, and as such am not really sure how much a new player might be willing to take before they give up... I might tend to under-estimate new players\u0027 determination as a result.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first orbit actually was inside the atmosphere as a result of how tall it is compared to the planet; my sense of scale was wrong.

Let me tell you, that was frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that proper aerodynamics will inevitably result in a somewhat more rewarding rocket launch (you spend a lot more time getting speed and a lot less time waiting to get high enough) I think it will be more enjoyable for players, even with the failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m *hoping* that SQUAD will spend more time listening to guys like you who know how to actually implement revised aero, and less time listening to guys like me who just have some experience playing with it.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027d be highly appreciative if you actually posted a suggestion/discussion thread yourself about what features should/should-not be included in a revised aero model.
