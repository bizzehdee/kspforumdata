The stock solutions for rotary drives, such as stock bearings, propeller motors and the like, are elegant and ingenious. I wanted to use something in one of my builds for powered linear motion and the new \u0027Inflatable Airlock\u0027 seemed to be a possible approach. Click for linear extension or retraction. Then use stock bearings and levers to adjust range of motion or torque. Just the ticket. But I found that nothing can be attached to the Port end of the Airlock while in build mode. Not even a cubic strut, which will attach to almost anything. Kind of like my first girl friend. But if I could attach even just the cubic strut to the Airlock I could build more cool things. Stock. I found a poor solution that requires 2 Airlocks, a Clamp-O-Tron and a cage surrounding the movable part but it seems a kluge (is that how you spell that?). So I want to be able to attach, in build mode, a part to the Port end of the \u0027Inflatable Airlock\u0027. If I can. Please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-08T23:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure what you mean by this post. Do you want the cubic strut to be attachable to the inflatable airlock? Is that what you are suggesting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbService","CreatedById":193070,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-11T02:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCIS... A part that can push and pull a chain of other parts gives me all kinds of good ideas. That Airlock, if you could attach something to the end could do just that. But, as much as I have tried, nothing seems to attach to the end of it. If I could attach the cubic thing-a-ma-whatsit then I could build a chain of parts to move the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
