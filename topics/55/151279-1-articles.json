While I am enjoying the new 1.2 wheel physics and think that in a lot of ways, it\u0027s great, I feel the wheels act too much like magic electricity-to-lateral motion devices.You press forwards, the motors turn on, and you roll forwards. You stop pressing forwards, and you keep your momentum, only slowed by air resistance, while the motors stop consuming electricity. This only makes sense if the motor disengages from the axle whenever it isn\u0027t running (which is precisely the kind of over-complicated thing no spacecraft designer worth their salt would do). In my opinion, it would be much more interesting for the wheel motors to act like proper electric motors-i.e. whenever they aren\u0027t running, they apply torque opposite to the direction of wheel rotation and charge the battery (because DC motors can function as generators). Furthermore, the throttle should have an effect on wheels-it should decrease input voltage (or equivalent Kerbal term) to a percent of the maximum, allowing you to drive forwards at something other than your vehicle\u0027s maximum speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T17:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a little flaw in your reasoning.

Manually adjusting provided voltage to ensure a stable coast would not be particularly fun, and it seems like the kind of thing that would be easy to forget or mess up, especially on bumpy terrain. I know Teslas have regenerative braking on by default, but on the other hand they are designed for flat tarmac, and not so much rough terrain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the way motors consume electric charge makes no sense. However the controls are done, motors should never be in a zero electric charge consumption/production state except. Either voltage is applied to generate enough torque to provide acceleration, or they\u0027re applying voltage to generate enough torque to maintain a velocity, or they\u0027re applying torque to decelerate the motor, or power is being generated through regenerative braking. The \u0022coast\u0022 mode on a typical motor controller is really regenerative braking mode-it\u0027s just labeled coast because it decelerates slower thank \u0022brake\u0022-which applies voltage to decelerate the motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough all of this would require serious changes to the way brakes and wheels work-including removal of the \u0022brake torque\u0022 slider (unless there are physical brakes along with the regenerative ones, which makes everything even more confusing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps regenerative braking isn\u0027t such a good idea for the stock game, simply by merit of being far too complicated to deal with. It\u0027s not like the stock game doesn\u0027t have its share of magic things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
