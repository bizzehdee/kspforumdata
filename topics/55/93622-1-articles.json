I agree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a shower thought just a minute ago that I swear could either be awesome or pointless but what about a schematic feature for creating blueprints for rockets and SSTO\u0027s while you are in-flight? I guess it would be fairly pointless for most instances but consider the times when you have an insanely long burn and want something to do other than just alt-tab the game? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it could be useful for the moments mid-flight when you think, \u0022ah ha!\u0022 and want to quickly edit something in the VAB for next time or just because you have the attention span of a 2 year old. That\u0027s me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, mobile VAB is what I guess I would call it...any takers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Format and spacing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T03:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-19T03:53:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a better form of implementation would be to a) give the advanced inline stabilizer some SAS capability (or at least give us something other than probe cores that will), and make kerbal pilots able to hold and EXECUTE maneuver nodes, with a degree of error perhaps inversely proportional to the kerbals stupidity and experience. From there, add a toggle in the menu, or the editor scene, or something that allows the UT clock (universal time) to run while you\u0027re in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWIth this, you can plot the ejection burn, mid-course correction, and circularization of an interplanetary craft and then forget about it while you go test an SSTO design or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for balance, the drawback is that you can\u0027t use aerobraking for efficiency or lots of other things like that because the craft wouldn.t be loaded, and you could go off course because of execution error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mission sent on its own has a lot more ways to screw up than one you\u0027re manually flying, so I think its an acceptable trade off for being able to manage other aspects of your space program and fly other, shorter, missions whilst your interplanetary is away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
