I my opinion I think that they could be integrated into the tech tree seamlessly and rather than simply giving a new part, they would improve all parts of a certain type. This would allow a solid rocket design to be improved and stay competitive throughout career if the player wished.\n\nE.g.\n\nCommon bulkheads: Would allow fuel tanks to carry slightly more fuel and have slightly less dry mass.\n\nImproved chamber pressures: Improves the ISP of all liquid fuel engines slightly.\n\nComposite Materials: Reduces the mass of most parts slightly.\n\nThese would be placed in the tech tree just as part currently are and could be unlocked when the player has enough science."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T21:46:52Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t it be super-complicated ?

However, as it turns out, user B has only unlocked the parts, and the lack of the required upgrades means significant performance differences that lead to the same craft falling short of entering the Mun\u0027s SOI.\n\nOf course, one could post with their shared craft a list of all the specific tech nodes and upgrades that need to be unlocked, but this makes it unintuitive for newcomers to the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:16:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E physics tell you that there is no way you can put more fuel in a tank without increasing its size ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n Surprisingly not true. I know of 3 ways that can potentially allow more fuel to fit in the same tank.\n\n Common bulkheads: Rather than a separate wall for both the oxidiser and fuel tanks, they share a single wall. Save mass and allows more fuel. This was used on some of the Saturn stages.\n\n Stronger materials: Allows less to be used and so the tank itself can be lighter and with thinner walls. The lithium-aluminium alloy in the Falcon rockets is a good example.\n\n Chilled fuels: Are denser and allow more to be put in the same space.

An engine upgrade would effect all engines. For example the LV-909 could start having: mass 0.75, thrust 40kN, and max ISP 380s. It could then end up mass 0.40, thrust 60kN, and ISP 400s by the end of the tech tree after several upgrades. These would apply to all engines at once to stop a player using a single one to the exclusion of all else.\n\n The only issue with this is craft sharing as sumghai points out. A player at the end of the tech tree would have the same craft perform better than a player at the start."},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:34:41Z","Content":"What is required is the ability for research to retire parts from the VAB/SPH catalogue\n\nYou\u0027ve just researched engine mk2! engine mk1 is set \u0022category = -1\u0022 (the part.cfg for engine mk2 contains researchHides = engineMK1 or similar argument)\n\nThis would leave superseded parts still in the game but no longer appearing in the VAB/SPH (no mk1, mk2, mk3 clutter), similarly flights in progress are not lost/affected and craft using them can still be loaded"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:41:53Z","Content":"I\u0027d definitely be for upgradable parts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The only issue with this is craft sharing as sumghai points out.

If the ship is only made up of a couple of made to fit parts, it takes away things like part of a wing coming off or a fuel tank being destroyed. Half the vehicle would simply go poof instead.\n\nI\u0027ve played with the various procedural mods quite a bit and just didn\u0027t enjoy them at all."}]}
