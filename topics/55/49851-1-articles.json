There is that picture of Kerbal getting ready to strike a golf ball near his lander on the Mun. So I thought \u0022Wouldn\u0027t it be fun to do the same in the game? It actually happened on Apollo 14 mission!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I don\u0027t want the game to become some sort of Mario Golf, but isntead it could provide science points. Also it would be fun to see the ball itself bumping around in Mun\u0027s craters. We already have whack a kerbal in debug window, but it\u0027s not the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think?
