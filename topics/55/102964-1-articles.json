It was a genuinely fun mechanic that you had to account for when landing there. Now, it\u0027s just a dead, boring, moonlike body.

It seems pretty neat. Not to mention a very unique feature...\n\nI have no idea why it was changed. Maybe it was believed to be too difficult?"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T13:59:14Z","Content":"If it was to difficult, then I still don\u0027t get why it had tonbe removed entirely instead of tweaking some numbers. It is indeed a pretty interesting feature, although I don\u0027t know how realistic it is (mostly because: why would it appear near the surface but not in orbit around it/at a similar distance to the sun?). \n\nAnyway I would definetly like more unique features for planets and moons.

They couldn\u0027t make that happen at the time, as they could only make both sides hot through the superheated atmosphere. So they decided Moho was to be more Mercury-like, while a the original concept would be applied to a planet closer to the Sun (where such a concept made more sense) sometime in the future, when they had more control over making a strange planet like that."}]}
