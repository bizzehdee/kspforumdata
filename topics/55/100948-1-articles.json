However I feel this could be expanded in a few ways to further improve gameplay:\n\n1) Being able to set your own waypoints, either on a per-mission basis (for example if you want to go to a particular mountain range on Kerbin for some fancy flying, you could just click the location on the map, \u0022add new waypoint\u0022, perhaps name it, and then follow the icon on the NavBall, or for plotting your route in a rover. They could be persistent, like manoeuvre nodes) or across saves (for example when you find an easter egg, saved in a similar way to the custom part categories). \n\n2) An icon in map view representing the location of KSC. This would make it easier to know where to deorbit to get back to the space centre for recovery, particularly for spaceplanes.\n\n3) Maybe some sort of icon representing your predicted landing site. This makes it easier to deorbit to a particular location.\n\n4) The ability to filter waypoints in map view: KSC, Contracts (maybe by individual contract), Custom Waypoints, and Available Contracts in the Tracking Station.\n\nAlso, there is the bug where landed vessels have the rotational velocity of the planet added until they load in to Physics range. If that has not already been fixed, perhaps the same code could be used when targeting a landed vessel."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T16:13:12Z","Content":"Makes [waypoint manage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104758-0-90-Waypoint-Manager-v2-0-3-2015-02-12-%28Formerly-In-Flight-Waypoints%29)r stock and expand it!"}]}
