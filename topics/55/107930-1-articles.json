Science is a currency? Now that I think about it, it just doesn\u0027t make sense to me for a game aiming for realism. So it should be revamped to approach realism a bit more.

To discover something, you need to observe something. In some cases a scientific tool is needed. To unlock certain experiments, you need to observe certain things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExperimentation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you experiment to unlock a certain part.T do that you need to unlock certain technologies, but before you can do the experiment you need to discover it first. These technologies have a certain level ranging from 1 to 3. Technologies need to be a certain level before certain parts are unlocked. Bigger parts than small require a better level aswell as tiny parts. Experiments have a random chance to unlock a tech and a smaller chance to improve existing tech, but if you already know something about a certain tech, you will be given more information about the experiment you are doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T21:07:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jappards\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFormatting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ImJake","CreatedById":100029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is unrealistic that by driving around and learning about the bios on the mun you are able to \u0022unlock\u0022 something like better parachutes, but I\u0027ve just kinda accepted it at this point.
