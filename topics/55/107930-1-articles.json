Science is a currency? Now that I think about it, it just doesn\u0027t make sense to me for a game aiming for realism. So it should be revamped to approach realism a bit more. First of all, the tech tree as we know it dissappears compleetly.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nInstead of having the start unlocked, you have to start by doing research on the subject you want to experiment with, but you don\u0027t need to discover everything from the beginning, things related to Chemistry are already discovered. To discover something, you need to observe something. In some cases a scientific tool is needed. To unlock certain experiments, you need to observe certain things.\n\n**Experimentation**\n\nThen you experiment to unlock a certain part.T do that you need to unlock certain technologies, but before you can do the experiment you need to discover it first. These technologies have a certain level ranging from 1 to 3. Technologies need to be a certain level before certain parts are unlocked. Bigger parts than small require a better level aswell as tiny parts. Experiments have a random chance to unlock a tech and a smaller chance to improve existing tech, but if you already know something about a certain tech, you will be given more information about the experiment you are doing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T21:07:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jappards**\n  \nFormatting"},{"CreatedByName":"ImJake","CreatedById":100029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:46:24Z","Content":"It is unrealistic that by driving around and learning about the bios on the mun you are able to \u0022unlock\u0022 something like better parachutes, but I\u0027ve just kinda accepted it at this point.

Not quite. With those kerbal companies having underground test facilities in underground kerbal cities making the parts would still not make sense as an agreement: For any experiment on any biome you get science points which you can spent in any direction to help develop.\n2.

I wonder how well it would work to simply make every part available from the start, but bigger and more complex parts require more funds to develop.

Actually I should have added that Reputation should also be a modifier or factor into how much funds you get. Will you mod strategies to convert 100% into funds then?

The whole point system needs to go out the widow to a large extent.\n\nScience needs to be *valuable each game* in and of itself. This pretty much requires some fog of war (a randomized Kerbol system). If each career start could be a new solar system, with nothing known we cannot know by telescopic observation from Kerbin (Kerbin itself could vary like an RSS scaling, perhaps, but stick within what the engines, etc are balanced to, so 1X Kerbin to maybe 3X kerbin at most), then science might have meaning. \u0022Scanning\u0022 could be done with cameras to actually be able to see a map-view, atmospheric scanning can tell you more about what is needed in terms of chutes, etc. ISRU could require data from the surface (or atmosphere) and be forced to be planet specific."},{"CreatedByName":"Aercus","CreatedById":143357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T17:27:36Z","Content":"I honestly believe you guys are singing to the choir on this one.
