Thing is, this only works decently with SAS permanently on, because the engine re-centers itself. It also has the problem of going from 0 to 100% throttle making your craft jerk around while the gimbal adjusts itself to the new acceleration state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea: Those engines (or maybe all) could have a toggle for keeping aligned with CoM. Almost like an auto-trim feature, that would allow you to maybe even steer shuttles without SAS \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-14T10:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s actually a mod that does that.
