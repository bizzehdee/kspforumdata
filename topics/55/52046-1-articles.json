I thought maybe I could flesh out the idea a bit more, since I think it has good potential to add some depth to the game. For example, the player would have incentive to be more careful with their crew selection and to keep their well-trained Kerbals alive longer! Even a relatively simple skill point system could add a bit of flavor, IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESkill Sets\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting - The Kerbal\u0027s experience with the control of various craft. Adds a bonus to craft control (manifest as a bonus to reaction wheel torque/engine vectoring/control surface reaction). Increases the dampening from SAS to reduce oscillations. Some parts get a slight bonus for impact resistance (Landing gear and wheels in particular). Perhaps a slight bonus to engine efficiency (1-2% tops) because a skilled pilot knows how to exploit all the \u0022sweet spots\u0022 in the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERepair - For this to work you\u0027d need to modify Kerbal-performed EVA activities a bit to add a chance of failure. Repair skills decrease failure rate and at higher skill levels may add resistance to further malfunction or better, \u0022tuned\u0022 performance for bits that have been graced by the touch of a skilled Kerbal\u0027s wrench. (Bonus: Three levels of failure! \u0022Failure\u0022 and simply try again, \u0022Catastrophic failure\u0022 and part is permanently disabled for the rest of the mission, and \u0022Spectacular failure\u0022 where the part explodes. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience - Specializing in research protocols, a Kerbal trained in science can get more science point yield per experiment. (NOT necessarily increasing the total science points obtainable at a particular location, just how much you can extract per attempt/scan/sample). Having a Science major on board automatically adds the bonus to most things, however taking samples and making EVA reports under certain situations would be particularly fruitful, and transmissions may be slightly less lossy. Automated science experiments may also have a chance to fail, which will need a keen mind to reset and prevent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, using a Kerbal who is inappropriately skilled may have the opposite of the desired effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGetting Skill Points\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I could go two ways with this... one is a generic RPG style experience system where you distribute the skill points as you like based on earned mission experience. Consider it like sending them for training or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be easier and more appropriate, however, to automatically increase skills based on the things the individual Kerbals have done in their careers as \u0022On the Job Training.\u0022 For example, using the same Kerbal to always perform repairs will gradually increase that Kerbal\u0027s repair skill, having the same Kerbal in the top slot of the crew (or only crew in a particular capsule/seat) would improve his piloting skills, and having the same Kerbal interact with science equipment would improve science skills. This also allows for Kerbals to improve during a mission, instead of waiting until afterwards... so your crew becomes more valuable over time and you have more reason to bring them home in one piece!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach Kerbal recruit would start with a random level of each skill but usually be fairly poor all-around except, perhaps, for the occasional prodigy/Badass. You can add a hidden stat for how well a particular Kerbal learns (\u0022Stupidity\u0022 ?) for extra fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptionally, these stats could work against each other so it would not be possible to max out all three of them at the same time. Either a cap on the total amount of stat that can be added, or subtracting from one stat as another is improved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to go the extra mile, throw in a \u0022Ruggedness\u0022 stat to increase Kerbal\u0027s durability in case they ever \u0022fix\u0022 how well they currently bounce.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T03:34:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a combination of being able to pay for training and on-the-job would make sense. That way once your space program is up and running you don\u0027t have to do too many training flights for rookies, or break something on purpose for your kerbalnaught to repair. Perhaps there could be a cap on the training or it gets much more expensive for the higher levels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T09:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI forgot about the funding mechanic!
