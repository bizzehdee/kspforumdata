This would change the Isp of the engine its placed on, so it doesn\u0027t have to be an \u0022overpowered\u0022 engine, but a modifier for other engines. It would take up the bottom node and add weight.\n\nAt any rate, the Aerospike as an engine is just too underpowered for the one case where it should be most useful, on the surface of Eve.\n\n(And thank you so much everyone for telling me about how bad and senseless this idea is. I feel so happy right now.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T13:15:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tay_T","CreatedById":67173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:22:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ... have it be a nozzle that you place on other engines.

What if this was how it worked for every engine? Maybe allowing nozzle adjustments and therefore efficiency changes, like a balance for air or space travel \u0022Isp\u0022 wise, kind of similar to the modeller for the fairings would be amazing. However! That\u0027s drifting off subject, I do agree with your idea, it would be very fascinating to see your idea imported into KSP somehow.\n\nSo in other words, I second this notion. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Great idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:15:27Z","Content":"But the aerospike isn\u0027t a nozzle that you can just stick on any old rocket engine.

Swapping nozzles around on engines just seems too fiddly, and particularly not viable to use the Aerospike as an alternative nozzle for a conventional bell engine. Even swapping bells around on bell engines seems dubious to me, as the bell has to be matched to the other parts of the engine, as I understand it, it\u0027s a complete package where the size and design of the bell has to be closely matched to the turbo pumps, etc. The nozzle is actually part of the fuel system as well, with fuel circulating around pipes integrated in the nozzle, to cool it, before it goes to the combustion chambers.\n\nNot convinced at all by this, or that a whole custom engine system would really be worth the effort. The game might benefit from some more choices in engine, but I don\u0027t think we really need the vast array of choice from custom mix and match building."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T06:50:18Z","Content":"Sorry, but that\u0027s a very bad idea.\n\nThe Aerospike isn\u0027t an overpowered engine, at least it doesn\u0027t have to be if its stat were balanced correctly.
