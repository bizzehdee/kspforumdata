Instead, I suggest a new, only ramjet/scramjet item, to be a high-tech alternate to the RAPIER, wich should have its new advantages too. Also, crafts with complex engines should be superior. Making those engines more realistic could solve the problem. Here are my ideas:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA scramjet engine is a very simple type of jet engine, that is miserably unefficient and weak at low speeds, but efficient and strong at high speeds. The faster you go, the more thrust and Isp you have. Their performance, determined by your speed, is extreme, as you can reach incredibly high speeds with them, witouth the worry of overheating, while they produce no thrust at low speeds. They can operate at medium speeds, with a poor efficiency. They also consume a lot of fuel. With scramjet engines, you can reach incredible speeds, a vast majority of orbital speed, still in the atmosphere, but they consume much fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, RAPIER engines are supposed to be SABRE engines, wich are ramjet-rocket hybrids. In the air-breathing mode, they are mostly different from a single ramjet in complexity, and that it can use the heat to power its pumps. They are not so good ramjets in air-breathing mode, but they are excellent rockets in rocket mode. However, in the game, they function as a super-strong, overpowered ramjet in air-breathing mode, and nearly the worst rocket in rocket mode. Either this should be changed, or add to the diversity of the game, by making it work with a whole new,different mechanism. I think they could be conventional rocket engines in air-breathing mode, relying on intake air. (If you look at it\u0027s texture, it has rocket thrusters, but no ramjets.) This would not only make them appropriate, the only VTOL choice, the game diverse, but it would help a lot those starters, who can\u0027t drive jet crafts to orbit. Also, they shouldn\u0027t stand the extreme conditions at high speeds, meaning that they have limited abilities in the atmosphere, due to the major overheating. Just like in real life. Even with spamming precoolers, you should hardly be able to reach the atmospheric performance of scramjets. On the other hand, RAPIER engines aren\u0027t such fuel-waster monsters like scramjets. So with the air-breathing mode of RAIPER engines, you could gain a lot less velocity in the atmosphere, as the faster you go the more heat you will have--\u0026gt;overheating--\u0026gt;lower performance, but you will be more efficient there. The engine itself is quite simple, so that it shouldn\u0027t cost 6000. However, precoolers should be more expensive, and should only cool down the air, instead of giving fuel, and plus air from nothing. Precoolers should be more expensive, also because they determine the atmospheric performance of RAPIER engines. The more precoolers you have, the more velocity you can get in the atmosphere. Also, precoolerless RAIPER engines could be used as an effective and cheap air-consuming lower-stage rocket booster, where there are safer conditions. This would also make its name fit it (\u0026lt;...\u0026gt; for Rockets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional heat of intakes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EAir intakes apply an additional heat, to the engines. \u003C/span\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThis heat is caused by the high-speed air. \u003C/span\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EHigher mach number, more of this special heat. \u003C/span\u003E \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EA lot stronger than heat caused by drag.

On the other hand, altough scramjet planes are a bit more efficient, they are a lot harder to drive. The REAL difference comes with the upgraded variants. Upgraded ramjet-planes recieve a basic jet engine stage, meaning that they become even more complex and hard to build. Upgraded RAPIER planes recieve additional preccolers, but they become even more costly. So, if you upgrade these to have even more performance, you can either choose complexity and cheaper-ness, or simplicity and higher costs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwaiting replies.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T11:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T13:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour analysis is fundamentally flawed, as there is no pure ramjet in the game.

Interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost release, planes don\u0027t have to be built like they used to in order to go 1400m/s on jets, and they can accelerate faster and at lower altitudes. I\u0027ll go see what top speed I get on constant thrust nowadays. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, by constantly changing the throttle to keep the thrust at around 130 on each turbojet of the Ravenspear Mk1 I got up to 700m/s or so at 20k or so altitude level flight. I imagine a tiny plane like I used to use could do a reasonably good speed like that, but so can a regular sized craft now. Then when I maxed out the throttle, dove for air, and came back up once I had enough speed to ram the air in better at high alt, I got up to 1200 at a 45* angle, and did it much faster than the first time. The higher thrust lets you keep breathing air longer and it\u0027s less speed to need to make up with rockets. Space jets go boing boing.You just can\u0027t go as fast with low thrust, and it isn\u0027t like you can\u0027t set the brakes while the engines spool up if you have a particularly heavy aircraft, so thrust at low speed isn\u0027t an issue either, the regular engines can take off and accelerate to operating speed on their own generally. Shall I mention again that if the rapiers need turbojets to go with them you might as well use some other rocket engine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T18:59:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with Ramjets and Scramjets is: the new default re entry heat.

It\u0027s fast, but not convenient if your plans involve flying around kerbin, rather than going to orbit. I find that with the current system it\u0027s best to let yourself get a suborbital arc and shut off your engines until you reenter and then do it again if you are trying to circle Kerbin. Oh, as for the shuttle and sr-72, the shuttle used insulation not ablation- the tiles were reusable if they didn\u0027t get damaged AFAIK. Ablative heat shields are like what capsules use, and they get used up because the material they are made of actually comes off to carry away the heat, whereas the shuttle just tried to insulate from it long enough to reenter and the jets are built to operate while hot since they are flying around like that not trying to slow down. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking maybe make the ram air intake and the shock cone intake have even better heat tolerance, and do that to the nosecones too, and it might just be enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:44:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese issues are invalid now.
