The closest confirmed planetary system is Epislon Eridani at 100 trillion km or 100000000000000m. To get there you would need a rocket of monumental proportions, you would have to chart your course VERY carefully, and you would have to build the craft in orbit as it couldn\u0027t possibly fit in the VAB. This craft file would be so big that even if you combined all of Earths hard-drives and USB\u0027s you would not have enough file space to store this thing, not to mention that KSP would be unable to handle it and crash on even a hint of loading, and even if KSP did work, no computer could run such a beast. So unless they add warp drives or some other mass propulsion system that is unamanglnable. Either that or you\u0027re going to have to chart some sort of clever course that matches you up with minimal fuel in which case you are going to have to time warp for centuries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other way I see other planetary systems is if squad make solar systems not to scale with real life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
