If the asteriod lands in sea it will make the atmosphere more foggy and dense, if the asteriod lands on land it will make the atmosphere red and any fast movement in the sky burns, reducing the toughness of parts a lot. And perhaps recovering the asteriod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mlah","CreatedById":64670,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T23:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CjStaal\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CjStaal\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s what I\u0027m saying though.

The novelty of an doomsday scenario isn\u0027t worth ruining what could be anywhere from several to several hundreds of hour worth of progress, especially seeing as you can already do the redirect missions of your own volition.
