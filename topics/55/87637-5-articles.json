Something impossible to do without a little space strategy or some great reward that you wouldn\u0027t be able to get otherwise. I propose the off kerbin VAB \u002B launch pad! Setting one up would require scouting, building infrastructure and mining considerable amounts of resources.

Likewise ISP in game doesn\u0027t work like ISP actually works because...

Anyways, not particularly relevant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I always imagined ISRU in KSP would consist of an ISRE (in situ resource extraction) and an ISRP (in situ resource production) part and appropriate tankage, so that we can have the option of establishing bases for processing and storage, and have vehicles that go out and get us the raw materials to be processed. From a game design perspective, the only thing simpler would be a drill that drills fuel directly from planets... and methinks that while that is a possibility, our erstwhile developers will hopefully take a two stage approach of extraction and processing for gameplay reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO resource hunting shouldn\u0027t be done with a scanner except to reveal \u003Cem\u003Elikelihoods\u003C/em\u003E of the presence of resources (which could just as likely be go/no-go result as a % of resources present) so we establish the best places to hunt for resources rather than reveal them. The actual confirmation of the presence of resources should instead be by gathering samples and either returning them to a mobile lab or sending them back to Kerbin for resource analysis in lieu of science, and would reveal an area on the map that displays where (if any) resources are. The area could be small enough that multiple samples could be gathered by rover (say each sample reveals a 2km or 5km radius circle of resources present) for hard difficulties, and could be up to 100% of the biome or the planet or whatever for easy difficulties. In any case, the result would reveal the best places to set up the ISRE or whatever it is we players decide to do with the info.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, once we have those resources, everything will of course boil down to resources \u002B electricity = fuel/monopropellant/snacks/whateverelsetheyhaveplanned so they may likely have to rethink the electrical generating parts (can we say NTG Spam?). And hopefully they don\u0027t come up with a ton of resources. Really all I see is a base resource for making fuel, and another resource (say Kerbolium\u003Csub\u003E3\u003C/sub\u003E) for returning to kerbin to advance kerbal civilization with environmentally friendly fusion power.

I think it would depend on how you wanted to play it and what you thought you could efficiently employ given the situation. There might only be small deposits on the Mun, making it more efficient to leave your refinery in orbit and jaunt down for small H20 fill-ups, or if you found a convenient geyser on Duna you could land a permanent refinery base there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just think this is the most straight-forward implementation. The task of mapping resources, launching and carefully landing drill rigs and refineries is challenging enough. I see no reason to overcomplicate things.

The other nice thing about this is you could dovetail it into life support later in development, with greenhouses converting H20 and electricity into snacks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-24T21:01:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2014 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tux","CreatedById":111829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T22:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewait...what? we are not in beta already? wow...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the best game that has stayed in early access...ever..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T20:11:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was considering the question: \u0022What kinds of propellants do KSP rockets appear to use based on what we see in the game (tank sizes and masses, and the oxidizer-to-fuel mass ratio used by engines)?\u0022.

I placed a capsule on the launch pad and EVA\u0027d the kerbal to measure his altitude...and then I placed a capsule on top of a stack of 20 FL-T400 tanks and did the same thing. The result is that an FL-T400 tank is 1.9 meters tall. Measuring the length and diameter of the tank on the screen showed that the tank was 1.112 meters in diameter. This is not the 1.25 meters expected because I measured the surface of the tank that is indented in the image. Assuming a wall and bulkhead thickness of 2 cm, this gives an internal tank volume of 1.661 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. If you want to ignore the on-screen measurements of the apparent indented diameter and use 1.25 meters as the diameter, you get a tank internal volume of 2.116 m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E (again, assuming 2 cm wall and bulkhead thickness). The 2 cm thickness is enough to easily account for the 0.25 metric ton dry mass of the stage (allowing for double-wall aluminum construction with insulation between).

For the full 1.25 m diameter tank, the closest fit to 2 tons is kerosene/LOX. I was sad to see that my preferred choice of methane/LOX does not result in getting 2 tons of propellants into the tank.
