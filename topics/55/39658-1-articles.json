The gravity one may be useful if you want to do the hardcore math for TWR values, but the greater majority of players (okay, this is just an assumption here) don\u0027t do a whole lot of math. The temperature one is also completely useless, as heat doesn\u0027t radiate properly, and sticking one on an engine doesn\u0027t give you the heat of the engine, it gives you the heat of the atmosphere, which as stated earlier, isn\u0027t modeled very accurately. Next we have one the accelerometer, which aside from one experiment I did with ion engines, serves no real purpose as Kerbals don\u0027t die if they take high G\u0027s (unless it is something absurdly high that I am not aware of). Lastly, there is the barometer, and had we not been given the ability to see the ISP of the rocket just by right clicking it, may have had some real practicality, but alas not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the (hopefully .22) upcoming resources, what if we had all of these scientific parts help us determine what resources can be on which bodies? The logic behind this being that in reality, certain materials can only exist under certain conditions, and therefore things like methane can\u0027t be found on Mercury due to the lack of both low temperature and atmosphere, but it is found abundantly in Titan, as Titan has a thick atmosphere, and is very cold.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the mission control building (that\u0027s the unclickable one, in case anyone didn\u0027t know), there would be a reference sheet of ranges and the correlating resources. For example, what is refined into liquid fuel, may only be found on bodies with atmospheres \u0026gt;0.1 atm and \u0026lt;0.75 atm. (NOTE: That range was just pulled out of thin air (no pun intended), it has no IRL science basis to it).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sytaline","CreatedById":64225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T17:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, no do math good.
