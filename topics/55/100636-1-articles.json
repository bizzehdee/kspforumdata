(Alt\u002B,). Going beyond that becomes tricky, since TWx5, TWx50, etc. are all On-Rails calculations (the orbits are unchangeable, and basically only looked at by the code once). In order to burn while in high TW, they would have to always be off-rails calculations. KSP is essentially runnable because only your active flight is calculated off-rails. Calculating multiple flights off-rails would make your game into a slideshow, and probably crash it instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd besides, you wouldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E to have the super-human reflexes nessesary to cancel a burn at the right time in 100000xTW, would you? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T21:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHold alt when you timewarp to use physics warp instead of regular timewarp\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T15:24:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut with low TWR vessels, in particular ion probes, it can take several minutes to perform a large engine burn.
