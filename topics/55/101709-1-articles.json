Most KSP crew compartments are small command pods, with a dedicated hatch separate from any docking ports that may be installed on the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of large space station modules (such as those in my FusTek pack), these hatches would be located at the two ends of the compartment, where docking ports would also be located. If both ends are docked to other compartments, then the hatch would be inaccessible to mouse clicks, and so there\u0027s no point in having hatches there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWell, why don\u0027t you move the hatch onto the side of the modules, away from the ends with the docking ports?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany of these station modules are habitation areas, which are not intended to be depressurized on a regular basis. An airlock isn\u0027t just a door; it also includes a lockout chamber, bulkheads, life support, air pumps etc. Designing every single station module to also double as an airlock adds unneeded redundancy and complexity to each part. Besides, who would depressurize an entire space station just to let one astronaut go on a space walk?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother type of crew-habitable part that doesn\u0027t have hatches opening to the outside are crew tunnels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIf you don\u0027t want it to look like a hatch, just disguise the airlock / hatch collider as a window or panel!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an extremely hacky workaround, and would give users the option of essentially teleporting Kerbals out through solid walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Crew Manifest / Ship Manifest allows you to transfer crew directly without clicking on hatches.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use SM on a regular basis, and it\u0027s a great add-on.
