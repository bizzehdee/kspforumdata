My purpose isn\u0027t to just spam pro-multiplayer arguments, but to share a glimpse of the multiplayer experience, plus it is a great way to teach new people how to play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMP works great, the warp system is a elegant solution, I have a LAN private server that I run for my room mates.\u00A0 It adds so much more to the game to have others come and use stations and ships I\u0027ve designed and use each others achievements to gain career progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, its not just launching rockets at the same time that is fun, it\u0027s the fact that others are working towards the same goal, and you all have a common saved solar system.\u00A0 It\u0027s a lot like swapping save games back and forth, but much faster and you can play the same save at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIssues that could be fixed with a official multiplayer version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the DMP mod I get ghost duplicate ships on reverts that are usually during launches on new designs which inevitably crash back into Kerbin causing a negative reputation for killing the Kerbal pilot. I offset this by occasionally editing the player files manually to reset rep back to 0. It\u0027s less of a problem as designs are improved and reverts are less frequent. Money, and research are unaffected by this bug, It of course doesn\u0027t matter at all in sandbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMP mod also has issues with live player-player interactions, which we try to avoid on important stations in case something goes horribly wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of these problems dissuade me in the satisfaction of docking at a station and being able to refuel with fuel that was delivered by another player who may have been playing 6 hours previously, or have a unmanned probe have connection to the comms network because of another players newly added orbiting satellite, obviously the co-op experience adds life to the Kerbal system. It is a great addition to the game and has sold more copies of the game as the people I play with purchased KSP due to the fact that a working multiplayer mod existed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 I am very interested in a official\u00A0 multiplayer, with private or lan server capability.\u00A0 I would instantly purchase a \u0022KSP 2\u0022 or KSP 1 DLC with this feature.
