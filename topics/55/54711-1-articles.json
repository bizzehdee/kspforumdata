Everyone has their reasons, but I personally would love too see this in game some day, if it was implemented in a challenging and hard way. Because tech like this would grant huge benefits, it should be equally hard to gain those benefits. And as I\u0027ve recently started being interested in orbital construction via docking ports, this came to mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding stargates in space by assembling 4-5 parts of it in orbit around Kerbin (and one at your destination too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts would be huge, hence why they\u0027d have to be built in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce 2 stargates are constructed completely, you can bind them only and only once, and this process can\u0027t be changed. If one stargate is damaged or destroyed, so is the other one. (or if that\u0027s too harsh, the other one goes offline until the previous one is repaired. Still can\u0027t be bound to a different stargate though.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo enter a stargate, you would either have dock with it (it\u0027s portal), or just pass right through it. Upon exiting on the other side, the rocket maintains the same Delta/v and direction (which only changes depending on the rotation of the exit portal) as when it entered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStargates would require huge amounts of electricity to perform one teleport, and maybe the bigger the rocket that goes through (more parts/mass) the more electricity it would need. If a rocket too big for the amount of electricity the stargate has tries to go through, BOOM, everything blows to kingdom come)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo building one stargate in orbit around Kerbin is hard enough, but if you want the other one, the farther you\u0027d want it to take you, the harder it would be to take the stargate there and assemble it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know this sounds like a mod, but I just hate mods that affect gameplay, and I\u0027d like awesome things to be developed, balanced and implemented by the devs themselves. Questions/thoughts/discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those asking why would one eliminate the core basics of this game which is orbital manuvaring between planets, take a look at this comment:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t completely hate the idea of being able to establish a device which would teleport a ship from one orbit to another.
