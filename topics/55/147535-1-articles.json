When I came into the situation that I needed one of my vintage savegames, I looked into the backup folder and found... several \u0022persistent (date,time).sfs\u0022 files but not a trace of the .sfs files I moved into that folder. A few configs that got moved as well are still there, I take this as a sign that I\u0027m not imagining it, that one day I really marked everything and moved it to the Backup folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently KSP zealously rubs out any extra sfs files in the backup folder, even if they do not match the naming convention of KSP\u0027s backups (and hence are in all likelyhood none of the automatic backups). Would be nice if this could be changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T10:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sorry for your loss, but one can in similar fashion argue that you shouldn\u0027t be placing files (and subfolders) in folders you didn\u0027t create, even if it is convenient. A simple solution would be to make a folder \u0022laie\u0027s backup\u0022 and put your files there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanother solution is to convert the saved games (folders, really) into zip files and leave them in the saved games folder, if you\u0027re after such convenience.
