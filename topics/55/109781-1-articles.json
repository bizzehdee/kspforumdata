It would be nice if, when both COM and COT are toggled on, the torque vector relative to COM were displayed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T10:01:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by akruppa**\n  \ntypos"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T21:50:55Z","Content":"I love rhis idea ! it would make shuttles so much easier...
