I was wishing I could manually replace solar panels when it occurred to me: If there were such a thing as a really, really tiny docking port (smaller than the Jr. Model) I could just undock the old one, ship a new one up on a rocket, and dock it into place. Micro docking ports, or docking plugs, would allow a small connection for disposable/replaceable components to be mounted to whatever you need it to, so long as it has a compatible port as well. It would be most useful for things like thermal generators and solar panels, but could see use in orbital refueling of craft too small to comfortably fit larger ports. Opinions, anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sumyunguy","CreatedById":76225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried this with Jr. Docking ports?

A new micro-port would be nice. It could either be used as a standalone piece or extra holds for larger docking situations for more stability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John Nowak","CreatedById":67890,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T18:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the Attachment Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/attachment-pack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/attachment-pack/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T19:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat seems pretty cool, but it seems that 1) it does not appear to be updated to 0.21 and 2) it only works with the stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T19:55:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by zxczxczbfg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
