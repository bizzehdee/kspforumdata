Also one of the moon of Jool rotating retrograde around it, maybe bop since it could be a captured asteroid. As for science I would like to see a medical exam when the kerbal returns from orbit, perhaps some tweaks required for further safe exploration. For example you do a suborbital or single orbit flight when you start the game, collect science about the reaction of the kerbal\u0027s body and then use that research to create a safer capsule for longer duration flights. Perhaps a resource like elements that can be recovered to create atomic fuels, so say two trips to Duna and back allows you to make enough fuel to go to Dres or Mojo one way on a stock atomic engine.
