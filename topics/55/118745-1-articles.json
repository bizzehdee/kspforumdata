However, it\u0027s impossible to target them for flight guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, you can plant flags and launch dummy probes in orbit, but that means more memory usage because those craft are simulated (even flags are flyable objects) and it may be a bit cumbersome to do so just for arbitrary reference points in space. Also, static waypoints in mid-air are difficult right now. (A good example would be a series of waypoints for the runway 09 approach from orbit to the KSC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, there would be directional waypoints as well which can be followed on the navball \u0027Target\u0027 mode. An ILS runway 9 approach, for example, would be a waypoint on the runway threshold which has a direction pointing along the runway, with a 3 degree slope upwards. This way you would be able to auto-land your aircraft with SAS on \u0027Target Retrograde\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T11:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA mod that I want it to be stock does this.

Your target shows up in the nav ball (pink icon), and an extra navball view mode is added. It also allows additional SAS modes (Target, Anti-Target, and the movement modes relative to the motion of said target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, only flyable objects (ships, bases, rovers, stations, flags, debris, etc.) can be set as target, no virtual waypoints.
