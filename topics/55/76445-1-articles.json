Not only because it would make identifying and relating landing locations much easier, but also to help flesh out the landscapes with some life and backstory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if the current state of planetary/munar topography in KSP would allow to identify distinct gelogical formations like Craters, Highlands, Marinas, Mountains, Rilles, Valleys and so on, so it would be nice if someone with a background in geology/geography/cartography could weigh in on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad could act as the head of the Commission for Planetary Cartography and use the forum as tool to collect naming proposals for a geological formation of the week and put it up for a vote. The naming could be used to honor distinguished KSP community members (think Manley Crater, Ferram Rille etc...), but also more Kerbal like vocabulary like Snackus Mons could be used. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that finally we would have some sort of map that could be used ingame which would allow for mission/contract description like this: \u0022Fly to the Mun, land at northeastern quadrant of Manley Crater and conduct impact seismology experiments\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think ? I know there have already been countless suggestions to name things in KSP and they all ended with a lot of proposals starting with the letter K, but I really believe having relateable locations that have real names might help with immersion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.infohow.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moon-World-Map.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.infohow.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Moon-World-Map.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR - I think we should start naming mountains and valleys on planets and moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT for real moon map\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-01T20:46:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2014 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Josson K.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T23:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m all for the naming of the geological features.
