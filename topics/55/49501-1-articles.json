I saw on the internet the other days that Juno got a gravity assist from earth to get to Jupiter so I found out that, that is the most efficient way to reach other planets but when I tried it in KSP, I found out that the maneuver node only shows a max of three gravity encounters (where it changes color yellow,purple,green) so if I wanted a gravity assist from eve to get to duna all I would see is the escape from kerbin (yellow), kerbol orbit (purple) and then the eve encounter (green) but I can\u0027t see anymore, so I won\u0027t know if Eve will give me a gravity assist to Duna or not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso was wondering if there is somewhere a calculator like this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eone\u003C/a\u003E but that it can show multiple angles to be able to use the gravity assist method.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T21:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn easy fix for this is to open your settings.cfg (located in your ksp directory).
