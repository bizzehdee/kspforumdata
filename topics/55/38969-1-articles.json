Its short sometimes and longer other times. Doesn\u0027t seem long but I feel as if it is lol.. Same goes for launching. The audio screeches as well which is horrible when you have headphones on like me. Doesn\u0027t seem long but I feel as if it is lol. The whole point of the new Pstate system was to help with load times and remove the need to reload everything everytime right? Wrong? I know the Pstate is still new and needs further work but just though i post something about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have this? I just feel as if maybe there was some way to improve it somehow? Just a discussion is all. Not really worthy for a bug report if its meant to be like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there is a lot of information the game has to load for the scene which would explain the load times.
