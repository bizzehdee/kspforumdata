This could possibly be done by separating all vehicles separated via docks and or claws as other vehicles. Then you can allow a super Plus right click type of option between two vehicles and then tranfser fuel between them as whole objects and fill the fuel evenly as it would when burning it to refill all parts of the ship. This would help all complex vehicles and allow refueling where otherwise it may be hard or impossible to find individual tanks. Things in CArgo bays could or should be allowed to transfer fuel through the main ship from another vehicle(through the fuel lines)potentially and be able to be fuel separately from the main ship so you do not have to haul full vehicles etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB/SPH it should add a resource window and allow you to select either a single resource and slide it like how an individual tank allows so you can play with the weight of the vehicle. This should also have an option to do this with all/multiple resources simultaneously so you can play with various weight distribution setups and more accurately simulate fuel use in flight!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T19:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like an advanced vehicle properties window.

I\u0027ve always wondered why they haven\u0027t been used more. They could have an advanced computer system that can only be fully used from IVA. That could make a great internal computer system for all ships. They could make several versions of it too and add a new tech tree to unlock with computer system OSes to unlock etc! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if they do the thing with the resource window and seperate vehicles it takes care of a swathe of stuff for stacked parts with a simplified version when using Normal 3rd person mode. The rest would be great in the Internal Interface in the ship. I still swore it had that when I first started playing. But it never seemed to get more advanced or I\u0027m remembering another game. I can\u0027t really play my current ship with high enough graphics to see. That or they tend to be unmanned and don\u0027t have a cockpit! 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Another cool thing might be the ability to make ISRU\u0027s only fill up another vehicle or specific tank. A big OS could do alot of that. And making some of that only in the cockpit could give a cool way to make IVA useful. Especially as it could be more convenient to simply go IVA and make a zoom in of the computer screen and use it to go over everything in the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T20:08:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 08:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T09:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have made multiple threads about better fuel control specifically being able to add fuel tank \u0022tick boxes\u0022 to the action groups, so you can activate/deactivate more then one tank at a time.
