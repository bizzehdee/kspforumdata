There are some cool easter eggs out there right now like the arches but I would love to see something more varied with its own biomes. I believe that having cave systems to explore would add a rather interesting dynamic to the game... not to mention an added challenge to surface vehicle designers. It would be an added challenge because many caves can be rather haphazard in formation... winding back and forth for a few hundred feet then suddenly plummeting vertically into vast caverns with more passages winding deeper still. So not only will your rover have to do... what a rover does... but it will also have to be able to fly *precisely* through tight formations that are either too rugged for wheels or would cause it to be damaged in a flip or fall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI only suggest this because I have not seen any posts from the devs discussing it... I know NovaSilisko had planned for some very cool things such as geysers in the past and maybe caves also were thought of at the same time. I have hope that the Devs will be expanding on surface details once the core gameplay updates start winding down, and I believe some variety to rocky worlds other than simple elevation changes would be a great place to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T01:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, it would be awesome.

I was thinking more along the lines of very large \u0022easter eggs\u0022 to make up the cave formations. I think this could be more easily accomplished by making a cavity in the overall planet mesh, then plopping down the cave model into the cavity. Not sure how this would look from a distance (possible graphical artifacts/glitches) or if the Unity engine would allow for such a large model with its own colliders without slowing to a crawl. I really like the idea of caves on some worlds being flooded, say on Laythe, it would be a bit more variety and another interesting part of the challenge :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T18:58:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nId love to see stuff like this because it would really make planetary exploration more interesting.\u00A0 That said, a good first step would be to add a few easter egg like natural formations, and fix the ones that were left underground (like the cave on tylo).\u00A0 Not an ideal solution, but it doesnt require adding alot more colliders and polygons (all of which do affect performance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, if the devs find the time and can pull it off without making the game much laggier, i am all for cave like formations on planets where it makes sense to have them.\u00A0 Maybee we can even get a massive cave where you can like fly into a planet\u0027s core while we are at it.\u00A0 It would be very interesting to experience the 0 gravity zone inside a planet (ofc assuming its not a melted core in which case the EVA kerbal instantly goes poof).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Racescort666","CreatedById":137852,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-02T14:09:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCloud City on Jool?
