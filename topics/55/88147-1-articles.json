Previously this has required duplicate tanks or a plugin like B9 uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest that instead of additional variants, fuel tank contents should be a function of the fill level tweakables. If, for example, you reduce the level of oxidizer in a tank, it would add available empty space to the fuel side of the slider, which you could then fill with LF. using this space would of course remove the empty space from the oxidizer side. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEXAMPLE TANK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllllllllllllll]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllllllllllllll]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllllllllllllll ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllll ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid Fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOxidizer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[lllllllllllllll]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that make any sense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T06:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027s realistic, but gameplay wise it\u0027s not a bad idea.
