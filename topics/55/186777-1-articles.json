It just works kinda weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you stack same sized (and taper matching) parts then their drag is reduced. Otherwise\u00A0air\u00A0passes straight through leading parts and causes drag on parts behind. For instance, you can have a huge deployed\u00A0heatshield out front and all the parts behind it are subject to drag as though it wasn\u0027t present.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get that leading parts in RL are not going to eliminate the drag of the parts behind completely but they\u00A0reduce it to some appreciable extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich brings us to KSP heat occlusion. It works a bit more logically.
