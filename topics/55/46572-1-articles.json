However, I can\u0027t seem to get rid of that little icon on the bottom left (the microphone.) It\u0027s a little annoying and I couldn\u0027t find a way to hide it. I tried going to the files and deleted the icons because i thought that would get rid of it. Well instead of the icon, not it just shows a gray box with a text inside of it that says \u0022Chatterer.\u0022 Does anyone know how to hide windows like that if you have mods installed? Whether it would be deleting a certain file in the mod files or pressing some keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if I posted this in the wrong section, I\u0027m new to the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T02:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t hiding that make it impossible to change any chatterer settings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jellyman","CreatedById":83295,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T03:01:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually don\u0027t change the settings.
