Aerospikes are not \u0022Iwin\u0022 engines that break the laws of physics by having the *same* Isp in vacuum and in atmosphere. Aerospikes are engines that have *near* optmial Isp *no matter the pressure.* You can never do *better* than optimal at a given pressure, but you can do a lot worse; bells are optimized for one pressure, aerospikes are 95% optimal at most all pressures."}]}
