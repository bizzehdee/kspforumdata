While the easier solution would be to just iron out the kinks, it would offer far more to the game to add a new contract system that is more realistic and fun at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy proposal is thus: Instead of contracts where you do X to get Y funds, and if you fail you lose Z funds, redo the contract system so that players can \u0022haggle\u0022 with the various companies, and make contracts more generalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, reputation would now be per company. A high company reputation would offer rewards like discounts on parts for that company, and a higher reward margin in contracts (you could ask for more funds and would be more likely to get them). Your main reputation bar would be the average of all your company reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTourists would now be persistent, that is, you could get the same tourist multiple times, and they would \u0022remember\u0022 you, so each tourist would get their own reputation bar. Killing a tourist would result in a detrimental loss in rep for all tourists. Tourists that you offer discounts to (more on that later) would be more likely to come back, while a kerbal that you charge the Kraken out of will likely never be seen again. To prevent clutter of tourist rep bars, they would become hidden if that tourist had not hired you in a year. If you later accepted a contract from them, the bar would reappear the same that it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract Format\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGoal:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is basically what the company wants you to do, like build a space station or launch a satellite. These are usually not up for negotiation, except for X Program contracts. Now, goals are much more generalized, so instead of a bunch of different contracts having to do with the Mun, you would get a single one called \u0022Mun Program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESubgoals:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would be a checklist of things that you would need to do to complete the main goal, and you could select tasks that you want to do. For each contract, there would be a few mandatory tasks, and a minimum amount of subgoals would have to be selected. You could do more than one of each type, but you would get diminishing returns for each one. You would also get funds for each subgoal (more on that later). If you completed all of the tasks for a contract, you would get an additional 50% bonus on funds and company rep.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAdvance, Completion and Penalty Funds and Rep\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Note: I am lumping the advance, completion, and penalty funds into one part of the contract format as they are all pretty similar)\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere, you would see the company\u0027s proposal for the contract\u0027s rewards, but there would be sliders for the amount of funds that you want for completing the contract. Each task has its own slider and rewards, which are given to you as you complete them. Some contracts are short-term, lasting only a few weeks with one thing to do, while some can last for years, like a long-term station maintenance contract with a huge list of things to do in that time period. The more funds you ask for, the less likely it is that you will get the contract. Requesting a large amount of funds will also make the penalty for failing the contract increase. This ensures that you can\u0027t ask for 10000000000 funds for launching a satellite to LKO. Offering discounts by asking for a slightly lower amount of reward funds will increase your reputation with that company.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look at an example of a contract under this new system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMun Program\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sliders for the Mun Program can only affect fund rewards by 20%\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompany: The Goverment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimum items: 5\u003Cbr\u003E\nOrbit an unmanned probe around the Mun (Mandatory) 30,000 Funds \u002B 5 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLand a unmanned ship on the Mun (Mandatory) 50,000 Funds \u002B 7 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLand a crewed ship in the Mun (Mandatory) 80,000 Funds \u002B 15 rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerform a temperature scan in the Lowlands biome (Optional) 15,000 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerform a crew report in the Northwest Crater biome (Optional) 17,500 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerform a seismic scan over the Highands biome (Optional) 7,500 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nReturn a surface sample from any biome (Mandatory) 10,000 Funds \u002B 3 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nTake an EVA report over the Polar Regions (Optional) 17,500 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nReturn a surface sample from the Polar Regions (Optional) 30,000 Funds \u002B 2 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nPerform the first orbital rendezvous over the Mun (Optional) 15,000 Funds \u002B 3 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nTransmit science from the surface of the Mun (Mandatory) 5,000 Funds \u002B 2 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, with this setup, it would be pretty hard to do this all in one launch. With these kinds of contracts, you can take as many launches as you want! If you wanted to save on funds, you could probably do most of the optional tasks and make a profit. If you just did the mandatory tasks, it might be a little hard to build a good rocket with those funds. A good strategy for this contract would be to launch 2 missions. one unmanned and one manned. The unmanned one would have plenty of fuel, so it could complete most of the optional tasks that require orbital science. It would later land and then complete more optional tasks. A manned mission would orbit, do the surveys, and then land to complete the rest of the tasks. If you wanted to complete every one of the tasks, a second manned mission could probably do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look at the slightly easier, but more substantial Build a Space Station contract:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sliders can only affect rewards by 15%\u003Cbr\u003E\nMinimum items:\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgency: Vac-Co\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch a station core to Kerbin orbit with at least 4 docking ports, space for at least 2 kerbals, and power generation (Mandatory) 40,000 Funds \u002B 5 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch a power module with at least 8,000 EC storage capability and a power generation of at least 30 EC/S (Mandatory) 40,000 Funds \u002B 2 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch a second power module with at least 2,000 EC storage capability and a power generation of at least 15 EC/S (Optional) 30,000 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nIncrease the station\u0027s crew capacity to at least 6 (Optional) 30,000 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nTransfer at least 2 Kerbals to the station (Mandatory) 30,000 Funds \u002B 5 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch a lab module with a Science Lab and at least 4 different experiments (Mandatory) 50,000 Funds \u002B 5 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nLaunch a communications module with at least 3 antennas (Mandatory) 30,000 Funds\u003Cbr\u003E\nGather at least 100 science points from the station (Mandatory) 80,000 Funds \u002B 7 Rep\u003Cbr\u003E\nResupply the station (Optional) Note: If life support ever comes, you would have to transfer LS resources to the station.

Instead of using rockets, you could build a spaceplane and use it to construct most of the station. You would also get the 80,000 fund payment for docking a spaceplane. If spaceplanes aren\u0027t your thing, you could complete more optional tasks to pay off the costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorld First contracts will largely remain the same, as they aren\u0027t really contracts; they are more like a prize that you get for breaking or making records. Things like \u0022Explore X\u0022 and \u0022Land a Kerbal on X\u0022 will now be exclusive to World First contracts. Part testing contracts will now become much more interesting; after completing a part test, you will have access to that part, no matter what tech level it is at. To balance this, part tests will only be available for parts 1-2 tech levels ahead of your highest level tech node. The somewhat ridiculous part tests that we have now would be replaced by something like, \u0022Expose X part to Y Gs on Kerbin\u0022 or \u0022Expose X part to Y degrees on Kerbin.\u0022 This is something that actually makes sense, unlike \u0022Test Mk-whatever parachute at 1000-2000 meters and 100-200 m/s while in flight over Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis contract system, in my opinion, would allow many more strategies of gameplay to enter the game. It also gives the player some control over what they do in a contract, so they don\u0027t have to do random, meaningless achievements. I probably got Fund value horrible wrong, as I rarely play career. I\u0027m just assuming that a medium sized rocket costs around 30-40k Funds, but it\u0027s probably waaay different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know what you all think!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh wow, I just noticed what a wall of text that was!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T19:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like your thinking on this one. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand correctly, the sliders would effectively increase or decrease the\u00A0cash advance and (proportionally ? ) decrease or increase the final completion payment accordingly. \u00A0Would rep be boosted or reduced\u00A0by giving the company a discount or upping the price on a separate slider?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T20:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my broader question is what exactly do you think is the qualitative benefit of this system?
