Also an option to enter the amount of fuel and get the tank height created that way around. There could be different types of tanks like ones meant for least dry mass or for impact tolerance or whatever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also i\u0027d like to see an option to build a craft with empty or partially filled tanks (they could be created full by default).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also more control over fuel flow, the one way fuel lines often give unexpected and undesired fuel flow. What would be more functional is a two way fuel line and all tanks connected could have a priority value as to which one gets emptied first and which one last.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m aware there are mods for this but an official version of harvestable fuel would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In addition to 1 piece engines, what would be cool is separate engine modules. Lets say 3 modules per a functional engine with various options for exhaust, combustion chamber and a mainfold of sorts. Each of them would affect the engine performance and other attributes in some way based on the engine diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUI:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E An optional readout of your current periapsis and apoapsis in the staging view would be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In docking mode a sort of overlay projection of your current trajectory (like a line) as well as the projected position(like a big X marker) of the closest docking port on the other vessel at the closest point of approach by the projected line\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In flight function assignment, sorta like in VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E More wheel variations, faster and stronger ones! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In flight strut construction, my giant space station needs them :/ i\u0027d gladly \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Esacrifice\u003C/span\u003E assign many of my kerbonauts to the building task.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T03:28:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

It takes the same time for per percent which means pushing fuel from a small tank to a big one takes a different amount of time than pulling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build-an-engine would be interesting. I think that would be a kind of open a dialog and do some editing and the part would come out.
