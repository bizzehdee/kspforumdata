If you fly a certain ship design often enough it can be a pain if you forgot to do the disabling on the launch pad only to find out you drained fuel from the wrong place during your trip. If we could do this in the VAB then it would save the setting with the design so we wouldn\u0027t need to always remember to do it on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also has the added benefit of affecting any mods you have enabled while in the VAB to show you things like Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are already similar settings available for other parts like landing struts up/down, or lights on/off, so it seems like this would fit in well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T22:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn spite of the necro and lack of detail in the OP, I do think that this would be an excellent idea.

By making the change to the docking port so that this can be set in the VAB, then it potentially becomes a \u0022set it and forget it\u0022 situation. I could add a spacer like you say, but that would add more mass and is not really ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LiBoHanse","CreatedById":108212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T09:30:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100% Agree when using docking ports as a connection to payload, normally I find my payload run out of fuel if I forget to disable cross feed on launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T17:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes please.
