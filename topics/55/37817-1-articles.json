For example, the radial separators being used to give radially mounted fuel tanks a bit of distance from the center tank. It is currently impossible to exclude the function allowing these separators to do their job and separate these radially mounted tanks from the center tank from staging, even though these tanks are intended to be permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest it be made possible to allow leaving certain components outside of any stages to prevent accidental uses of such components, when no action is or ever will be desired. It would still be possible to do the actions through right-clicking the components, if one needed to do so later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"12gabriel3","CreatedById":36595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-20T03:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, they could do that by making a stage called \u0022not in staging\u0022.
