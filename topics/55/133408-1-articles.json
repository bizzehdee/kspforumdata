You start with KSC, and one 50km radius circle you can place on the globe (if you move a recovery area, you click the new spot, and it moves to the new spot\u00A0at 15 km/h (so you can\u0027t move the recovery area at the last second). Each upgrade adds another recovery circle you can move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFailure to land in the recovery zone would give you some hits on rep, funds recovery, etc. Also, perhaps recovery only happens when your zone is there.
