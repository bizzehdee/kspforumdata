There is 2.5m cupola and there isn\u0027t any 1.25m cupola;\n2. There is 2.5m crew can and there isn\u0027t any 1.25 crew can;\n3. There is 2.5m processing lab and there isn\u0027t any 1.25m processing lab.\n4. Additionaly, 2.5m landing can looks similar to all other payload 2.5 parts and 1.25m landing can is an oddity.\n\nOn the other hand, the only inline scientific experiment part (Science Jr.) is 1.25m in diameter.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s for the best.\n\nIt would be nice to have some series of parts to look good with Mk1 Command Pod (like [1-kerbal laboratory](http://www.wired.com/2014/09/one-man-space-station-1960/)). Maybe even some matching parts for Mk1 Landing can - 1.25m nodes, 1.65m-or-something diameter. They will be good for basic space stations.\n\nBut - it would \n\n- extend clutter in part list;\n- add basically analogues of existing parts with no additional functionality;\n- spend time and effort.\n\nSo... What do ***YOU*** think about assortment of manned parts for different diameters?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T09:47:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nothingSpecial**\n  \nUpdating"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T19:59:17Z","Content":"When was the last time the US launched a single astronaut to space?

Maybe the hypothetical 1.25m lab could reset the one-use experiments, but only once or twice each? Or maybe what the lab does needs an overhaul to give it more of a purpose.\n\nI\u0027d also love to see a 1.25m equivalent of the cupola, even just a translucent dome on the end of the cylinder, or at least SOMETHING that has better IVA visibility than the existing command pods.

As it stands, the existing one-man components are not only superior to the multi-man components for non-crew-related mission objectives (sample fetching, whatnot), but they\u0027re ALSO superior to the multi-man parts for crew-related missions such as training (aside from the hitchhiker, but even there if you aren\u0027t using the monoprop, or like the extra free monoprop storage, the damned one-man lander can is slightly better and faintly more durable).
