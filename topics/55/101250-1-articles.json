No complicated geometry for collision boxes to calculate, just a simple UV-map with \u0022Bump\u0022 would do, a good idea would be not to make something we as humans live in - something like I quickly put together in a matter of 2 minutes but looks original, maybe a bit more kerbal for the final version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

I think using the American road system for the cities would be a good idea. How to cross the road from the garage? I don\u0027t know. Let the devs sort this thing out. I\u0027m just giving an idea that I put together in a couple minutes.. let me live pls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. A simple tunnel from which the kerbals can enter/exit the city would be satisfying. No need to go all out and actually do a small portion of the underground road system or anything like that.

Everything fits within a small area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my proposal. I imagine these could be placed in manually by the devs, which can locate them wherever they decide, put in the flags which the players can customize via config file, etc. Or maybe not, maybe you won\u0027t be able to customize them and they will just be there as \u0022easter eggs\u0022 or whatever. They can be bigger, with multiple rings and crossings in between, or some other system of energy generating like solar panels. Maybe even add stores or something like that. But the key thing is, during the night we would finally be able to see the yellow dots, wherever the cities would be located. That would just be neat, and finally the green planet we all call home will become habitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think, guys?

On the other hand, buildings and houses sit on the ground without flexing around like parts in a vessel, so the vast majority of the lag issue is already mitigated.
