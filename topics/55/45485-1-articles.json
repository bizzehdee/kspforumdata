So I thought of a simple solution to this problem! When you plan to make a maneuver with the planner, you can target the location you want to go to and then set down your planner like you normally do on the orbit but you don\u0027t need to do anything, it will automatically set the best way to get to your location! Let me tell you that this will not effect YOUR piloting and maneuvering skills, this is simply just the planner. This would be a setting if you want to have it on or not, I know people like to do their fancy maneuvers which Jeb is very fond of, so it will be an option if you want it or not. I still have trouble simply planning a maneuver to get to Ellio! I think that this will surely help beginners and people who are having a lot of trouble just trying to get to a location even when they use the maneuver planner. Please tell me if you would like or dislike this feature in the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry if this has been suggested before I read the rules and what not to suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-10T01:57:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2013 01:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hoagster35\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T01:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit would probally be better if the mechjeb function of punching in numbers was added, your idea seems to fall under \u0022auto piolet\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hoagster35","CreatedById":82068,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-10T02:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMine isn\u0027t really auto pilot.

A really good idea someone had once was to have a chalkboard or whiteboard you could interact with in the mission control building somewheres. It was a grand discussion, but some of the ideas brought up involved having stickers representing planets(after you\u0027d discovered them, of course), moving them about to plan maneuvers and things then maybe even roughly crunching numbers based on your telescopic measurements of the planet\u0027s distance. Additionally, it was said that there should be a type of maneuver node editor in the mission/launch control building where you take your rough sketch and plot your maneuver nodes manually before the launch and try your best to keep to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it was all really compelling stuff.
