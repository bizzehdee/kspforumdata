I\u0027m wondering if there could be a mod or a part of the game that offers a \u0022low memory demand\u0022 area that could be used between the VAB and the launch pad. Here is my scenerio... Go to VAB, build something, take it to the pad and test. Repeat as often as required until I get a crash to desktop. At the point where I\u0027m just tweaking a design and moving parts around. I dont care if the vessel graphics are stunning or if I can see the KSC in the background or any higher quality memory sucking stuff. Just let me test in a meaningful way...I spend almost as much time building and testing as I do playing. Is this possible? Maybe a another tab to click after \u0022resume game\u0022 and before \u0022XX flights in progress\u0022 there could be a low res testing area? Just a thought.\n\nEDIT: when I say \u0022tweaking\u0022 I mean looking at how much space is under the engine of a lander and the legs need to move lower because the VAB won\u0027t show how much \u0022squat\u0022 I\u0027m gonna get, or if solar panels are too close together, or a hatch is blocked and a ladder doesnt reach the ground, forgot RCS or a battery...any of these tweaks could have me back and forth to the VAB 3 or 4 times...and crash to desktop.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T12:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vixr**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:29:37Z","Content":"For issues with ladders, lander legs and panels, you are aware you can deploy them in the VAB right?"},{"CreatedByName":"vixr","CreatedById":133940,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:46:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For issues with ladders, lander legs and panels, you are aware you can deploy them in the VAB right?\n\nYes, I eyeball them mostly... but sometimes I try to anticipate how much the weight of the lander will compress the landing legs and miss the mark... you can only do this on the pad.
