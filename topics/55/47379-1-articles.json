The debug menu has to be activated and \u0022no part clipping\u0022 has to be selected before you can place parts that overlap.

Struts can be used to stabilize a craft by creating an artificial branch linking 2 different tree paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore...Why not create a button that creates an invisible super strong strut-like connection linking any parts that the game recognizes as overlapping?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would in theory make the VAB a heck of a lot easier to actually use because we would no longer have to manually add jungle-gym strut atrocities covering our beautiful creations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kodiak42","CreatedById":62082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T16:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the largest problems with this idea is how terrible the game engine is at determining part clipping. You get false positives and false negatives so often that \u0022no part clipping\u0022 just makes the task a bit easier. Although, I wouldn\u0027t mind a nice connection between overlapping wing segments (it almost seems like the game allows certain parts to clip, and it does make sense for those parts, ever try to make a good looking plane without clipping?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
