Now, if I for example would like to test if a fuel truck has the correct design to \u0022dock\u0022 with another vehicle, I always need to spawn the first vehicle at for example the runway. Now, I need to drive this vehicle a little away off the runway to make place for the second vehicle. Then I spawn that one and have to drive this to the other vehicle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes not fit? ARGH, have to do the whole procedure again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be really cool if I could select another spawnpoint for such testing purposes, say: In front of the hangar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWriting this, another idea pops up: How about a possibility to select any given location on Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my 2 cents\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChris\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T09:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea but wouldn\u0027t you then just have to drive your rover/whatever over to the new spawn point?
