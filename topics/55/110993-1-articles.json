Now, if I for example would like to test if a fuel truck has the correct design to \u0022dock\u0022 with another vehicle, I always need to spawn the first vehicle at for example the runway. Now, I need to drive this vehicle a little away off the runway to make place for the second vehicle. Then I spawn that one and have to drive this to the other vehicle. \n\nDoes not fit? ARGH, have to do the whole procedure again. \n\nIt would be really cool if I could select another spawnpoint for such testing purposes, say: In front of the hangar?\n\nWriting this, another idea pops up: How about a possibility to select any given location on Kerbin?\n\nJust my 2 cents\n\nChris"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T09:50:28Z","Content":"Good idea but wouldn\u0027t you then just have to drive your rover/whatever over to the new spawn point? I can\u0027t see that this would make a great deal of difference in just driving it off the runway or launchpad to be honest, that\u0027s what i did when i wanted to make sure my base parts dock OK.\n\nThe idea of spawning anywhere on Kerbin would be open to abuse for science gathering... spawn at biome then gather science and recover ship... repeat at next biome.\n\nSpawning at KSC only might not be too bad though."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T09:53:58Z","Content":"I support the first idea. It would make it much more convenient to be able to spawn rovers or tanker trucks while there is something on the runway."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:46:29Z","Content":"One way would be to include an option in the \u0027pop up\u0027 menu to spawn next to the runway or launchpad if it is already occupied, rather than just clear it.\n\nA few \u0027pre-set\u0027 locations could be used, say one just off the western end of the runway and one off to either side next to the usual spawn point, then maybe 3 around the launchpad. Only if all 3 extra spots are occupied does it need to clear one.\n\nThis would avoid the problem of programming in random or flexible spawn points for a relatively small issue, but still give a useful extra degree of flexibility for testing stuff."},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:41:25Z","Content":"Or, come up with some \u0022Parking lots\u0022 in front of the Hangar (planes). In the aviation hangar before you click on \u0022launch\u0022 you could select lot no.1, 2, 3 and so on...\n\nThen I have one rover pop up at parking lot 1, then for the other vehicle I want to interact the rover with I select no. 2. \n\nOut I go, flip-flop between the two.\n\nI understand what middlemass meant two posts above, but still, having to drive something off the runway and downhill on that plane is still quite tiresome.\n\nI also agree that it is not a good idea to be able to spawn wherever you want to."},{"CreatedByName":"dyson","CreatedById":43009,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:07:31Z","Content":"I like the idea - how about that you could spawn vehicles at flag-positions? A additional constraint could be that the flag position had to be on \u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022 (not \u0022Administration building\u0022 or \u0022Grasslands\u0022). With this everybody could (once) define his/her spawning positions for him/herself."},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:55:58Z","Content":"Hangar with crane, so we could put things in cargo bays.\n\n![06_08pd2607.jpg](http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/roundtrip_12_22/06_08pd2607.jpg)"}]}
