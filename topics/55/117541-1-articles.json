It should be crushed, crinkled, smoking, leaking. \n\nMaybe someone can help with more ideas.\n\n![MQkxU6P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MQkxU6P.jpg)\n\n![siD6eVI.png](http://i.imgur.com/siD6eVI.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T14:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 02:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hellblazer**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T17:17:33Z","Content":"This should be in stock. Other damage than blowing up parts. For example, your rocket is on orbit, and a sharp debree, for example, a structural panel hits your ship. Currently, the fuel tank wich is hit explodes, and your rocket will remain in 2 parts. Something should happen, like having the body cutted, and, if it explodes, the whole thing should blow up. Also, some scratches on parts damaged during re-entry."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T20:06:38Z","Content":"If I\u0027m not mistaken the parts would need at least two states for it to work (like wheels do). That means it\u0027s twice as much models. That would be catastrophic for RAM.\n\nUnless you want softbody physics. That would be a bit too much to redo, I think.\n\nBut I would like to see scratches and burning effects. Maybe even parts catching on fire before they explode, instead of simply going \u0022BOOM!\u0022 after hitting the ground. Also clouds of gas after depressurazition.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T20:16:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 08:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:18:14Z","Content":"Couldn\u0027t damage just be texture decals, instead of needing to make a new \u0022damaged\u0022 version of each part?"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T22:23:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Couldn\u0027t damage just be texture decals, instead of needing to make a new \u0022damaged\u0022 version of each part?\n\nTextures are actually more RAM-hungry compared to meshes."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T04:34:04Z","Content":"nice idea whenever, in // with memory usage and how it could be implemented \u0022lightly\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:19:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Textures are actually more RAM-hungry compared to meshes.\n\nWhat I mean is a single decal that could be used on all parts, much as scorch marks or bullet holes in some games.\n\nSurely, making individual damage textures / models for each part would be much more ram intensive."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:24:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What I mean is a single decal that could be used on all parts, much as scorch marks or bullet holes in some games.\n\u003E Surely, making individual damage textures / models for each part would be much more ram intensive.\n\nI have a feeling that would look kind of cheesy, like the fact that KSC buildings have the same explosion no matter how they are destroyed."},{"CreatedByName":"Ven","CreatedById":109931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:40:42Z","Content":"Another solution could be with a special shader that dynamically alters the base texture (note: not the actual model) ingame.
