As you keep dumping more and more electric power into it, Isp scales up more and more, but you struggle to increase thrust as much. Additionally, there comes a point somewhere (depending on which engine technology we\u0027re talking about) where you just can\u0027t add any more power without destroying your engine, and those points are way lower than engineers would like them to be. In order to use more power and/or get more thrust at the same Isp, you must cluster smaller engines, or find completely novel approaches (see: the X3 nested hall thruster, the helicon radiowave based VASIMR, or ESA\u0027s dual-stage 4-grid ion concept).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has little to do with the suggestion, and just serves to educate \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kertech","CreatedById":156079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T13:25:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErrr aren\u0027t these literally two completely different technologies!!
