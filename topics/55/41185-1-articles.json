I realize it is a purely aesthetic matter, but I am anal about that kinda thing, and it upsets me when I build a nice shiny rocket launch it to orbit only to discover that my comm dish clips through the vehicle/solar panel/another comm dish. Thank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PetWolverine","CreatedById":76001,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second this, and it\u0027s not a purely aesthetic matter. For example, I need to be able to tell if my landing legs will clear my solar panels as they extend, keep the engines off the ground once extended, and leave my kethane drills close enough to the ground to work. Of course these things can already be tested on the launch pad (and then \u0022revert flight\u0022 and add a launch vehicle), but some testing in the VAB would be much nicer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree. Even if it were just a button to toggle EVERY deployable part at once, I\u0027d still prefer that over not being able to do it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, I think some of the B9 mod parts are animated in the VAB. That\u0027s rather convenient because it shows you what it looks like closed, shows you the animation to see if you like it and shows you what it\u0027s like when it\u0027s deployed. I feel like that might be the the future of stock parts as well. One can hope, at least \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T20:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe this will be part of \u0027Tweakables\u0027 which are on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplanned features list.\u003C/a\u003E It might not arrive soon, so until then I guess you\u0027ll just have to do a lot of testing on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod that can play animations in the VAB, I can\u0027t remember what it\u0027s called, though.
