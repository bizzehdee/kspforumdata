The only goings-on are at KSC, or your spacecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would propose would be a few features, all designed to place the experience into a setting with meaning. Working them into the currently existing features is a huge bonus, but some features might exist purely based upon the experience they provide. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst. I would like to see a modification to the reputation system, splitting it into \u0022factions\u0022; ie, the companies represented as entities in the game currently. You might be absolutely adored by Rockomax, but Jeb\u0027s Junkyard might despise you (maybe you bring all your rockets back intact? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) This *could* lead to some more interesting missions (or not, depending!) such as: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E *Corporate Espionage: Deliver the (in development part) to *company* headquarters (which of course, doesn\u0027t currently exist), or alternately, deliver the part to an orbit of X,Y,Z, where our agents will retrieve the part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E *Cooperative Venture: *Company A* and *Company B* would like to collaberate on a project. You need to use *item1* with *item2*, and see if they perform as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, another \u0022invisible\u0022 faction, \u0022The Populace\u0022. The Kerbals not employed by these companies (or, if that isn\u0027t an option, maybe the Kerbals that aren\u0027t the BOD for these companies?) Your success rate (or spectacular failure rate, depending), milestone acheivements, etc, impacts this rating. This rating could do a number of things, all more visible, detailed below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, News and Media. Perhaps integrating the Second suggestion, the Kerbin Weekly News (or whatever) could report on your space program. Your rating with the populace and the companies (or even overall, if the others aren\u0027t implemented) could adjust the page your article is found on... if at all. This would add another personal goal for some players - make the front page news!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, though this one is a bit less likely, a sort of marketplace for craft designs. When the player designs the craft, they can choose to \u0022keep private\u0022, ie, not sell the craft or design, and produce it only for their use, \u0022Sell vehicles\u0022, where they sell the finished product to other companies, or the populace, or \u0022Sell design\u0022, where the design of the craft itself is sold off to competitors. The player could set the asking price, and interested companies could make bids. The bidding amount could fluctuate based upon your reputation, flights of the craft, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are a lot of other things that could add more to make the space program seem to fit into the overall world, but those are the ideas that jumped out at me the most.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T09:04:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis idea would be a monumental undertaking.

Something like a scrolling banner that runs kind of like Simcity 4. They were all ways fun to read, like when the Llama\u0027s got mad at you for creating pollution.

I kind of see it the same way, that the reputation is how the Kerbals see the program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think is more in-line with what I was thinking is leaving the general reputation intact and as-is; this would be the populace. Each company could still get their own reputation factor with the player\u0027s program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe impact of raised or lowered reputation with each company could vary widely, from simple things like higher probability to get a contract with that company (or lower...), probability to get the ability to test things further down the tech tree (it seems, from what I\u0027ve seen, that currently prototypes are only one step out, maybe two, from your current progress... though I may be wrong), changes in what they are willing to pay you for your testing services, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf dynamic reskinning (I know some mods do this, but its another example \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) were to be integrated, perhaps certain levels of reputation with a company would allow a player to add the company logo to a part, or apply a custom texture, representing your achievement with the company. Just a couple ideas. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA newsticker would be cool, and would definitely accomplish part of what I am after there. I like the idea of a newspaper or something similar, because of the ability to be pushed to front-page (or back!) page news by your actions. Just another little thing that monitors performance and progress, and gives a subtle, non-game breaking reward for doing well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T18:14:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIMO newspapers should work this way\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh rep: A Kerbal walked on the Mun yesterday!
