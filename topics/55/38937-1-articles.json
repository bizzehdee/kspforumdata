When a node on the navball is \u0027behind\u0027 your ship (more than 90 degrees rotation from you) there is no way of telling where it might be. On small ships this is not a problem, as you can easily just rotate around quickly and find it but on large ships that take quite a while and quite a lot of fuel to turn, Its hard to tell which direction I should start rotating to minimize the amount of rotation needed to reach the node. My suggestion is to add a small arrow around the edge of the navball that shows the general direction of the maneuver node. An example of this (though on a 2D map rather and a navball) can be seen in many games where an objective is outside of the minimap like this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://vnmedia.ign.com/lotrovault.ign.com/wiki/8/86/MinimapNodes.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://vnmedia.ign.com/lotrovault.ign.com/wiki/8/86/MinimapNodes.jpg\u003C/a\u003E.
