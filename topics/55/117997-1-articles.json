Too much brown and blues. Doesn\u0027t really fit with the space center aesthetic that it should be going for. So the main styles I have here are as follows:\n\n-Converted Industrial Farm (VAB is a grain elevator, maybe not the best idea. Coal mine facility might be better) The low-cost, cheap, but well put together style I was aiming for reflects the RT-5 and RT-10 SRBs. They don\u0027t look like junk, and neither should the VAB.\n\n-Alternate Tier 0 (not pictured): Coal (or maybe Ore??) Mine facility repurposed as a space center. They would have all the machinery already there for construction, and some decently big buildings.\n\n-Rocket Testing Grounds (Like Penemunde perhaps. Brown bricks are okay here, but grey concrete might look even better.) Looks entirely neato with the prototype-like liquid fueled rockets of Jeb\u0027s Junkyard.\n\n-1950s Rocketpunk Spaceport (From the 1954 Disneyland Tomorrowland documentary Man In Space) Fits the part for the retro-looking Rockomax parts. I really liked the design when I saw it in Man-In-Space, and I figure it could be used as a VAB. In the top image above, you can see the Mission Control Center. It\u0027s a blockhouse, which is also seen in the Man-In-Space documentary. It was also designed to look good with the derelict island airport.\n\n-Cape Canaveral space center with real-looking VAB. Looks great with Kerbodyne Saturn/SLS-like parts. No changes would be needed here, we already have the wonderfully brilliant design by Bac9.\n\nThere are a whole host of problems with the space centers we got. Texture holes, sub-par quality, Kerbals clipping through ground objects, floating paint lines, conflicting art style with stock parts, etc. It\u0027s not horrible, and its a heck of a lot better than the pictures we were shown of the Barn. But it really does feel like it was hastily made, a bit rushed, and not done with as much love and care as Bac9\u0027s Tier 3 Space Center from 0.21/22.\n\nI realize it may seem to be a bit too late to redo an entire art asset like this, but it is possible, and I think it could be done a lot better.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-09T00:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T00:32:55Z","Content":"Certainly nice drawings, I can\u0027t read your handwriting though.
