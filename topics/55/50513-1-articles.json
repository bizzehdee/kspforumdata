The trick really is to keep these parts together as long as possible. Deploy parachutes on all parts while the ship is still in one piece and disconnect it as late as possible, preferably after drag and your chutes got you to safe small speed and you\u0027re less than 3 km above terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut who knows, maybe this is planned for the final release. It\u0027s not like there\u0027s thousands of parts entering the atmosphere all the time so it shouldn\u0027t be major problem to run several physics simulations at once for each atmosphere passage. It might be a problem if that happens when you\u0027re trying to time warp on some completely different ship but the game could just tell you sorry, that and that ship is in the atmosphere now so you cannot warp until it\u0027s over. Or it could mark the ship as \u0022unresolved\u0022 and run the simulation when there\u0027s time for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T12:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit seems to be a hit and miss kind of thing.
