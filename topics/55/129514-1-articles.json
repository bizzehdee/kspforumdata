Instead of supplying a slow but infinite source of science points, I suggest one based on the current science gathering mechanic.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimplified version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEvery SOI has a set amount of science points attainable by the MPL(doesn\u0027t matter whether you gathered every experiment or not). For arguments sake, let\u0027s say 500sci.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSend a MPL into Kerbin orbit, put a scientist and lots of solar panels on it. Click the \u0022start research\u0022 button, then after some time and lots of EC the current attained science points in the MPL will increase.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAt any time the player can transmit the current attained science points(to recover some science earlier if need be).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe processing can only continue until the sum of all transmissions and current attained science points reaches the 500sci point limit...at least for this SOI.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSending another new MPL to the same SOI does not get any new science at all: once the 500sci has been reached, then no more MPL science can be done in that SOI...the MPL is essentially useless as far as science is concerned(unless of course you move it to a different SOI).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThis science is essentially like a thermometer experiment, except that it is worth a lot more, but it trickles in slowly and takes much more electricity(and the scientist and fuel to get the MPL there)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAdvanced version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEvery SOI has a set amount of science points(dependent on the total amount of gathered science in that SOI) attainable by the MPL. For arguments sake, let\u0027s say 10%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n-\u0026gt; Let\u0027s say there is 5000sci gather-able science(thermometer,gravimeter,crew report,etc.) in the Kerbin SOI, but at the moment the player has only collected(recovered/transmitted) 1200sci. Then the MPL can only processes until it has attained 120sci.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n-\u0026gt; As soon as the player recovers/transmits more science points(let\u0027s say 2000sci more), then the MPL can continue a little bit further(until it reaches 320sci).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSimplified version points 2,3,4,5,6 are all applicable here\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nUnmentioned ideas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nScientist skill level: Should it influence the speed of processing? (time warp nullifies this anyway). OR should the skill level enable \u0022over-processing\u0022(instead of stopping at 500sci, a good scientist can up the limit to 550sci)?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRight click menu on MPL: Show the maximum amount of gather-able science point in it\u0027s current SOI? (it\u0027s a nice way to track progress...although the R\u0026amp;D has a version of this)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSOI: Is Kerbin SOI all the science(landed,splashed down, all binomes on kerbin, atmosphere, LKO, high orbit,etc.) except those that are within Mun and Minimus SOI? (In other words, are Kerbin, Mun, Minimus SOIs counted as 3 different unique MPL experiments?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLanded vs Orbit: Should a Kerbin SOI MPL experiment rather be divided into a Kerbin-landed\u00A0and Kerbin-orbit\u00A0experiment?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBut...why?:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBoth the previous and current version of MPL stock mechanics did not address the issue\u00A0of encouraging players to use a 3.5ton fragile structure in space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n-\u0026gt; \u0022old\u0022 MPL made it sensible to use 1 of each \u0022SC-9001 Science Jr\u0022 and \u0022Mystery Goo\u0022 when doing a mission that required re-using these multiple times. The boosted transmission value was silly: it had such a slight effect for unmanned crafts(one-way trips usually), but adding 300 LFO to a science probe craft could very well let you even return that science back to kerbin. For manned craft, why would i want to leak out ANY science points by transmitting, when i am planning to bring back that crew? The only sensible argument is that the little bit of transmitted science could help support missions, to refuel those far away kerbals who need it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n-\u0026gt; \u0022new\u0022 MPL is just ridiculous: Start the game, rush the techtree up to the MPL(get solar panels, and basic rocket parts). A few contracts should get enough money for like 10 MPLs. Build a centipede of 10 MPLs, separated by decouplers, each with lots of solar panels. Put them on the runway. Use the VAB to launch your scientists, and a single kerbal to run around the KSC collecting every piece of science he can. Put this heap of science into MPL nr.1 and process it...retrieve that science, store it in the next MPL. So you fill up all these MPLs by copying the same heap of science. Start research and timewarp to the max. -\u0026gt; Your first Mun landing will be a Saturn V sized craft and science will become meaningless\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHowever, i understand why it works this why. Whiny players convinced devs that \u0022career/techtree is such a grind!\u0022...career is\u00A0a mechanic that encourages players to build smart and cheap, on a shoe\u00A0string budget with outdated technology. If you want to build your dreams, then use sandbox to skip the grind or slide the wonderful difficulty sliders at the start of a new game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel the current MPL is overpowered,\u00A0i vowed to never use it until the techtree is fully researched. The admin building\u0027s funds-\u0026gt;sci mechanic breaks the techtree as well, but that\u0027s for another thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was aiming for an abstract mechanic, where the player doesn\u0027t have to micro-manage everything. Where a science lab in space just \u0022does science\u0022, sort of encompassing what happens on the ISS(NASA wouldn\u0027t make a half-way stop back from a moon landing to fill up the ISS with moon rocks, do they? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t a perfect solution at all, so please criticize and tell me everything that is good, wrong, right, bad about this suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-14T07:31:16Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2016 07:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Blaarkies\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T00:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree in that this is better than the currently implemented version and that it is no perfect solution.

But that mechanic would be boring alone, it would only make a\u00A0 nice addition. I would then limit the maximum amount of science that can be made in each region; these contracts can still give money if the science there is already finished (perhaps the money would also depend on the number of scientist stars in the MPL?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLast comment for this post: I did not need to read the \u0022But...why?:\u0022-section to prefer it over the existing system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T04:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222353911\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022129514\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221452298243\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110849\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaos\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/9/2016 at 2:10 AM, Kaos said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...I also like how it makes no difference between the biomes, but I think ground and orbit should be treated differently....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe too.
