I would suggest just grabbing the PE and AP markers. Maybe hold down mod key to apply normal adjustments to the maneuver node directly, or maybe you would still have to apply normal/anti-normal via the handles. Seems like this would be much more efficient than fiddling with\u00A0the little handles to get the exact orbit you want.
