So this suggestion is simple (and yes, I know it\u0027s been suggested before, but the last thread was about a year old): Allow stuff to crash into terrain scatter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first thing people are going to say is, \u0022The performance hit would be terrible!\u0022 But I think the terrain scatter only has to have collision in a 300 meter radius around the rocket (the same radius that full physics extends to for inactive rockets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the benefit would be huge for adding that. Suddenly driving in a rover would become way more fun and exciting by having to avoid rocks and/or trees. Landing would become more challenging, as you\u0027d have to find a place without ground scatter beneath you. And another thing that would have to change is that ground scatter would need to become permanent, so that once it was generated, it would stay in the same place (otherwise people\u0027s save\u0027s could get ruined by having ground scatter spawn within a craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid taking up too much memory, there could be a criteria for having terrain scatter be permanent (obviously memorizing the position of terrain scatter on every inch of every planet would be insane). That criteria would be if the scatter is 300 meters or less to a ship that is landed on the terrain. If that ship leaves the ground, the scatter no longer has to be permanent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut maybe I\u0027ve missed some important reason why ground scatter would be ridiculously hard or impossible to implement. If so, please speak up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the way I look at it now is a little bit of coding for a huge amount of added fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T18:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 06:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Andrew Hansen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T19:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027d probably need a way to tell, from orbit, which places have ground scatter and which do not, or which have a lot and which have too few.
