It makes sense that part of the standard gear of a cargo bay should be equipment for securing a load under any reasonable conditions-- anything up to where the cargo bay itself is in danger of structural failure. This leads to the following conclusions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhile a cargo bay is closed, it should no longer be necessary to simulate the individual parts that it contains.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAll of its contents can and should be treated as physics-less, and their mass distribution summed and aggregated, calculated for physics purposes as a single virtual part locked to the cargo bay part they are contained within. Fuel use or other mass redistributions for shielded parts should be calculated to affect the aggregate. \u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWe don\u0027t need to render or calculate collisions for parts that are contained within cargo bays. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EThe potential for performance improvements is excellent, especially during launch when part counts and lag are highest, and cargo bays will nearly always be closed.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe above improvements can also apply to mods with ejectable fairings or other parts that aero-shield.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter all, ejectable fairings are just a special case where the cargo bay starts closed and opens irreversibly. Procedural fairings is a must-have mod, and would become even better with these features.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELinked open-ended cargo bays should operate their doors as a single unit, and should be closed off at their ends.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ECargo bays should be tweakable to be open-ended or not, and link or not at either end. Right now, you have to terminate a cargo bay with another similar-shaped part or the end will be open to space-- make everyone\u0027s lives easier.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECargo bay structural failure could become substantially more exciting.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EUnder the right kinds of stress or after taking enough damage, the bay doors should fail, popping open and causing the contents to Kerbalize rapidly.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed properly, implementation of cargo bays has the potential to reduce micromanagement worry about game-y structural problems, improve performance, and make game mechanics more intuitive.

Ideally, closing the cargo bay around something that fits entirely inside auto-docks and simulates it as part of the cargo bay until the bay is re-opened, same as attached parts inside the bay.
