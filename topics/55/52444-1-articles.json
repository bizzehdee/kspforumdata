One of the things I do in a ridiculously big way is science. I load up my ship with far more science components than are actually necessary, and send it off to distant worlds. However, one thing I\u0027ve noticed is that, when I toggle all my science components and try to transmit the data all at once, one dish ends up transmitting by itself, while the others transmit one or two items, then go dormant. This, naturally, makes science data transmission take several times longer than it should. This, to me at least, suggests that the means of queueing data transmission for a given dish should be tweaked, such that the load on each dish is as balanced as possible. What are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
