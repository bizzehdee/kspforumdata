And while we\u0027re at it, why don\u0027t they have a small tractor (worker-bee) for moving modules/equipment around and for \u0022receiving\u0022 modules/equipment from a launch? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.pix8.net/pro/pic.php?u=3365epM5u\u0026amp;i=11591462\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.pix8.net/pro/pic.php?u=3365epM5u\u0026amp;i=11591462\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my thought is to use the spacejunk mod to make one and add \u0022mission critical\u0022 spare parts (if bound for another planet) or \u0022stock part replacements\u0022 (if for spacestation around the homeplanet). It\u0027s also a really neat place to poke around when you\u0027re bored. There could be parts for making all sorts of things which blink, unfolds, buzzes, or moves around. Different people can use whatever stuff they want or even turn it into a large greenhouse in space. I just like it looking more like a one-stop shopping place, like a mini-mall for gizmo\u0027s, thingamabob\u0027s and whatchamacallit\u0027s. Or if you\u0027re a guy, like a hardware store.. in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Sasami (^__^)/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T07:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-25-0-Hangar-v1-3-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-25-0-Hangar-v1-3-0\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
