I\u0027m not a coder but know it can be done since I\u0027ve had other games that do it. I assume KSP would note the computer\u0027s time when you exit the game, then when you start playing again it sees the current computer time and would calculate how much\u00A0Kerbal time has passed and adjust things accordingly.

I\u0027m not QUITE sure since I have the options off, but I think Unity is fairly smart about GPU usage when KSP is not actively being rendered (i.e. Minimized to taskbar... Though maybe it\u0027s the OS managing that.) I\u0027ve had my GPU wind down when I have KSP minimized for a short while (couple of minutes? However long it take the fan to cool it to reasonable level so it can wind down, it feels like.) Granted, you\u0027d be paying more for power usage, but it\u0027d probably not be all that noticeable (maybe...) And of course you\u0027d be losing compute resources and can\u0027t play any other game that needs exclusive GPU access...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, considering the amount of real-time it takes to do certain tasks (Space = Time and interplanetary distances are immense, even if scaled down), I don\u0027t think letting real-time, unattended (offline)\u00A0progression is all that useful. I\u0027d rather Time-Warp for a few seconds and be done with it than wait 18 real hours for a task to be done. (Or doing something else in-game while I wait, but we\u0027re assuming a player doesn\u0027t have the time to do that. i.e. Have time to do one mission, not two, in a block of real-time.) I don\u0027t think that amount\u00A0of unattended game progress is worth waiting 18 real hours. I\u0027ve gotten interrupted playing KSP as well. It could be hours after I Alt-Tab\u00A0out of / ESC pause it, so I\u0027m glad to be able to continue exactly where I left off rather than coming back to progression I have no account of because I wasn\u0027t there to witness it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not to knock on the idea further, but your proposal now reminds of how many Social Media games work by tying progression to real-time elapse. (e.g. Farmville and waiting 18 hours for planted potatoes to growth before harvesting.) I know people have their own play styles and all, but I\u0027ve always hated real-time elapse style progress... Well,\u00A0in games\u00A0that didn\u0027t have in-game time acceleration. I think too much can happen in KSP for unattended progress to be a real thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway... I say if you have a spare computer that can run KSP, set it up as a pure KSP machine and leave KSP running on it all the time. Expensive workaround, but it\u0027s either using up some of your own resources\u00A0or\u00A0getting someone to volunteer and donate theirs to create your mod for you.
