(scientifically speaking)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the suns color output is close to white, like our sun, the color when looking through a red atmosphere should be blue. We see this on Mars, Here is a picture taken from one of the rovers \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bestinterestingfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sun-from-mars.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bestinterestingfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sun-from-mars.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough if the suns output is yellow (it kinda looks yellow from space), it should appear green.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because the sky\u0027s color is determined by the average particle size in the atmosphere. Light that is the same wavelength as these particles, gets bounced everywhere in the atmosphere, causing everywhere to look that color (i.e. on earth blue, on mars red, ect...). Since this light is essentially removed from the sun, because it gets distributed throughout the atmosphere, we color we see the sun being is it\u0027s original color minus the color of the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can be figured out by using the additive color system (which applies to light, the subtractive color system applies to dyes, paints, etc...), you take the sun\u0027s output color, and remove the color of the atmosphere; and that gives the color that it appears.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBadAstronomer","CreatedById":89508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T11:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the sun is the same color on Mars than it is on Earth. At sunset, it is blue. This is similar to how Earth sunsets make the sun look red, while the rest of the day it appears yellow-white.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T11:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAye, the color is more pronounced when the sun is near the horizon. The point still stands, though. I think it\u0027d be pretty awesome to see a blue Duna sunrise \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
