Deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen containing one proton, one neutron and one electron, as opposed to regular hydrogen that contains one proton and one electron. The added neutron makes it pretty much twice as heavy as regular hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Fuel cells\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollowing the video posted, you\u0027re wrong. Really, you posted \u0022proof\u0022 for your side and didn\u0027t even follow it. In a fuel cell, hydrogen is passed through the cathode, splitting it into electrons and protons. these later rejoin and bond with oxygen, forming water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Electrolysis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the hydrogen and oxygen separated before feeding it into the fuel cell, you have to use electrolysis. This is done by applying a current through water, turning it into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. Performing electrolysis of heavy water simply creates heavy hydrogen gas, deuterium, and oxygen gas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T14:05:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Floppster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T12:58:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP, few things for you to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. monoprop is for rcs. rcs ports are under \u0022control\u0022 in the vab, and use little poofs of monoprop to help turn big ships. it is not(supposed to be*) a source massive orbit changing propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. the jetfuel tank holds 180(?) fuel and no oxidizer. it is for use with the basic jet engine, and the turbojet engine. they also require \u0022intake air\u0022 to run. no oxidizer. have to throw on an air intake(those are under the aerodynamics tab)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. the rest of the engines run off the other tanks. in the vab you can rightclick the part in the partmenu to see how much fuel and oxidizer each has. that should help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what USE is this supposed to have?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eop was using jet fuel in rockets, kept running out of oxidizer lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T13:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://fcdn.mtbr.com/attachments/downhill-freeride/704128d1359601749t-new-school-gravity-bikes-thread-necromancy-thread-necromancy-demotivational-poster-1271554886.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022704128d1359601749t-new-school-gravity-bikes-thread-necromancy-thread-necromancy-demotivational-poster-1271554886.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Floppster","CreatedById":92677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T14:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit: double post\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-21T14:08:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2014 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Floppster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T15:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamnit, I hate it when I don\u0027t notice a necro\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
