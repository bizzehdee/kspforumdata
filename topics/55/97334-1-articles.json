Obviously in career mode you\u0027d have to do it all yourself, but in sandbox I\u0027d like to be able to put a spacecraft directly in orbit at X meters above planet Y to see how well it performs a function (seeing if I can easily go to the Mun, putting a lander in orbit around a far away planet to see if it\u0027s a good design before I actualy attempt to go there, placing a large spacestation in orbit without having to send up many missions to assemble it like it is a base I already had, ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModless autopilot for noobs and people that can\u0027t math. \u0022Okay I got to orbit, computer get me in stable orbit around Minimus, make it so\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA indicator of whether or not I can do something. Like in the Android app \u0022Space Agency\u0022 it will tell you what percentage of the flight to orbit each stage will take you, and if you will even make orbit with your design. Maybe a thing like \u0022I want to go to planet X, will this design allow that?\u0022 And of course a lot depends on you flying correctly and doing the right burns, but it could indicate \u0022It\u0027s physically possible if you do everything right, not very likely, or you\u0027d be lucky not to explode on the pad\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that\u0027s a few ideas I had.

Kind of hard to believe the entirety of the species lives at one space station. It would be cool to see cities as you orbit and see patches of lights from the populated areas during the night side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be even cooler to get news reports of how you rained flaming rocket pieces all over downtown New Kerb City when you jettisoned a stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-21T07:21:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there.

It\u0027s been going on for years and tbh it\u0027s not geting anywhere. If I remember corectly, the last dev statement on this was along the lines of \u0022no full auto pilot like mech jeb is going to happen\u0022. Oh and I just looked it up, auto pilot IS in the what not to suggest list \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure that a function to hyperedit (mod for teleporting vessels to orbit or elsewhere) is not planed. Orbital construction is not going to happen either, sadly enough... A testmode however seems to be at least nog off the table. Many people like that idea, but judging from dev statements the chances aren\u0027t the best. Mod for this is, if you are interested, \u0022kerbal construction time\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat readout on how far the remaining fuel will get you, is something a large part of the community has been begging for since the release probably \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It\u0027s actually pretty easy to calculatd it yourself (not as scary or complicated as the word \u0022calculate\u0022 indicates \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). Most people around here do that anyway I think. The number you need is called \u0022delta-v\u0022. You need a mod (mech jeb or kerbal engineer redux) to get your vessels delta-v readout and then you would need too watch this video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/afN3g8zj-HM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes on the lanscape ehancements.
