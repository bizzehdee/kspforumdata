A single larger tank might cause less center of mass issues, but a bunch of smaller tanks will dissipate heat better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever in real life, a single larger tank will have a better dry mass to total fuel capacity ratio than a cluster of small ones. (The small tanks will also have a higher boil-off rate with cryogenic fuels than a large tank but that isn\u0027t modeled in game so it\u0027s a non issue.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight it be a good idea to make smaller tanks have a higher dry mass in proportion to the larger ones as a balance fix? This would give the player an actual reason to want to unlock bigger tanks instead of just focusing there research on power and experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have an example of this sort of thing with the RCS tanks, the inline ones are more efficient than the radial ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
