And you state you *like* the way it works now, but don\u0027t want missions to work in a way that, when you describe it and give specific examples, is exactly what science does now (which you did say you\u0027re okay with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re just not making sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair point, but I still have no idea what it is you don\u0027t want because you contradict your own statements. Some of the time you say you don\u0027t want to be compelled to do things you normally wouldn\u0027t but then say the way science works now (which does precisely that) is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat he said made perfect sense... He said that he didn\u0027t want SET MISSIONS for money, such as \u0022Go to Minimus, collect a few rocks, and get awarded x amount of money\u0022; he said he wanted to do whatever he wanted and get awarded for the accomplishments HE did... so if he decides to randomly go to Jool he wants to be awarded for going to Jool, not forced to go to Moho by some mission. Not sure where you\u0027re confused, as the science system in the game right now doesn\u0027t make you go anywhere, you go places and you get science from going to those places.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T14:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t want random failures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T14:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGregox, I\u0027m talking about stuff like \u003Cstrong\u003ESABRE engines\u003C/strong\u003E, etc...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/R.A.P.I.E.R._Engine\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESo much for that notion.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rdivine","CreatedById":66317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T15:23:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei definitely do not want more lag in ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eurybaric","CreatedById":33541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T22:41:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t wanna right-click my kerbal to tell him/her/it to go pee or shower \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Special Agent Sigvan","CreatedById":92033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T02:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDLC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022SQUAD!

Keep it this way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Uber-realism. It\u0027s already got simplified physics, a fantasy environment, and cartoonish graphics. Great! That\u0027s what I like in my games. If I want reality, I either play a serious sim, or go and play in the real world. Having said that, adding slightly more realistic aerodynamics (nosecones!), re-entry, basic resources/funding (I know, some of these are coming) I\u0027m all for it. But keep it (relatively) simple and abstract and above all FUN. Gameplay should always win out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Multiplayer. Sorry, just not for me. So if it\u0027s a separate mode/module, fine, but please keep single-player intact!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Microtransactions. This had not even crossed my mind until reading this thread, so just adding a voice against this abomination. Paying for DLC which adds significantly to the game but is completely optional (eg, a second star system) is a different kettle of fish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) A scripted/on-the-rails mission structure. This would destroy replay value of career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for people a page or two back that advocated a huge list of toggleable settings, yes, in an ideal world that would be great. But as a software developer, sorry, that\u0027s just not possible (or at least, not economically viable). You can\u0027t compare switching aerodynamics (for example) between simple/complex to settings such as Civilization\u0027s number of opponents or size of map. Changing the aerodynamics affects -everything- in the game, and hence you\u0027d need to tweak -all- the parts, costs, settings, etc between the two modes and ensure each of the modes is balanced and works well. And that\u0027s just one setting!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut hey, the great thing is that the developers have been clever enough to expose a plugin/mod system. This has allowed the community to build great mods, and for everybody to tweak their game to be just like they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T16:27:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIAP\u0027s are the one thing I don\u0027t want in KSP.
