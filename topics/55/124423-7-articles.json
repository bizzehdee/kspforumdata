Creativity, or so I\u0027ve been told around here, is working within the confines of the given pieces to create something new and unexpected. Pieces are changing and you won\u0027t be able to create the old, tired things you\u0027ve been creating. Try something new! We\u0027re getting a 0.625m engine to go with the bigger ones, no reason a few of those can\u0027t be clipped into an airframe for VTOL work.\u003Cp\u003EThis is exactly like the arguments against changing to a new aerodynamic model; pure doom and gloom. You either adapt, mod it to your liking, or walk away. If this change goes through, that is. I hope it does, the parts look pretty good (more polys please).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-05T21:08:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2015 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bloody_looser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
