This made me have to deorbit him. May the kerbal rest in peace. Anyway I believe the usage of a a grappling hook could be a small addition that would be a great addition to the Eva capabilitys of the kerbal. The could allow for exploration of caves and valleys to be made possible with out the use of jet packs. The grappling hook could also be used to connect two objects sort of like a strut (Like an asteroid) this could be Vital for an asteroid belt.
