Pluto has a thin atmosphere, as do a number of moons. Whether it was tall and thin or even shallow hanging smokey in valleys I just imagined how fun white-knuckle aerobrakes dodging mountains 1000m off the deck would be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.space.com/images/i/000/048/730/i02/atmosphere_size.jpg?1436388993[/IMG]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T16:44:54Z","Content":"\nDuna doesn\u0026#39;t have a really thin atmosphere, at least by Solar System standards. Duna has about ten times the atmospheric pressure of Mars, at 6.755 kPa, compared to Mars\u0026#39; .636 kPa (kilopascal). Pluto has an atmosphere of a single pascal, at max pressure! Even if you had Vall or Eeloo have a 10\u002B pascal atmosphere, the effect would probably be negligible. Of course, this is KSP, where planets can be denser than the densest elements and s solar system that is10th the size of real solar systems, so anything is possible I suppose.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:15:35Z","Content":"\nDuna\u0026#39;s atmosphere is a bit over 20 kpa.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T17:54:22Z","Content":"\nYeah that\u0026#39;s kind of what I\u0026#39;m saying. Even Duna feels plenty thick. Gameplay wise it could be fun to see a few bodies with atmospheres on the lower end. You wouldn\u0026#39;t be able to capture at Eeloo, but depending on your approach you could use it to slow down around Vall. Especially with those high ridges there could be some really crazy passes if you were brave.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T18:43:59Z","Content":"\nExcept Eeloo is a poor Pluto analog.
