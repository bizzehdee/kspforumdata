If you take the contract some random parts of the vessel in question will be damaged and you have to take an engineer there to repair them.

In fact the [Tourism Plus contract pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113621) has some of the logic in contracts for bringing tourists to visit stations ([this one](https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractPack-Tourism/blob/master/GameData/ContractPacks/Tourism/Station.cfg)). The basic idea is to use an expression to find a vessel that meets your criteria for the contract, like so:\n\n        DATA    {        type = Vessel        targetVessel = AllVessels().Where(v =\u003E v.VesselType() == Station \u0026\u0026 v.CelestialBody() == @targetBody \u0026\u0026 v.IsOrbiting() \u0026\u0026 v.EmptyCrewSpace() \u003E @/SpawnPassengers/count).Random()    }\n\nYou can then reference it like this:\n\n        PARAMETER    {        name = VesselParameterGroup        type = VesselParameterGroup        vessel = @/targetVessel        duration = 4h        PARAMETER        {            name = HasPassengers            type = HasPassengers        }    }"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T22:00:15Z","Content":"Yes, please.
