I\u0027m not refering to the fact of mining kethane or materials for construction or ISRU but to bring them back to earth as material of study or high price market luxury.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the idea I had of working it out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESample could have the following atributes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Weight\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Volume\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Material state: Rock (unaltered samples), dust (recovered from surface or preprocessed from rocks for better compactation), liquid \u0026amp; gas(atmospheric scoop or rock-\u0026gt;dust byproduct).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Planet from where it comes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Biome to it is related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddition to this, some machinery could be added to obtain such samples but also to change or improve their profit by using energy ( a macerator to turn rocks to dust (less volume and a bit less of profit), a compressor for storing more gas, a surface drill which depending on the size and energy can reach deeper layers,...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ammount of samples you plan on recovering can be hindered by your storage space but also because your engines are not powerful enough to lift again the vehicle (which I think is a nice handicap).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce recovered on earth, this samples could be stored on the center and later study them (escalating/limiting the science yield up to a number of kg) or sell them off (with the drop in price or even with market saturation until you sell samples from another planets/moons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this idea, I could be possible to encourage plane utilisation by placing deposits on earth of fallen meteorites or other elements of interest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, one last addition to avoid exploits over the last one is to add a budget cost of recovering vessels on earth surface depending on the distance to the center and the biome in which you are placed (desert/artic/sea zones are difficult places to find people). These could even encourage plane/vehicular rescue missions xd.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter tossing that out of my head, I will be glad to any opinions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
