With space planes, I have found that, if I use liquid boosters, the symmetry of thrust is hard to maintain after leaving the atmosphere. I can adjust thrust limits by hand, to fix this, but clicking and dragging sliders on paired liquid fuel boosters, on the fly, is painful as best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I am sure that this could be fix by making my boosters symmetrical...above and below the wing...like we would NEVER do on earth. But this feature seems like such a no brainer and what aircraft doesn\u0027t have easy to use throttle controls for adjusting each engine?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T23:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the Space Shuttle-style configuration of a spaceplane piggybacking on an external tank with offset boosters is inherently unstable, I think you\u0027d be better off using an automatic \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/107802\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethrottle control / thrust balancing plugin\u003C/a\u003E, rather than having a a dedicated throttle limiter action groups that don\u0027t see much use outside your particular case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA such thrust balancer, maybe as a computer, could also help a lot with stock space shuttles.
