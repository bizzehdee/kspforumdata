I sent up a segment that had some \u0027tugs\u0027 that could be attached to other pieces to move them into place but that is still cumbersome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thought I had is that instead of connecting thrusters, RCS tanks, and some type of control module to it in order to move pieces around in space, instead we could attach some small handles around the part we want to move. We could then EVA some kerbals that would hold on to these handles (similar to how a ladder works) and any kerbals holding on to the handles will act in unison as RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing something like this would help ease in the construction of stations and also give kerbals in space something to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T23:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe latest update to the KAS add-on allows small parts such as solar panels, science sensors and struts to be attached to vessels during EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the author (KospY) has described how to modify any stock part (including trusses or small fuselage segments) to also use this custom grab/attach system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
