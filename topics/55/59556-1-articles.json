A full on calculator (possibly associated with the planned observatory) would be wonderful and probably appropriate for the game. Using third party software is obnoxious and I doubt having users guess their phase angles could be considered a picture of realism. Presently mechjeb will give you the phase angles in degrees (I have a window devoted to it), but it really strikes me as something too fundamental too be third party. Frankly I wouldn\u0027t mind something as detailed as Orbiter\u0027s TransX serving as an MFD based alternative to maneuver nodes, but TransX, while capible of being extraordinarily accurate in transfer plotting, is pretty complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T00:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is sorely needed in the stock game along with a lot of other information that is present but not displayed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Queeg","CreatedById":92659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T05:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo simply it further, why not just add a Kerbal Kalendar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 17 - Launch Window for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 23 - Launch Window for Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the heart of it, that\u0027s what we as players are interested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless you like protractors, slide rules and calculators.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T06:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Queeg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Queeg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo simply it further, why not just add a Kerbal Kalendar?\u003Cp\u003EDay 17 - Launch Window for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDay 23 - Launch Window for Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProper tools to plan an interplanetary transfer do not involve MechJeb-esque automatic planning.

Guides I\u0027ve seen and read tend to point to websites and addons which will interpret the phase angle for you and give you the information you need for a launch window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I\u0027m suggesting is that if the idea is to include within the stock game all the information you need to be able to play without referring to 3rd party addons or tools/websites, then just including a protractor doesn\u0027t do that. Although maybe a protractor like window in game and recommended phase angles included in the science archives or some form of codex about each planet might be a compromise?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that existing players have always taken pride in the fact they can calculate interplanetary transfers based on phase angles or estimated phase angles done visually. But invariably, that is a result of those experienced players knowing that the phase angle to Duna is {xxxx}, that the phase angle for Eve is {yyyy}. And that information (in a lot of cases) came from wiki\u0027s and websites and isn\u0027t within the game either.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pigletx2","CreatedById":78322,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T14:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have a protractor mod, but it\u0027s a guidance system for getting between planets, not an actual protractor, so that won\u0027t help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T15:20:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Queeg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Queeg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll I\u0027m suggesting is that if the idea is to include within the stock game all the information you need to be able to play without referring to 3rd party addons or tools/websites, then just including a protractor doesn\u0027t do that.
