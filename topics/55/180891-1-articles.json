Right now there are very few perks after 3 stars--it all feels sort of half-finished. With pilots for instance its much easier to unlock probe cores than to earn piloting skills and there are no perks for 4\u002B5 stars so most players just slap a probe-core on pretty early and pilots cease to have a function.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the question about whether we want incentives for players to bring more rather than fewer kerbals on missions. Letting kerbals train across specialities kind of works against this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T18:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a module manager config somewhere that spread abilities out a bit, but haven\u0027t used it in years and things have changed so I doubt it would work anyway.
