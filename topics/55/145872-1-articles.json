Would it be possible/wanted to have extended (flight) info showing in the tracking station in stock game? I am thinking of information like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOrbital period for flights and/or planets/moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAscending/descending nodes (together with apoapsis/periapsis nodes)\u00A0without the need for setting up maneuver nodes,\u00A0for other bodies to aid in setting up transfers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne can calculate some of this but some things one can\u0027t readily calculate (at least I can\u0027t). It would be of great help in deciding if say a satelite network is on track or if the satelites are drifting, without having to actively fly the satelite with the disturbances in the orbit that leads to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
