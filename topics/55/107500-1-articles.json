I\u0027ve got little problem with the atmospheric-mode of the engine, that\u0027s fine and dandy, and I\u0027m not massively bothered by the loss of thrust at altitudes of around 20km, but the vacuum ISP is absolutely dreadful for a rocket motor that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eat the end of the tech tree\u003C/em\u003E. I mean, 305s \u003Cem\u003Emaximum??\u003C/em\u003E That seems to be defeating the point of having an engine for the task of putting spaceplanes into orbit, even in the name of balances with regards to the new aerodynamics. I\u0027d have expected one of the most high-tech engines in the game (as mentioned, it\u0027s at the end of the tech tree) to at least be a little more capable in vacuum. The vacuum ISP in 0.90 was around 360s, and that was just about enough, so I think \u003Cstrong\u003Ea value around 330s or 335s for 1.0 instead of 305s would be more appropriate.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I know, people have made SSTO spaceplanes with RAPIERs in 1.0, but in every instance I\u0027ve seen, they\u0027ve barely had any fuel left for anything once in LKO, and a lot of you will no doubt come along and say \u0027realism, bud; get with it\u0027, and while I agree that\u0027s it probably is realistic (Skylon\u0027s proposed flight profile has the vehicle fire a solid rocket motor in the tail to make the final push into LEO, conserving what little fuel is left for after re-entry), I must say \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enay!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Squad themselves have stated that KSP is a game first, simulator second, so why would it be beyond reason to expect the RAPIER to perform just a little better than its real-life counterpart? They\u0027ve already done a similar thing with the ion engine, buffing the thrust dramatically compared to reality for gameplay purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t deny my logic, really.
