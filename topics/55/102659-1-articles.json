(in sandbox you could search any mod and just use it including hit the run test button at random times just for fun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods could have a reputation score, as they pass tests they get a higher reputation the higher the rep the more players get offered the test contract for the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me as a player these contract them have a purpose not just to me but to the community. Which take out a lot of the grind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it opens up a vast amount of game scope meaning mod parts might need to introduce new contract types with new challanges to replicate certain bugs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust something that keeps coming to mind wondering what others think now we are getting close to release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
