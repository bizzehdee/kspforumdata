It might be a little complex though because of orbital speeds. For example, in Low Kerbin Orbit, stuff orbits at around 2800 m/s (give or take). It would be hard for the game to decide if you wanted to shed the 7 m/s extra driving you towards a solar panel, or the 2800 m/s you have orbiting the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T02:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, but if the thrusters he\u0027s got don\u0027t have that kind of power anyway... well, you can\u0027t kill velocity if you don\u0027t have the thrust to do it quickly enough to avoid death.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
