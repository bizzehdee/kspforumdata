It seems fairly obvious though, so my apologies to OP(s) if it has been discussed at length before. How about having your space agency require a certain amount of funds annually to maintain operations, based on the level of the buildings you have? I\u0027ve heard it discussed before that there should be an annual budget for the agency, but as funds coming in not going out. With that type of system, there would be a real incentive to meet ambitious time lines in the game, mostly as you start exploring other planets, but possibly earlier with some other minor tweaks. There would also be no need to implement anything nearly as complicated as a rival agency, which I can\u0027t imagine the devs even considering for quite a while. It could of course be a toggleable/slideable option in the game config, but would be part of at least the default moderate and hard modes. I think that type of system would add an interesting new dimension to both the time and money aspects of the career game.

It makes a little sense in the earlier stages of career mode, but becomes nonsense in the later stages, once you\u0027ve fully unlocked the tech tree and naturally your focus has shifted towards long range missions (having likely got to the stage where the local system is no longer that much of an appeal).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would have to be set at such a low level of funds needed, that it would be basically irrelevant and pointless.
