This made many things easier, such as attaching things to station hubs or attaching rotated parts to ships. Now, they have to be attached in the original direction before being rotated, which I consider tedious and unnecessary. Can you change this back please, SQUAD?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T17:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUmmm... I\u0027m thinking you probably have a bug or something, because I\u0027m having no trouble at all with rotating my parts before I add them to my vessels. For further information, are you using the keys or the gizmo?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T20:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was another thread about this recently.

You wouldn\u0027t use a pocket knife to cut down a tree, so why would you use a rotation gizmo intended for fine-tuning to orient parts before placement?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
