While I was coming up with cool base/lander designs, I tried out several different types of command pods to see which ones would suit my purposes. While looking through the stock selection of manned space pods, I noticed a lot of quirks with the pods that drive me up the wall and make my OCD flail around in fear. Since I love to use the Hitchhiker module whenever I can, that\u0027s usually where I run into problems with my designs. Ah, it\u0027s unbearable! So here we go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMK1-2 (3-man) pod:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E I knew something was wrong with this pod the day it came out in 0.16. The hatch is at a weird angle! I like to build very spacious CSM craft, so I often add that lovely, lovely hitchhiker module as a \u0022living quarters\u0022 for my dudes during long-duration missions. Of course, when I want to transfer them to the pod for the long journey, I have to EVA them around to the habitation module\u0027s hatch. That, however, is not really that big of an issue. What IS the issue is when I want to use this as a 3-man landing pod. I have trouble placing the ladder where it needs to go. Ah! This pod bugs the crap out of me. Sorry C7. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMK2 Lander-can:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E Ah, the Tuna Can! I remember being so excited for this pod when it was teased in 0.18. And when it came out, hot diggity! I found so many uses for it. Unfortuantely, a problem immediately presented itself: the pod isn\u0027t a perfect 2.5m cylinder. The \u003Cem\u003Ebase\u003C/em\u003E is 2.5m, yes, but then it tapers slightly inward and then goes straight up again, making it this odd diameter where, presumably due to the imitations of the collision mesh, stuff doesn\u0027t appear to stick directly to the surface of the pod. Still, it bugs me nevertheless. Also, it\u0027s really heavy. But it DOES line up with the Hitchhiker module, so props for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECupola:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Clara, you\u0027re a genius. This pod is very attractive looking, the IVA rocks my pants off, AND it lines up with the hitchhiker module\u0027s hatch! What more could I want? Well, more capacity for Kerbals and less weight. I know why it\u0027s like this though, considering the real Cupola on the ISS isn\u0027t exactly a very good place for three people to sit down in surrounded by equipment. And IRL, glass is really heavy, and seeing as the Cupola has 7 windows (and not Windows 7), I\u0027m not really surprised by the weight. Still, it bugs me nonetheless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMk1 pod and Lander Can:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E I clumped these two together because I have the same issues with both of them, that being \u0022pretty much none.\u0022 Seriously, these pods are practically perfect. The hatch is in a convenient place, (for the hitchhiker, that is. Oh, also, ladders) they\u0027re lightweight, and their collision meshes are accurate enough for my tastes. The thing that bugs me about them is while they\u0027re perfect, they only hold one Kerbal. Still, if the other pods could be like these, I\u0027d be ecstatic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ECommand Seat:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E This isn\u0027t a pod, but there is an issue with it nonetheless: I can\u0027t add any Kerbals directly to it, I have to EVA them from a pod and manually board them. At least, I think this is still an issue, unless 0.20 made it so I can add them to the pod through the crew menu. I forgot to check. Maybe this really doesn\u0027t count...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there are several people already making command pod mods that fix all of my issues with these, but some of them aren\u0027t modular or stock-alike. I don\u0027t like relying on mods to fix my (very few!) issues with the game because I\u0027ll never know when the creator will abandon it, or whether an update will break it and I\u0027ll have to go and reinstall a compatible version.

The problem with moving the hatch/ladder on the Mk1-2 pod is that then you\u0027re giving us few choices in how to deal with the fact that the RCS quads are going to want to be \u0022under\u0022 the ladder for efficiency. For the most part, this is just a visual thing, since the ladder can still be used with the RCS quad in a position that would appear to block the use of the ladder, but if your RCS quad placement calls for placing the quads at a height that would put them over the hatch instead of the ladder, if you try to EVA a kerbal out of the hitchhiker, you get told that the hatch is blocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs much as the non-symmetrical placement of the hatch/ladder on the MK1-2 command pod bothered me at first (yes, I posted forum comments about not liking it at the time), having to place RCS quads in positions that would cause inefficiency would be worse.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T21:53:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eil agree on the command seat issue. i like to build small open cockpit aircraft and dont like that i have to jump through hoops just to get a kerbal in the seat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you need to lign the hitchiker up to the MK1-2, you can just rotate one or the other till they line up. this is what i usually do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
