Career starts off with a couple of programs avaiable, which would pretty much encompass all you could achieve at the beginning anyways, by having multiple starting missions for each program offered. You simply pick the general direction (=program) you want to go and go. You\u00B4d not even have to specify which mission you are aiming for - just the program. The first couple of missions in each program would probably resemble what are now milestones, the later be more like what are now contracts. For each mission completed you get a fixed amount of REP, according to its tier within the program, that does not decay (two ways of losing REP: Dead kerbals and suspending a program, the later you can resume for no REP-cost, so you do not end up trapped because of that). More advanced programs may be listed early on, but only get unlocked if certain conditions are met, one of which could be a REP-threshold. For more details read my previous posts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is pretty straight forward, without being too linear and would nicely deliver the feeling of progression, while at the same time provide a good basis for balancing and tutoring and also be in compliance with general video-game experience. It would be about as linear and complicated as your standard open-world RPG, giving about the same feeling of progression. Like, look at the different programs as analogies to, say, the factions in Fallout: New Vegas, for example. If you choose to help one of them (which you dont have to), they will offer you quests, in a certain sequence (but sometimes multiple at once). If you have already completed one of them, before it gets even offered to you, that\u00B4s fine too. Feel sick and tired of this one faction? Well, go somewhere else and help another for a while... and the overall game-progression depends on who you helped to what extent. And then there are these completely unrelated sidequests, which would be the equivalent of the occassional contract you pick outside of programs, just to get some extra-funds. And of course, you can still just goof around, trying to see if you can go \u00B4there\u00B4 (wherever) just for the lulz or out of curiousity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I am thinking of like 1-3 missions for each tier of each program and each program having like 10 tiers. With like 10 programs around, that would total to something like 200 \u00B4quests\u00B4 and about 1,000 REP to collect, so each point of REP would roughly resemble 0.1% towards game-completion. And there is still independent contracts, tourism and mining for you to do outside of the programs, plus any personal goals you may have in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: Science would be the analogy to (craftable) loot, the science lab would be your workbench, transforming the loot into something useful, science instruments would be your backpack (or your \u0022vest with [x] pockets\u0022)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T14:10:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 02:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T16:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The tree is just a dumb limitation of the career mode.

And when you did reach those 5 (actually 6, in both cases) REP the questions becomes: Do i initiate the mun or the minmus program first? Now, or do i proceed along the Kerbin program a bit further, first? (remember: once initiated, a clock begins to tick on any program\u00B4s financial rewards) Do i suspend the Kerbin program while i am doing the mun/minmus one (or both in parallel?)?

I want it to play a significant role in KSP\u00B4s career mode. That\u00B4s all. I want that to be achieved with the simplest tools possible, that come with the least amount of confusion for new players, reasons to get frustrated, addition of new mechanics or general revolution possible. At this point i am even dropping out of the construction-time and life-support camp (for now, at least), because i think with the changes and additions mentioned above, those could be reasonably abstracted away for the sake of a smoother gameflow, since R\u0026amp;D times, wages and depleting program-rewards have them covered. If it\u00B4s time we are aiming for, there is no need to shoot at it from like a dozen directions at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: That\u00B4s also, why i\u00B4d prefer the programs to be body based (and generally focused on exploration, with all the rest being seperate from the programs): 1. It would feature less individual properties (tick-times for entire programs), making it simpler, less error prone on both ends, 2. It\u00B4d be more akin to that RPG-experience, where, by-and-large, you go from town to town completing one after the other, more or less (of course with the occassional return). I think it\u00B4s more intuitive, offers more affordance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMining \u0026amp; tourism i just see as something that you\u00B4d run on your own accord. Mining obviously requires the equipment and once you have it, you can run mining operations. See to it that they turn out profitable (or useful). No program required. Toursim? Well, depending on your REP (3rd way of destroying REP: killing tourists) tourists line up - the further you take them (and back), the more you can cash on them. No program for that, either. (Thats not to say, that the body-themed programs couldnt contain mining/tourism missions/branches here and there)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there would be contracts like we have them now (minus what is covered by the programs). Tourism \u0026amp; mining contracts would be more of the kind where you set up infrastructure for someone else, instead of doing the actual business of ferrying ore or tourists (those would only occur rarely if you have already had one of those infra-setup-missions first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, and this is something i would really love to see, there is this special program, that doesnt offer any rewards at all really, game-currency-wise, but guides you to explore some mystery around the anamolies, and which gets triggered after you have found your first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT3 (sorry): You know what? Actually, the body themed programs should have at least tourism branches (starting maybe around tier 6) for bodies, where it makes sense, focusing on building destinations (accomodation) - and tourists would only want to go to those. Then you\u00B4d get contract-offering for those destinations and each destination (or rather their capacity as you\u00B4d expand each \u00B4hotel\u00B4 over tiers 7, 8, 9 and 10 of each respective program-branch, if you so chose) would increase the number of such contracts showing up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T18:22:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-26T22:21:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually add that I\u0027m fine with \u0022random\u0022 contracts added.

One does not learn about the mechanics of liquid rocket engine turbo pumps by studying the craters of the moon.

In the aforementioned example, you could assign both missions to the launch and it would be named something like \u00B4Mun Duna Science Mission\u00B4, or something a bit better sounding. You get the idea. This would, however, not limit the reapable rewards to the assigned missions - it\u00B4s just a naming tool for your individual rocket.

That\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t send a dozen missions to the Mun or Duna over the course of a save if you wanted to, but the game shouldn\u2019t really expect you to in order to progress. I also tend to think you should be able to get halfway through the tech tree in Kerbin SOI with a bit of work, at least to nukes before heading interplanetary. It would also be nice if you could complete the the tech tree before mounting big crewed Jool missions. Moho windows are about every 230 days, with Dres, Eve, Jool and Eeloo ranging from 600 to 400 days. Duna windows unfortunately are 2 years apart, which means if you send a probe first you\u2019ve got quite a while to kill before your next window if you want to go manned, which is usually your first logical interplanetary mission.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13.333333333333332px;font-family:Verdana;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EWhat this suggests to me is if the research upgrades are to remain relevant there should be a huge difference in research times between early game parts and late game parts, from a couple of weeks early on to as much as years later. I don\u0027t know if you want to cap the number of concurrent research projects, but later on it should be as many as a dozen. It also means there will be times later in the game when you\u2019ve sent multiple probes to each planet and may need to time-warp for over a year to get to a sensible launch window for manned missions. This could get really tricky if you actually want people to run missions while they wait for upgrades and research rather than just time-warping through it. You also can\u2019t just schedule penalties annually as they won\u2019t scale from the early game to the late game. They really need to be tied to mission durations, probably in the form of deadline hits to reputation. Increasing caps on total funds keeps you from having infinite money at any one time, but you can still abuse it by launching huge numbers of modules. It also seems a bit restrictive for players who might want to strategically save up for a particularly expensive mission. Better I think would be limiting funding duration for each mission so players could take risks and increase their total so long as they could come through in the end.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cb style=\u0022font-weight:normal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:13.333333333333332px;font-family:Verdana;color:#333333;background-color:#ffffff;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\u0022\u003EIf this was the case, if deadlines were intelligently calibrated to factor for transfer windows and funding durations were simply capped you wouldn\u2019t actually need to flag vessels.

Why are we starting over with this discussion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHard deadlines are either too easy and offer too little incentive for the player to consider time, or, in case of actual failure, frustrating AF. It\u00B4s a punishing game-mechanic ; something that should be avoided. Veeltch pointed out the balancing issue with hard caps, and how they are hindering creative gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPthigrivi asked wether to cap the number of techs to be researched at any one time. Answer: Yes, to exactly one, cause any higher number makes no sense. Imagine 3 \u0022nodes\u0022 you want, each costing 20 SCI, and you are able to research 1 Sci/d. So it would take 60 days to research them all. If you\u00B4d do them in parallel, you\u00B4d get all 3 on day 60. If you do it sequentially, you get node A on day 20, node B on day 40 and C on 60, which only offers advantages and has no drawbacks - so why would you want to research in parallel, ever?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe late game techs would of course take much longer to research than the early ones. In my mind, i treat 1 Sci = 1 day and go from there. Early game techs are like what? 5 Sci? Late game\u00B4s are a thousand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings that should take time? R\u0026amp;D. Done. Why would you need more?\u00A0 Construction time is hard to balance, quite complex and a high-odds candidate of frustration. It offers no meaningful choices, imho. All it will do for the player is a lot of thumb twiddling and launch-window missing. Let me ask you this: If you\u00B4d build a Space Shuttle-alike, you know, a reuseable vessel, how\u00B4d you feel about having to wait for a new one to be constructed before every launch? Yeah, perhaps one could device some super-complex internal mechanic to account for this... but why and how likely is it to happen, really?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other two (facility-upgrade and training) are less problematic and could be time-relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWIth programs featuring diminshing rewards the longer they are active, you dont face hard caps, you are not restricted, but incentivized (which is always better), to do things effeciently with a focus on whatever is more valuable to you in your current game at the time (time, money, sci or rep) without even having something like life support (which is another potentially very punishing mechanic).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso i hear the word \u00B4grind\u00B4? That\u00B4s a function of options not of the number of times you need to go somewhere. After ~3 missions, the next place should open up, maybe, to provide another option, but the old one should not be automatically \u00B4completed\u00B4 just because of that. That\u00B4s why i suggested 10 tiers with a branching out tree for each program. To only have 3 missions for each planet would be waste, imho. That would be like having a swimming pool and only bathe your feet in it. I want you to: 1. Walk around it, to check its size, 2. dip your toes in it to check temperature and acidity, 3. Grab that life-saving ring and wade in to hip-depth, 4. Swim a lane, 5. Dive to 1m below surface, 6. Dive for 30 seconds, 7. Build a slide and use it, 8. build a 3m tower and jump from it, 9... ahh, you get the point, with some branches going of at certain points (e.g. a \u00B4dive-branch\u00B4, a \u00B4slide-branch\u00B4...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I\u00B4ll allow myself to state some basic principles which should be followed, not only when it comes to this, but in game-design in general, in the hope, that we can all agree to these and tailor our suggestions accordingly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Try to avoid punishing players - instead try to reward them. Work with incentives instead of deadlines, for example. Avoid measuring success in booleans (0/1 - yes/no) but aim for a continuum (possibly in more than one dimension, even), instead. Work with soft-caps where you can, avoid hard-caps, where they are not needed.*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Guide new players, but try to avoid restricting experienced ones as much as you can while doing so. Players become more experienced, while they are playing ; so in early game guidance is the focus, with freedom gradually taking over, as the game progresses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. KISS (\u0022keep it simple, stupid\u0022): Try to achieve the experience you are aiming for with the least mechanics possible. Implemented mechanics should be easy to understand, consistant throughout the game and intuitive from the get-go. The information needed for the player to actually play with them should be easily avaiable to him/her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Do not add elements for their own sake, but instead ask yourself, what they would add to the game-experience as a whole. Realism is only one aspect and not something that forces elements to be part of the game, per se. If a realistic element adds tedium, confusion and/or frustration, it has to offer a lot more more than just reaslism on the other side of the coin, in order for its implementation to be a good idea, still. Chances are, it\u00B4s not, in many cases.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*The reason soft-caps are rarely implemented in games is because of AIs usually having issues dealing with them - but KSP has no AI. They offer the possibilty of \u0022i did it\u0022 or \u0022that\u00B4s good enough\u0022 becoming \u0022i did it \u003Cem\u003Ewell \u003C/em\u003E(=efficient)\u0022 and \u0022i could do better than this\u0022, which is what experienced players are looking for and becomes ever more interesting as you crank up the difficulty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2 - PS: If you give me points for my posts, i assume, you are actually agreeing to what i wrote to a high degree - please do NOT give me points, just for participating in the debate.

Once it\u0027s launched there are no deadlines and the only objective of the contract is to do science once you get to your destination. That way the only thing you would have to do\u00A0before the launch would be the tech research, which would also\u00A0be easier to balance: if there are two parts/groups of parts (one takes 15 days and the other 20 to research) needed for a mission/program you add the time needed to research both (35 days) and set the deadline for the launch somewhere around that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeaaah this is a good point about complex slingshot missions, and its probably part of the reason stock deadlines are so crazy forgiving. So you\u0027re saying you could flag one vessel for multiple missions? I know you\u0027re not unlocking missions linearly, but they must be somewhat linear, right? Like say when you start you only have \u0027flying planes\u0027 and \u0027get to orbit\u0027 as your mission options. Complete one or both and Mun and Minmus unlock, complete one or both of those and Asteroids, Duna, and Eve open up. At this stage could you put a probe in orbit, flag it for anything incomplete and use all that money to just do one mission? Like if having something flagged in orbit indefinitely postpones deadlines why wouldn\u0027t you always have a probe in orbit flagged for every available mission so you could get as much money as possible and never worry about deadlines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222607699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138448\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464592420\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002239636\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Veeltch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003EEDIT: oh, and by the way: Have you ever played\u00A0with KAC \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105624\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105624-pthigrivi/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Pthigrivi\u003C/a\u003E?

I still feel like maybe the most important thing in all this is to give payers choice over where to go and how to go there, and if a player just wants to do a damned Duna mission but instead is being required by the penalties and incentives of the game to do lots and lots of other things while they wait we might end up back where we started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-30T13:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2016 01:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
