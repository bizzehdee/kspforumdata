I registered specifically to weigh in on this IMPORTANT TOPIC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis Game/music/folder method was used in Civ 3 and 4 (I believe) and I can\u0027t tell you how awesome and important it was to those games. Here are some (perhaps obvious, but important) points for the devs and all of us to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Game music is needed to create a signature for the game and increase stock game experience, BUT, no matter how awesome a game\u0027s music is or how much there is, most users will eventually become board of it. So adding more music as a developer is great, but isn\u0027t the ultimate solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: System resources are taxed by running itunes in the background, and the effect is lost somewhat because the music is not queued to game events (VAB, Tracking Station, Space, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Each person\u0027s TASTE in music (while interfacing with the game) is different, and will even differ throughout the same person\u0027s life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: Most people are not adept enough to modify \u0022hard wired\u0022 game music files, but MOST people ARE likely to utilize a music folder and subfolder system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain with Civilization as a point of reference they had different music subfolders for each \u0022era\u0022 in the game (ancient, industrial age, modern, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, and let\u0027s keep this topic alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T14:04:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love this idea.
