to the unbearable lagfest the game has turned into.\u00A0 I mean its not unplayable, but its excruciatingly painful when part counts get above 600, and even at a low 300 pats i notice some stutter/lag, 300 parts is what id call average for a interplanetary ship that carries a dropship or 2, some ground vehicles, ect.\u00A0 This also says nothing of capital ships and anything military based, when a spaceship hull is at least 150-200 parts itself, and weapons are what, at least 5 parts for a guided missile thats any use (engine, fuel, droid core, decoupler, and ofc the warheat which is needs to have 80m/s impact tolerance).\u00A0 I know not very many of the community is into military, but if your ships carry like 20-40 missiles onboard (and thats assuming you are actually using teh absolutely most basic missile type), the part counts shoot through the roof and end up lagging the game to death.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like legit MP support, but i can live without that for the near future (as you can always use buggy but functional DMP, or stick to good old fashioned save game sharing for turn based combat).\u00A0 Stock MP will be alot of work, so i dont expect it soon, but id love to have some relatively unbuggy multiplayer that allows people to actually interact in real time, build together, or more likely blow each other\u0027s ships out of the skies (err space).\u00A0 Cant wait to go full out pirate and attack people at random, ofc assuming the server allows free-for-all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, as for other features, 2 things id like would be some procedural parts like wings and panels (if only as a bandaid fix to the lag), and KAS style system that at a bare minimum lets kerbals deploy struts in the field by perhaps using ore supply and directly converting ore into the mass of a strut.\u00A0 Id also like the ability to make minor repairs in the field, like say a wheel is completely broken off and is physically separated from the craft.\u00A0 Why not allow highly skilled engys to like weld it back on to the ship somehow.\u00A0 I know both of these are wishful thinking, but especially KAS would make the game so much better, and well, procedural parts would at least act as a method to cut down on part count and thus current lagfest, not to mention they\u0027d unclutter the bloody part lists.\u00A0 Do we seriously need that many bloody wings?\u00A0 You\u0027s need 1 basic wing thats can take the shape of any of the current wings, then 1 basic tailfin, and a procedural control surface that can also create any of the stock surfaces.\u00A0 i know here are mods for this, and i know the devs absolutely hate the concept of procedural pats and prefer their lego approach, but this would go a long way in both increasing freedom in our designs, and lowering the insanely high part count requirements for both aesthetically pleasing designs and anything that is plain and simply
