I think it would be really cool if there was a wider variety of contracts in the future, and one idea I had was inspired by the priorities of real-life space agencies today: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESatellites are big business for space programs and corporations, and it would be really cool for Kerbal corporations to pay the player\u0027s agency to put satellites, orbital stations, etc. into orbit around Kerbin, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn or other celestial bodies. The requirements might center around including certain parts, putting them at a certain orbital distance, or leaving them up for a certain amount of time. Not only would these contracts give added incentive to develop space, they would also result in less empty space around Kerbin, especially in career mode when money is tight and launching craft just for kicks doesn\u0027t always make sense financially.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leicontis","CreatedById":9874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T21:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are mechanics already in place that could work well for this: Add \u0022payload\u0022 parts that don\u0027t show up in the tech tree, and thus are only available as \u0022experimental\u0022 parts when you\u0027re doing a related mission.
