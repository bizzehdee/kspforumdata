I sure did.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you can use maneuver tool near space object, you must collect at least some data about it. Example - before you can plan maneuvers in Kerbin zone of influence, you must visit a set number of biomes\\ spend set time in it\u0027s atmosphere or low orbit\\ run specific experiments\\ etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPROS :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Makes more sense (at least to me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Makes probes actually useful ( for suicidal missions to unexplored objects, which, afaik, they are partially used for IRL )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Makes exploring chain a little more robust (instead of \u0022go wherever you want after you discover nuclear engines\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONS :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Might make learning curve a little bit more steep for new players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T13:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is a good idea. All the data you need to plan a manoeuvre node can be obtained by observations from afar -- generally speaking (i\u0027m not going to go into details because they hurt my head this late at night) you only need know the mass of the body and its orbit/trajectory/velocity/etc. None of this requires direct observation, and all of it can be gained via simply observing the objects for a time via a telescope in the real world. Very little experimentation is really needed. Sure, actually planning the nodes is a bit math-heavy if you were to do it manually, but you wouldn\u0027t need to have gotten into orbit about it or gotten a soil sample to do so. Those things are useful for science... but not for the math and physics of orbital manoeuvring. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rallige","CreatedById":93444,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T14:01:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I get what you\u0027re saying.
