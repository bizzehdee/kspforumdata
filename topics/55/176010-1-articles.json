Many of these strict rules make absolute sense and for the most part this game has it the right way around.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are several of them that I find ludicrous,\u00A0and\u00A0one of these rules makes so little sense I want to complaint about it and suggest it to be fixed in a later release.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe satellite missions that start with \u0022Position a sattelite in [any\u00A0type of orbit] of planet/moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe first mission requirement is, which is to strict, annoying and what this topic is all about... \u0022Build a new unmanned probe that has a antenna and can generate power\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nSeems simple right? \u003Cstrong\u003EIT IS!\u003C/strong\u003E Sometimes these missions are so simple I as a player like to complicate things a little bit, and I find I should be able to. This game forbids it unfortunately as I will explain below.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I like to do is do many contracts all at once. Sometimes mixing manned and unmanned missions into a single launch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my previous playthrough I had 7 contracts. 2\u00A0x rescue contracts, 4\u00A0tourist to Mun orbit, 1x sattelite deployment mission to the Mun,\u00A0Plant flag on the Mun, Science data around the Mun and Science data from the Surface of the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo for the\u00A0satellite\u00A0contract\u00A0I took one with me on my Mun rocket with a manned lander module where the satellite was attached\u00A0in a fairing shell ready to be deployed at the destination. As I tried to deploy it didn\u0027t register and while browsing the web while finding threads on this forum also I learned everything has to be unmanned right from the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the entire launch vehicle including all the modules it consist of must also be unmanned otherwise the attached satellites aren\u0027t registered as being unmanned even if they are by themselves. Either that or I shouldn\u0027t bring a pilot on board, I\u0027m still not clear on that one, but so far I made my point I think. There is this mission requirement check that becomes green but only if everything is unmanned right from the launchpad.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe contract requirement sentences are a farce and if I take it for how things are written I\u0027m\u00A0at no fault whatsoever.\u00A0The contract says to build a new unmanned probe. \u003Cu\u003EIt doesn\u0027t say build a new unmanned launch vehicle with a unmanned probe on top of it\u003C/u\u003E. If it were to say that I would see my mistake, now I don\u0027t. For all I care what I tried to accomplish seems right and this game fails to tell me the exact criteria for deploying a unmanned satellite.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also doesn\u0027t make sense from a real life perspective. The Hubble Telescope is unmanned, but it was put there by people in a shuttle. So why can\u0027t I do this in KSP when following the satellite contracts in career mode?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShouldn\u0027t this be fixed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesa","CreatedById":130333,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-19T10:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds very strange to me, I\u0027ve heard of people reusing old probes to complete contracts by just docking and undocking them.

But I\u0027m thinking it might have something to do with my tourists on board. You said you unboarded your Kerbal to have the satellite contract requirement activated, however, tourists cannot be unboarded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if my tourists are at fault\u00A0a satellite contract\u00A0also should work in my honest opinion. I think I should be able to combine tourist, satellite and any contract I like with whatever vessel I\u0027m currently using as long as the end product (product meaning vessel) is unmanned to satisfy the satellite contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I\u0027m jumping the gun on assuming the tourist are what stops the satellite requirement to activate\u00A0as I haven\u0027t tested that but since you seem to have done this many times before and you talk about unboarding your kerbal I feel it has to do something with the tourists on my vessel. Either that or something that is part of my vessel setup is completely different then that of yours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, I to thought I\u0027d remembered I took satellites into orbit before using manned vessels. The thing is, I haven\u0027t played career in a long time. The last time was in V 1.2.2 I think, I\u0027m not even sure if the version number is correct, but it was a while back. So it\u0027s only since recently I\u0027m getting back into the career mechanics. Apparently according to your career play this is still possible. We\u0027re all playing version 1.4.1 I assume? Then I\u0027m doing something wrong, I hope to find out what that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-19T20:30:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2018 08:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Aeroboi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesa","CreatedById":130333,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-19T22:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223401872\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221529440173\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re all playing version 1.4.1 I assume?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.4.3 I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T02:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223401872\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221529440173\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re all playing version 1.4.1 I assume?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be testing this on 1.4.3 (or 1.4.4 if I don\u0027t get a chance before then \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) but I was on 1.3 or maybe even 1.2 the last time I did this. 1.1 maybe even who knows.
