Demands for Helium-3 and deuterium have driven the prices sky high.\n\n**Fusion reactors and engines**\n\nFusion reactors will be able to provide lots of power, fusion engines have a large amount of Isp, but Fusion engines won\u0027t work inside an atmosphere and the engines aswell as the reactors need to be kickstarted with power. They also require Helium-3 and Deuterium in a 1:1 ratio. The tanks used to store the fuel of the fusion engine are not able to be filled in the VAB or the SPH, but can be filled from another vehicle(docking).\n\n**Mining**\n\nHelium-3 can only be gotten from some planets, while Deuterium can be gotten from every planet. The ISRU converter is able to convert ores into Deuterium(liquid fuel is hydrogen and Deuterium is an isotope of Hydrogen). Helium-3 and Deuterium can be gotten from the atmosphere of a planet. Lists of planets with Deuterium and planets with helium-3:\n\nDeuterium:\n\nJool\n\nEve\n\nDuna\n\nKerbin\n\nLaythe\n\nHelium-3:\n\nJool\n\nEve\n\nTo be able to mine Helium-3 and Deuterium from an atmosphere, you need air intakes and atmosphere tanks. These tanks store air gotten from a planet, air only gotten from 1 planet can be stored. Then the ISRU refinery is able to refine the air in it\u0027s new atmosphere mode(where it uses up air instead of ores) and store the Helium-3 and Deuterium in their special tanks.\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThe recovery of Helium-3 gives a huge amount of money if you have a contract, otherwise you get half of the value of a contract.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T16:52:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jappards**"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:15:23Z","Content":"Would the 10x density of the kerbol system make fusion easier or harder than Earth?\n\nit makes the ground more explosive so I\u0027m guessing it would make fusion easier as well."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T23:54:04Z","Content":"I think you\u0027re talking about the LV-N, and it\u0027s powered by liquid fuel for convenience.

Would be cool if we needed to mine special fuel just to use LV-Ns though.\n\nNo, the LV-N uses liquid fuel and is powered by nuclear fission, there is a difference. Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom, this is usually done with uranium and gives some nasty radioactive byproducts. Nuclear fusion is making 2 atoms merge, I am talking about the fusion of Deuterium(an isotope of hydrogen,which has more neutrons that usuall) and Helium-3 (An isotope of helium, which has 1 neutron less than usuall). This nuclear fusion \u0022creates\u0022 1 proton, normal helium(the helium you put in party balloons and in airships to make them float) and gives off energy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E If we look over a few unimportant differences, you\u0027ve just basically described the KSP Interstellar mod.\n\nApart from Antimatter, Alcubierre drives, microwave wireless power transmission, Megajoules, Aluminium hybrid fuel rockets, Waste heat, Ammonia, plasma engines, Methane-oxygen engines, solar sails, do I need to go on?"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:42:49Z","Content":"Ok, it wasn\u0027t a full description.

It\u0027s plasma physics, not rocket chemistry.\n\nIf you\u0027re talking about matter density; I don\u0027t think *everything* in the Kerbol system is denser that elsewhere/when; just the planetary cores. Maybe two neutron stars got into a spiral dance and one came apart through tidal forces, scattering stellar fragments through a nebula that formed a planetary system with superdense centers. IDK. But that shouldn\u0027t have anything to do with fusion either; physics is physics, unless you find a doorway to another universe (or \u0027brane\u0027, as they\u0027re now saying).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Little green men with bulging eyes, I\u0027m willing to accept that.\n\u003E A planet 10 times as dense as earth, I\u0027m willing to accept that.\n\u003E \n\u003E Converting hydrogen into deuterium?

A hydrogen nucleus can \u0027capture\u0027 a neutron (under the right conditions, of course) and become deterium. All you need is a source of neutron flux of the appropriate density and energy distribution. It\u0027s nuclear chemistry."}]}
