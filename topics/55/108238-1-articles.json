They also require Helium-3 and Deuterium in a 1:1 ratio. The tanks used to store the fuel of the fusion engine are not able to be filled in the VAB or the SPH, but can be filled from another vehicle(docking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMining\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelium-3 can only be gotten from some planets, while Deuterium can be gotten from every planet.

Nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom, this is usually done with uranium and gives some nasty radioactive byproducts. Nuclear fusion is making 2 atoms merge, I am talking about the fusion of Deuterium(an isotope of hydrogen,which has more neutrons that usuall) and Helium-3 (An isotope of helium, which has 1 neutron less than usuall). This nuclear fusion \u0022creates\u0022 1 proton, normal helium(the helium you put in party balloons and in airships to make them float) and gives off energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cicatrix\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cicatrix\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf we look over a few unimportant differences, you\u0027ve just basically described the KSP Interstellar mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from Antimatter, Alcubierre drives, microwave wireless power transmission, Megajoules, Aluminium hybrid fuel rockets, Waste heat, Ammonia, plasma engines, Methane-oxygen engines, solar sails, do I need to go on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:42:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, it wasn\u0027t a full description.
