My searches on the subject turned up very little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat my suggestion is, is rather simple. Lander legs have a form of suspension built in, right? Basically, why not mod a shock absorber part?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, it would have two attachment nodes: top and bottom. Top stays solid, while the bottom can move upward into the top one, absorbing shock, similar in the way landing legs do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use this in a number of ways, but the main one I am think of is on rovers. Basically, attach shock absorber to the frame at the top, then a small cubic strut or something to the bottom, and the wheel attached to that, allowing the wheel to get the effect of suspension.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ustudy.in/sites/default/files/images/Shock%20absorber.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Shock%20absorber.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas this already been done, and/or is it feasible?

This is why, for instance, you cannot current attach parts to cargo bay doors and expect them to also move when the doors open and close. For a part to move relative to another, its position and orientation values must thus be updated constantly to ensure smooth motion - in effect, you end up rebuilding the vessel constantly every time you move an appendage and any parts connected to it. This is pretty much the secret behind how InfernalRobotics works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 0.24, Squad had in fact experimented with a secret ModuleJointMotorTest PartModule, which would allow two or more parts to move relative to one another.
