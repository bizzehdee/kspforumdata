Adding weather as a feature would mean the game would have to have another engine within it, meaning a heck of a lot of programming, testing, etc. It would be easier to simply add that feature into Kerbal Space Program 2.0 rather than reworking the current version to include weather. And then, what would it be once it is included? The hard-core KSP player would not just want weather on Kerbin, but on every body of the stock system. This would mean a lot more coding, the potential for more bugs, and so forth.\u00A0 I really do not see how adding weather would be feasible for KSP 1.X.
