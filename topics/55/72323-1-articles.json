I\u0027ve tried this approach already with the Mission Controller Extended mod, which has been providing a contracts feature and money earning/spending for a long while now. Under that system, a skilled player could make so much money that it is pretty much a non-object, completely making the feature redundant. At the same time, a newcomer could easily, within 2-4 launches, utterly ruin themselves to the point of having to reset the mod - a feature presumably introduced to avoid the alternative, which would be \u0022start a new save\u0022. For a stock implementation, that would be the only option left to the player. So whichever way you turn it, there\u0027s only a limited band of \u0022average\u0022 players in the middle who can use the feature as designed without bombing their saves, yet are still actually challenged by it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, I think we should take the term \u0022budget\u0022 more literal. Squad has always used that term instead of outright saying \u0022cash\u0022 or \u0022money\u0022, and I think that\u0027s no mistake. I think the player will be getting a self-replenishing \u0027allowance\u0027 with which to conduct their business, and merely the size of that allowance can be increased or decreased through ingame success/failure or currency exchange. Such a system would ensure that players cannot bomb their save through things like \u0022I forgot to set the staging order correctly, my rocket failed to launch and now I\u0027m in the red, help!\u0022. In fact, while Squad has stated (in an interview somewhere) that yes, there will be a Game Over screen, they have also stated that you will have to be exceptionally bad for an extended period of time in order to get to see it. You could never realize this with a fixed money pool, but with a budget in terms of a self-replenishing allowance of variable size, this can be done with great control on the developer\u0027s end over the speed with which a player spirals into bankruptcy. Not to mention that it accurately reflects the situation of real space agencies, who don\u0027t have or earn any money themselves; they just get yearly budgets assigned to them by other entities, and those budgets keep coming even if the agency happens to have a slow/unsuccessful year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as already mentioned above, the existence of timewarp renders any time-based refresh mechanism pointless. Instead, I could imagine a per-launch allowance. You can build any rocket you like, but when you press launch, the rocket\u0027s cost is checked against your budget, and if it exceeds it, you simply can\u0027t launch. And if you do launch a rocket and it fails, you have not lost any money: you can just launch again, so long as whatever vessel you launch stays below your budget allowance. Of course, failing repeatedly will probably reduce both your reputation and your launch allowance, so if you keep being an idiot you might be able to fail yourself into a corner where you remaining allowance is so low that you can\u0027t fly useful missions anymore (or simply the Game Over screen triggers if one or more of your three currencies reaches a certain lower threshold). By making budget cuts percentage-based, you can ensure that an advanced player with a high budget stands to lose a lot from a high-profile failure, while a new player on a small budget who\u0027s randomly pressing buttons to figure out how stuff works will only see small decreases that don\u0027t impact him that much (unless he fails over, and over, and over).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReusability could be modeled in an interesting way with this system; namely, a part of the value of anything that you \u0022recover vessel\u0022 could be added as a one-time temporary boost to the next launch of similar vessels (i.e. recovering a spaceplane would give a bit of a boost to your next SPH launch, but not to a VAB launch). Players trying to simply launch, land and recover something for budget boosting purposes could be discouraged in some way - for example, that flight could be seen as \u0022failed\u0022, because it didn\u0027t actually achieve anything. The player \u0022wasted\u0022 third-party funds on this launch without having anything to show for it, and this costs him reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there\u0027s downsides and/or difficulties to this approach as well, but for starters I think the concept has merit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-14T12:37:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2014 12:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T13:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe we\u0027ll just get 250 million dollars since its being funded by the government.
