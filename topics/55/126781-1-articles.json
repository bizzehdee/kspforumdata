He puts down multiple segments and connects them. Sooner or later the part count lag of this Colony will increase so much that it leads to stuttering or kraken attacks. My suggestion is that at some place in the construction tier of the science tree there will be a Geodetic Conversion Kit. It would be required to be flown near the settlement, where it is deployed. On deployment the Player may insert a certain volume of modules into a placeholder. The placeholder will be a relatively low poly low part count geodetic dome that may be placed by the Player. The functions of the geodetic conversion may be limited to vertain elements like batteries, capsules etc. While solar panels and other stuff might be necessary to stay outside of the dome.\u00A0 Here is an example form a polar expedition:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dome.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.ecophotoexplorers.com/images/antarctica/Dome.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSize and possible content of the dome might be connected to the tech level, but the purpose should be clear: Reduce the part count of colonies. And with geodetic spheres it would also work on space stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-01T15:24:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2015 03:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by QPDO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T11:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I upgraded my computer.
