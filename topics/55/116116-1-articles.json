Goethe claw, and all of a sudden you have to bring the entire wreckage back to Kerbin? Why, exactly? Better to have a full ship, but out of fuel, and you must dock, and refuel. Or a ship with no power and broken solar panels---send an engineer to repair. There are many options that are better than most all the current contracts (which almost universally stink).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Layereddiagram","CreatedById":148146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T22:06:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe just a mk1 command pod with a hammer SRB attached to it.
