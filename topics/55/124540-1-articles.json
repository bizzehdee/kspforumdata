It is buoyancy and that is it, they said nothing of anything else. If you are expecting anything more that realistic buoyancy let me disappoint you now. It is not a water system as this topic suggests, it is a buoyancy system. For those who missed basic chemistry in high school, molecules that are less dense than other molecules will float above them. Air floats above water, helium floats above air, etc. However, NathanKell specifically said this system will be limited to the water for performance reasons, so no blimps this time. He also said mods that create resources to change buoyancy will work. So a mod could create water as a resource and make an effective submarine ballast tank (this is my sentence, not his). Finally he said there will be a water displacement system so craft aren\u0027t torn apart.
