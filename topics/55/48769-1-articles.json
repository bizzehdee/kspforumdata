A big motivator in scientific research and exploration is a way to market new discoveries to earn a profit. Granted, these profits usually come discovering new concepts, locations, or landmarks, but what I am proposing would just be skipping that step that is otherwise non-essential in the scope of the game play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mechanic could serve to positively change the game in three ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) It will set the pace of how fast you can expand and develop your space program by balancing tech tree advancements with exchanging points for credits to fund your rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) It provides more purpose to the game because you fly not only for science, but also for profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) It will instill motivation to think out your designs (and possibly test them out first in sandbox mode) before embarking on a mission because of the possible consequence of blowing up a ship and losing all of the invested credits. The ability to salvage scrap from a crashed mission would be a nice side addition to this so that you aren\u0027t at a complete loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting cash will be provided as a grant (government, private sector, etc.), but the amount would be debatable in consideration of not giving too much so that the advanced players don\u0027t start off too rich and giving just enough so that the beginners don\u0027t go broke when when/if they fail at their first few attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(this may be thinking too much into the economics side of things)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoans could also be available at various fixed interest rates with some sort of direct proportional relationship to the possible amount that you can borrow. (high rate = large loan) I also propose a debt limit where you can no longer borrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would encourage some sort of continuous method of gathering science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only viable downside to my brainstorm is that there is a possibility of going completely bankrupt and not being able to borrow any more money, which ultimately means Game Over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does everyone else think about this? Has anyone else came up with the same/similar idea once they first heard about the science points system? Have I pretty much said something that has already been discussed/modded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
