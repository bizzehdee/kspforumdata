Currently the one\u0027s in ksp are always NKO\u0027s Every single asteroid wants a piece of kerbin,\n\nNow i understand the issues of having thousands of asteroids, And the fix for this is to not show them on the map screen, And not to even render them until within 20-60km range, Asteroids should also have more sizes ranging from class A all the way up to giants of 500m radius, Squad should also incorporate voxel terrain to the asteroid\u0027s making them modifiable ingame (So if you crash into one you leave a crater,) As for finding them, Distant asteroid\u0027s should simply show up as they do in Rodina, As little blips that mark their location without interrupting gameplay or causing much lag.\n\nMost of these asteroids would share very similar orbits, So the DeltaV required to fly from asteroid to a nearby one would not be that much, Maybe even just a matter of pointing at it and firing.\n\nThe large 500m asteroids that i pointed out earlier, Would frequently be in the way of the smaller one\u0027s, Making impacts frequent in the asteroid belt, This belt would not be like in Sci-fi\u0027s where they are EVERYWHERE!! but still they would be close enough to from one to another without use of too much fuel, This would also add extra challenge in getting to the outer planets because while it\u0027s unlikely you will it an asteroid on the way to jool, You hair might turn grey with a few close calls.\n\nEDIT: To fix the problem of rendering multiple orbits at once, All asteroids would be paired to the nearest large asteroid (Meaning that they are viewed by the computer as one craft and each smaller asteroid is a part.) And maybe even generate a form of dust fog that you can find in asteroid clusters\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T00:10:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by daniel l.**\n  \nImproved upon the article"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T23:29:11Z","Content":"They\u0027re supposed to be NKOs.
