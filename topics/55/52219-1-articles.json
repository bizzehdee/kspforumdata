Specifically, how you can repeat the exact same experiment and get a smaller amount of science, and you have to repeat it several times to get the max. It\u0027s even worse with transmissions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, here\u0027s how it should work :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a. Every science activity can be done only once, after that, it\u0027s 0 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E b. If you choose the transmit option, some of the science is lost permanently. Obviously, the losses need to be made smaller, perhaps only 20-40%, depending on the activity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would cut down the tediousness of science by a factor of 5. There\u0027s nothing wrong with having to return to the Mun many times to max out all the science, what I have a problem with is when I\u0027m in an area I have to repeat the same experiments over and over and over to get all the points out of them. That is not fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would be nice if I could hotkey the experiments to both perform and transmit them, without a popup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T09:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027re toning down the repetition (at least, according to what they\u0027re saying about 0.23) but really, you don\u0027t have to do any experiment more than a couple times.
