Personaly fps would make my life much easier since i do play quite a lot of FPS games. However this could bring so much new stuff to the game like tilting your kerbal and even jetpack upgrades. For example as of now the jetpacks are very un manoeuvrable, maybe if you follow the tech tree you get better jetpacks that are either stronger or more \u0027manoeuvrable\u0027. i personaly think this could open alot to the EVA aspect of the game. thanks for reading \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T02:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPosting here to build on what goldfang is saying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding \u0022limits\u0022 it occurred to me that IVA missions are extremely difficult yet promising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest adding in the future a \u0022hard-mode\u0022 that limits flight control to 1st person IVA view.

This made the camera turn into a first person view in EVA, however, it made the kerbal uncontrollable, and you always looked up or something. I\u0027m pretty sure this camera view could be fixed in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T15:47:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I was just thinking about the same thing lately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be useful in later updates.
