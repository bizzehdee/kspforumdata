Do you know of any more sources of info regarding their PQS mod system? It comes across as a bit ambiguous when it talks about the particular technique used. I know they mentioned Simplex Noise within the later stages of the talk but is the same technique used to create Height data for all if not most planets in KSP? I know Kerbin has some hand drawn features but it\u0027s the rest I\u0027m interested in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to avoid misinterpreting any info they gave us in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T18:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment I do not think of any more info.
