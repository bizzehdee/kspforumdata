It would be cool if there was a similar housing built in for some of the landing struts that we use for non-wheeled landing craft. Some kind of shell that opens and allows the strut to extend for landing and then could retract and hide the strut for an aerodynamic ascent.

I drew some red circles to indicate mini hatches that would open so the legs slide out in the direction of the yellow arrows. Once they got all the way out then they could angle down. The idea is that you could mount an engine below the part and it would not interfere with the legs going in or out. Presumably you could do this for the 1.25m size and fit a terrier engine there and have the legs reach the ground, and for a 2.5m size a poodle engine would fit and the legs would likewise have the length and room to reach the ground below.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T20:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, as I already said, I like it. I like both ideas. Bigger landing gear, in my mind, would have a hard time fitting in a system like that, so have aerodynamic pods for the larger ones would be good while having the in-line style for the smaller ones would be great. Though I wouldn\u0027t make it 1.25m and 2.5m, that just adds un-necessary limitations (on landers with multiple stacks in symmetry, you don\u0027t need 4 legs per stack).

Those 4 struts fit inside the 2.5m reaction wheel perfectly. The struts that are one size larger - I forget the name of them, the ones that start upside down and fold down about 135 degrees - might not work for an inline part.
