To add challenge to this, you would have to transport out the raw materials to the destination and successfully land them all within 1km diameter of the first successful drop. Once you transport out enough material, you can then build a structure like a VAB on Duna. However, you can only build one building at a time and you can\u0027t make all of the space craft parts out of it without transporting the supplies out to the space center first. So the new building would use the resources that you transport out there to assemble the different space craft parts. This way you could launch a new space craft from a planet and you would have a fresh vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T14:19:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPart of the \u003Ca href=\u0022Orbital\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, under \u003Cem\u003EOrbital construction and construction on other celestials\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
