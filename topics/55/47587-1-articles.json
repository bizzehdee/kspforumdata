That includes things like crew ingress/egress (will they be able to climb the ladder?), lighting, adequate room for deployable parts (legs, antennae), rover functionality and so on. With subassemblies becoming stock in 0.22, testing various parts of your spaceship on the launchpad or runway before strapping them together onto a rocket is going to be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T19:29:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you remember a time when launchpad testing did not incur a five to ten second unity bsod?
