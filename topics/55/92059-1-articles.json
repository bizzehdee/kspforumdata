Unfortunately, you can\u0027t render every 1/2 frame to slow things down, you have to render whole frames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, totally could be wrong about this, but this is how I recall the explanations provided, more or less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T17:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty sure that both types of warp work by increasing the dT value.

I \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve read that before (sucks I can\u0027t find the source), and it\u0027s why the kerbals in the IVA view in the lower right jump around during that time warp. Because of how Unity does physics, the forces and vectors are assumed to be the same through those un-rendered skipped frames as they were in the initial frame prior to the skipping, so I \u003Cem\u003Eguess\u003C/em\u003E you could interpret that to be messing with dT. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you believe that it\u0027s super easy to add the feature, then you need to come up with a reason that Squad has ignored repeated requests for the feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I Think one of the previous threads I was looking at was here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60916-Freeze-frame-Pause-game-without-locking-camera-view\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60916-Freeze-frame-Pause-game-without-locking-camera-view\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TKO","CreatedById":20719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T09:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the added info Lethaldose. ..I guess it\u0027s a shame if it can\u0027t be added. I can appreciate the \u0022well, the Apollo astronauts couldn\u0027t do this so..\u0022 argument, but I was more thinking of it in terms of compensating for a sometimes clumsy user-interface. For example, when I have a four-engine plane that has one of its engines sheer off when \u0027landing\u0027 I imagine a real pilot would be able to hit a swich, or pull a lever to cut the opposite engine before it yaw\u0027ed out of control. Or when I realise I haven\u0027t shut-off the flow from the (several) RCS tanks on my rover, I expect the real pilots would be able to hit a few switches to cut the flow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead, I\u0027m having to rotate my view to get those parts into view, right click on them (possibly several times if the right-click is being usually finicky), maybe try again if the rocket/plane is swaying and the part moved out from under the mouse while I was right-clicking .. then I finally hit the toggle to do what I want .. repeat this process for each part. If a total interactive-pause of the game isn\u0027t possible, maybe a one quarter or one eighth speed option is -- where I might be able to try to effect the needed change similarly quickly to what the \u0027real\u0027 pilot would, with the necessary button-laden control panel in front of them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Suddenly imagining another scenario with a hard moon-landing and one of the four landing engines breaks off .. perhaps what would be ideal is a \u0022panic\u0022 button that could be hit, engaging a slow-mo speed for, say, three or four seconds while I frantically get that right-click on the opposite engine so I can kill it. ..could be a nice thing to have. ..feels like bullet-time. ..might be better out of the regular time-scale arrows, and implemented as a big red panic button. ..maybe with the time available dependent on pilot skill/experience? ..okay, I\u0027m rambling now.) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
