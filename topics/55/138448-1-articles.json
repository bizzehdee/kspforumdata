The game has thought me alot about the mechanics of spaceflight and motivated me to study the history of spaceflight.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen career mode was added, at first I was quite exited about the prospect of playing the game like a real space program manager. However, I find myself exclusively playing sandbox mode these days again because I keep getting frustrated with the way career mode functions in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing the stickler for historical accuracy and realism that I am, I always found it rather odd that the KSP career begins with a manned mission. unmanned probes only come into the game after some research. While in reality of course, every destination in space has always first been visited by unmanned robotic probes, paving the way for manned exploration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the fact that one needs to gather \u0022science\u0022 by measuring the properties of the different regions of space and celestial bodies in order to develop rocket parts seems a bit absurt. One does not learn about the mechanics of liquid rocket engine turbo pumps by studying the craters of the moon. In the real world, knowledge about rocketry is gained by spending money on\u00A0testing parts on the ground, and by flying (and occasionally blowing up) equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ve been finding myself RP-ing a career in sandbox mode. Would it not however be swell if we could imagine a more realistic career progression and mechanic then is currently implemented in the game?

Time needs to be a thing. Currently long time only passes due to time warp, and the only reason to time warp is to progress a mission in flight, or to warp to a transfer window. If building things took time (including rockets), then time would progress more naturally. The usual complaint is \u0022needless\u0022 warping, but warping is a thing, and moving the calendar forward is not \u0022needless,\u0022 it\u0027s in fact needful. KCT as a mod does this, but stock likely needs a more simplistic approach (but not much, KCT is a great mod).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The science/tech paradigm is broken. This is harder, since buying tech is currently the only psychological reward system in career. Intermediate fixes are better tech trees (CTT and ETT, as examples of mods that do this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. To actually be a management game at all, kerbals should be able to do things on their own if the player wishes---execute maneuver nodes without the player needing KAC to do it themselves, for example. I\u0027d add in even completing routine missions alone if assigned (station resupply, etc). With meaningful time this becomes more important as you usually have a few balls in the air at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Ideally there would be some sense of science giving you something for its own sake---doing some science could unlock an atmospheric trajectory prediction, for example. Some could allow better map zoom, and/or the ability to place markers on the map (to use as targets just like a landed ship) to facilitate better landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.

I would like to see \u0022internal\u0022 contracts that come from your program, that fit the goals you might set in something like strategia. So your goal is the Mun, but your science team then suggests possible landing spots (via survey, etc, \u0022contracts\u0022). Instead of rewards being funds/science upon completion, perhaps (assuming time became a thing) the funds come from a budget, and perhaps science points can be awarded in advance---to buy tech for the mission in question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay the whole funding paradigm became an annual budget, paid out to the player in chunks every month or so (a Minmus month is ~50 days, or it could be a Kerbin year/10, or whatever). This would make time be a thing, instantly, as if you are low on funds, you warp to the next month. Bam, 40-50 days pass. With real mission planning, your goal is, say a crewed Duna Program at this point. Taking that goal would award some science to spend on stuff for that mission. Contracts and missions (Duna is the program, I\u0027ll use \u0022missions\u0022 for the internal to KSC contracts) are then generated for Duna. Linus suggests orbital science at Ike, and various science on Duna at specific places. Taking those gives you extra science to spend, and perhaps can borrow from total annual funds, NOW for that mission (reducing your later payments, obviously, as you took an advance). Time limits on missions and contracts would be slashed across the board. You\u0027d not have 10 years to complete a rescue, it would be 10 \u003Cem\u003Edays\u003C/em\u003E.

You\u0027d lose control over how many active vessels there were, so performance could tank without you doing anything or having any way to fix it.

Those will keep hunting for every possible subsidy which offers them a higher reward than regular, trying to get ahead by buliding microscopic networks with subsidised passenger\u00A0runs, which pay almost nothing per completed run. When you play against those as a player, you can easily beat them by running heavy networks of bulk freight, which have a higher net payoff, but take more time and money to set up, but keep generating reward once they are running.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn AI may not be the best option here but we need a competitive element to keep the game challenging and rewarding.

And when the Game was in Alpha and there was only orbit and the mun to go to, slapping together some boosters and flying by the seat of your pants was indeed a viable form of gameplay. I think KSP\u0027s identity crisis started to appear once other planets were added, requiring much more complex mission architecture such as transfer windows\u00A0Delta-V calculations.

I\u0027d even go as far to say that it would be an improvement to the game if the rocket parts had a much more cartoon-esque\u00A0look to them then the realistic shape they tend to have now. That would even be very appealing.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Strength of KSP lies in the marrying of cartoon-esque slapstick with real spaceflightscience.

Looking for a more realistic mechanic for career mode progress\u00A0does firmly lie within the bounds of KSP\u0027s identity. And if the career mode gets to serious with itself, heck, throw in a ludicrous contract like landing a heavy golden statue of Werner von Kerman on the far side of Mun.
