This is very handy for cleaning up the map when trying to select something, but often hiding ships that I don\u0027t want to see also hides the ships that I do want to see!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I\u0027m trying to dock two capsules and have selected one as the target, disabling capsules on the map hides the active capsule and the target capsule as well as any other nearby capsules. Either the current ship and the target should always be displayed or there should be an additional tab in the filter panel for the \u0027selected ships\u0027.
