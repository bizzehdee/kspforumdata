There would be random events at random places in the system. Things like cryovolcanos erupting, solar flares, earth quakes, storms (you don\u0027t have to write an entire atmosphere script onto vanilla or anything, just random storms), flooding caused by gravitational events, and whatever else you could think of. You could receive tips of this happening from the tracking station, and record them appropriately. That is, you would get the tip off if it\u0027s under the range of an appropriate scanner satellite.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou could try to collect data (for science points too) by watching from orbit, or sending a probe/rover down and watching it. Or if a kerbal is EVA out there watching it, you could actually witness it. Let\u0027s be honest, we\u0027ve all dreamed of something like that.
