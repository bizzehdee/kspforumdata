This means that you will always know when you are going to stall or when it\u0026#39;s safe to deploy chutes, on any planet, at any altitude. This is because traditional airspeed indicators are based on relative \u0022pressure altitude\u0022 not some global reference frame. It is a critical instrument, arguably the MOST important instrument in any aircraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed_indicator[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T09:23:35Z","Content":"\nFAR will give you your current speed in IAS, EAS and Mach number, and given our atmosphere is static we don\u0026#39;t need CAS seperately. If you try using IAS in the upper part of the atmosphere you\u0026#39;ll find your airspeed reading goes rapidly into five figures, though. I think what you really want is stock to give you a readout of dynamic pressure ( FAR does this also ) - can you get that from Mechjeb now?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T11:46:38Z","Content":"\nYup.

What he means is a traditional, INDICATED airspeed meter (IAS), where KSP gives you TRUE airspeed (TAS). TAS is great for many things (navigation, for one) but IAS, due to the nature that it\u0026#39;s measured, is very useful in real airplanes. Certain reference speeds (stall, do not exceed, etc) are a function of air pressure as well, and change at (roughly) the same rate as the indicated airspeed. So your stall speed is always, say 75 kts IAS, even when your true airspeed is 500m/s. Same for the maximum speed the airframe can sustain. That\u0026#39;s why the barber pole is painted on the face of a IAS indicator, but it\u0026#39;s a hand on a TAS indicator.\n"}]}
