Right now, I use the MK2/1.25m adapter fueltank...but that\u0027s a fuel-tank and is heavy, even if I unload the fuel. Also, there is no good tail piece, what-so-ever.\n\nSeems like a no brainer.\n\nHere\u0027s one such design that would benefit highly since the center section wouldn\u0027t need to be used for fuel, at all. It could be light weight components, but since I must use fuel tanks for tails, or at least as adapters, I\u0027m going to fill them with fuel.\n\n![Af0lAdA.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Af0lAdA.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T21:53:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by coreyfro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T22:13:08Z","Content":"I agree.
