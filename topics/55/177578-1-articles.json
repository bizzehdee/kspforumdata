Please give me a button which stops all the fading entirely. I guess whoever added it was trying to help but the algorithm continually guesses wrong about what I want to see and what I dont, basically I want to see everything.\u00A0(I am not talking about the orbit trace bright / fade slider already in the game, I mean that whole craft and their orbits are faded out.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance today I wanted to switch to a craft I knew was approaching Minmus inside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E on an escape trajectory which needed a deceleration burn to insert into an orbit. So in the map after finishing maneuvers with another craft outside Minmus \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E,\u00A0I switched to focus on Minmus and the craft I wanted was not visible at any zoom level, only orbiting craft were visible so I had to go through the tracking station. This doesnt help and it should not have been faded. This is just an example, the fade is continually obstructive and never helpful, it even happens to the craft I am focussed on sometimes, it just isnt working right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond quality of life suggestion is please have a way to toggle MNV display to permanent in the tracking station. It is such a pain trying to read all the node times when they are continually blinking out for four seconds and you have more than half a dozen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could do something about those that would be great because they are the foremost of my list of desirable changes.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-16T07:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.
