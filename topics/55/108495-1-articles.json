Now most of would probably question the use in that however, making replicas with cargo bays can be hard due to their shear size. I believe making an Mk.1 cargo bay and more .625 meter parts is the way to go. This suggestion was inspired by the F-35B. My question is, what if we do get that, then we can put hidden VTOL engines and actually store internal cargo in our Mk.1 ships. What do you guys think? Yes or no?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T23:53:19Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ghostbuzzer7**"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T06:57:57Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to see more mk 1 cargo bays AND 0.625 tanks in general in stock. The service bays are nice, but they\u0027re too short even for some small items like a QBE, and 0.625 size is underrepresented in many ways."}]}
