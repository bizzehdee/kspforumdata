In my modded career mode, I\u0027m playing with Dang-it, Kerbal Engineer and some other minor mods. I\u0027ve recently exhusted most of the science on Minmus. This was due to the massive science run when I found the crater that had 4/5 biomes in close proximity all in the same crater. I kind of regret getting almost all the science in 2 trips, as I wont get back to Minmus until I\u0027ve got Ore extraction technology available. (assuming I work out how to transport it - that stuff is heavy!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway - As I\u0027m planning my missions to the Mun, I felt the overwhelming desire to make it \u0027mean more\u0027 that a science collection run. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETLDR\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like for the surface sample report to add weight to the ship for each report gathered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo many surface samples and you\u0027ll find you might not be able to get back home.... how that\u0027s balanced in the game if the suggestion is ever taken up, I have no idea. Maybe the weight is an actual resource used in the science tree for something - no idea really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t find anything in the mods forum section that did that - I\u0027ve assumed that the available API with regards to the science reports doesn\u0027t allow a lot of (mod) flexibility at the moment - other than within the current method of gathering the various data reports. So I cobbled together a few mods that allow me to do a slightly manual representation of something \u0027like\u0027 this suggestion...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMods I\u0027m using to kinda sorta make this work for me:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28895-0-20-2-Resource-Generation-Module-(0-28)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EResource Generation Module\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E (RGM)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---I\u0027m not a modder, but I can work out how to edit a cfg file. I found this old mod by Fel that still works in 1.0.4 and after following the doc Fel included, I managed to get it to add a button to a container that would add a resource (Rocks in this case) at a set rate while the button was on. If I click the button again, it would stop adding that resource to the container. Ok - now I can use this process to represent the surface samples I\u0027m returning from the Mun. The resources themselves mean nothing other than the weight they add to the ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thematic bonus is that the RGM only adds the resource and I can\u0027t remove them. If I add too much - then so be it. (Obviously Bob found some rock samples that he absolutely couldn\u0027t leave behind.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/91998-1-0-4-Community-Resource-Pack-04-3-2015-07-06\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECommunityResourcePack\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---I tweaked the Rock resource to set the weight to be 150KG for every 10 units. I could of made a new resource for surface samples, but this was already there. Also - looking up the official lunar missions on wiki I see they returned about 110Kg of samples on their last trip, so I\u0027m in the ballpark of a weight that seems right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe weight of the Rock resource was tweaked around some random requirements I made for myself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - make a small rocket for under 5.5K in funds (my rocket ended up with a delta/v of 2k)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and assuming a return trip needs 600 to land 600 to ascend and 300 to get back - all rough numbers from a delta V map I found on the net)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I wanted each 10 units of rock to knock off 200m/s off the return trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - wanted 2 return samples to be a borderline achievable return trip (more so with my inability to land without using less than 750/800m/s of delta V with this design)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - allow for adjustment of the sample weight until it was \u0027just enough\u0027 to allow a small rocket to land and only have enough delta V for a return trip to kerbin with 1-2 samples from the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis edited resource, combined with the above RGS, meant I could add an amount of the Rocks resource to a container on my Mun lander/rocket. The downside was that the RGS adds resources like the fuel transfer system (but with only one container) which means it\u0027s not an integer number and there wasn\u0027t an easy way to get a specific number of said resouce. So I just set the transfer rate to be slow enough so I could stop the transfer at a close enough number. (again blaming Bob for any addition over the rough quota I\u0027d set of 10.0 units per sample.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECustom Part\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI added a new part (used the model asset for another mod - KIS I think, but it could of been a goo canister. I just liked the look of the KIS crate container) This would act as my surface sample return crate. I added the rock Resource to it with a starting value of 0, max of 100 (10 reports). I also added the science container Module so it would allow a Kerbal to store their surface sample reports via EVA in the same crate. Lastly, I added the RGS module that allowed me to add the button that add rocks to my crate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of how I\u0027m playing this is a packaged \u0027mod\u0027 in any form. It\u0027s just a selection of existing mods and cobbled together ideas from mods that would be nice if someone put it together as a \u0027mod\u0027 or even an expandable option in the science reports API that allowed those reports have actions occur like add a resource to a tank/container when performed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EHow I play to achieve this effect\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I get Bill to take a science report for a surface sample, I force myself to add about 10 units of Rocks to the container I set up. This lowers my available delta V for a return trip and ensures that I plan how much fuel I have with me and weigh that up against how many surface sample reports I want to bring back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this surface-sample \u0027weight penalty\u0027 method is what I\u0027m applying to myself to ensure it adds a \u0027bit\u0027 of a deterent to trying to grab a stack of science reports in one mission. And this meant something to me in achieving this because the surface samples were the highest paying science points. The actual science report also has to come back with the rock weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI even managed to come up with a plan that involved 2/3 small sample return rockets that I would land in advance along my planned rover route. So I don\u0027t just beast-mode it and add a heap of fuel/high power rocket engines, I limited the sample return rocket to be under a 5.5k fund limit for the Mun decent/accent return stage. This severely limited how much delta-v that small rocket could have. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was done all so I could land a kerbal in a rover (I think I can land that too - it\u0027s heavy!), take surface sample science reports as I rove around the various biomes. When I eventually come across my sample return rockets (which also act as waypoints for the rover trip), I drop off the surface sample science report/s (adding ~10units of rocks to each sample report I added to the crate) and send it on it\u0027s way back to Kerbin while Bill looks for the next sample. If I managed to land the sample return rockets well, I could get 2 samples back, if not, I make do with 1 sample per rocket. If the entire venture gets old, I\u0027ll just load up 1 rocket and boost for the Mun station and get them to pick up the reports and deal with it later with a seperate return craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hopeless at designing rockets and I\u0027m sure that adding a few 100kgs of deadweight to a rocket probably poses no problems to those who know what they are doing in the game. Having said that - I\u0027m sure the \u0022surface sample\u0022 weight could be tweaked to be more meaningful for those better at this than me, but it\u0027s just the idea I\u0027m playing with at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully pictures will help convey what I\u0027m trying to suggest a lot better than the mess listed above. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/KEv3U\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
