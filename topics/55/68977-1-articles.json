Unity 5 was announced not too long ago, but what does this mean for us KSP players? Well despite Unity\u0027s proposed upgrade price, this my be well worth it. Here\u0027s why for those not in the know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: 64-bit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was asked alot throughout the forums where it\u0027s to the point where they\u0027re on the \u0022What not to Suggest\u0022 thread, sadly all 64-bit OS systems are suffering from this, even linux due to it running a windows app with just linux exsentions. for those not in the know you can only use 4GB of RAM at max on a 32-bit apps, but 64-bit can handle way more RAM. once the 64-bit problom is solved this means more installed mods and maybe less lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Multithreading:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on the \u0022What not to Suggest\u0022 thread. To sum up If your having alot of lag, this is most likely the problom. Right now the physics engine for KSP is big data processing wise. once mutithreading is implemented the physics engine data will be ditributed evenly throught the Computer Processor cores instead of focusing on one core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are alot more things that maybe in unity 5 that i missed that would improve KSP, but those are the major ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you folks think? Shoud they upgrade to unity 5? I think so.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T07:36:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have noticed. It\u0027s been discussed several times. The devs will update to unity 5 when they can be sure that KSP will run properly on it and have made the necessary adjustments to facilitate this. This was discussed a little while ago -- it\u0027s a good idea to search before posting, so that you don\u0027t end up posting redundant threads. The previous thread was here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73623-Unity-5-Support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73623-Unity-5-Support\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo quote Rowsdower in the previous thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rowsdower\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m going to have to close this one up. Not that it\u0027s a bad suggestion, but it\u0027s been brought up a lot lately. At this time, there are no plans for 64 bit support, but the devs are excited about the potential of Unity 5.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the same reason, I\u0027m going to be closing this, as there is already one large thread and several smaller ones on this topic that have been discussed to death recently. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an additional note, Unity already has 64-bit support. The reason Windows and Mac users don\u0027t have a 64-bit binary to play with is because it isn\u0027t stable in the slightest. Only the Linux 64-bit binary is reasonably stable at the moment, and even that has its extra issues. The devs are just waiting till Unity can properly compile 64-bit binaries that won\u0027t crash for no reason before they give everyone else the 64-bit binaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
