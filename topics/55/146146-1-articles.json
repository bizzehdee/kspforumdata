A bit too complex to my likings though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think each chosen program (in the Admin Building) should grant a fixed amount of money for accepting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, basically you go in there and\u00A0you want to explore Dres. You pick the \u0022Dres Exploration Program\u0022 which grants you\u00A0100,000 funds. Once it\u0027s accepted you get the cash and you are to complete a bunch of objectives around Dres. The program tells you to do a bunch of World\u0027s Firsts (orbit, land, etc.). You build a satellite that is capable of doing that BUT you also bring experiments there. Why? Because you have them and designed yourself a contract that will pay you for using the experiments. Now that the program is finished it grants you, let\u0027s say 50% of what it gave you at the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that\u0027s a bit complicated. So:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo into the Admin Building -\u0026gt; Pick a program and get funds to realise it -\u0026gt; Go into the Mission Control -\u0026gt; Design yourself a mission with objectives you\u0027ve picked yourself -\u0026gt; Go there -\u0026gt; Get rewards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO prpgrams should grant money and completed missions reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T14:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure. We can haggle about the complexity and the options. I\u0027m not married to anything except the base concept.
