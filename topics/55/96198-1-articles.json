I entered a polar-ish orbit so I can start doing sweeps over the surface but the altitudes have to be quite low which means I can\u0027t warp time. The time to complete each orbit is over an hour. I switched to another vessel to enable the time warp and the lander in low orbit around Gilly disappeared, presumed by the game to have crashed into Gilly. It\u0027s going to take a great many orbits to complete this contract (most won\u0027t put me in the right spot for a measurement) and at 1 hr 30 per orbit, I\u0027d rather play Garden Strimmer Simulator 2014. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T09:14:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
