First of all, 0.65m Reaction wheels. I really enjoy making space probes, and sometimes they are a bit heavy, and the tiny torque from the control capsules (or whatever they are called) is not enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow a suggestion not only for the game. I think Squad should create topics for we to vote or talk about things they create. For example, they surely had parts that were half developed and left aside because they weren\u0027t good enough or just didn\u0027t fit. If the players could give their opinions on those parts it would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
