It now has a much worse TWR than its real life equivalent.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the end of the day the Nerv is a solid core nuclear thermal rocket and no amount of nerfing will make chemical engines competitive to it over interplanetary trips unless you take away the fundamental qualities that differentiate it from chemical rockets. Instead of any further nerf I say decrease Nerv\u0027s weight back to previous level but simulate one aspect of NTR that make then truly different from chemical engines - the deadly radiation coming from the unshielded reactor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst of all, I propose a 300m stand off distance from a fired NTR engine (unfired engines are pretty safe). Any kerbal with in this distance will immediately suffer the effects of acute radiation poisoning - pilots/scientist/engineers all lose their primary function, cannot EVA and cannot transfer (so basically, like tourists that can\u0027t be transferred), their IVA portraits should also show them unconscious inside their IVA suits and flickers of static on their screens..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce they leave this hot zone, kerbals return to normal on account of kerbals having much higher tolerance to radiation than humans. However on their personal log (the thing in Astronaut Complex that says \u0022Orbit around Kerbin\u0022, \u0022Landed on Mun\u0022 etc) there will be a new \u0022radiation sickness\u0022 entry. This flag doesn\u0027t have any material effect on the kerbal, rather it\u0027s just a reminder that you weren\u0027t as careful as you could have been with the crew.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow to mitigate the effects of radiation coming from the reactor we need shadow shields:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i67.tinypic.com/16j0s3k.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216j0s3k.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically it\u0027s a flat, curved part similar to a heat shield but thicker. It comes in 1.25m, 2.5m and 3.75m size. When attached to the top of the Nerv it produces a cone area above the engine that is shielded from the radiation. At launch the shield is the same size as the stack but once in orbit you can toggle to extend the shield and the shield will have several lobes that slide out to expand the protected cone area to perhaps 90 degrees. It should weight a bit, so that a unnerfed 2.25 ton Nerv \u002B shadow shield works out to be about the same weight as we have now, say 0.75 ton for 1.25m shield, 2.25 ton for 2.5m and 4.5 ton for 3.75m.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nDocking a manned craft to the nuke stage will then have to be done with some care as you will have to approach the stage front on and stay with in the shadow. Similarly when undocking you will want to back the two crafts away from each other till then are more than 300m apart before you flip the nuke stage around.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe aim of this is to make NTR engines unwieldy enough that some thought needs to go into a vessel using one, yet to make the drawback not so punishing that no one will want to use them, and simulate this drawback in a way that it\u0027s unique to this type of engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-10T23:21:39Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2016 11:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T15:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already only use nukes in a way that fists this description (i.e.: I copy NASA reference mission designs to a large extent).

If checked, it adds weight to the part. If not, then going through VanAllen\u0027s belt (or using NERV) should kill all crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way, you can have lightweight non-shielded crew parts (for when you don\u0027t want to go beyond LKO - usefull for SSTO spaceplanes, for example, or in early-carrier) or heavy shielded crew parts (for when you want to go farther : mun, minmus, or any other planet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe could even have a slider to configure the radiation shield : a ship that is going to explore the Jool system should have a heavier shield than a ship that is just going to the M\u00FCn\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T15:40:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI, for one, would be happy to give this a try.
