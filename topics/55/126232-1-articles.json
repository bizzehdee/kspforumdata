It\u0026#39;s very hard to compress liquid - especially in space, where the difference in pressure would be huge. However, liquid fuel and oxidizer also seem similar to liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. (Especially since hydrogen makes the ideal propellant for a real life nuclear engine, and the NERV in KSP uses the same liquid fuel.) These are both gases at room temperature. The way you compress them is by refrigeration - the gas condenses into a liquid. These are called cryogenic fuel. ...since in KSP they are called liquid fuel, if they are meant to correspond to hydrogen and oxygen, they\u0026#39;re already cryogenic and as dense as they\u0026#39;re going to get. Realistically these fuel tanks should actually be drawing power for active refrigeration. They don\u0026#39;t.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI generally think of the LF/O in KSP as a microcosm rather than any one kind in RL. I would also say fuel stacking just isn\u0026#39;t realistic. If you want more fuel realism, check out the RealFuels mod and the Stockalike Realfuels Configs, which make stock engines use real world fuels without changing their performance.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jf0","CreatedById":148341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T03:49:10Z","Content":"\nIn real life most rocket propellants are liquids (or solids) which don\u0026#39;t compress much, even under very high pressure. The reason liquid propellants are good is because they are dense without storing under pressure. High pressure means you need stronger and heavier tanks. This is why liquid oxygen,for example, is used in rockets rather than compressed oxygen gas. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe density of some liquid propellants can be increased a tiny bit by (furthur) cooling and pressurising, but nowhere near doubling the density (which is what you get by clipping two tanks into each other)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"More Boosters","CreatedById":147303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T17:52:30Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Kyrt Malthorn\u0027]hydrogen and oxygen, they\u0026#39;re already cryogenic and as dense as they\u0026#39;re going to get.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot necessarily true.
