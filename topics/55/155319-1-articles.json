This was true until the Science and Career modes were implemented; because of the tech tree, those modes make KSP \u0022Open World\u0022, which can be understood as a \u0022Sandbox\u0022 game with a goal. The goal in the case of KSP is simply to fill-out the tech tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, for players such as myself who enjoy goals, after the tech tree is complete, the game is effectively over. Radiant quests, such as the contracts, are a means to an end and are fundamentally the same from when Career mode begins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore I suggest that more focus be given to post-tech-tree Career and Science game content, to maintain the interest the game generates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne idea I had was unlocking new models or skins for parts based on where those parts have been in the Kerbin system. A landing leg that made it to a certain biome on Duna, for example, might be \u0022improved\u0022 by engineers to better suit dusty environments, resulting in an unlocked model for construction. The base function and form would be the same, but it\u0027d look different and perhaps even have better traction on biomes considered \u0022dusty\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother idea would be to consider NASA\u0027s current major long-term objective, that being Martian explorers and eventually colonies. Bigger rewards for colonies (not just funds from contracts, but new equipment) after the tech tree is complete would help drive extended play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhatever the case, the bottom line is this: endgame content requires concrete goals and explicit rewards.
