At the time the nerf made sense. There were few engines and the aerospike outclassed them all. But times have changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RAPIER engine has become a major contender for the role of SSTO engine, something the nerfed aerospike was often used for. Career mode is now the mode to which parts are balanced, instead of sandbox mode, due to the introduction of the tech tree. The playing field has changed completely. The aerospike dangles at the end of the tech tree like an exciting price but its outclassed by most other engines. I think all parts should have some use, even at the end of the tech tree, but at the moment I find too few uses for the aerospike. This is why I think a change is in order.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment the aerospike has three clear disadvantages and one advantage. The advantage is that its atmospheric and vacuum Isp are high and nearly identical. This makes it an ideal engine for launches in an atmosphere. The disadvantages are a lack of thrust vectoring, a lower thrust-to-weight-ratio and the inability to stack it. I think the best way to make the aerospike more useful would be to add a thrust vectoring capability to the engine. The whole point of the aerospike is its efficiency in all layers of an atmosphere, but without thrust vectoring controlling a aerospike is difficult. Control surfaces are a solution, but are generally not enough to control large rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving aerospikes thrust vectoring (which they have IRL) would make it more useful for atmospheric flight, but with the other disadvantages still in place it wouldn\u0027t be OP. Stackability is sometimes necessary, as is higher thrust-to-weight-ratio, meaning engines like the T-30 or T-45 still have a role even after the aerospike is unlocked at the end of the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T12:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is a niche design and you described this niche it quite well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T12:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather see stackability added than thrust vectoring.

The design philosophy behind it is solid: Its excellent efficiency in atmosphere is unique among KSP rocket engines, but it has more mass and less thrust than engines like the LV-T30 to balance it. In addition, it lacks thrust vectoring, which encourages the use of control surfaces. Because of this, its easy to see that the Aerospike is intended to be used in a planetary atmosphere, rather than in a vacuum (where the LV-N, LV-T30, 48-7S, ect. outclass it). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay then, which atmospheres can I effectively use it in? In KSP there are 5 celestial bodies that have atmospheres: Kerbin, Eve, Duna, Laythe, and Jool. Lets address Kerbin and Laythe first. As you all know, these two planets have atmospheres than contain oxygen, which means jet engines can function in them. When it comes to efficiency and thrust, both turbo jets and RAPIER engines COMPLETELY outclass the Aerospike. Turbo jets offer raw power for their mass and RAPIER engines can switch between air breathing and LFO to work outside the atmosphere. Therefore, there is no reason to use the Aerospike in Kerbin or Laythe\u0027s atmosphere since it has no advantage over the air breathing engines. Okay, that just leaves the oxygen-less atmospheres of Eve, Duna, and Jool as possible places to use an Aerospike. However, the atmosphere of Duna is so thin that rocket engines like the LV-N Atomic Motor and 48-7S can function at almost peak efficiency at most altitudes. Duna also has a very low surface gravity, which means that the almighty LV-N is a viable engine there. Once again, the Aerospike is simply outclassed. So that leaves Eve and Jool. Heck, there is little to no practical reason to actually fly around Jool so while the Aerospike may be somewhat useful there, its not going to see much use there (flying into gas giants is not recommenced). That just leaves Eve. Only here, does the Aerospike truly shine. While all the other engines get smothered in Eve\u0027s oppressive atmosphere, the Aerospike functions at an amazing 388 ISP. With this efficiency, it makes up for its decent thrust by allowing you to take less fuel than if you were using a different engine, which ultimately means that you get a higher Eve TWR with more atmospheric Delta V. Eve is the place that the Aerospike was designed for: an oxygen-less atmosphere that is thick enough to minimize the effectiveness of all the alternative rocket engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is for these reasons that many people find the Aerospike useless. It is not necessarily under-powered, its just a niche engine that only happens to be useful in one atmosphere (well two, if you count Jool).

But its TWR is quite a bit worse than the LVT-30 (17.533), and even the LV-T45 (13.592); this kind of makes sense as they are more inefficient engines, so should have the higher TWR.

Giving it thrust vectoring does little; it could make it slightly more useful as a launcher engine (the Aerospike is pretty much the most mass and fuel efficient engine for taking payloads of up to 20t to high altitude with a TWR of 1-1.8 on Kerbin, which is actually quite important), but it\u0027s not really significant. You have to be really careful messing with TWR, as just lowering its weight to 1.25t makes its TWR shoot up to 14.271, which is higher than the LV-T45, which isn\u0027t good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose adding thrust vectoring and stacking would make the most sense....
