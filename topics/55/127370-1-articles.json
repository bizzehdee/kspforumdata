Therefore in theory it should be able to run thermal physics on a separate thread, increasing the use of multiple cores, post version 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDiscussion please.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-09T10:50:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2015 10:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T11:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJoints, collisions and similar physics items are handled by the PhysX engine and Unity5 claims to be able to run every individual physics gameobject in its own \u0022task\u0022, whatever that is, so I assume it can bunch tasks and distribute them across cores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thermal code isn\u0027t a Unity physics object so doesn\u0027t benefit from PhysX at all, but with physics more evenly distributed there should be more cpu time free on whatever core Unity is currently using for the orbital and thermal code (i.e Squads stuff)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d be interesting to know if Unity is capable of deferring the developers code to other cores, like it can do with the sound, input and similar, or if it all has to run in a main thread, I don\u0027t think this question has ever come up before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
