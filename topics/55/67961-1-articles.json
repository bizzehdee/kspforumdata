Either remove that part or let us go above 100%. Overpowering the engine should produce vastly more heat which limits the duration to 1? minute. This needs tweaking of all engines as some are really cool and other are already in the red zone at 100% (ie. the LV-N).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUI and nav ball:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Let us change the position of the UI elements. The nav ball often is in the way when landing but needs to stay open. I would also like to be able to move the altimeter down near the nav ball. In crucial situations I have to look up and down all the time. That\u0027s not ergonomic and drives me crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would like to see sharper indicators on the nav ball. I would like to have them semi-transparent, too. I have the nav ball scaled up to the second largest setting and the indicators are fuzzy. If there are several indicators overlapping each other I have problems orienting myself. (worst case: prograde, target, planned maneuver and \u0027cursor\u0027 [don\u0027t know the name of that \u0027wing thing\u0027 in the center])\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is an altitude change meter. I want additional ones for the to horizontal axes. It will greatly help for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There is a bug in the stage view. It sometimes doesn\u0027t group parts right when using symmetry, one isn\u0027t in the group. The bug is around for ages - it\u0027s time to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The stage view can get very long on complex rockets. Is there a better way to visualize this? I have no idea how to improve it but I don\u0027t like the current one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T02:32:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 02:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by *Aqua*\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
