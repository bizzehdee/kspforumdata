Full KSP doesn\u0027t really make sense for interface and performance reasons.\n\nTechnically, if you want to play mobile KSP you could get one of those cheap 7\u0022 or 8\u0022 windows tablets (HP has one for $100) and run it on there. I can\u0027t imagine that it would have all that great of performance, and a pure touch interface would be frustrating to play with (although I have seen some interface mods as well that put some basic controls on the screen).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T16:56:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 04:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"}]}
