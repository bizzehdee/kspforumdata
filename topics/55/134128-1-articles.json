There isn\u0027t one bit of any form a positivity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad is taking their time, because it\u0027s a massive update. This isn\u0027t like any previous update, in fact this is bigger than the release of 1.0, because they have to work with a brand new updated game engine. They have to make sure that everything works as it did, which may mean dumping old files and possibly replacing them, they may have to upgrade them, or any number of things. Not to mention, they also have to BUG TEST it for any bugs that existed in previous versions of the game, as well as find new ones they don\u0027t even know about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, keep your problems to yourself. Yes, KSP doesn\u0027t take full advantage of your computer\u0027s resources, but that\u0027s a software issue, not KSP itself. They are planning to fix it, but complaining about it does not make anything go faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to clouds, if I were Squad, the second 1.1 is dropped, I\u0027d openly announce that after hearing all the \u003Cstrong\u003Ecomplaining\u003C/strong\u003E about the lack of clouds, that they would \u003Cu\u003Enever\u003C/u\u003E be implemented. From what I\u0027ve seen (and I only see select corners of this forum, but my 5.7k posts speak for themselves), the majority of the demand for clouds come from \u003Cstrong\u003Edemands or complaints\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Esuggestions or recommendations.

It is because it requires them to make the clouds, and all the programming and such that goes with it. But then they have to make it optional as well as change how many clouds there are. Clouds eat a lot of CPU, and that alone is why they are not added. Your complaining is one reason why they don\u0027t add it. You complain the game barely runs even out of the box, then why do you expect Squad to add something to make it worse? This is again a reason why they would be more likely to push it off the table... until 1.1 rolled around to run with higher memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T01:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222455683\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457910433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137952\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022seyss\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, seyss said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s 2016 and we still don\u0027t have clouds.
