I have figured out a way to get THOUSANDS of science without even going to them moon or setting up a DM magic research station. Basically what you do is commit 20% of your income to reputation, get it really high, then commit 80ish percent (the higher the better) of your rep to sicence, continue rebuilding your rep with your income and once you re-establish it convert that 20 income to rep to science, and viola, 1000\u0027s of science from high profile missions and you never have to leave Kerbin\u0027s orbit. This exploit RUINS the game for me because I am no longer pushed to explore the universe in order to find new science data, I have no incentive to set up orbital research stations, nor do I really have to do any actual research experiments any more because the amount you get from missions is staggeringly high compared to what you would get. Just as a quit example, I did a mission to send a gear bay to orbit around Kerbin and \u0022test it\u0022 in the contextual menu at a certain elevation in orbit, FOR MY EFFORTS I GOT 2000 SCIENCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To fix this MASSIVE exploit, I think getting science from contracts should be REMOVED COMPLETELY! It doesn\u0027t even make sense that you get science through contracts. That\u0027s like being a plumber, but then every once in a while calling in a different plumber to do your job for you and still getting paid for it. How can other organizations on kerbin possibly give you science data when KSP is the only space program on the planet?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T19:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve moved this thread to Suggestions and Development Discussion, where feedback about the game belongs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the game mechanics are currently incomplete, so we can expect that they will be revamped and rebalanced.

I personally find the get-out-and-push enjoyable enough to allow it, but I won\u0027t exploit mechanics for extra science, funds, or rep.
