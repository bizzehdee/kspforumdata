OTOH, I pretty much refuse to take any more site surveys that involve landing on Kerbin--I\u0027m not THAT good at pinpoint landings (especially on the seemingly inevitable \u0022one patch of rough terrain which cannot be seen in Map View when accepting the contract but is Ground Zero for survey completion\u0022) in the few seconds between \u0022you\u0027ve arrived\u0022 and \u0022whoops, you\u0027re leaving\u0022. On the third hand, orbital parameters are laughably loose, and I find myself getting annoyed with the game for announcing contract completion (and erasing the target orbit from Map View!) when I can EYEBALL that I most certainly have NOT achieved the desired orbit yet.
