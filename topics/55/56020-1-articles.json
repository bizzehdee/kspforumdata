Since it always seems to go for the latest trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to suggest the option of creating a list of things on which you might have clicked, after which you can select at which one of them the node appears. I got this idea from Unigraphics NX, in which this option only occurs when you hover with your mouse on one position for a few seconds. This list might also include your closest approach, periapsis, apoapsis, descending and ascending node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: This UI feature might also be useful when building in the VAB of SPH (especially when trying to remove a strut).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T14:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have asked a few times for a menu of clickable items to choose from so that if you have, say, two or three craft/orbits/nodes within a few km of each other, you can select the one you like with ease. Also the same system for selecting parts in the VAB. Same with directly entering numbers into a node. Basically, any time there is more than one option, give the player all of them in a requaster and get them to choose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0060t think anyone has noticed.

However some people might debate over which way would be the best UI to open such a list of options, since it might get annoying to scroll through a list every time you want to create a maneuver node while your choice seems obvious. But I think that hovering with you mouse for a few seconds or double clicking would be good options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way this might also be used for improving the way you can focus your camera in map view, since when in low orbit I currently find that I focus on the celestial body, set target to or switch to another craft, while I wanted to focus back on my active craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
