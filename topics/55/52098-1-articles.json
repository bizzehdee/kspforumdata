If thought of a presure scaling of 2-5 times the value it has right now. Therefore the scaling factor should be lowered to not break existing crafts in a low orbit. Furthermore Jools atmosphere could be altered to not simply stop 100m (?) meter below the \u0022surface\u0022, but to go down several kilometers below there up to a point, where everything overheats (like at Kerbol). By the way, the surface of a gas giant is measured as the level where the pressure exceeds 10bar, so Jool\u0027s zero level isn\u0027t set correctly I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
