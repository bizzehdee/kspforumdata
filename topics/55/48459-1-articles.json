Then give it it\u0027s own minimal propulsion system just to de-orbit it. Recover. Send a new one up and dock it to the lander, and it\u0027s good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I have no idea if this is feasible for your design I just thought it might be kind of cool to do - have a replaceable command pod so that you can recover it and just launch up a new pod with new crew when you want to make a new mission using it. Though it\u0027s unlikely that you will actually -need- maximum science output. If you want to do it for efficiency though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T11:06:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should be made possible to move small experiments about on a crewed craft.
