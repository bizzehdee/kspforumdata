There is a scaling tweak in the game settings screen. Set it to 0 for no wobble at all, or if you\u0027re brave (and very tolerant to motion sickness) set it to \u003E1.\n\u003E In any case, this isn\u0027t a gratuitous shaky-cam effect. The camera isn\u0027t going to be constantly wobbling about just for show. The movement is always based on something, like pulling Gs, or atmospheric flight at very high speeds.\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers\n\nNo worries, you will get that and even more.\n\nYou may get used to it after a while too, I really liked KerbQuake.\n\nI think the quote above should have been added to the blog itself."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T15:32:02Z","Content":"I always intended to install Kerbquake! such a fantastic idea...until I realized that I never really use the IVA very much when doing maneuvers/launch!"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T15:36:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s just few lines of code to make it toggleable, it will not influence at all the performance.
