This should happen in the background but it doesnt resulting in destruction/damage of your spacecraft. I believe the small struts just have unappropriate collision boxes but this is \u0022just\u0022 an esthetic issue and \u0022harmless\u0022... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be happy to see 0.21.2 bugfixing release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
