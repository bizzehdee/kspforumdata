Like they could attach a rope to one point, then fix it to another part of the ship. Then by right clicking the rope you can make it become rigid at the cost of some electric charge. The Kerbals would get a limited number supplied in a \u0022parts\u0022 part like the monopropellant tank, but with struts in it instead. The struts could also be severed at a click of a button much like parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T19:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested on numerous occasions. I am sure the devs are aware of this request. In the past it has been modded a few times too: Docking Strut, Quantum Strut and Kerbal Attachment System. The first two are abandoned and won\u0027t work in 0.23. KAS however does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
