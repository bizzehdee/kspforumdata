It also means that the data shown on the map represents what is actually known about the terrain.

With the exception of some variation in ground scatter (which I\u0027m not entirely sure isn\u0027t a bug anyway), every pixel of every planet you land on will be exactly the same every time. You will get the same science readings at every spot every time. Mistakes aside, pretty much every planetary landing is the same. The issue is that we are never uncovering anything truly\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E, just things that have been pre-placed by the developers. Truly interesting and \u003Cem\u003Eexploratory\u003C/em\u003E gameplay occurs when the unexpected occurs.\u00A0If you\u0027ve visited Duna once, there\u0027s very little reason to go back there, because (poles excepted) it is pretty much the same wherever you land.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we need isn\u0027t just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emore things\u003C/em\u003E, it\u0027s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edifferent things\u003C/em\u003E, and things that are different with every game. In an ideal world I would suggest that each new save would result in a completely procedurally generated solar system (with perhaps Kerbin itself excluded), but I find it unlikely that that\u0027ll ever happen. Instead, I think the practical solution to the planetary exploration problem is to have every planet be procedural\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eto a degree\u003C/em\u003E. Perhaps the overall topology\u00A0is pre-defined, but each time you play, a certain set of attributes is randomly adjusted for each planet.\u00A0These attributes could include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSize/mass/surface gravity\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAtmospheric density\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTemperature\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWeather (including cloud cover, which would hide the planet surface necessitating mapping probes)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHave some degree of texture/colour variation\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOrbit (maybe Moho is suddenly furthest from the Sun and Eeloo is closest) and placement of moon(s)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSurface type (e.g. sand, rock, mud, lava flow) - this variation should occur at a small enough scale that rovers could easily visit 2-3 different terrain types in one mission\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCratering\u00A0(dependent on atmospheric density)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTerrain scatter (is it flat and barren or are there clumps of deadly sharp rocks that make landing a real challenge?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSemi-random procedural surface features (implemented in the same way as craters currently are) e.g. canyons, mesas, sand dunes etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nImportantly, all of these things should be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elinked together\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0so that there is a logic to them, and should reflect the scientific readings you can obtain.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat needs to be set up is a system which makes\u00A0exploration not a boring task (go here -\u0026gt; take sample -\u0026gt; come home) but something interesting, rewarding and vital to the success of your space program.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach new game would bring a new surprise. Perhaps you arrive at Duna to find\u00A0vast oceans and a thick atmosphere; maybe Eve is dry, cratered and barren. Different locations on planets should come with different surface features and different hazards; perhaps your lander may slip and fall in sand dunes, or get stuck in a muddy area, or be vulnerable of tipping over on an exposed hillside if there are high winds. This would require proper exploration before any serious manned missions; sending first a probe to scout for landing sites and check out the overall features of the planet (Is this planet big? Does it have an atmosphere? What\u0027s the surface temperature like? Where is the flat ground?) before deploying unmanned landers to check out landing sites. Only then would you be able to send a manned mission, safe in the knowledge that you are coming down in a place that isn\u0027t going to instantly kill you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore thought needs to be put into this to make it workable, but I\u0027m pretty sure that the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E way of making surface exploration interesting beyond the first time you visit each place is some degree of randomisation.
