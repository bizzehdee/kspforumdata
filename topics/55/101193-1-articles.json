My opinion is yes.\n\nHowever, That depends on what SpaceX wants to do. KSP is a for profit game so it is not as easy as Elon tweeting \u0022yes!\u0022 There would have to be a agreement for the right to use the IP. There is also the fact that KSP gives you no real reason to use a space station right now. Removing most of the need to use a Dragon capsule in the first place.\n\nAlso you have to think about balance issues. SpaceX exists to provide a cheaper alternative to big government rockets. Yet if you make them cheaper to use in KSP. They can break the balance of the game.\n\nThen you have technical problems. Like manned pods not being able to have built in RCS yet. The draco and superdracos are not simple bolt on parts. They are built into the design and leaving them out would mess up the entire design."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T03:49:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would much rather have a POCKOCMOC pack, mainly for a Soyuz-alike.
