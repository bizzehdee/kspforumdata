In a nutshell, KSC would concentrate more on spaceplanes, solar panels, manned exploration, big, powerful rockets, and more and more cockpit-like flying experience for kerbonauts, while the other space program would be focused on reusable rockets, developing better autonomous robotic spacecraft with advanced A.I., advanced RTGs for power generation, smaller rockets, and more nuclear engines and parts for travel in vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you land a Kerbal on enemy territory, he will be taken hostage, and you would have to bribe him out by offering money, research, space samples or technology to the rival space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there would be no weapons, no war and stuff just a semi-peaceful space race.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fatfluffycat","CreatedById":73913,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T14:26:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about NO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey said they wouldn\u0027t make a rival space program( I heard it from somewhere, but I forgot)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"szputnyik","CreatedById":84032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T14:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t find it on the \u0022Don\u0027t ask\u0022 list, just that there would be no weapons and war.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T16:06:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Devs said multiple times, no.
