What madness is this? Whose daughter did he insult?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI therefore humbly suggest a \u0022Boss Effect Field\u0022 that lets a high level kerbal \u0022Manage\u0022 other kerbals; sufficiently advanced Kerbals should be able to generate an area of effect, allowing nearby Kerbals of similar profession to operate at -1 the manager\u0027s rank. The effect should be at most 15 kilometers (without telepresence and teleberating technology), decreasing in effect proportional to distance, and their active radius should increase proportional to their rank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this manner, our 5-star engineer could lounge behind a desk in a lander can while the younglings stationed at his base reflect his years of experience, through the delicate art of ore drilling, and a L2 engineer would be able to tell a L0 engineer how to go outside of their pod to repack the parachutes on the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-02T10:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, the whole experience thing always bothered me. The stars should \u00A0represent the number of missions/time spent in space, not give some special powers. An engineer should always be able to operate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E no matter if he/she is a rookie or a pro. What kind of agency sends untrained astronauts into space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t hate the idea though. What I think could be better instead is this \u0022Boss/Commander\u0022 class kerbal having the ability to manage a base/station he is in more efficiently. Kind of like the engineers do now with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E. For example: if a station is in orbit of Laythe and it has solar panels, probe cores and batteries the Commander\u00A0should be able reroute all the power to the batteries\u00A0to save EC and the more crew he has the more EC they are able to store for future use, or something like that. Or balance it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to match it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E, or maybe even change the way antennae work (lower bandwidth, but less EC per bit/mit/whatever it\u0027s called).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut not mess with the fuel that way.
