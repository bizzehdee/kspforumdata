We take our prejudices with us into the laboratory and the workshop. When we have to work with women scientists and engineers, we condescend, we harrass, we insult. We do all we can to drive them out. There are individuals who don\u0027t. But, collectively, our gender needs to grow up. If adding Female Kerbals to KSP helps us grow up a bit, to start seeing women scientists and engineers as colleagues worthy of respect, then let them be added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguments that adding Female Kerbals will \u0022break the game\u0022 are, bluntly, false.

I saw that argument \u0022women have it harder\u0022 trew around a lot of time without any solid base, and I take it as a personal insult, as I work in a STEM field. I don\u0027t insult and harrass people in my work for their gender and I can assure you that women are treathed equally in most places and don\u0027t experience any extra difficulty than males; females professors exist, and have existed for a long time, as the person who implemented Apollo flight computer software was a girl, for example. Maybe you are one of the guy that think Dr. Matt Taylor was a terrible sexist pig because he had a shirt during rosetta/philiae landing (made by her female friend) that some random \u0022intellectual\u0022 found offensive, while seroius women where in the control room coordinating the mission. Our gender is mature as the opposite one. Women can be sexists, and men can get an harsh unfair treatment in work as well in the form of less support, as they are seen by gender stereotypes as strong and emotionless. So I would say that you are the sexiest one here, as you paint the opposite ... as beings in dire need of help, oppressed by a stronger force, when that isn\u0027t really the case. We\u0027re all human and we share all the fault and the virtues, just in different forms. Last but not least, gender bias in workfields exists on biological bases, and while it\u0027s bad to invoke those stereotypes to exclude a person from a place, it\u0027s also wrong to use them to stigmatize the opposing group. But this is more for the science lounge. If someone is intrested in sexual dimorphism in the brain and human behaviuor, make a thread and I\u0027ll give some you some papers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.female kerbals don\u0027t break the game, they are uncomfortable because they bring gender in a game where there wasn\u0027t ANY. Kerbals where mostly male because most of ksp player seems to be male and there was a certain degree of self identification, the default pronoun in english is the male one and they had mostly male names. Wanted a quick way to add females in? Just add to the config some female names, leaving things gray. And last, Max started hyping up this feature like it was something important, while my main gripe is exactly your point: it doesn\u0027t subtract from the game, but it doesn\u0027t add anything really either. It would have been better if they had showed the feature like the aero overhaul or resources, just presenting it to the community.

I\u0027m looking forward to this so much; it should have been done months if not years ago. I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing a variety of hairstyles and shades of green for skintone as well. The notion of kerbals gaining experience and having different careers leads nicely into the notion that kerbals can look different. We humans often tend to think in terms of faces; I for one would find it easier to remember \u0022The light green one with medium brown hair is the pilot, the dark green one with blue pigtails is the scientist, and the medium green one with the purple mohawk is the engineer\u0022 than \u0022Jefdan is the pilot, Kirmok is the scientist, and Bikbot is the engineer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the claim that kerbals are a single-gender race: yes, at the moment they are, and that gender is clearly male. The default kerbalnaut model has a haircut and jawline that are associated with maleness (in modern western culture, at least); the associated specialists at the space center are generally wearing male-associated clothing, they have male-associated names, and some have facial hair.

I\u0027d love to see improved aerodynamics and n-body simulation and Lagrange points and procedural landing gear and Rockomax-sized xenon tanks. But the addition of female kerbals isn\u0027t preventing that. Believe it or not, it is possible for the developers to work on more than one project at a time.

I would say that they are another misstep of Squad, at this point. The kerbals from most of us are the ones in the suits, and they don\u0027t look particularly manly to me. The jaw line is mostly due to the whole face shape, and females have short hair when working as astrounauts (see Samantha Cristoforetti).

The \u0022torso\u0022 of a Kerbal is little more than a muscular foot featuring one or two pairs of tentacles. Kerbals possess no bones, and their bodies being adapted to a marine environment, they suffer negligible muscle degeneration from being in space and are able to survive extreme G-forces. As they live underwater, Kerbals have built very few structures on land - rather the majority of their cities are hidden deep in Kerbin\u0027s oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike crabs and several other marine invertebrates, Kerbals are able to survive and breathe on land as long as they keep themselves well-hydrated, but whenever they go outside it is necessary to wear protective suits to prevent drying out. A side effect of the suits is that they restrict movement, preventing the Kerbals from extending their tentacles freely but still allowing them to manipulate objects and operate machinery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the space program only employs male Kerbals due to physical limitations: male Kerbals possess a second pair of tentacles, which originally developed for use during mating, similar to the claw on the back end of an earwig. Female Kerbals, on the other hand, only have two tentacles. In the water, unrestricted by gravity, this is no problem for them, but on land this prevents them from performing tasks such as carrying rocket parts, using a notepad, etc. Presumably work is being done to develop artificial limbs for female Kerbals so that someday soon they too can explore the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nitrous Oxide","CreatedById":131998,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T03:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ekerbals are our little green aliens, so why not this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause political correctness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spidersVise","CreatedById":113944,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T03:05:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t care for that theory(read: really dislike), but at the same time I\u0027d love a pair of robot arms to be on the lady Kerb I\u0027d use for friggin\u0027 all of my missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
