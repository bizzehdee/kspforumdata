I don\u0027t really know how the sextant works, and would welcome the learning challenge \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Would it be possible to take readings and calculate approximate orbital parameters based on how accurate you are? Perhaps a small control panel where you enter the angles and times you record and it displays orbital predictions? For those of us who like flying realistically, it might be pretty cool to only have an approximate orbit, and not really be certain of it, and to refine the predictions as you approach the Mun/space station or whatever... seeing where you are on the map is all very nice, but I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s more exciting and challenging when you are taking readings and estimations only..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions welcome, please! Could this work in game and be fun and educational?
