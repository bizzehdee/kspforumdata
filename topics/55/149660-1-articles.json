Switching to every single part laying around a ground base that is in construction is very annoying. Using a mod like \u0022Vessel Switcher\u0022 makes picking individual Kerbals more easy, still its selection list is cluttered with uncontrollable parts as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martian Emigrant","CreatedById":158362,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T21:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there \u0027s a real reason.

As well as flags, which may be useful as camera positions, but in a lot of situations you don\u0027t want to switch to inert objects like\u00A0flags or debris. They have no way of interacting with the outside world, so what\u0027s the point?
