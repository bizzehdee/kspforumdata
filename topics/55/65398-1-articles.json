That is to say, the player can command any inactive Kerbonauts (e.g., ones they\u0027re not controlling) to be \u0027at ease\u0027, wherein they will wander around and perform little random duty animations, like scratching their bottoms or checking their note pads. Alternately, the player can give a \u0027follow\u0027 command (which does exactly what it sounds like) or a \u0027stay tight\u0027 command, wherein the Kerbal stands still, in situations like, for instance, being on a cliff or in a very low orbit EVA. They should also have a \u0027board nearest\u0027 command, where all the Kerbs on active EVA will move to the closest available pod and get inside.

It breathes life into the little chaps, adding huge amounts of character for little additional effort. I think that a radius from the point where they were last controlled by the player based on Stupidity/Courage is a good idea. They\u0027re then free to roam. Give them a few animations - note taking, photos, sample taking, rearranging kit, etc and suddenly you have something pretty good. You could link the animations to stupidity levels; the brighter Kerbals taking samples and notes, whilst the thicker ones... jumping up and down on the spot in low gravity, waving at each other, trying to pick their noses through their helmet visors etc. It gives the individuals character beyond how much they scream on takeoff!
