It has two functions. The first is that it can analyze experiment results and instrument reports to decrease the amount of science lost if you transmit the results/reports. The second is that with the goo canisters and materials science bay, if you don\u0027t discard the results, you can\u0027t run the experiment again. The lab module lets you reset those two science parts so that you can repeat the experiment after transmitting or moving them to alternate storage, in the same biome/location or a different one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals in EVA can take the results from a capsule or science part and store them in a (different) capsule, with some limits. Basically, there is some restriction on storing experiment results of the same type in the same capsule. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s experiment-per-biome similar to EVA reports, or experiment type regardless of biome similar to crew reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-13T19:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that is more for recovering science from a crashed/disabled ship.
