I accepted it because it looked like a nice challenge, and finally managed to complete it after lots of trying and quickloading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither I did something wrong, or this is WAAAY more difficult than, say, planting a flag on Minmus which yielded more money and reputation. I think the reward for this recovery contract should probably be a lot higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecover a module from the surface of the Mun:\u00A0advance 81,237, completion\u00A0185,595, and 16 reputation stars\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply planting a flag on Minmus (anywhere at all): advance 79,875, completion\u00A0199,375\u00A0and 16 stars as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you start out, you don\u0027t even know what you will be recovering, you have to fly over and look. It turned out to be a Swivel engine standing upright in the middle of nowhere. So I flew there with a rocket that had a last stage consisting of a brown fuel tank, eight thuds near the top (to avoid blowing away the module), a claw at the bottom, and RCS thrusters. I first had to navigate to the precise location, come down, hover in the vicinity of the module, with the nose perfectly up (without mods like Mechjeb\u0027s SmartASS), then used RCS to move over the module. Positioning had\u00A0to be extremely precise, this is much harder than docking because of the gravity. I viewed the rocket from such an angle that I could see\u00A0the left/right position and height directly, and used the shadow on\u00A0the ground to judge forward/aft. If I wasn\u0027t precisely above the thing before trying to pick it up, the claw wouldn\u0027t engage\u00A0and the module would just fall over. In fact I almost gave up because I thought the claw would never pick up such an item. But finally it latched on after dozens of quickloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I had just enough fuel left over to make it into Mun orbit, so I launched a refueling mission to dock with the first one to refuel. Fortunately I had thought of including a docking port.\u00A0Then I had to get the module back to Kerbin without burning it up on reentry. Used a very shallow reentry with retrograde burning keeping things just below overheat\u00A0until I could deploy the chutes. I guess I could have transfered the engine to a different craft with the claw at the top and a heat shield at the bottom, or I could have started out with a heat shield at the top of my initial rocket, but anyway, I made it down in one piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s certainly doable, but the reward should have been way higher than for a simple Minmus landing which I normally get right on the first try. Picking up that Swivel engine took dozens of attempts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is there some sort of easier method that I missed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T12:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out munar marooned but yes I agree it should pay much better\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T12:52:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222527562\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022137585\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461238172\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157405\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022michelcolman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, michelcolman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is there some sort of easier method that I missed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have done the exact same thing pretty much.\u00A0 The only thing I\u0027d change is probably the size, your craft sounds huge and overkill-y.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Also, the person offering the contract should really just buy a new swivel for 1.2k instead of wasting 200k getting a used one heh)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-21T14:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts fairly easy to make a rover that can achieve Mun-orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction group some 24-77s radial engines facing down just in front of the claw (the contract should tell you the mass of the item).
