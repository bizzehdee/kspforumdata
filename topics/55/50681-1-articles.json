So last time i was flying around Kerbin with my Spaceplane and in Map View i noticed, that planes are displayed with the capsule icon. I play KSP since 1 Year now and as far as i know Planes have been a feature before docking port and therefore space stations. So why is there no icon for it? I guess it\u0027s something really small to change but it would be really nice since there are a lot of people (including me) that use spaceplanes a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-26T20:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore icons in the rename dialogue would be great, I personally want \u0022Satellite\u0022 as a separate type to \u0022Probe\u0022, and perhaps also a distinction between probe orbiters and probe landers.
