I created this trhead to comment and suggest easter eggs for add to the game. I don\u0027t know if Squad wants to add any new easter egg, but I think that this could be interesting, so my intention is make this thread for a brainstorming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI start:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably read or heard some about Arthur C. Clarke\u0027s book \u0022Rendezvous with Rama\u0022. I think tah this book is a work of art for any who likes space science fiction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is a \u0022little\u0022 Rama (scale 1:3 (13 kilometres large, 3 wide) , 1:4 (10 kilometres large, 2.5 wide) or 1:1 (40 kilometres large, 10 wide)) in orbit around a planet (or moon). The game should recognize it as an asteroid or a little moon. (or didn\u0027t recognize it, if you saw an object of 10 kilometres in orbit of a planet and doesn\u0027t appear in the orbit map, you should investigate it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Rama, in Arthur C. Clarke\u0027s novel hasn\u0027t got any hall mark and alll it\u0027s surface is uniform (except for trhee little mountains in the north pole), i don\u0027t think that make this could supose much effort than another easter egg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA greeting and thanks to Squad for the excellent work that they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS1: Sorry for my horrible English.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS2: Did the game will be translated to Spanish?

To be honest I prefer it to the 2001 series.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this was put in, you\u0027d need to be able to enter the craft (at least I\u0027d be dissapointed if you couldn\u0027t.)
