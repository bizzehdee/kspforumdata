I\u0027m not really using several of the newer tools like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E indicators or maneuver node editor. I\u0027ve been sticking with the tools I had that did the job better, IMO. My biggest problem with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E indicators is they are in the bottom corner where I don\u0027t normally look while flying.

I played with the maneuver node editor once, and went back to using the one in MechJeb as its something I\u0027m already used to using.
