He really wants a KSP tee shirt. Actually alot of his friends do, as a bunch of us dads are all players of KSP. I\u0027ve been nagged, hounded and begged for one. You\u0027ve never seen a kid so addicted. Between KSP and Minecraft, my son has became an honorary engineer. He builds constantly, it stimulates his creative process to a whole new level. He\u0027s even been sharper and been doing alot better in school. This all started from him WATCHING me play ksp. So for his birthday his mother and I have some gifts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis own copy of KSP on Steam and a 3D printed Jeb, kerbin, and other various 3d prints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut he really wants some apparel, and we\u0027d love to get him some. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s the question squad. Will you hook our kids up with some KSP apparel? If its not possible, where can I send a check to have a local shop make one for me? Because I\u0027d be more than happy to send the $30 to you guys to make his birthday a special one. He\u0027s a T-6 shirt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Dad would like a bumper sticker and coffee mug that says \u0022Mun or Bust!\u0022 in the cafe press shop.
