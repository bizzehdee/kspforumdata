One thing I do worry about is the mission planner estimating based on optimum transfers and then the player hitting an intercept that runs long or needs an inclination correction and getting frustrated when they run out of fuel or LS. I mean it\u0027s just as bad now with us having to guess but I feel like if the game tells you one thing and it doesn\u0027t work that would be a problem. Maybe all it needs is a safety margin field. A lot of the fun of the game is doing Apollo 13 when things go wrong. If the planner is just an estimator unlinked from actual active flights it seems kind of limited, so I\u0027m wondering if the flight plan might not be able to update based on how a mission progresses?

All of that is great and in the early carreer you really should have very little information and be encouraged to experiment. But later in the game as things progress and players mount more and more difficult missions I really do think being aided with better information gives players the ability to make \u003Cem\u003Ebetter guesses\u003C/em\u003E and reduces repetitiveness and grind. The wiki helps, and the engineer report is a step in the right direction, but we should really be able to just play the game without having to go to online dV maps and transfer calculators. I think that\u0027s true now, and would become even more important if LS was included. Like dV, LS is one of those things you want to estimate before you launch. This is hard because so much complexity is possible in ship design, but the good news is there\u0027s a limited number of bodies to explore. So really an estimator only has to produce 2 numbers: Mission time and delta V. If dV and LS days are calculated in the VAB then you don\u0027t actually need to enter things like occupant number and payload in the planner; you should be able to just select a starting body and target body from a pair of drop downs and see:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimum days until next transfer window: x [set alarm]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptimum days until intercept: x [set alarm]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV to orbit [100km]: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV to circularize: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV to transfer: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV to capture [100km]: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV to surface: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etotal dV: x\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can repeat this this for the return and pretty easily see what your total mission dV and optimum mission time would be.
