Because of this, you could be in a defined large\u00A0orbit around\u00A0a comet\u00A0when it\u0027s far away from the Sun, but when it comes closer, you\u0027d continue your way on an independent solar orbit.\u00A0(In extreme cases, if the body approaches too close, it\u0027s not even holding its shape - it\u0027s smearing along its orbit,\u00A0coming apart.
