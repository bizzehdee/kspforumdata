Squad knew that it was difficult and so they took their time (A little less than a year after 1.0) and released it. 1.0.5 as well added parts that made aircraft much better, and helped make many more possibilities for a space game.\u00A0For all I know, that 11 months consumed making 1.1, 1.0.5, 1.0.4, 1.0.3, 1.0.2 and 1.0.1\u00A0could have been used to fix career mode, add a DV Readout, work on the demo version more, and expand rocketry. I guess with that logic, Squad should have never added career mode to work on the things Sandbox needs, and should not have introduced a whole new set of problems with the game to fix. Right? Right??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also,\u00A0you know what else had too many ways to go wrong?\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E1.1.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0It was porting from one engine to another, and it could be argued that it was one hell of a risky move. If you decide to dismiss an idea just because too many things could go wrong, well, that\u0027s gonna get you nowhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor all I know, aerodynamics was also risky because it made calculations far more complex, and made the launch phase of a flight somewhat harder which some might not like either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it is true that it would be a crappy idea to start working on multiplayer\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enow,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebut there will be a time that\u0027s ripe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, AlamoVampire, if you are so against multiplayer, what about the people who both share a common love for KSP and want to\u00A0play together? Hmm? It could be argued that you could just install a mod, but that doesn\u0027t mean you should remove a possibility from the stock game. And once again, as Alshain said, if you do not want to have anything to do with it, don\u0027t have anything to do with it. Don\u0027t play multiplayer. It\u0027s that simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the argument for it being a total ****storm with trolls\u00A0is pretty solid, but it doesn\u0027t mean it will definitely happen. For trolls and griefers, as someone said before, comparing it to the way Minecraft ended up is just not fair. Minecraft is a game made for the younger audience (not necessarily meaning the older audience can use it), it\u0027s easy, and it\u0027s trolling potential is really high. Not to mention that among younger audience there tends to be\u00A0the less mature part of the audience who has fun out of ruining someone\u0027s day. KSP is a space simulation game that\u0027s notorious for it\u0027s steep learning curve, has a lot of building involved, and is built around orbital mechanics, aerodynamics and rocketry. Unless you\u0027re referring to aircraft or rockets taking off and being shot down (bdarmory hurr durr), it\u0027s pretty unlikely that someone who comes to the game for the sole purpose of liquiding someone off would be as willing to learn rendezvous, orbital mechanics and how rockets and planes work as much. And even then, there\u0027s always the banhammer, and assuming a system that DMP uses, the victim would have to allow him syncing with his \u0022bubble\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not saying there will be no trolls, but comparing it to something like Minecraft isn\u0027t accurate nor fair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd IMO if KSP would get multiplayer, *maybe* there could be a system where certain players could get into another\u0027s \u0022bubble\u0022 and both of those could play with each other but no one else, or at least no one who they wouldn\u0027t want to see. More and more friends could play together in their own world separate from others without the problem of trolls and griefing.\u00A0Then again, that system has way too many flaws, and I have no idea how a server system works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dills0n","CreatedById":162421,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T17:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222583140\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463326052\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161340\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John JACK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/15/2016 at 8:27 AM, John JACK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are mixing up plain old multiplayer with Free-to-Pay MMOs.

You see, kerbal, runs on your computer. Not on your friends computer or the computer that hosts the multiplayer game. When you time warp on your computer, your personal kerbal program (your client) warps time ahead and makes all the necessary calculations to the present. This does not, however, cause time to warp on other clients, they remain in the past with out calculating the time warp.
