Theres no real need for larger landing legs, as all the dedicated landing engines work well with the large legs right now. Adding larger legs for non landing engines is somewhat redundant. As the main purpose of landing engines is mainly their short size, among other things. So asking for landing legs for the SLS engine is crazy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really need longer legs just use the long pipes to extend the length of the landing legs. If anything the game needs specalized \u0022base\u0022 landing gear like what can be found in B9. Where the gear is super heavy duty, but short designed to keep things from laying on the side and the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i feel with the MK3 upgrades we should get at least 1 larger sized landing gear. The current one can just be spammed, and it works but the main thing i want is higher clearence off the ground and higher impact tollerances at a cost of adding more weight.
