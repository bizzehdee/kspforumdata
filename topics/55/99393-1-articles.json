With the new dimension checks, could the marker be bound to the smallest dimension? (About 10% of the size of this dimension) It would be much more convenient like that, as I can\u0027t see my probes at all sometimes when I check the mass. This would also help with RCS balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther help would come if there were lines or axes protruding from the CoM marker, so that you have better guidance as to where to put objects so that you have balance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T00:22:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently the colored orbs that indicate the Center of _________ are about 1m in diameter. This makes any degree of precision hard to obtain. In coordination with the new engineer reports could we have the size of theses icons scale with zoom, vessel mass, vessel dimensions, or some combination thereof? It doesn\u0027t take a lot of offset on .2 mass unit probe to cause control issues, but trying to center things when the orb is larger than the whole spacecraft is quite a challenge. If the orbs got smaller as you zoomed in then you would have greater control over the precision of part placement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T00:37:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS build aid has a slider for this.
