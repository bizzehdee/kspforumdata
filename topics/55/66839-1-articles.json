I understand why the devs decided not to go with a full 6 degrees of freedom for all players, but it should be an option, especially just to see if I could handle it. If I can dock a spaceship I\u0027m pretty sure I can handle a Kerbal without autocorrections\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T20:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree. It would also be a good idea to fix that thing where if you have your view overtop of your Kerbal he will sometimes spin and fling himself really fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T21:03:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate the eva controls. Just let me control him like a ship.... it would be ever so helpful if i could pitch and yaw and spin the little guys with the keyboard. the mouse doesn\u0027t work for me. it seems dependent on the camera mode. every time i rotate they just flip back around as soon as i use the jet pack. (yes i have gone into settings and turned off lock rotation to camera or whatever that option is). and i didn\u0027t even know the mouse was a control option until i randomly read it online. there\u0027s is nothing in the game to even hint that it would be a mouse control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T21:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the cam controls in EVA need some care for sure. But this is one of those things on the endless to do lists of tiny optimization stuff during game development. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs EVA in general will receive some updates in the future as pointed out by the devs, i guess EVA cam controls will be taken care off, when they turn to EVA in general.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravener","CreatedById":44766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T21:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can aleredy do this, i cant remember how, but there is an option in some config file that allowes you to move kerbals decupled from camera movement. i dont know how you would go about tracking the kerbal again though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T23:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll I want is the Kerbal to be stationary relative to the camera while he tumbles.
