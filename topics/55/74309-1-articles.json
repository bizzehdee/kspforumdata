It would fix many of the problems people are having trying to get everything a more realistic feel (ISP\u0027s, drag, mass, etc....). At least make it an option in the release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo many mods are made to try and mimic real life. Everything needs tweaking in order for this to happen it becomes overwhelming to try to keep all the mods straight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, just my two cents. If you want to keep it 1/10th scale that is your choice but I think full scale should be an OPTION as it would hit a broader audience and it would lead to more realistic craft designs and flights. You, as the Devs, can make it all work in one package that deals with everything so we don\u0027t have to download 15 mods and adjust them all the time. With time warp the distance to other planets doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just love KSP and I want to keep the cartoon feel and great UI but to upscale to 100% size and all that goes with it (RL rocket performance) out of the box would be just perfect!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T16:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebut kerbin isnt meant to represent earth. its meant to be kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fcbayerndm","CreatedById":23444,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T16:32:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately this thread is going to have to be locked because what you\u0027ve suggested is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E list, please refer to that list before making any further suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
