With money, comes cost per part, so what about reusability? Currently, it\u0027s just a role play concept. Until part inventories and money come in, it doesn\u0027t matter. But what happens when it does? Currently, the only actually reusable crafts are spaceplanes (sidenote, this would further the point established in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65054-Space-planes-make-rockets-obsolete\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know you are yelling at your monitor saying I\u0027m wrong, but think about it. If you drop boosters or an entire first stage off a rocket shortly after launch, would it have time to hit the ground before it unloads due to KSP unloading crafts in atmosphere? If you are over 2.5km, it\u0027s a guaranteed no. Even at lower altitudes, it\u0027s unlikely as with the obligatory parachutes (so it lands instead of lithobrakes) it falls at a few meters per second. You, in the rocket, are climbing at hundreds of meters per second. The fact is, the game does not facilitate proper reusability on rockets. When money comes around, is it worth it to make reusable launchers? In the current meta, the answer is no. Parachutes cost more than stock nose cones and do not provide the same minimal stabilities the nose cones do. Why should I waste the money on them if they will unload and read as destroyed before they safely touch down?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShare thoughts, I\u0027m curious to see other opinions on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T22:40:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game could implement some sort of re-useability aspect in which parts that have parachutes that get deleted can be considered recovered, depending on a randomiser or the biome it lands in. Basically, you launch a rocket and you dop some tanks during the gravity turn and they \u0022Land\u0022 in the ocean, and the water biome would have an 80% recovery rate. Say, however, that they \u0022Landed\u0022 in the highlands or mountains? Well then the recovery rate would drop to about 20% and if they landed at or on KSC, it would be around 95 to 100% (Cost of recovery would also be more expensive the further away the part lands, so you may end up recovering half of a part for the same amount as an entire rocket, simply because it landed further away. Of course, there would be minimal or no cost if recovered from KSC.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T00:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDeathsoul097, that is almost the exact same way \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMission Controller\u003C/a\u003E implements reusability.

Now due to the current science system, we have to bring back vast amount of scientific gadgets from each of the biomes (4-6 SC9001s, etc), but those gadgets cannot be paradropped or even disessembled on reentry to decrease the mass to lower the descending speed - because of that f********* atmospheric automatic \u0022recovery\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, there must be some kind of exceptions of this unloading.
