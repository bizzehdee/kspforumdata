Today I was talking to a friend of mine who likes to play ksp, who wished that there is a multiplayer mode, and as he told me, I happened to publish the ideas that emerged from the dialogue with my friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI not only propose different ways to do something, but it would please me to see that the community thinks of my ideas ...\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet\u0027s begin:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngame mode:\u003Cbr\u003E\na game like ksp can be played in various ways, and while it may be the same as in single player but with multiple players, a \u0022space race\u0022 would be\u00A0caused, and if there is something good that can be drawn from the game,is the \u0022Space Cooperation \u0022as I would call it, but the only way to do that is by giving each player a different role, I mean a pilot, an engineer, or a controller, but \u00A0thereby it deprives the player to be in another role, for that we have the following possibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: everyone can build and fly missions but there is no cooperation, I mean competition \u0022unless the players are in agreement among themselves\u0022or playing singleplayer with multiple players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Each player has his role in the space program,a\u00A0\u0022forced cooperation, with the disadvantage that you can not fly because the pilot role is occupied by another player that grabbed that role, you have to build, but among all try to reach a common goal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: my idea, all players are free, but they have roles as a pilot, engineer, or controller .but if a player needs help, you can send a request for help, specify if you need a pilot\u00A0(the requesting player and the accepting player can control the vessel but the first player can cancel the control of the second player if he doesnt help\u00A0(or ruins) something...\u003Cbr\u003E\nengineer request: the player who sends the help request from\u00A0\u00A0engineer can ask a free player to\u00A0build a vessel for you, and when the requesting player\u00A0can, launch it, as if he had built it.both players can modify the design.\u003Cbr\u003E\nrequest control: the player who asks for help from a\u00A0available controller, can see paths, and data that only the controller can, allowing the first to follow nodes already done, or have access to more information, more than that given by the game by itself.also \u00A0that a controller\u00A0can help establish maneuver nodes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsimultaneous rocket launches:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: expect\u00A0that the first player rocket\u00A0to have a safe height, only then can launch the rocket player that was left on hold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: multiple space centers, with all facilities available, no waiting, just each player with his own space center\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: my idea, multiple rocket launch platforms\u00A0(the amount = maximum amount of players), without delay and without creating a space center for each player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimultaneous use of buildings assembly:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1: each player can see his own creation, in the end, assembly buildings are just a GUI itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: my idea, all players can see other creations in progress, I mean if two players go to SPH, and build aircraft, both can see in real time as the other craft\u00A0changes, gets more parts\u00A0or remove parts, which would also allow an option \u0022seeing \u0022 Player Y creation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt requires a small change in the design of SPH and VAB to add numbered platforms (which change according to the number of maximum players), and on them the buildings are, if desired, you can hide the creation of the view of the others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
