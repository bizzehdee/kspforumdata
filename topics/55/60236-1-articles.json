New players (myself very much) quickly ignored the drag value on parts when they realize most parts have the same drag, and those that don\u0027t, seem to have only a small effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suggestion is that we could have a way of seeing where the average drag of our parts is in the editor. This would highlight drag as a design consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first suggestion (which is not so good, as pointed out by ferram4 below) was to use a \u0022Center of Drag\u0022 indicator.

This ties directly in with possible overall improvements to the aerodynamic model in which drag and lift are more realistically calculated based on surface area, but could also be applied using the game mechanics we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-20T14:14:54Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JumpsterG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdated based on ferram4\u0026#039;s feedback\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T19:26:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is a great idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea could be toggleable lines that go through the indicators at 90 degree angles so that you can see thrust-mass indicators evenly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kodiak42","CreatedById":62082,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T20:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you made sure that it wasn\u0027t your center of lift that was in front of your center of mass?

This is coming close to an \u0022Improve Aerodynamics\u0022 thread, but I really just wanted to suggest a way to visualize drag effects in the editor, so regardless of changes in the physics engine, I think the suggestion stands.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T19:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent idea.
