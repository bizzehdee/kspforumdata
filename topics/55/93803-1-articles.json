If you really wanted this, you can just modify a career save with tons of money and full science tree. You get the same results plus some. Throwing in more buttons to choose your KSC building in Sandbox kinda beats the point of sandbox anyways. Its all about flying and building in sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T05:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven so, some people limit themselves in sandbox. Also, the land on Mun with 30 parts and 18 tons limit would be easier to do if the KSC you were using was limited. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, the devs put a lot of work into these buildings. I wouldn\u0027t mind being able to choose which one so I can admire it. To be honest, I was actually expecting this to be a feature in 0.90, it just seems like an obvious choice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
