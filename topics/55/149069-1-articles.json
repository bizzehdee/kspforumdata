The alignment wasn\u0027t right, so I changed course and went to Eve. It\u0027ll take several hundred days to get there, an annoying amount of time to do in even the fastest timewarp. So I\u0027m proposing being able to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eskip\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Etime to certain points. Like, say, skip to Eve encounter. Or skip to the closest approach with your space station, or whatever.

I have left a few missions behind on old saves due to the time required to sit through even a max time warp making it take more time than I had available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game can already calculate the on-rails trajectories and even show how much time it will take to get to a certain point in the orbit (maneuver nodes do this). So the code could simply assume its projection accurate and simply skip all craft ahead x time on their respective projected orbits even correcting across any \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E changes. Of course if any of the craft have a projected periapsis too near a planetary body before the chosen time, there should be a message and it should disallow, just like the existing time warp slows or stops when that happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if we accept that such a time skip would come with some inevitable loss of accuracy compared to regular time warp, it could be an acceptable trade off in some circumstances (and would make testing and \u0027simulating\u0027 certain interplanetary missions a lot easier/less off-putting).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-01T15:47:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2016 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emy typing accuracy also decreases when it goes faster...\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
