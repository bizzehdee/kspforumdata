In War Thunder, because you are flying around a lot, fuel can become a concern if you get good enough to survive for a while and realise that you \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E have enough fuel to last the whole 10 minute gametime... or what usually happens is people run out of ammunition, and either way have to learn how to land at an airfield to refuel and re-arm.
