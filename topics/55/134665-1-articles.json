It can be quite difficult to rotate a large ship in such a way that some specific science item, near the top and far away from the center of mass, comes into view. To make the rocket rotate one way, sometimes you have to use the right arrow, sometimes the up arrow, and then when you almost reach the desired angle, rotation stops because the camera reached gimbal lock and you have to rotate 180 degrees right and then down again, looking at everything upside down but at least hopefully getting to see the item you wanted. And you get different results depending on the camera mode (\u0022free\u0022(?), \u0022chase\u0022, \u0022orbit\u0022,...) but never really quite the one you wanted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it be at all possible to make a gimbal-less camera that just rotates left and right when you use the left/right arrows, and up/down when you use the up/down arrow? And rotate around the center of the screen either with a modifier key or by pressing two arrows together (up\u002Bdown = clockwise, left\u002Bright = counterclockwise or something like that). Basically, at any given time, pretend the gimbal axis is going up/down on the screen. It would make it so much easier to move the camera!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd maybe \u0022free\u0022 should be called \u0022planet\u0022 or something like that, because \u0022free\u0022 doesn\u0027t quite describe it. And you could add a \u0022ship\u0022 one that is relative to the fixed axis of the ship instead of its direction of motion (\u0022chase\u0022). In fact, just that last suggestion would already solve a lot of my problems. When you\u0027re in space and want to conduct experiments, there should be a fixed camera gimbal that always looks at the rocket in the same way no matter which way it\u0027s going, which way it\u0027s pointing, or which orbit it\u0027s in. Top = capsule, bottom = engines. Pretty please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(BTW I know you can move the camera using the middle mouse button, but I don\u0027t have a middle mouse button and anyway an easier way of rotating the camera would still be welcome in any case)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMichel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T15:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not entirely sure I understand what you mean by \u0022gimbal-less camera.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there is a \u0022Locked\u0022 mode, which orients the camera to the fixed axis of the ship (as you describe toward the end). This orientation is my preferred setup for docking, because the up/down/left/right RCS motions match up with the camera view, and with the navball.

Not the most intuitive one for a rocket (full up shows one side of the rocket, full down shows the other side, so to look at the top you have to aim somewhere in between and then rotate until the top is at the top) but at least it doesn\u0027t move about while you\u0027re flying by a planet. So I guess that part is\u00A0almost OK, I just wish they\u0027d picked a different axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith gimbal-less, I mean that it shouldn\u0027t be based around some particular axis, like the gimbals of an oldfashioned gyroscope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe camera currently works as if it were connected to gimbals. When you\u0027re in certain orientations, it becomes very difficult to rotate\u00A0in a particular direction you want. For example, after moving the camera full up, if you then want to rotate the object sideways, you can\u0027t do that directly because left/right rotates around the center of the screen (you are looking along the axis of rotation). So you have to rotate 90 degrees\u00A0around the center and then rotate up/down to look at the part you wanted to see. But if you now want to rotate this image\u00A0around the center of the screen (for example because the particular part you want is obscured by a window), that\u0027s impossible again because now left/right does what you wanted it to do in the first example, rotate the view\u00A0sideways. In fact there is no way of getting the object into the orientation you really want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust take a tall rocket and try to get a particular side of the capsule into view (for example the door of the capsule visible somewhere around the right hand side of the screen). It\u0027s really, really hard if the gimbals are pointing in an awkward direction. Very often you just want to rotate \u0022up\u0022 a little further but you can\u0027t because you\u0027re already fully up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish there would be a way of controlling the camera that worked like w-a-s-d on the attitude indicator.
