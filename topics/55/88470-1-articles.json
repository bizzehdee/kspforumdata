I\u0027m not the most creative person around, but I\u0027m sure that many folks can come up with other interesting instruments and experiments that present different challenges, and requires the player to do things that they normally don\u0027t do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-01T09:09:42Z\u0022 title=\u002211/01/2014 09:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Empiro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-02T00:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like TW1\u0027s \u0022knowledge\u0022 concept and I\u0027d like to make a suggestion on how to expand it and help add more of the scientific process and thrill of discovery to science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it was clear that there were anomalies in the game - the Munar Arcs, the Munoliths, Vallhenge - people engaged in grand hunts to see if there were more anomalies. We searched, we rejoiced when we found them, and we expressed sadness when there were no more to find - or even when an anomaly vanished, like the Magic Boulder. But here was true exploration, in the classic sense, of going out and seeing what we can find. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can do the same with science - WITHOUT changing the basic way that science functions, but ADDING to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose is that there be some anomalous science results - viewable in the science reports (AKA the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfluff text\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2) that repeated study can develop. Certain biomes might have an anomalous mineral that would require the analysis of surface samples from that biome to uncover. Each sample analysis would result in some unique property being reported, or in the mineral being named. Here is how I think it would work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you land a Kerbal in the Mun\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s East Crater. Your first sample report would be much like existing reports. Your second sample report might read as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou found a rock that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s much harder and lighter than the others. The geologists might know what it is.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo learn more, you would need to take this sample back to a lab module - either on a planetary base or a space station - with a \u003Cstrong\u003EPlanetary Science Module \u003C/strong\u003Eattached to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Planetary Science Module would be a new part (I envision it to be a 2.5 m diameter part that can either be attached inline to a lab module or connected via clampotron or clampotron-SR docking ports) which contains the necessary equipment to analyze the sample. This module NEEDS the lab module to work: if you put it on a space station or base without one, it will just sit there useless. There would be a variety of experiments that can be accessed by either action groups or by the right-click menu: hardness test, spectral analysis, etc (someone with geology knowledge, help me out here: what other tests can be applied to a new mineral?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can only run one experiment per sample, so if you perform a hardness test, you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t run a spectral analysis until you get a fresh sample. When you run ALL the experiments, the mineral is declared \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cknown\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and named. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe this should grant more science points than the existing amount for surface samples, but rather that the total science points for samples per biome should be spread out among the experiments. This should also mean your first sample from a biome would have a much SMALLER payout than currently, but you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d get larger payouts when you start running tests on later samples. Of course, the transmitted vs. recovered difference should remain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this system is adopted, we might see something similar for liquid samples and even atmospheric samples. Liquid samples (good for Kerbin, Eve, and Laythe) could be collected by Kerbals, but atmospheric samples (Eve, Kerbin, Duna, Jool, Laythe) would need to have an atmospheric sample collector part. The same Planetary Science Module could be used, but different tests for liquid and gaseous samples. The type of sample put into the module would unlock the battery of experiments that can be run on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for this system to work - and be enjoyable - we will need well-thought out anomalous minerals and results. No \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CYou take a measurement and report it to Kerbin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 fluff - something substantial, please. So if you perform a hardness test, the report gives you the hardness of the mineral. Geologists could have some fun dreaming up new minerals for these tests, and giving them consistent properties. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see one anomaly-mineral like this per planet, but ultimately we could expand this to see three or four anomaly-minerals per planet, one per biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
