The Mobile Processing Lab offers a 25% additive bonus to transmit value which is better than a max-level scientist, however it is very large and cumbersome. If it is crewed by at least one scientist, it gains half of that scientist\u0027s bonus as well, so with a level 3 scientist inside, the transmit bonus is 33.5%, and a surface sample would transmit at 58.5% of the base recovery value. If there are two scientists inside the MPL, only the higher bonus of the two is used.\n\nScientists also increase the maximum amount of science that can be obtained from each experiment. This does not increase the amount you transmit at all, and does not increase the amount from your first recovery, but it raises the recovery cap, allowing subsequent recoveries to grant a bit more science. The bonus is applied from the highest level scientist on board the ship when the experiment is performed. EVA reports and surface samples only gain a bonus when performed by a scientist.\n\nThe scientist\u0027s transmit bonus rises quickly with experience and tapers off, while the recovery bonus rises gradually. This should hopefully match the playstyles of those who prefer transmitting or recovering.\n\nEngineers can crew a drill to make it run faster while heating more slowly, significantly improving your ore collection rates. They can also repair broken parts of your craft at partial effectiveness. These are any parts of the craft (other than science experiment modules) that initially had a function but got dinged and ceased working although it is still attached to the craft. For instance, if Jebediah was hopping across the top of the craft and he stepped on an OX-STAT panel a bit too hard, it\u0027s okay because Bill can go out and fix it. It\u0027ll only grant 22.5 electric power per minute (at level 0), but it\u0027s better than nothing. This also covers the broken landing legs, although an engineer below level 3 will not be able to make them extend fully.\n\n*edit: forgot a section*\n\n*All crew gains 50% of their experience on the spot when they perform an activity that grants experience and 25% when they spend 6 hours (resting) within an immobile habitation craft (ie. a station). As long as the Kerbal performs no work for 1 full Kerbin day/night cycle and the craft the Kerbal is in does not change its orbit more than 0.1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA (to account for bumping or phantom thrust from SAS rotation, or using RCS to rotate), the Kerbal will \u0022rest\u0022 and gain up to 75% total saved experience. You still have to return them home to get full experience.*\n\n*adding an ability for engineers:*\n\n*Engineers (all levels) can operate folding equipment without power by going to the module and folding it by hand. This can save your craft if you run out of power and you had forgotten to extend the solar panels, for instance.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T03:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:43:35Z","Content":"I\u0027m not fond of pilots affecting ship torque [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97769-Opinions-on-Kerbal-Experience](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97769-Opinions-on-Kerbal-Experience)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nBut the other stuff, science and mining efficiency, sound good"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:50:53Z","Content":"What\u0027s wrong with pilots increasing torque?"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:54:52Z","Content":"\u0022Ye cannot break the laws of Physics.\u0022\n\nSo why would a physical attribute of a piece of hardware be higher by skill?\n\nWhat would be believable to me at least is reaction time and over correction.

I was able to tell the pilot to go to a node on the other side of the navball and she\u0027d do it usually with no overcorrection at all.

Every Kerbal can fly a ship even if they can\u0027t use SAS, they can all perform science experiments, and they can all operate mining drills. There is a bit of a disparity, however, in that the pilot\u0027s role of SAS is far more important than the scientist\u0027s ability to clean experiments, or the engineer\u0027s tiny bonus...whatever it does. So I was thinking of making it so that non-pilots would have partial SAS ability: you must arrest the ship\u0027s spin most of the way by yourself, but once it\u0027s spinning slower than the amount of spin you can generate in, say, 0.25 seconds of turning, the kerbal at the controls would take over and hold stability.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T16:06:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:27:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E I was considering that also, but I couldn\u0027t think of any good abilities to give them at level 0. Remote operation of experiments is already doable with any crewmember or even a probe core, and I wouldn\u0027t change that. I was thinking of differentiating transmitting and removing experiment, perhaps a level 0 scientist could clean it after a transmit, but only level 2 or higher can remove the experiment and then clean it.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nI think you misunderstood me.\n\nProbes, pilots and engineers can operate experiments while they are still inside the pod but they can not while on EVA.

They just sit there, unwilling to function but still firmly in place. I\u0027m not sure how it works but I\u0027ve seen it happen once in a while. I was thinking it\u0027d be nice if sometimes when something got smacked only a little too hard, that it didn\u0027t outright explode. It could be achieved by giving each part two crash tolerances: the lower value to signify at which speed it breaks, and the higher value to signify at which speed it explodes. Broken parts would stay on the ship but would also transfer remaining speed on impact to the parts they press against, thus allowing more parts to break if you impact hard enough."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:38:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t understand what you mean by better auto-tuning values for the internal PID controller. Can you elaborate? I\u0027d love to give pilots something more realistic.\n\nThe crew can point the ship in certain directions. Sometimes this causes craft to wobble if the pilot is overcorrecting. Internally, i assume the game treats the pilot flying as a [PID Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller). PID controllers need constants for their proportional, integral, and derivative values to work. If those values are not selected correctly (and indeed each ship might require different values, especially going from small ship to large ship), the ship can wobble and shake itself apart. There are methods for autotuning these values so that this doesnt happen. As kerbals level up, the values of the constants can scale with ship size, or, can be autotuned to avoid this."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:12:45Z","Content":"I like that.
