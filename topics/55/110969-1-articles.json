Longer range, a single heavy mission may be enough to justify it. Short range, it just takes a few missions to pick up their return fuel at the far end, and you\u0027re ahead.\n\nEdit: There\u0027s also the use case of refuelling at Mun and Minimus on the outward journey, to reduce launch weight on Kerbin (you can launch much larger craft, or use smaller launchers, if the long range stage is unfuelled at launch).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T02:56:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 02:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"}]}
