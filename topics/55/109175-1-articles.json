All it means is the final model is created by a number of mathematical procedures instead of a pre made model. It can be based on a random seed but it can also be fixed."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:36:18Z","Content":"One benefit that developers of games like No Man\u0027s Sky and Space Engine have that Squad does not is the fact that they can use \u0027Star Wars\u0027 physics.
