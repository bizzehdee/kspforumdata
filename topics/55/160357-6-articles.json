I am working on a mission to re-orient an asteroid I captured into polar orbit of Kerbin last night. and I am making a ship for this task. I have only 3 parts in this picture, 2 stock and 1 from SpaceY. Ignore the probe core as its not relevant because A its on the bottom, and B well, its not stock. Just focus on the 2 stock parts, the 1.25m to 2.5m adapter on top of the\u00A02.5m to 3.75m adapter and tell me this is not ugly as sin. they are theoretically the SAME size where they hook up to one another, and yet, the one is a hair bigger. No part in this picture has moved beyond the selection pane to where its placed on the corresponding nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1B5LKou.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u00221B5LKou.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope we get an art pass and soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noriginal posting 01:52:30\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
