But I have some specifics to include, so I thought I\u0027d go ahead and write a \u0022suggestion\u0022 post anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB/SPH part menus, of course everything is thrown together without a meaningful sorting order, and some tabs contain many more parts than others. It\u0027s usually tolerable in a stock installation, but when you start adding parts mods, it becomes a huge mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there are several ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Split fuel \u0026amp; engines into separate categories, as both are becoming quite numerous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Sub-categories. For instance, electrical, vs docking, vs wheels, vs general utility. Sub-categories based diameter, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Sorting. For instance, sort first by type (group the decouplers together, etc). Then, for more granularity, sort by size (mass would be OK).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is right now, it would appear that the parts are sorted first by mod group, then by internal ID name. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, something that I think would also help, and would make sense (especially if not creating new categories):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Move the jet fuel/engine parts to aerodynamics, where the air intakes are already located.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry if this has already been talked to death. Quick googling turned up nothing, however)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?
