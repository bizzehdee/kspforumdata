As soon as the mission ends, the science experiments are gone and the samples are no longer there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich got me thinking, what if we had a building in the Kerbal Space Center which allowed you to look back at all the science experiments you collected? It shouldn\u0027t be that hard to implement and if would be nice if you could always have those science experiments with you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my idea of how it would work: When you return/transmit your science, your science will also get automatically stored. If you\u0027ve brought samples from the Mun and you bring it back, then it would go into a group called something like: Munar Surface Science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be 3 types of sections:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[PLANET/MOON] Surface Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[PLANET/MOON] Low Orbit Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[PLANET/MOON] High Orbit Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you got a certain bit of science in low Munar orbit, that science would be stored and it would go into the Low Orbit Science group. If you were in high Eve orbit, any science you get would go into the High Orbit Science group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think of this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leatherneck","CreatedById":77501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T04:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to look back on each planet/moon I\u0027ve visited, and see the experiments as well.

It would also help me remember what I tested, and where, especially since once I get a landing down, I\u0027m prone to set 2-3 simultaneous missions to the same body. In one case, I think I had a probe on almost every biome on Mun. Problem is, I didn\u0027t have ALL the biomes, so I can\u0027t recall which craters I\u0027m missing.
