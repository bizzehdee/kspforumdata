I don\u0027t have to use the keyboard for much else (using a HOTAS), so this is quite a nuisance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrim controls are usually *very* accessible in an aircraft. On the Thrustmaster warthog (which is a replica of the A10 controls) there is a trim hat on the stick. Adjusting trim is also particularly important in KSP due to the shifting weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have attempted to figure out a way of using autohotkey and various other methods of replicating the \u0022alt \u002B keyboard\u0022 input required, but it\u0027s actually rather difficult. The combination of requiring a modifier key and the fact that it needs to be \u0022held down\u0022 in a particular way (I think KSP uses keyboard driver repetition as opposed to just checking to see if the key state is down or up) adds a whole lot of additional complexity to the process of getting it to work right with autohotkey. If, for example, I map a joystick button to \u0022alt\u002Be\u0022 (I use ESDF, not WASD) then pressing that joystick button has no apparent effect, I think I\u0027d have to press it hundreds of times to see any response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to remap trim to a hat or POV (axis) control would really help. Alternatively, simply allowing a modifier key to work with joystick axis controls to set trim in the same way as it works for keyboard control would also probably be OK as long as the sensitivity is extremely low (eg, hold button and pull joystick back to trim up).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T17:28:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 05:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-26T09:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as suggestions go, this gets my vote \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using the \u0022trim adjustment gadget\u0022 from the Firespitter mod pack for this \u0026amp; binding trim\u002B / trim- to joystick buttons. \u0027tis still not optimal though, as you only get steps of \u002B-1 or \u002B-10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, I remember long ago I had a joystick with physical trim wheels alongside the stick axes... why can I not find one now?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-26T09:50:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2014 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by steve_v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mintme","CreatedById":61058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T03:11:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry using Xpadder. great for binding modifer\u0027s like shift-X and the like.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T14:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1 to this request.
