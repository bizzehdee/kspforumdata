There\u0027s a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving to the next point that realism should not be a focus of KSP, I disagree. The game is marketed as a space simulation game, ergo the game must be developed as a sim. Also, I want to quickly make a point. A realistic aero model will not be true-to-life accurate. This is not something we can ask of Squad and this is overcomplicated. A realistic aero model aims to make things which exist/work in reality behave as they would in reality while not necessarily modeling all the complexity and intricacy of real-world physics. A realistic aero model can imitate reality even if its not necessarily working like reality or modeling the same physics by which reality works, as long as the effects are generally predictable based on the real laws of physics and their calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I personally am unable to find an answer for the debate of realism vs gameplay. I personally believe non-aerodynamically sound designs (i.e. most asparagus staged lifters) should be punished in the form of incurring lots of drag and having to spend plenty of extra delta V to brute-force their way into orbit, but I don\u0027t think the aero model should make them unusable, just inviable. On the other hand, more aerodynamic rockets would benefit from a much easier ride to orbit. Under FAR, I find aerodynamically unsound rockets almost never make it to space, not for lack of delta V but rather because all the control surfaces in the world won\u0027t keep it going straight. It likes to flip out and explode, which is not something I think should be done in a stock aero model (hence the problem). now MAYBE this could be solved by making the old aero a debug option as @CaptRobau suggested, but I\u0027d like to see an implementation where debug does not need to be summoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Updated with response to Red Iron Crown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I do not disagree with you, I will say that a counterpoint to your argument could be made by the fact that KSP is a space sim, and the getting to space part does not need to be the most accurate portion of that, albeit it must be good enough to approximate the difficulties involved therein.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T00:24:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Captain Sierra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T00:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile I do not disagree with you, I will say that a counterpoint to your argument could be made by the fact that KSP is a space sim, and the getting to space part does not need to be the most accurate portion of that, albeit it must be good enough to approximate the difficulties involved therein.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt the same way for most of my time playing KSP, for me the atmosphere was something to punch through on the way up and a useful braking medium so a low level of realism was acceptable.

Allow me to suggest the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic aero allows players to leverage their existing knowledge of aerodynamics, however rudimentary, when designing craft. Everyone has seen real life rockets, aircraft, streamlined cars, and other aerodynamic shapes. They should be able to apply those shapes to their benefit in a game that purports to have realistic flight simulation and see good results. Instead, they are punished for making craft that would have good aerodynamic properties IRL, due to dead mass of nosecones, tall and thin being less structurally sound than pancakes, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic aero is more challenging. Currently, pretty much anything can be thrown into orbit by simply strapping ever more radially attached boosters to the lifter. Having the frontal area of craft matter adds to the challenge by making overly wide designs less efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic aero allows players to reuse experience from other flying games. Pretty much everyone who has played a non-arcadey flight game has to \u0022unlearn\u0022 their piloting techniques and learn new ones when trying to fly in stock aerodynamics. The learning curve for KSP is already pretty steep, why not allow players to tap their existing experience for parts of it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More realistic aero is educational. Part of KSP\u0027s satisfaction is in figuring out how some of the more complex mechanics work and learning to manipulate them to your advantage. Just about everything I know about orbital mechanics and spacecraft design is from KSP; because of what I\u0027ve learned here I have a better (though nowhere near perfect) understanding of real life maneuvers in space and I can reasonably claim the title of armchair rocket scientist. Aero is different, it\u0027s a mechanic that the player must figure out, only this time the things it teaches you are wrong, wrong, wrong. There\u0027s less satisfaction in figuring it out because it doesn\u0027t give you a better understanding of real life aero or the feeling that you\u0027re an armchair aircraft designer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the above is realism for realism\u0027s sake, but instead are ways in which gameplay would be improved with more realistic aero. I agree that the rules in the game are arbitrary, but it seems to me that an arbitrary set of aero rules that are closer to reality and other games would serve KSP well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Every time someone trots out that old post from the Orbiter forums I thank the Kraken that it\u0027s not how KSP development played out.
