And there\u0027s no TL;DR. But please bear with me - you might like what you see!\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIntroduction.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite pleased how in KSP 1.0, you no longer need to accept and complete every single altitude record contract individually. That makes the start so much smoother! No longer do you have to decide between spending the time to do this or missing out on the cash and rep that is supposed to help you get off the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I noticed that the UI of the mission control building is kind of struggling to support this feature. The altitude records are now all automatically listed under \u0022accepted\u0022 contracts, and maybe you noticed this on the KSPTV stream as well as your own gameplay: nobody ever looks at the accepted contracts tab at game start. Especially when the UI explicitly tells you that you do not have any contracts accepted. So a player starting a new career save doesn\u0027t even realize these records and other auto-completing contracts exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContinuing the career gameplay, I couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t help but notice a strange dichotomy in the way contracts are handled. Some contracts are clearly procedurally generated, repeatable content. Other contracts are clearly handcrafted one-off affairs. But the game doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to be sure whether or not it should acknowledge that difference. Some of the one-time contracts are automatically accepted, like the altitude records; others are not, like escaping the atmosphere. Admittedly, making \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cescape the atmosphere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 a contract that the player manually accepts is a means of player guidance; but at the same time, isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t that a tacit admission that (as mentioned before) nobody ever looks at the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Caccepted\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 tab? Also, doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t that generate the same issue as before, where you can accidentally complete the prerequisites of a major milestone contract but you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get credit because you didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accept it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome players would call the contract system inherently flawed for this. But I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d instead like to call the mission control UI inherently flawed. It was made for a contract system much smaller in scope and variety than what is currently implemented, and it shows. I believe there is a lot that can be gained from improving the UI - and while at it, taking the chance to make a fundamental change in the way contracts are presented to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Premise.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest to take what the autocompletable record contracts started to its logical conclusion, and divide contract types strictly between procedurally generated, repeatable content and handcrafted one-off content. The former, they can keep the name \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CContracts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Or you can call them \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMissions\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 for the alliteration, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s honestly not important. The latter, let\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s call them \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CMilestones\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new mission control UI would have two principal sections - either side by side, or in tabs, or whichever display method ends up looking great and making sense (EDIT: maybe multiple views, like in the R\u0026amp;D building). One section dedicated entirely to Milestones, one section dedicated entirely to regular commercial Contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMilestones.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...would be the player guidance method. They would comprise all of the things that generate rewards for doing them once, for the first time: reaching an altitude record. Escaping the atmosphere. Achieving orbit. Performing a Mun flyby. Exploring the Mun. And so on - every single of these contracts currently in the game would be grouped under Milestones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll milestones would be visible right from the start, but those that make sense for the player to focus on would be displayed at the top of the list, under a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwithin our reach\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 heading. This does not need any new logic to handle, because it can simply use the same logic that already determines whether or not a new contract should be generated for the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only exception is that all of them would be always visible, and you\u0027d no longer be praying to the random number generator that the game actually spits out a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cvisit Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 contract at the same time it produces a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cvisit Ike\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 contract. These not showing up together is way too common, and feels awful when it happens because you know that if you actually go visit Ike, the Duna contract will never show up and you missed it. Under this proposed system, this issue just magically disappears without any need for the devs to further tweak the system. All by simply displaying it in a different way to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll milestones and their sub-objectives would autocomplete upon achieving them, and there would be no deadlines on them (this is already true now), nor would they need to be accepted or require a free contract slot. But the player would have the option to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctrack\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 them in the mission control UI, which adds them to your toolbar contract widget the same way an accepted contract shows. The player could also un-track the objective again if he no longer wants to see it. Kind of it like a quest tracker in an MMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe iterative starter milestones would be unified under one big header. For example, there would no longer be an individual contract for each altitude record. Rather there will be just one single \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CAltitude Records\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 milestone, and one single \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSpeed Records\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 milestone, and so on and so forth. Each individual record would be a single sub-objective under that overarching milestone. This keeps the milestone list shorter and more easily browsed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts (or Missions, if you like).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...would be just what they are now, the player\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s main source of income. Every procedurally generated, repeatable contract would be found here. The list would start empty and becomes populated when the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEscape the Atmosphere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 milestone is completed, just like it already works right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like now, contracts would need to be accepted in order to complete, and they would have a deadline by which they must be completed. In fact, there are no changes necessary to how any of them work, except that they are displayed apart from the milestones, in their own UI section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the fact in mind that contracts are completely focused on the commercial side, with milestones moved out of the way, the contract UI can offer the player new options that wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have made sense before. For instance, the game currently has a small issue where certain contract types simply stop appearing during gameplay as other, more advanced contract types take over. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve had situations where I was asked to build four different ground bases, but not a single satellite contract had shown itself over multiple ingame years. Why does it have to be that way? Why not have a contract UI that offers all (unlocked) types of contracts at all times, in parallel, and lets the player choose? Maybe dedicate a part of the UI to each contract individually. Like, have a dropdown menu where you could say \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cshow me satellite launch contracts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2, and it would offer you three of those. And then you could switch to viewing tourist contracts, and it would show you three of those. Dropdown menus are maybe not the best way to do this, but you hopefully try to get the point I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m trying to make: let the player choose from and enjoy the full spectrum of all available mission types for the entirety of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this would make the game present a greater number of individual contracts at once to choose from. This way, the final tier mission control building and its unlimited contract accepting allowance actually makes sense to have. Right now, tier 2 already gives you 7 contracts, and the game only ever spawns like 10 at once. Including milestone contracts, by the way, which is another reason why it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s so beneficial to split those off into their own category - else they just take up room where commercial contracts could spawn instead. Contract allowances could be further tuned for this new system, especially when the tier 0 space center eventually makes its appearance. With milestones no longer counting against the limit, you could do something like: 1, 3, 7, unlimited instead of the current 2, 7, unlimited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and by the way? Please remove all science payout from repeatable contracts. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re okay on milestones, to a small degree, but really\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 no science from launching the fifteenth tourist.

That player is going to be very put off. And again, rightly so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it sounds like it could make sense in principle, I fear that this would actually play pretty badly in practical application for anyone except a small number of people who share the exact same playstyle as the person who defined the dependencies of the milestones from tech nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, everything breaks down completely when people start using modded tech trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I see far more problems than advantages with that idea. My suggestion is aimed at enabling maximum flexibility for the largest amount of different playstyles. Player guidance is achieved via the \u0022within our reach\u0022 suggested milestones, which in no way need to be followed but allow a new player to know what is expected of them next. Since that system would be using the same routines as those currently deciding whether a new unique contract should generate, that means the suggested milestones will already be defined by the abilities and unlocked parts of the player. I see little need to change or expand on that right now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
