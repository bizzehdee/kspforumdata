You don\u0027t need to be physically connected with another spacecraft to hear that spacecraft\u0027s engines sounds. Since microphones respond to pressure, a microphone actually would pick up \u0022sound\u0022 in the space around a burning rocket engine, especially towards the rear! But a lot of what the microphone would hear wouldn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Etechnically\u003C/em\u003E be sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnically, sound is defined as a wave phenomenon, carried through a second order differential relationship between pressure and particle velocity in a physical medium. Average physical transport of that medium is not allowed- the particles can move back and forth with the sound wave, but that motion must be sinusoidal and have no average velocity component. Any motion of the medium that DOES involve an average motion in one direction is NOT considered sound. Obviously, a medium in motion does not preclude itself from carrying sound; it\u0027s just that any averaged particle motion is not considered to be \u0022sound\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what happens with a rocket engine in space? A rocket engine exhausts a lot of high temperature gas (typically, water vapor and maybe something else too like CO2 and CO). That gas rapidly escapes in a large cone, and perhaps, even in all directions. (To know, you would probably need to look up how fast the actual gas particles are moving at the temperature they are exhausted at- it could easily be FASTER than the average exhaust velocity.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this expanding gas cloud creates pressure on any surface it impinges upon. This would not technically be sound because its the entire medium in transport that creates the pressure, not a wave being carried by pressure and particle velocity. However, there undoubtedly would be some TRUE engine sound being carried by this medium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines would not be the only thing that would create apparent \u0022sound\u0022 in space. I remember that during the 1998 (or was it 1999?) HST servicing mission, when the astronauts vented the shuttle\u0027s airlock out to space when they were preparing to go out and start working on the HST, the HST\u0027s solar panels were hit by a dangerously powerful blast of pressure that nearly could have damaged them. If there had been a microphone on the HST, it would have certainly picked up this pressure blast as \u0022sound\u0022, even though *technically*, most of the pressure wave\u0027s \u0022volume\u0022 would not have been due to sound (as it was the medium physically transporting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example would be explosions in space. Contrary to popular belief, you COULD hear them if you were close enough to be hit by the wave of expanding gas. So if you had been floating in your spacesuit just outside the Apollo 13 module when its oxygen tank exploded, you would have undoubtedly heard something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: There IS \u0022sound\u0022 in space, though mostly it\u0027s not really sound by the technical definition of sound.
