The current one is very short, only showing about two contracts at a time - it could be simply resizable like any program window on a computer - grab the bottom edge and pull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing with it: it keeps opening descriptions of contracts that are impossible to complete on a given fight after \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E of the conditions are true. If I have a list of 10 contracts, out of which I want to complete two on this flight, why can I not leave only those two be displayed/detailed? Either remove the auto-unroll, change it to \u0022unroll if all conditions are complete\u0022(like a reminder), let us rearrange the list as we see fit or simply let us check what contracts do we want visible for the time being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the last one: if the menu/debug windows can be moved around, why is it not possible to do this to other stuff as well? I mean the upper-right corner tabs. So far I have not found a way to for example keep the resources tab open and contracts visible at the same time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T15:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready discussed here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86806-Contracts-window-difficult-to-navigate-needs-a-sticky-option\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86806-Contracts-window-difficult-to-navigate-needs-a-sticky-option\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-02T16:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOuch, sorry...
