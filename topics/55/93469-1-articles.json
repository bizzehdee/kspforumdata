I\u0027ve just barely made it past the Tier 3 Science Tree (45 science level) and every contract I have available is something like create a space station orbiting Kerbol, place a satellite in some specific orbit around Minmus, or a build a Mun base. I barely have the tech to be capable to reaching the Mun much less building a base there and I couldn\u0027t guess how to place something in a specific orbit without the use of maneuver nodes. Considering that I have never left Kerbin SOI, is there something odd with my contract list or should I be able to complete these contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T09:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI couldn\u0027t guess how to place something in a specific orbit without the use of maneuver nodes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, the problem that the hard mode is too hard in this case. The game lack building price settings. On hard mode you have difference between income scale and spending scale ~1:4. On moderate level it\u0027s less and so you can upgrade buildings faster to get maneuver nodes end etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T11:15:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe fix is really easy. Go to the administration building and convert reputation into either science or funds. I did that in my moderate save with 25% commitment. Before I did it I got the mission of launching a satellite with a polar orbit around Duna. After doing it the most difficult satellite missions were equatorial orbit around Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, reputation determines how highly the game thinks of you in terms of the difficulty of missions you can complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seadart","CreatedById":119961,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T23:41:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I figured out why I was getting such hard missions so early on.
