I must be doing something wrong. Even my mid-tier space planes don\u0027t look like hot dogs. Quite frankly this update is the best thing to happen to spaceplanes since the addition of the Space Plane Hangar.\n\nYou are using four wings. See the problem is, us people who like to build larger wings run into trouble because it\u0027s either lego the wings together (=massive drag) or use the flashy new large wing parts - which don\u0027t look good at all. Furthermore, wings have long been used for creative purposes to build aerodynamic shells around engines and other components. Obviously your small spaceplane wouldn\u0027t need that, it doesn\u0027t look too bulky what with only two externally placed fuel tanks along the sides, but for larger designs we can no longer cover up the ugly bits.\n\nThis patch caters to simple spaceplanes which conform strictly to the stock parts. That\u0027s fine for simple builds (which will then, inevitably, look like sausages with wings), but if I want to construct something that looks the way *I want it to*, I run into serious trouble now because creativity has been severely restricted.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhat I\u0027m considering doing as an emergency solution is to create structural versions of the current wings, massively reduce their drag and mass, but also remove their lift capability completely. I\u0027m not a modeller, so aesthetics wise the only way to distinguish them from the real wings would be a different texture, but at least we would have some aesthetic parts that don\u0027t interfere too much with the performance of the spaceplane.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T21:53:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:54:41Z","Content":"i finished 1.0.2ing my pod racer, the realism, i can feel it\n\n![2xWwS2K.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2xWwS2K.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s interesting because I did mention in the Realism vs Creativity thread that there would be a loss of creativity in 1.0 due to the parameters needed to get SSTO\u0027s into orbit becoming stricter.
