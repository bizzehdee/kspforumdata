Most planets have axial tilt and major moons orbits few degrees tilted to planet\u0027s equator in our solar system. That should be added in KSP too. It may be good idea to keep Kerbin\u0027s system as it is because otherwise it would maybe be too hard to learn but Eve, Duna and Jool could have some tens of degrees of axial tilt. Of course game should have suitable controls for more difficult orbital calculations and maneuvering tasks. Orbital parameters of planets are good now, I do not see any reason to change them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe then developers could add Uranus-like planet and couple of moons in outer system (about 100-150 Gm orbit). Uranus have axial tilt of about 90 degrees and major moons orbit neat equator level. In my opinion there is not any good reason to add many more celestial bodies in game before they can give something really new things. Just adding spheres with different colors and sizes is quite pointless in this phase of game development.
