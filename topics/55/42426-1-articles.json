I.e., you start out with almost no parts in the space category, but you can construct planes/land vehicles. Various space centers would be spread around Kerbin and you can recover parts from them if you can get a kerbal to them. Get into a stable orbit around Kerbin, unlock a new part. Dock two ships together while in orbit, unlock a new part. Plant a flag on the Mun, unlock a new part. Plant a flag on Minmus, unlock a new part, and so forth. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T03:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*Cough... techtreecomingin.22 *Cough...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T03:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJebster, have you read the KSP Weekly Newletters?
