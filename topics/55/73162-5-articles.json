I personally know someone who utterly refuses to use NERVAs for instance. They don\u0027t add anything to \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E game, even though many, many other people have fun with them. So he just doesn\u0027t use them. Myself, I haven\u0027t really bothered with ions, even though people seem to have fun sending slowboats to the sun with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would ask that you give KSP Interstellar a try. Create a separate installation if you like so you don\u0027t ruin your existing save file. You don\u0027t have to get into dusty-plasma reactors, creating new types of nuclear fuel to power them with nor reprocessing actinides and disposing of depleted fuels. You don\u0027t even have to bother with the beamed power side of things at all. You may have to bother with putting some small heat sinks on the craft as KSPi introduces heat management into the game, but it\u0027s really not that big a deal unless you\u0027re using the nuke reactors or huge amounts of solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust give it a try. Make creating a Munar ISRU a mission objective, try the hybrid aluminium/O2 engines on for size. Just to see what you think. One small 62.5cm nuke reactor has enough fuel to last more than the duration of any Munar or Minmus mission, gives enough juice to power a couple of ISRUs, and you only need a couple of small radiators to stop it overheating. At the end of the day, even with KSPi installed, you don\u0027t need to use any of the extra bits (asides maybe the heat sinks) in order to carry on as usual. And, if you find you like the ISRU, well, it\u0027s an extra toy to play with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd given that Squad\u0027s implementation of an ISRU might not even need to use the extra nuclear reactor parts of KSPi, that just makes things even more simple. Actually you can use a KSPi ISRU with just solar panels if I recall correctly, it just takes a long while to extract or refine anything due to the reduced power available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, give it a try. If you don\u0027t like it, you don\u0027t have to use it. Just like many of the other stock parts.

The game may be alpha, but it\u0027s not a case of \u0022throw everything to the wall and see what sticks\u0022. Features should only be implemented if they\u0027re intended to be in the final game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe \u0022if you want it, install a mod\u0022 answer is well known and little constructive.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also a fact. KSP has a huge mod scene. Mods exist to extend the stock game and change it.

The most popular mod out there is probably Mechjeb, but you won\u0027t ever see that in stock either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou think it shouldn\u0027t be stock... can you give a reason (other than \u0022there is a mod that does it\u0022)? No offense, Im just asking for a more detailed explanation. Do you think it would affect gameplay? too much complexity? low priority feature but ok to have it in 1.0?....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already given a reason in my original reply, but I\u0027ll repeat it if you like. I think the rocket equation and the need to get everything you want in space up from the surface of Kerbin is the main source of difficulty in the game. I know there are mods that allow you to mine resources and build and launch ships from other planets, but the core game is about launching rockets from Kerbin. Anything that moves the game away from that paradigm rightly belongs in modland IMO. The core game should have some focus and not try to implement everything. They\u0027ve deliberately built the game to be moddable so that if you want to change that focus you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I\u0027m not arguing against ISRU being in KSP.

The core of the game has been finished for quite a while. KSP is a game about building, launching and crashing rockets. Maybe a bit of flying them too. We\u0027ve been doing that for ages. We\u0027re now at the point where they\u0027re adding all the extra stuff (such as career mode) on top of that core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying that there shouldn\u0027t be anything in the game that builds on that core, I\u0027m saying there shouldn\u0027t be anything which detracts from it. ISRU potentially means you could reach a point in the game where you never had to launch anything from KSP.
