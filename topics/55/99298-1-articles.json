(And to be honest, I\u0027d much rather the devs keep doing what they are doing rather than devote time to something like this, but I wanted to mention it because I think it sounds cool.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, I think that it would be fun to have a loading video while the game is starting up rather than watching a yellow bar count off the assets as they are launched. Potential content already exists on the KSP official YouTube Channel (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/KerbalSPOfficial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/KerbalSPOfficial\u003C/a\u003E) so they shouldn\u0027t have to do any new animations. I\u0027m not talking about the gameplay sneak peeks, but the cinematic update trailers - \u0022Selection Process,\u0022 \u0022Recovered Munar Footage,\u0022 \u0022Kerbal Science,\u0022 \u0022Kerbal Engineering,\u0022 \u0022Jeb\u0027s Junkyard,\u0022 \u0022Special Delivery,\u0022 etc. Even the \u0022Grab KSP on the Steam Summer Sale\u0022 video where a Kerbal gets grabbed on the Mun with a Claw. They are actually really good videos, in my opinion, and really capture what KSP is about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe some sort of compilation of these clips could run while the assets load in the background. (If so I think it should end with part of the \u0022Teaser Trailer\u0022 which has a pod drifting away above Kerbin with \u0022How hard can rocket science be anyway?\u0022 written on the side. If loading all the game assets takes longer than the video, then it can just go back to the background image with the yellow loading bar. And, of course, you should be able to disable/skip the video if you don\u0027t want to watch it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, this is really just an \u0022icing on the cake\u0022 sort of thing that would give some additional polish for the big 1.0 release and I really can\u0027t wait to see the new features they have in store for us in the update!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T18:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at some FPS counter, it\u0027s usually very low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, the video would be very choppy.
