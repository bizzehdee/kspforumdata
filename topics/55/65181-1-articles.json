But its very hard to light up end parts of structure, especially when they stick out to open space. It would be usefull to have some kind of position light, which would make only small point of light, not directional. It would be good for emergency lightning when electric power is running low too (i suppose that it would have small power needs). Another related problem is, that if you\u0027re using many many classic lights in a various directions, there are always some parts of that structure, which are over-lit (balancing the right light composition requires very much time).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-08T11:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/08/2014 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pelican\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T12:04:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a mod for that!
