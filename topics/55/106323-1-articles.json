Now im not asking for actual procedural parts (as squad hates procedural parts and will never implement them stock), but im asking for the ability to pick my fuel ratios, and possibly even what fuels are loaded in a tank (with logical limits, i doubt a xenon tank could fit LF, or vice versa, not sure about monoprop vs LF though. \n\nFor example take the FLT-400, a good high-capacity tank, but its now basically useless for LF only nuke engines, as you need twice the fuel tank amounts to get the same fuel. Why not let us pick how much LF, and how much OX fits in each tank? This is not ruining the lego building style, and doesnt make half the fuel tanks worthless for many applications.\n\nif this isnt implemented, i can always go into the .craft file and edit the fuel to LF only, not like i havent been doing this already, but its kinda annoying to do, and it doesnt really feel like i can call it stock (even if its the same exact fuel weight/volume). Its not essential, but itd be very nice, especially for those that use nukes ALOT."}]}
