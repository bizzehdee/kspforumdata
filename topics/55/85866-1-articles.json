Reduce the Kerbuck cost to 1000 (shielded panels are 400 and the large is 3000). Raise its power generation to the same 2/sec than the shielded and unshielded solar panels produce. Reduce the mass from the current 80 kg to 50 kg (twice the mass of the shielded solar panels). This will keep solar panels as the better choice for cost and mass, while also making the RTGs more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T21:20:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERTGs shouldn\u0027t produce that much power.

Also, speaking of the Gigantor, it is massively heavy (350kg), and also has \u0026gt;9x larger surface area than the SP-W and OX-4L panels, but only produces 9 times the power....
