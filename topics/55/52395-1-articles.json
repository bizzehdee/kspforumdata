But when I want to play realistically, I dont want to do that but it happens ever so often just because i got soooo used to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to have a slider in my options menu, that removes the \u0022Revert to...\u0022 option once my rocket/plane has reached a certain heigt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe slider could start at 0m, in order to allow me to completely disable the Revert feature and end at infinity, to have it always turned on as it is right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not like the idea of having the on/off feature because with a slider, i can set myself a difficulty level. I could basically say (example): Ok, I put the slider to 10000m, to have a buffer zone for finding mistakes on my rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Id love to be allowed to disable the quicksave. I personally dont find it that important because i never use it anyway, so i dont have the \u0022klick automatically\u0022 issue. But i guess other people might have that. In my opinion, a on/off would be enough here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I really hope that this is a simple feature and many people think the way I do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash save!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMad Vince\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T20:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can help you with the quicksave, just remove the key binding in the settings screen or settings.cfg \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also effectively disable the autosave by changing AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 300 to something a lot higher, like 36000 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MadVince","CreatedById":92209,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T20:44:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can help you with the quicksave, just remove the key binding in the settings screen or settings.cfg \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also effectively disable the autosave by changing AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 300 to something a lot higher, like 36000 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay the hotkey thing is actually a great idea.
