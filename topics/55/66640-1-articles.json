This can add some science value or budget (another future planned feature) selling some photos or movie filmed on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBye!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-24T15:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, nice Tracking Center internals and functionalities. Don\u0027t know if and when Squad may create something similar in game, but have you checked \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/67450\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProbeControlRoom\u003C/a\u003E mod (WIP)?

But my idea is a simple and not interactive live screens, it\u0027s just a graphic to give a little more immersion, probably more similar to vehicles assembly hangars background where you can see a lot of busy kerbals do something! Not a real function but just a menu to separate sections I\u0027ve mentioned. Funcionalities so complex as live screens I leave at great mods like RasterPropMonitor and of course ProbeControlRoom!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll watch for italian forum of course, thank you!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
