While this is useful for eliminating human error, or just helping a player along, it would be nice to see a setting where this force could be changed. For instance, full, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, and no force. I suggest this because (in my opinion), docking can be exciting/suspenseful/hair raising etc, and these feelings of a delicate maneuver are somewhat suspended when the two vessels are suddenly pulled together and connected rapidly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForce options would be great because it would allow inexperienced players to continue as is (eg: mistakes in a docking vessel\u0027s orientation), and experienced players to face more of a challenge / feel more realistic/authentic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"max_creative","CreatedById":159640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T18:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, plus then I wouldn\u0027t smash off my solar panels when I dock to Jebsey station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
