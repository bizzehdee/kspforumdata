It would make it easier to adjust node, especially those that are far away from your available perspectives (or at least current perspective) and 2. Pulling on the various controls that always begin in the same location on the screen when you begin to use them, would allow players to get a better feel for the node control and become more adapt at fine tuning them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T22:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed. This would be a great addition, espically in those cases where you\u0027re fine-tuning close approaches/encounters and you have to zoom in on them which always results in having to switch back and forth between the maneuver node\u0027s location and the approach/encounter node\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
