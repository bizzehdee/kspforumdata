Something were multiple people can participate on the setup sharing the same model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach part you add carries your name on it as it was your addition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great if others could join as an observer so people can watch but not limited to watch only because streaming would do that easily but also for people to have read only rights where they can inspect and visualize but not modify.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be also great if the people playing together could see when someone added something new... for example, when you log in everything that was added new shows up in a list and you can clean the list after you see.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would leave to fantastic ships been built and could even be an additional module/expansion. I would definitely pay for that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
