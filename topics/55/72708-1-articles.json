The results are not trustworthy for a large number of reasons. It\u0027s not a good way to decide anything important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest ways a voluntary online poll has useless results is NOT security risks or double-voting or anything illicit or dishonest. It\u0027s just the simple sampling bias of visibility and participation. You get a massive skew in the results because not everybody *sees* that it exists in the first place. The factors that can cause one person to notice the poll exists while another is ignorant of its presence are strongly tied to social and behavioral indicators that affect which way they\u0027d vote if they did participate. One strong effect is that you tend to get a higher percentage of disgruntled people than in the general population because someone disgruntled is a lot more likely to vote. Any poll in which one of the options is \u0022I\u0027m happy like it is - don\u0027t change anything\u0022 is suspect because someone who thinks that is far less likely to vote in the poll. Another strong effect is that you tend to get a very misrepresented lower than accurate percentage of people who prefer casual play. The more likely someone is to prefer casual play, the more likely they are to just play the game on their own without needing to be part of its \u0022community\u0022.
