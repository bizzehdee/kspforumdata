How many times I have tried to get the surface sample from somewhere on Kerbin when I landed and wasn\u0027t quite in the right spot. Keep checking my trajectory on the orbital map to see if I am going the right direction when walking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I had this awkward situation in my most recent career mode play through. I sent Jeb to the Mun, when he was coming back I pressed shift to pan the camera around as it\u0027s the input for a different game I play. burnt the last of my fuel on retro grade and was on a dangerous crash course with Kerbin (I use deadly re-entry). I sent a rescue mission up to intercept him. During that time his ship ran out of power so I had to EVA him (I use Tac LIfe Support) or he would die of toxicity. So I set up the rescue ship for an interception near Kerbin and then flew the last part EVA back from the Mun. This seemed ok until I got close to the point of intersect which then went dark. Kerbin came between me and the Sun. It\u0027s almost impossible to find a rescue ship or Kerbal in pitch black with no navigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was moving the camera around looking for a shadow blocking the star background. I flew past the thing several times, back and forth. I eventually got back when I had entered the atmosphere at 65km. I kept failing to grab on and flying off when I initially got to the craft. It was getting incredibly difficult to get back to the ship. I thought Jeb was a gonner. I now equip all ships with a few lights just in case. A compass could of saved me 40 minutes of dicking around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juvilado","CreatedById":106978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T21:18:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA must have\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E100% agree with the compass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip : If you are lost on EVA tryibg to get back to a ship, and not looking for a contract zone, then just set the ship as your target...
