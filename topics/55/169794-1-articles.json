I just can\u0027t see it; it\u0027s too small unless I stand and walk nearer to the TV. The current PC version has an extra control for UI scaling that would solve the issue: there is an global\u00A0UI scale control that works together with the UI flight element sliders,\u00A0and this overall UI control does indeed increase the size of the data in the map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll have to leave the game on console for now, as I don\u0027t like to stand up all of the time. That kind of negates the reason I bought the console version. I will play the current PC version instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my request is\u00A0(or maybe question)\u00A0when the console version moves forward will it include the global\u00A0UI scale modifier that is part of the current PC version? If it will\u00A0or not, would it be possible to beef things up so I could scale the map data be be even larger than the PC version would currently give when playing on a TV the other side of the room? Please bear in mind, developers, that peeps sitting on sofas 4 meters\u00A0from their TVs need to see orbital information too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope\u00A0readers of this\u00A0will understand that this isn\u0027t an angry rant; it\u0027s just that currently I really can\u0027t play the game on the sofa looking at my TV because I can\u0027t see the most essential information.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-19T11:51:12Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2018 11:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Fronto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
