The closest they got was 0.23.5 and that wasn\u0027t a major release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta starts when all major features you want in the finished game are present, and you\u0027re squashing any bugs that made it through Alpha (usually any that don\u0027t cause the game to be completely unplayable), and adding content and balance to the features you put in in Alpha. That\u0027s what Squad announced they would be at when they released 0.90 and one could argue that they made it. I think ISRU counts as a major feature but I\u0027d be willing to let that slide and say okay, it was tacked on at the end and so no bigs. Same with Female Kerbals. In the vast scheme of things its an important graphical thing but it\u0027s just a graphical thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReleased is when all major bugs are fixed. The game should VERY rarely crash and you should have no memory leaks. Everything should work the way they intend it it to. GUIs are tight. Every aspect of the game is balanced not just internally but with every other aspect of the game. Art assets are fantastic and polished. Brand new players can take the game, go into a locked room with no Internet access, and play it and have hours upon hours of fun with no outside help whatsoever - provided that player is of course interested in the game\u0027s concept and design. I truly hope that KSP will have all of these things on the very next version.

The code to calculate all those values will be almost completely different from whatever was in the old aero, especially the drag and somewhat the lift. The new code has to calculate drag as not some fraction of the mass of the craft but based on the size and shape of craft. Lift has to be revised for wings and now included for other large parts as well. The torques (pitching, yawing, rolling, including that of control surfaces) will have to be revised too. Values will have to be determined for individual parts as well as handling the effect of the whole craft, shape, stuff like area rule too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmost nothing of what came before can be used.
