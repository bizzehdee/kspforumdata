Mostly for landing jets and space\u00A0planes and other stuff. Not really for launching stuff though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, You could spend money building these at certain locations, and They would function as recovery sites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe put independent airports/launch sites that would not belong to you, but you could use them and pay a fee or something like that later, so You\u0027d have options If you for example asked to do a contract at the other side of Kerbin and do not want to spend half an hour flying back to KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother idea I have is tied to this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed that there are turbofan engines in the game which are very efficient, but well..too slow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike there isn\u0027t much things to do with the subsonic engines after You get the Panther.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my idea is to introduce these independent airports/launch sites that would act as corporations and give You contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts like: Ferry 4000 units of liquid fuel to the site, or build a LKO capable rocket( or a rocket according\u00A0to certain specifications) and ferry that to the site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just transport 3 Skipper engines to a certain site or things like the tourist contracts but with 10,20,17 or so Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m saying these because I noticed that there\u0027s a lack of things to do with jets and especially with subsonic jets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, atmospheric survey contracts are nice and all, but after a while They become tedious and boring.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso something for the contracts as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great If there would be a certain \u0022reputation\u0022 tied to certain contract types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, If I do a lot of test part or tourist or put satellite into certain orbit contract, the game would present me with more and better of these contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that\u0027s all, If there are threads similar to this I apologize.
