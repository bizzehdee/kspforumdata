There are no major differences between the two. Most mods have also made the transition to 1.2.2 and those that did not will probably work just fine. (If they didn\u0027t they would have been updated by now.)\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut to be sure simply make a back-up of your current game before you upgrade. KSP is DRM free so it is very easy to install the game multiple times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest making a fresh clean 1.2.2 install, re-download (to make sure you have the latest version) and install all your favourite mods and copy over your 1.2.1 career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EN.B.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Make sure you \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECOPY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E your save files and \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Enot MOVE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E them.
