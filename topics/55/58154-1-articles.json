Since I want to do all the possible science experiments on both bodies, I would either have to bring two mystery goo and material bays, or haul the lab. I really don\u0027t see why we need a 3.5 tonne part to reuse experiments, since all you are really doing is scrubbing the parts down and putting a new set of paint cans/goo blob in the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I suggest that two new parts be added: a canister of spare mystery goo blobs and a canister of spare paint cans. You could use the tweakables to adjust how many spares are in a canister, and it would allow a player to reuse experiments without needing a 3.5 tonne part that needs two crew to even use (you would still need one Kerbal to EVA out, grab a paint can/goo blob from the spare experiments canister, and put it in the experiment part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe disadvantage being that it doesn\u0027t hold any crew, experiments, or an infinite amount of new experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T22:53:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERadially Attached Experimental Data Storage Container: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370-Radially-Attached-Experimental-Data-Storage-Container\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54370-Radially-Attached-Experimental-Data-Storage-Container\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks perfectly in 0.23.
