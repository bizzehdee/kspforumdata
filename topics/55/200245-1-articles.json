There are certainly good jet engines in KSP but there may be some gaps that could use filling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Scimitar engine: The RAPIER without the rocket mode. Many \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E designs use only the jet engine mode of the RAPIER, trading its high top speed for its lower efficiency and using a dedicated rocket instead of the RAPIER\u0027s rocket mode. Maybe as a trade-off between the Scimitar and the RAPIER, the Scimitar could be lighter or more efficient, or cheaper. This engine would be used a lot for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Pulse jet engine: A very cheap and light jet engine for the beginning of career modes. Maybe have it replace the Juno in the tech tree and bump the Juno up a level, or maybe have the pulse jet down a level. The pulse jet engine would be a lot less efficient than other more advanced jets (1000-1500 Isp?) but it would be useful for puttering around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E area and getting some early game science, or for building micro jet engine craft, or for doing cheap contracts. The part number could be J-31, inspired by the Ford PJ31 pulsejet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Rolls-Royce Olympus: A very efficient jet engine that tops out at just over Mach 2. The Goliath engine would fill this role except it doesn\u0027t really look like it\u0027s a dedicated supersonic jet engine. If the Goliath does fill this role, then an actual GE90 that tops out at about Mach 1 would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Ramjet engine: An intermediate between the RAPIER and the Whiplash. The J58 wasn\u0027t a true ramjet and couldn\u0027t get as high of a speed as one. The ramjet would have intermediate efficiency and top speed. Maybe the Whiplash could be nerfed to accommodate this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Whiplash afterburner: The J58 had an efficient afterburner, so I feel like the Whiplash engine should have a more efficient dry mode and a slightly less efficient wet mode, just like the Panther engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Liquid air cycle engine or air turborocket: An engine that has high specific impulse at sea level and its specific impulse gets gradually lower as the atmosphere thins. Good for very high speed atmospheric flight but less optimal in space. This would be useful for large and streamlined craft. The RAPIER would fill this role except its rocket mode doesn\u0027t quite work this way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-A more realistic precooler: The real purpose of a precooler is to slow down the incoming air that comes into a jet engine, as well as cooling it down to increase the engine\u0027s efficiency. The precooler could maybe increase the Mach limit of any engine attached to it, and/or increase its specific impulse. For balance, its internal fuel tanks could be removed, while keeping dry mass the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Motorjet engine: Has a much flatter thrust curve than other jet engines and thus gives higher low-Mach thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.
