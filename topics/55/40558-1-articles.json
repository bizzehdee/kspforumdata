I can see why this makes sense for unmanned probes, but there could be a problem if this system is used for a full career mode. A player who wants to transfer his/her lander pilot(s) to a mothership and dump the lander before heading home (as in the classic Apollo mission profile) will not get credited for returning from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I misreading the file?
