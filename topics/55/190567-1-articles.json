with full power/fuel on the Flea as in said training\u00A0since the player can\u0027t be reasonably assumed to know more at this point -\u00A0goes to ~25km,\u00A0accordingly descends much more rapidly, and a Mk16 chute on either default or training\u00A0settings will either shred before opening fully, or not deploy at all,\u00A0no matter when it is staged.\u00A0 Unless you include a couple of goo canisters (the extra drag reverts the current Flea\u002BMk1\u002BGoo2 to approximately the same aerodynamics as the old Flea\u002BMk1\u002BGoo2 AFAICT -\u00A0probably reflecting that the aerodynamics of that configuration were\u00A0much more dependent on the canisters than I previously appreciated), modify the full-open altitude on the Mk16 to be MUCH higher (in which case the flight just gets tedious as Jeb slowly floats down),\u00A0or are savvy enough to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to ensure that you fall nozzle-first instead of tip-first (counterintuitive to a newbie, has to be activated before the problem becomes apparent,\u00A0AND is entirely contrary to the training), Jeb is one dead Kerbonaut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen physics\u00A0changes are made in the game, the training \u003Ci\u003Ehas\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eto be updated into consistency with those changes. \u00A0It\u0027s apparently been long enough since the training was resynced with the main game that it\u0027s now massively inaccurate relative to the current physics. \u00A0An update is accordingly absolutely called for. \u00A0Given that the Flea\u0027s essentially only role is (at most) that one first lower-atmosphere flight, rebalancing its capabilities to bring the updated hopper in line with the old one would work with respect to this particular mission. \u00A0Other training missions are probably less susceptible to such changes (maneuvers in vacuum being much more objectively calculable from first principles and hence less subject to changes in assumptions), but when it\u0027s the VERY FIRST flight a newbie can be expected to attempt, it\u0027s a big deal. \u00A0And said other missions really ought to be checked and updated too, in order to streamline the experience of new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot necessarily something that\u0027s going to be talked about a lot here - this audience is mostly veterans who, if they make a hopper at all, may be reasonably expected to squeeze every drop of potential science from it and hence will do OK thanks to the extra drag of the canisters. \u00A0And certainly don\u0027t customarily rerun the training at each update. \u00A0But for anyone who\u0027s entirely new to KSP, it\u0027s quite likely to be a dealbreaker to such an extent that they probably won\u0027t bother to comment on it -\u00A0just concluding\u00A0KSP to be horribly broken and reviewing it accordingly. \u00A0The mix of previous experience and recent newbieness lets me both spot the discrepancy\u00A0AND recognize the implications. \u00A0So unless Squad doesn\u0027t intend to sell a new copy ever again, attention to this aspect is called for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I did look pretty hard for prior comments along these lines, and found none which weren\u0027t essentially dismissed as clueless newbies. \u00A0Hoping that this will be counted as more convincing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-22T21:57:52Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2019 09:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Beamup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-23T00:37:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the launcher, the training missions have been woefully neglected for many years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-23T02:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou make a good point.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0physics simulation hasn\u0027t changed very much\u00A0in the history of KSP 1, although pointy craft did become\u00A0more slippery in version 1.2, three years ago.\u00A0 Still, the training missions do not introduce players to the real game, and this problem gradually gets worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forum is good for finding out why the game doesn\u0027t work like the tutorials (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/180460-why-doesnt-the-rocket-in-the-game-perform-the-same-as-the-training-rocket/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E) and the real tutorial for KSP is Scott Manley\u0027s videos, neither of which helps potential KSP players without fast internet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only hope I see is for us users to start posting improved Training Scenarios, using the methods Missingno200 discovered (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/183855-17-making-scenariorycustom-scenario/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3586656\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E).\u00A0 I have noticed that Squad has incorporated\u00A0solutions/bugfixes into KSP after users and modders have demonstrated them, so it can only help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-23T21:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223720142\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022190567\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221577061467\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the launcher, the training missions have been woefully neglected for many years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launcher is a travesty.\u00A0 Let\u0027s leave the first\u00A0thing most people may see broken since inception.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
