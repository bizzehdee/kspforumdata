I would place this suggestion somewhere in between making thrust vary with ISP rather than fuel flow rate (which is realistic, but doesnt drastically change the game) and random failures (which is also realistic, but really, really annoying). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I would think most people would rather squad, with its limited programming resources, dedicate its time to more pressing issues.
