Maybe even the Player\u0027s can choose which species they want to play as. AGAIN I KNOW THIS IS FAR OFF AND IS ALOT OF WORK. Even if this was implemented new \u0022spaceship parts\u0022 like those in Star Wars, Red Dwarf, Star Trek, Firefly, and who know what, all while keeping sanxboxy physics, SSTOs, exploration, and orbital maneuvers and mechanics. Not a total conversion, but maybe like an age system (early, mid, late, and apocalyptic) where in the early age, liquid fuel and cruddy ion engines, mid amazing liquid fuel, ok ion, and experimental warp according to the Alcubierre Theory on warp mechanics, late amazing ion, great warp and private stations, bases, and ships just for trade. Maybe like Sid Meyer\u0027s Pirates, only with what I said should stay the same earlier. Apocalyptic has no planets, missing from an unexplainable cause where orbital shipyards are floating all over systems and only some ships are piloted, so salvage is necessary to expand your ship and improve it. Weapons are a must, and salvage rays are needed without the apocalypse idea for a feeling of an actual career and life inside the game.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Perhaps a ship-purchasing system from shady builders and shiny, proud builders to sell you ships with whatever currency is implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:38:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just far off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlien societies are on the wat not to suggest list.
