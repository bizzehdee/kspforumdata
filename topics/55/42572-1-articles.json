It\u0027s a really simple thing: Time and time again we\u0027ve all seen the post made by a player new to the game asking why their spaceship controls suddenly stopped working partway into the flight. The new player is confused, doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s happening, and every experienced player immediately knows to suggest \u0022check your battery power level\u0022 as the first likely culprit. This is because we\u0027ve all made this mistake at least once when first playing the game and remember our own confusion over not knowing what was going on and why it was \u0022bugged\u0022 all of a sudden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo.... why not have an on-screen bit of text that appears when the game cancels an attempt by the player to perform a maneuver in which the cancellation is due to having no electrical power? It could be shown to the user in the same way as the little status message that says \u0022cannot switch vessels while throttled up\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Cannot perform action.

But at the same time the first time a person makes the mistake they will immediately know what happened and why, without asking the same exact question yet again, \u0022why did my controls stop working?\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cby","CreatedById":26505,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T08:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it would definitely help out new players and even some older ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T09:03:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Cby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T09:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExtent that to any reason input is ignored. Like timewarp. Like yesterday, i maneuvered around Duna with a multi-docked contraption bringing a station into its orbit. After a 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 turn, i had to go to the john and set the timewarp to a mere 10x. Came back and wanted to do some maneuvers, but the controls wouldnt respond. I was panicing, thinking the last turn might have been too hard for the docking ports. \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s try to switch command pods and see if that helps\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, i thought. But the pods wouldnt offer the option to switch. I was like \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4OMG- i totally broke the ship!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 And just before my face would be covered in tears and snot, i figured i was in timewarp. D\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4uh. A simple message \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4time warp is on\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, in the style and place of all the time-warp messages, would have helped alot. So devs: Please add a message to all if-statements currently just returning for any keys bound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
