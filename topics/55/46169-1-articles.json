For example, if I want to slingshot on the moon, it\u0027s hard to do it with the mouse, especially if you\u0027re far from it. It seems that there is some sort of acceleration of the mouse when you get very stretched ellipses. Maybe this can be corrected easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027d like to see an achievements list. For example: First Kerbal in orbit, first moon landing, first Eve fly-by, etc. This could also work in the sandbox. Fairly easy to implement I think... I have no trouble setting my own objectives, but this would be nice to have a list in-game. Could also include funny and/or difficult achievements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Since when you start you barely know how to fly things, the solar system map should have \u0027greyed-out\u0027 planets (or undiscovered), that you can\u0027t see for now.
