Is the OP asking for science to progress independent to missions? I thought they were just asking for science to progress during timewarp, but limited to the scope of the mission? Yeah, science will not just \u0022happen\u0022 when in timewarp, you need to actually do something to get a return. But I see no problem with putting a probe over to Jool, timewarping it\u0027s flyby and getting the 1000s of science in really quick \u0022time\u0022 (providing the probe has the transmission equipment etc).

For example, once you get the first solar panel power scarcity is no longer a consideration (for the most part). you do science, transmit till your battery is dead, and then timewarp to fill up your battery, and repeat. it\u0027s ignoring the fact that you can timewarp to overcome power scarcity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea better system would be if 100 electricity = 1 science, as a baseline. Science sensors would multiply the amount of science per 100 e, and transmitters would multiply the amount of electricity per 1 s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei.e. better science sensors gets you more science per power, and better transmitters transmit more science per power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esensors and transmitters would still have power requirements, so a sensor might use .5 e per minute, so it\u0027d take 200 minutes to get 1 science. but, if you only have one small battery, you don\u0027t have enough power to transmit it (possibly not enough to get home, even).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein the beginning, you benefit most by bringing all your experiments back, because without solar panels you can\u0027t afford to transmit the data. as you explore towards kerbol, your panels are more efficient, so you gain science quicker, but as you go to Jool, you need more solar or RTGs and better transmitters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can still have a max science per biome per sensor type, or some type of diminishing return. i sensor could degrade after being on for a long time, so that it produces less and less science per 100 e. that way you couldn\u0027t just leave it on all the time but only when it would be beneficial, like when you get to a new biome. some sensors, like thermometers and seismic sensors, should have a large max like 500 science, but a really slow rate, like .2 s /per 100 e, to encourage you to leave them on the surface for a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof course i don\u0027t know if these numbers work out at all but they\u0027re just an example. the idea is that you need some limiting factor to make you work for science, but the labor intensive clicking that it is now isn\u0027t fun or stimulating. having to plan a proper power/science budget (and making it work!) would be a lot more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T19:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo many posts, gotta quote them all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...nah. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my opinion is that to play a game, you have to play it within the game.
