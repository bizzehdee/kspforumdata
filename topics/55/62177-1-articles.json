Yes, it doesn\u0027t make sense, but on the other hand, you are giving control input, so it\u0027s doing what would be expected.

They move through input, and when you give turn input they move. This is expected and realistic. It is strange to you because you expect it to be otherwise, but your opinnion is not the default view.
