The rest would be spread out among the other sub-biomes inside that same biome. This would make the player have to travel/ explore, encourage the use of rovers, and makes the surface a little more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperiments that can\u0027t be (easily) reset would get all the science\u00A0the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T02:14:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunny.

For 50% of what\u0027s left, you need to land in another biome. Repeat until you have all biomes and all science, or the science you\u0027d get isn\u0027t worth it. Generally I suspect 2, maybe 3 biomes is all that\u0027d be worth it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-25T02:14:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2018 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
