It seems to me that its intended purpose would be a 2nd or 3rd stage engine (given its higher vacuum Isp and lower atmospheric Isp compared to the mainsail), but its low thrust (its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is fine, just its total thrust) is... not great\u00A0 I would envision it as something more like a 2.5m version of the Rhino.

Terriers have a better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E by a large margin, while keeping a very good vacuum Isp. If I had my way, rapiers would have a vacuum Isp between 320-340: their closed cycle mode\u00A0would still be objectively worse than any other vacuum optimized engine in the game.

Rapier closed cycle is marginal already, begging to be paired with a higher Isp engine and mainly being used to initially\u00A0 supplement the thrust of the higher Isp engine (such as LV-Ns, Rhinos, aerospikes, and now Cheetahs and... ughhh... the wolfhound). Halving the thrust would render it useless IMO, and I\u0027d just keep running them on residual atmospheric thrust and add more rhinos/wolfhounds or even vectors(while its Isp is not much better, it does have a GREAT thrust/Cross section area ratio)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Vector does need a rebalance.

Its also well suited to some specialty purposes (eve ascent vehicles for instance), so in those cases its worth the cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past many people complained about the Vector being \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

Balancing anything with cost seems a bit.. meh... due to sandbox and late career fund surpluses, but I see the cost as a way to encourage recovery of the vector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for control surfaces... yea, they seem a bit expensive, but... meh, many things have weird price ratios... even fuel is much more expensive relative to the cost of engines than real life... so I haven\u0027t really thought about it. The cost values they have now seem okay-ish to me, since many of the way the overpriced\u00A0parts still manage to be minor expenses (like the 440 fund ladders... sure its a lot for a ladder, but on a lander on top of a rocket costing several/tens/hundreds of thousands... who cares)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-07T18:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do agree we could use a big balance pass.
