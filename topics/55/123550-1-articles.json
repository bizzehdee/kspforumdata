Then when I get home and open KSP it would check my cloud/email/whatever and download any new ships for final edit and launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like a VAB app or SPH app......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think, and maybe incorrectly, that since there\u0027s no ships being flown the program doesn\u0027t have to work as hard.
