The Service bays are probably the worst new parts in the game, and the heatshields don\u0027t look to great either. Really the service bays are the second worst part models in the entire game, aside from the Poodle. Please, for the love of the Deep Space Kraken, let Porkjet redo it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel really bad for talking poorly about RoverDude\u0027s modelling because he is an awesome modder and developer and cool guy, but the models just don\u0027t fit in with the (very very good) direction Kerbal Space Program is going graphically. Porkjet ftw. Finally all the plane parts have been overhauled (Except for the small landing gear, which was apparently removed because it depended on 1.1\u0027s new wheel system) so the logical next step is rockets, then spacecraft. (That is, fuel tanks and engines, then command pods and stuff.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
