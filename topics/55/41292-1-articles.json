I had a suggestion I wanted to share, and a quick forum search didn\u0027t turn up an exact match so here it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands now [0.21], it can be difficult to duplicate a complex multi-part structure using symmetry, especially when there are multiple attachment nodes. For example, I was building a hollow cage structure the other day: a two-by-four pattern of M-Beams connected by Micronodes. I finished the assembly on 1x symmetry but then decided I wanted two cages on either side of the rocket (2x symmetry). Alas, I didn\u0027t build the cage outwards from a single attachment node but rather worked my way out from the main rocket body, and so I couldn\u0027t select the entire structure as one unit without rearranging the beams first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make things easier if there was a grouping function for parts in the VAB and SPH, whereby I could multi-select all the parts of an assembled structure (in my case, the cage) and group them as a single entity for the purposes of construction. It has been suggested elsewhere on this forum that parts should be physically welded together to create stronger structures, but my idea is different, and simpler. I don\u0027t want to change the number of physical parts, it\u0027s just that bundling individual parts into \u0022selection groups\u0022 would allow for easier symmetrical placement later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
