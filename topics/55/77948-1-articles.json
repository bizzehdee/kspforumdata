I second this. Problem is, how would I work? Would SpaceX do a collab like the NASA one? Or would squad simply do SpaceX styled or themed parts? Personally I would prefer a collab, for obvious reasons. Would we have engine clusters? Would they be mounts and multiple engines? How would they scale against the other engines in the game? How much would they cost? Where would they fit on the tree? How much SpaceX stuff do we want to add? Dragon, F9, F9H, FX, FXH, FXX? All points for discussion IMO.
