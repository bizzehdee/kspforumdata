Unless you\u0027re using jet engines, though, you\u0027ll typically want to keep the proportion between fuel and oxygen, specially if you don\u0027t want to transfer until filling one of the tanks. So I think it would be a good idea to be able to link both and start/stop the transfer for both of them at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T22:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFeature long overdue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
