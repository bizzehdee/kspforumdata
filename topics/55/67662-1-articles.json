I know that contracts are planned, but regardless I would like to share my vision on how I think career mode might work the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, science should not be directly related to the research unlocks. I think a more interesting way would be to track the following main variables: Funding, and tech level (available parts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunding would determine what you can do, of course. With good funding, you can do more missions, and if you have surplus funds, you can invest them into technology research to speed up the development of that particular technology. The funding could simply be the price of parts, although a more advanced system would also emulate mission upkeep costs (the salaries of ground control, maintenance crews, etc). Building re-useable spacecraft could be useful, however there would still be a cost associated in maintenance, repairs and fitting for new mission (space shuttle, awesome as it was, ended up hideously expensive to maintain in rotation).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of funding would be determined based on what kind of missions you do. Each mission could have three types of objectives: Political, commercial, and research objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe political objectives would mean high-visibility missions that can be used as propaganda tools. These would be done as \u0022government contracts\u0022 and would generally be given by long-term goals - like getting to the Mun by the end of \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ethis decade\u003C/span\u003E some time period. Failures could hurt your government funding, while successful completions of goals before time limits would get you better funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial objectives would be simple: You get contracted by some company to deliver a satellite with certain parametres and once you\u0027ve done that, you get paid for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearch objectives would be split into two sub-categories. The first would be scientific research, and the second would be technology research. Scientific research would be done by doing experiments, collecting samples, and delivering results to Kerbin for further analysis. The science research would not directly affect the research of existing technologies. However, doing a lot of science would possibly unlock entirely new technologies faster (such as high-tech propulsion technologies) and would also slightly affect the funding you get, since the science community would be advocating for good funding for the space programme. Some scientific instruments could be very expensive, however, and could take a long time to fabricate so missions would need to be planned long time in advance. Generic science instruments (like temperature, pressure, gravity and seismic sensors) could be cheap, but again as you use them you start getting more advanced versions (like goo canister or materials bay or a mobile laboratory). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETechnological research objectives would be done in the form of experimental missions, both in spacecraft and aviation. These missions would have a certain goal to be accomplished, and doing it would accumulate research on a certain category of parts. For example, high altitude supersonic aircraft mission would improve airfoils and air-breathing engines. A high-altitude atmospheric rocket launch would improve the engines (solid or liquid), and possibly fuel tank types available. Basically instead of just getting research points to unlock specific groups of objects, you would gradually improve the parts that you\u0027re actually using. If you make aircraft and fly missions with them, you\u0027ll end up getting better wings of different varieties. If you use rockets, you\u0027ll end up getting better rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of making a traditional tech tree with particular grouped unlocks, I would rather see a \u0022basic\u0022 form of all the important parts available from the start of the space program. You would have small rocket engines (liquid and solid), small jet engines, small fuel tanks, some basic airfoils and control surfaces, basic electrical power supply and probably one jet cockpit and probe core to use. By using them, the game would then make more advanced parts available based on what kind of technology research you\u0027ve been doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would avoid the annoying problem of not having any electrical power supply early on in the space programme - having a basic battery and APU (which when active would consume fuel) available would help with that. Old parts could also become cheaper to use as you unlock more advanced versions, since established technology is easier to manufacture by mass production than \u0022bleeding edge\u0022 technology - so you could choose between having heavier, smaller capacity batteries with cheaper cost, or lightweight, powerful batteries that cost a whole lot more. And, using APU would eventually give you other power production systems - like fuel cells, RTG, solar panels etc. In many ways, this would be parallel to the skill leveling in Skyrim, which is probably the best way of leveling up I\u0027ve seen in any game since you get better at things that you\u0027re actually doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleting tech research objectives would not yield any funds, but it would be necessary to complete them to gain ability to perform more objectives that bring in the funds. This would mean that exclusively tech research missions would be the most expensive mission type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissions could of course share different objectives. For example, a scientific mission can also have political objectives, like sending a powerful new space telescope to take beautiful pictures of the universe - the Hubble Space Telescope is a good example of how a particular mission can significantly increase the popularity of a space programme. Or, you could deliver several commercial satellites and scientific research satellites in one launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe important thing is that you should be able to assign objectives from a list to be completed on a particular mission, which would allow you to actually build your own mission with a specific set of goals, instead of flying pre-designed missions with fixed goals. The current Mission Control mod sort of does this, but I\u0027d like to see it refined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis kind of \u0022fleshed out\u0022 system for developing the space programme would in my opinion greatly increase the appeal of actually playing the career mode. You would have to choose between getting to the Mun as fast as possible in a Toyota Corolla, to collect the political reward for it and secure funding for your space programme - or getting funds more from the commercial sector, and developing your technologies using those funds before sending a more advanced spacecraft to the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: None of this is necessarily a suggestion to do it exactly like that. These are mostly general ideas; specific execution and balancing would need a lot of testing to make sure the game is enjoyable to play, progresses at a nice pace, and doesn\u0027t put you into a \u0022no funds\u0022 situation too often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arise257","CreatedById":104506,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T17:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI cosign this 100%.

Great. I\u0027d love to see such a system, and it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to implement as a mod (it\u0027d need another type of resource, though, to differentiate between scientific and tech-related returns.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tech advancement concept is nice, and I\u0027ve been thinking about making such a system for a while now. I think a good way to do this is something like assigning the R\u0026amp;D center to research a particular subject or multiple ones, at a fraction of the speed. As you get farther in the tech level, research becomes harder and you have to manage the productivity of your R\u0026amp;D center. You could speed it up by pouring funds into it (boosts speed of research according to a less-than-proportional function in relation to funding [the rate at which it consumes funds] ), doing science (boosts speed because scientists like you and attract good workers) and tech research missions (which become available during research and provide fixed boosts to the research progress for using a certain type of part, and more so for more advanced ones). When the research reaches, say, 30%, you get to know what parts will be available to you in the end and decide whether you want to continue or not. After it reaches 100% you could build a craft with those parts right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could also make the rocket assembly non-instant (and build multiple launchpads or VABs for less delay between launches), but I don\u0027t see that as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it hasn\u0027t been explicitly stated, I think the best way to approach political contracts (and probably the commercial contracts too) would be to make them expire at a predetermined date.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
