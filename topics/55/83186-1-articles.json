Basically just turning the lift off via dropdown menu would be fine. Or rather a slider?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Easier plane building. Just build the body, find the CoM, put some wings a bit behind it, there you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Relocating the COL would become less difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the current system, if you angle your wings to a positive angle of incidence, but not your tailfins, then the center of lift is pushed further to the front, the faster you fly. Nearer to the CoM. Possibly resulting in unstable flight characteristics. Wouldn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be the case with only the main wings providing lift. ( I know it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s a bit more complicated like that )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The ability to use wings as structural elements without messing everything up. You could build whole fuselages out of wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- aircraft would behave more intentional. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP can be a brilliant tool for understanding how planes work, and why they look like they do. You can build reasonably acurate replicas in KSP, with the correct distribution of wight, the right kind of propulsion (partly with mods), but you almost always have to cheat some controlsurfaces into the nose to get the right behavior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I got into planes through kind-of-replicas, because my first own designs have been utterly, utterly bad. Then I thought, what works in real life should be good in the game, right? And yeah, it worked... kind of.

Removing the lift is like removing the tail fin, or putting a fuel tank of equal weight in its place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the mechanic you describe, have you tried to angle the tail fin down slightly? This makes sure its angle of attack is always lower than that of the main wing. So you have fewer Lift when going horizontal (CoL in SPH), but still a correcting force when at a high angle of attack (so it still acts as a stabilizer). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my planes this even makes the plane pitch-stable (so hands-off it always pulls to a certain pitch angle that depends on airspeed).
