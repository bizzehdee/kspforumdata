One of the primary pleasurable skill-curves in this game is figuring out roughly what a rocket with various capabilities \u0027looks like\u0027 and figuring out how you can change that while still accomplishing your objective.

In that sense, it\u0027s a vehicle to have a good time learning more about rocket science. KSP gives players a real incentive to learn about things like orbital mechanics, momentum, the Tsiolkovsky equation, the vis-viva equation, etc. Providing a delta-V readout gives players an \u0027easy out\u0027, meaning it will stunt that knowledge-growth endeavour, much like having maneuver nodes means I don\u0027t have to learn anything about orbital mechanics other than some gut-feeling basics, instead of understanding the mathematics behind a Hohmann transfer. Some people find learning in this way enjoyable, whether or not you do. (I do.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor both arguments, a common response is, \u0022Then we\u0027ll make the delta-V readout optional, and you can turn it off.\u0022 But this misses the point. Human nature and human weakness are such that, if there\u0027s an easy way out, people will often take it, even if they wish they wouldn\u0027t.

One of the primary pleasurable skill-curves in this game is figuring out roughly what a rocket with various capabilities \u0027looks like\u0027 and figuring out how you can change that while still accomplishing your objective.

In that sense, it\u0027s a vehicle to have a good time learning more about rocket science. KSP gives players a real incentive to learn about things like orbital mechanics, momentum, the Tsiolkovsky equation, the vis-viva equation, etc. Providing a delta-V readout gives players an \u0027easy out\u0027, meaning it will stunt that knowledge-growth endeavour, much like having maneuver nodes means I don\u0027t have to learn anything about orbital mechanics other than some gut-feeling basics, instead of understanding the mathematics behind a Hohmann transfer.

The devs have repeatedly and without question stated that this game is about wonder and magic and all that.
