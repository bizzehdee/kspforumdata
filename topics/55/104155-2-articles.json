An LF\u002BO toroidal on a lightweight ant powered probe might add ~500dv, ensuring the LF\u002BO toroidal is often in the mix of possible design choices.

The round-8 is holding roughly half the total fuel load. Massing 501kg this probe has 1838 vacuum delta-v.\n\nThe ion powered probe carries a single PB-X150 tank. Massing 635kg this probe has 4817 vacuum delta-v. **The ion probe is not hurting for lack of larger xenon tanks.**\n\nNow sure, the ion engine doesn\u0027t have any larger tanks to move up to should it be needed, and sure that can be addressed, but I\u0027d argue the instances where larger tanks become really necessary (over and above merely adding an extra PB-X150 or X150R) are, outside ultra-lightweight grand system tours, few and far between.\n\nMeanwhile, the ant probe can move up to full size 1.25m tanks should extra DV be required, but to do so often ruins the aesthetic of 0.625m probes. Slapping on another round-8 will often get you the extra ~500 or so DV you may need whilst keeping an attractive visual style."},{"CreatedByName":"h4didact","CreatedById":140792,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T07:53:57Z","Content":"Don\u0027t worry guys!
