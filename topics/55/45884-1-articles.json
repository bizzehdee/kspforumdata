Doesn\u0027t hurt to dust it off again, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural generation is good... but it can go two ways -- the entire universe is procedurally generated, with every player\u0027s universe being the same (i.e., every player\u0027s seed is set the same, so they all get the same game, essentially), OR it can be that a few predefined systems exist, and the rest of the universe gets generated entirely randomly for every player. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, you end up with nice big universes without the need to download 10GB\u002B of game data to get it. The downside, however, is that all that data that would otherwise have to be downloaded then has to be generated and stored. Either way, KSP will eventually take up the extra 10GB\u002B at some point, whether the universe is created on first load, or it is created as one explores. In both cases, there is an awful lot of data to generate to populate an entire universe with stars and planets and so forth. It\u0027ll take a long time if it\u0027s done all at once, and it could easily slow down the game considerably, even if the procedural generation is sort of running in the background.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T17:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really think that sort of 10GB figure is necessary at all.
