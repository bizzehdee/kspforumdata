For example, increasing the temperature tolerance by 25 degrees of all wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy reasoning is this. I use the community tech tree, which expands the career mode a lot, but even though I use plenty of part adding mods, I deliberately avoided the \u0022end game\u0022 technologies, like the Future Propulsion or the Alcubiere Drive, because they are in my opinion overpowered and game-breaking. I was thinking how to utilise all those costly\u00A0high-tech research\u00A0nodes, which are currently empty in my game, without introducing anything game-breaking or superfluous, and came up with an idea of passive bonuses.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere could be multiple, very costly (science-wise) technologies, which would:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Increase the maximum temperature by a miniscule amount, like by 25 \u00B0C at level 1, 50 \u00B0C at level 2 and 75 \u00B0C at level 3.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Very slightly decrease the weight of a specific group of parts, say all the fuselage parts (fuel itself not included) are lighter by 2 %.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Struts and other structural parts get their maximum force durability\u00A0increased by a couple of percent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Nosecones and cockpits get their drag decreased, again very slightly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd so on and so forth; the possibilities are limitless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this idea is not at all unrealistic as new materials are being developed constantly to either improve the properties of existing designs or allow the construction of new ones. In terms of playability it would create sort of end game goals that are quite\u00A0attractive without being game-breaking, while at the same time not depriving the players of the \u0022good stuff\u0022 until the very end of the game. As\u00A0a career mode freak myself who loves to keep adding new planets and moons through mods, I would particularly welcome the drive and motivation to gather science from everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoooo... my question is, what is your opinion on it, and more importantly so; would it be even possible to implement via mods?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-12T14:54:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock Part Upgrade mechanism can be used to implement some of your ideas (not sure about drag changes).
