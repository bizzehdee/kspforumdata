This could be useful if you\u0027re performing a maneuver using all the remaining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of a stage, like if you\u0027re trying to reach a target periapsis for reentry while also reducing your velocity as much as possible. Could also be useful for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-only challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the option to have the maneuver node handles orient to the post-burn orbit rather than your current orbit. This would allow easy planning of plane-change maneuvers that don\u0027t change your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E using only the normal handles instead of having to fiddle with both normal and retrograde.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
