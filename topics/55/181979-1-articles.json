Which makes sense to some but for me, I change mods frequently and copy saves from install to install and not all of them can have the same mods. Some are outdated and some are not longer supported at all.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly I\u2019d just like a means to disable these messages when I load a craft.
