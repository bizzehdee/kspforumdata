The popup menu contains 2 lists: all types of resources you have a part for that stores it(and aren\u0027t already put into the part itself, also: no solid fuel or intake air) and all resources the part contains. When you click on the resource it is removed from the list of resources you can select and put into the resources your tank contains. The list of resources already put into the part would be devided into sections for each resource. Each section would contain the name of the resource, an X for removing it and 2 draggable bars. 1 bar would be for how much of the resouce you can store at max, the other for how much you store in it currently. Multiple resources can be put into a tank too.\n\nTo balance this all, the Resource modular tanks would have a volume property and adding a resource and dragging the max you can store decreases or increases volume(No silly MK2 short liquid fuel\u002Boxidiser\u002BRCS modular tank combo where every resource is 800 units full). If you store more resources in 1 tank at the time, the storage efficiency decreases. Max available is only changed in the VAB or SPH."}]}
