View full album](//imgur.com/a/WAxOB)\n\nScroll through the gallery above and you\u0027ll see some comic irony - the fragile Basic Fins can be used as basic hardpoints, but the Delta Deluxe cannot be used to support the tailplane of the aircraft. \n\nSetting Allow Surface Attach = 1 makes for a much sleeker and true to life appearance for this aircraft\u0027s tail assembly, as per the image below.\n\n![CCxTOuJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CCxTOuJ.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s not a big problem but thought for consistency\u0027s sake in community craft sharing, I thought it would be nice if future KSP updates could incorporate Surface Attachment = Allow for this part."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T02:19:23Z","Content":"I endorse this part tweak (it has since made it into my list of custom tweaks)."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T03:02:25Z","Content":"I also endorse this change.

For those wondering how to change the Delta Deluxe to allow surface attachment, find the Delta Deluxe\u0027s part.cfg at GameData\\Squad\\Parts\\Aero\\wingletDeltaDeluxe\\wingletDeltaDeluxe.cfg, open it with your favorite text editor, and change the line that reads \u0022attachrules = 0,1,0,0,1\u0022 to \u0022attachrules = 0,1,0,1,1\u0022 (no quotes).\n\nAlternatively, if you\u0027re not opposed to mods, you can use this ModuleManager config to do the above without touching your precious stock files:\n\n    @PART[winglet3]{\t@attachRules = 0,1,0,1,1}\n\nAll you do is get [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219), copy the above code, paste it into a text editor, and save it as a .cfg file in your GameData directory.\n\nPlease tell me if this doesn\u0027t work. I\u0027m still kind of a noob at ModuleManager and I haven\u0027t actually tested this to see if it works, but there\u0027s no reason why it shouldn\u0027t.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T05:01:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 05:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mythbusters844**"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:46:26Z","Content":"I remember in Beta and before I would use the Basic Tail Fin for T-tailed designs but now the Tail Fin had been changed to an all-flying design similar in shape to the F-15 Eagle\u0027s horizontal stabilizer. Without TweakScale to construct filler parts, it\u0027s difficult to use the Tail Fin as a static support structure.\n\nIronically too, other parts can be attached to the current Tail Fin even if it\u0027s inappropriate to do so, being an all-flying control surface.\n\nSo now the Delta-Deluxe is one of the few low-tech stock parts that look decent as a vertical stabilizer."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T11:41:22Z","Content":"Agreed."}]}
