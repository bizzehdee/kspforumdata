In most cases it is extremely difficult to follow the roads at the KSC. \n\nWhat if there was a tweakable for the turning radius? Tighter radii would of course be more unstable, and the rovers would roll, but you could also decrease it so you can turn better."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:47:50Z","Content":"Yeah! I would definitely decrease it by 70% (extreme flip carnavals on mun) but, tweakable wheels sound awesome. Maybe we could tweak the power/impact tolerance by 15% or 30% too for increased mass/electric usage so we could have faster rovers."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T17:02:18Z","Content":"Tweakables such as turn radius, torque, and suspension would all be nice.

Crab?)\n\n - The current speed of the vehicle (some steering mechanisms behave differently at different speeds) \n\n - The width of the chassis (or the distance between the wheels on both sides of the vehicle)\n\nI suspect that simply modifying a generic \u0022turn radius\u0022 variable would have less-than-significant effects on how tightly any generic KSP rover can turn in a general case. I\u0027d rather see new types of steering mechanisms / configuration altogether."},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitusII","CreatedById":57305,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T02:32:13Z","Content":"Since rover wheel tweakables seem to be a common request I should probably get back to work on my plugin...
