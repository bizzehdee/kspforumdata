I understand this aids in preventing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wobble, but the devs should seriously consider adding a \u0022response speed\u0022 adjustment to all of the control surfaces, well to really anything that moves (including landing gear).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing controll surfaces desperately lack is an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control toggle, just like how the gimbals on engines have. So, you could set stabilisers to be only controlled by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and have a slower response speed while the rest of the control surfaces be nice and snappy for only the pilot to control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 2.\u00A0Track Ir Support!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe keybinding section shows that trackir is supported, so why you no support!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 3.
