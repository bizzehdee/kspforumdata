So i decided to start a QoL-list. I remember something like that from another game and it \n\nwas really helpful. \n\nI intend to keep the OP updated, so feel free to share your thoughts on how the gaming experience can be enhanced.\n\nPlease don\u0027t suggest big features, game-changers or stuff alike. The list shall be a quick oversight tool for the devs and the\n\ncommunity as well. Please use a categorisation as i tried to do, to keep it as simple and short as possible. Please suggest \n\nimprovements on the list, categorisation etc., if you have them. Keep this thread clean and constructive. Please check the\n\nquestions on the end of this post and feel free to answer them.\n\ncurrent QoL-suggestions in categories: [**Flight**](%5Brelpath%5D%5B/relpath%5D#%252%24s)**,**

Ridiculous part testing contracts. *Please*, read over them and get rid of the absurd tests or requirements. Not just jets in space, but huge SRBs on the Mun, etc. Dumb.\n\n2. The number of rescue contracts has become absurd. At any moment I have more of those than I have astronauts in flight. If there are other Space programs out there, then I want a Space Race, not just evidence of their failures, which leads to 3...\n\n3. I like the rescues with crafts, but they need to check for player accomplishments better. Send a probe to the Mun, and you start getting rescues even from the munar surface. I haven\u0027t landed there yet (I landed a probe that was in orbit with some fuel left to get some science to unlock stuff I wanted for my manned flight). I\u0027m apparently about to send kerbals to the Mun, and the surface and orbit are littered with other kerbals.\n\n4. Survey contracts need to make sense. Not 2-3 readings in 1 area, and ONE as an outlier. Redo them so that they read as a mission to learn about a single region in detail.\n\n5.

Not that I\u0027m against such things in and of themselves, that\u0027s just not what KSP is about and I\u0027m 100% confident SQUAD is not going to go down that road. (The other day I was flying a cool plane I built over the mountains and as my finger kept brushing the trigger on the joystick I though \u0022Man, I wish there was some badies to take out\u0022 - so I understand, and I believe there are mods for that, but stock isn\u0027t going there)\n\nAs for part testing, in my 0.90 career I was loving them - they were a great source of science! Especially after I realized you could complete the crazy \u0022test x at y altitude and z speed\u0022 contracts pretty easily with rockets even though it\u0027s tempting to try with airplanes. That got nerfed in 1.0.x and although that messes up my lucrative strategy it was a good decision. In my new 1.0.x career I mostly ignore the part testing contracts; they\u0027re not a lot of fun and they don\u0027t pay much. However, when I got the chance to temporarily unlock a new mini-rocket engine for a Minmus lander to test on the surface of Minmus - win-win! Suddenly my Minmus probe was completing 4 contracts instead of 3!\n\nTesting contracts are awesome when they make sense as in my Minmus lander example. Most of the time they\u0027re ridiculous. But I wouldn\u0027t know how to code them to make sense more often. Who knows, maybe somebody is going to have a Mainsail landed on the Mun anyway; I look at that contract and say \u0022that\u0027s stupid, while I \\*might\\* pull it off, there\u0027s now way it would be worth it\u0022, and I expect 99% of players would agree, but for that one guy that contract is gold!"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:53:15Z","Content":"Some really good ideas!
