Fairly simple. We can turn them on and transmit but not see them without clicking on them or opening a bunch of annoying windows with Superkey... The display should also have a button next to it to activate the button to start the experiment. Just a little box next to the display information. Maybe even a toggle to turn on the display. It have a slot for every display capable item and maybe individual science piece. Also potentially to activate the other things on the science items like experiments. Call it the science window!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could also be used to save alot of keybindings for satelites and stuff if people use them.

All you do is reference a variable and do the same stuff that is available with objects in all languages.\u00A0 Buttons are not the hardest things in the world. It\u0027s literally the same coding for the already existing object in game. But in a different location. It\u0027s a very simple thing to add.

Even if they decided to do it the hard way and do low level programming for the fun of it it\u0027s not that hard. They should know way beyond that to even begin thinking of writing a piece of software let alone sell it. And any language or tool in existance will have easy ways to make these things.

That is completely insane and you have no idea what that or anything else in programming means. Don\u0027t bother people if you are just using your imagination. Especially not correcting people like that. You add one and reference a variable that is already exist. Learn some basic programming. People make those all the time in mods. They do make those but I have no interest whatsoever in making a mod. And It IS insanely simple to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t be argumentative with people about stuff you don\u0027t know the first thing about.

If you don\u0027t know anything don\u0027t tell people they are incorrect. Especially not this forcefully. Learn or ask about it instead. A lot of people in games like this know how to program. It\u0027s normal. it does not mean they feel like putting the work into a mod. Even if it\u0027s 5 lines of code. Some people don\u0027t like to do stuff like that for stuff they paid for. Or just don\u0027t in general. This game sadly and badly needs fundamental stuff done to it. I\u0027m not in the mood to do the programming for people I spent money for a service or product from(Or even if It was free.).

Why or how can I say this? Simple. Adding a display requires user interface work to alter the current user interface to display the data you request. Furthermore if you had formal coding education you would know that the addition or alteration of code can have unexpected issues with other code that may or may not be seen at first or even be easily found. You would also know that such changes would require significant development time that is to be blunt required elsewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also say it again, if you DO by some chance have the skill, tools and education to back up your claims that this is \u0022simple\u0022 you are by all allowed to modify the game by making said alteration yourself. I formally withdrawal myself from further debate on this with you and I also formally wish you well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
