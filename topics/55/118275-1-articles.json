I\u0027ve also documented much of it, and it can be read in my signature link. The Elcano uses mods but none of them alter physics, and the rover performs much the same when merely driving with all mod parts stripped, as I try to use mod parts in ways more interesting than merely \u0022make it easier.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose I just don\u0027t have the same assumptions. You took a \u0022small turn\u0022, the loss of traction may be sudden but it\u0027s hardly unexplained. Besides loss of traction to turning itself, it\u0027s possible you altered the slope on which you\u0027re driving, which could lead to wheels losing contact almost immediately by simple leverage. If you\u0027re zoomed out or it\u0027s dark, or the terrain is just hard to see, you can easily drive over small incline changes without even noticing, as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just feel most of it is exactly as I would expect, or even more forgiving than I would expect. On the real moon or Mars I expect most attempts at 50m/s\u002B speeds would be met with rapid unplanned disassembly as the reality of loose substrate and randomly scattered rocks sets in. Maybe there are some sites where it would be possible, but it\u0027s hardly the performance I\u0027d expect as a rule. The best information I could find indicates that the real lunar rovers top speed was something like 15 kph (according to curator of the Smithsonian, this was the only direct estimate of speed rather than extrapolation from distance/time I could find).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean to be contrary, I simply ask what evidence there is that any unrealistic behavior KSP rovers have is anything other than generous to the player. Is there any good source to suggest that strapping rockets to landing gear on Mars would have \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E results than it does in KSP? Cause that\u0027s quite effective in the game - if real life is actually way better than that and we\u0027re getting the gimped version of extraplanetary rocket sleds, I\u0027d definitely like to see some pics or video of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso because I don\u0027t mean to be unhelpful - try adding downthrusters of some kind, or at least a torque wheel. Maybe also check to make sure you aren\u0027t trying to drive around in all-wheel drive/all wheel steering mode, that can make you flippy all by itself and I still sometimes forget to fix that the first time I send out a rover. SAS works in a rover just fine and will act on the wheels even if you have no torque, and that can save you a lot of trouble when driving alongside slopes. Give them another chance man, check out my Minmus notes and you\u0027ll maybe decide they have some practical application after all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - My first attempt at stock munar rovers were extremely light and had no downthrust, and performed not TOO much differently than you describe, though I could still go 15-20m/s on relatively flat terrain, though braking in time to slow for a hill was a problem. The design changes I suggest changed all that. For merely driving reasonable distances (read: non-circumnavigational), I think a reasonably compact rover could accomplish a great deal, though due to the effect of downforce, bigger rovers are actually favored if anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T18:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sasquatch_Punter","CreatedById":115139,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s also due to the way the wheel module handles surface geometry; riding over an edge onto a \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E shallow decline causes momentary \u0022air\u0022, and the wheels end up bouncing around as they fight to regain traction.
