You crash, and your parts go sliding down a gentle slope for miles. Kerbals glide along the ground at high speeds instead of ragdolling properly. Even rovers can\u0027t handle more than 10m/s before their wheels start acting drunk...\n\nIn all honesty, driving is one of the least fun and most annoying aspects of the game for me, when it could be so much more fun. Imagine driving high-speed rovers across Duna or even Minmus without having to contend with the sliding bug? Or wheels that are responsive to braking and never take 30 seconds to go from 10 m/s to 0. \n\nImho the ground-related physics need love too."},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T06:41:03Z","Content":"I can absolutely say that rover wheels will hold up just fine and drive perfectly straight up to nearly 50m/s, at which point they break.

The problem is that traction gradients aren\u0027t implemented very well; you can see this in effect when your rover takes a small turn and you have a sudden unexplained loss of traction, followed by your wheels catching the ground and flipping your 3-ton rover on its ass. \n\nA light, 1-ton rover should have more than enough mass to get traction on Duna, but inevitably they start sliding and the wheels start lifting off the ground. This isn\u0027t a small, isolated incident, either; the forum search turned up a bunch of threads about this exact issue.\n\n@RIC, I didn\u0027t hear about that.

I\u0027ve also documented much of it, and it can be read in my signature link. The Elcano uses mods but none of them alter physics, and the rover performs much the same when merely driving with all mod parts stripped, as I try to use mod parts in ways more interesting than merely \u0022make it easier.\u0022\n\nI suppose I just don\u0027t have the same assumptions. You took a \u0022small turn\u0022, the loss of traction may be sudden but it\u0027s hardly unexplained. Besides loss of traction to turning itself, it\u0027s possible you altered the slope on which you\u0027re driving, which could lead to wheels losing contact almost immediately by simple leverage. If you\u0027re zoomed out or it\u0027s dark, or the terrain is just hard to see, you can easily drive over small incline changes without even noticing, as well.\n\nI just feel most of it is exactly as I would expect, or even more forgiving than I would expect. On the real moon or Mars I expect most attempts at 50m/s\u002B speeds would be met with rapid unplanned disassembly as the reality of loose substrate and randomly scattered rocks sets in. Maybe there are some sites where it would be possible, but it\u0027s hardly the performance I\u0027d expect as a rule. The best information I could find indicates that the real lunar rovers top speed was something like 15 kph (according to curator of the Smithsonian, this was the only direct estimate of speed rather than extrapolation from distance/time I could find).\n\nI don\u0027t mean to be contrary, I simply ask what evidence there is that any unrealistic behavior KSP rovers have is anything other than generous to the player. Is there any good source to suggest that strapping rockets to landing gear on Mars would have *better* results than it does in KSP? Cause that\u0027s quite effective in the game - if real life is actually way better than that and we\u0027re getting the gimped version of extraplanetary rocket sleds, I\u0027d definitely like to see some pics or video of that.\n\nAlso because I don\u0027t mean to be unhelpful - try adding downthrusters of some kind, or at least a torque wheel. Maybe also check to make sure you aren\u0027t trying to drive around in all-wheel drive/all wheel steering mode, that can make you flippy all by itself and I still sometimes forget to fix that the first time I send out a rover. SAS works in a rover just fine and will act on the wheels even if you have no torque, and that can save you a lot of trouble when driving alongside slopes. Give them another chance man, check out my Minmus notes and you\u0027ll maybe decide they have some practical application after all!\n\nPS - My first attempt at stock munar rovers were extremely light and had no downthrust, and performed not TOO much differently than you describe, though I could still go 15-20m/s on relatively flat terrain, though braking in time to slow for a hill was a problem. The design changes I suggest changed all that. For merely driving reasonable distances (read: non-circumnavigational), I think a reasonably compact rover could accomplish a great deal, though due to the effect of downforce, bigger rovers are actually favored if anything.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T18:47:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hagen von Tronje**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sasquatch_Punter","CreatedById":115139,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T16:29:38Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s also due to the way the wheel module handles surface geometry; riding over an edge onto a **very** shallow decline causes momentary \u0022air\u0022, and the wheels end up bouncing around as they fight to regain traction. On heavier rovers the suspension is loaded moreso to both decrease this air and push the wheels into the declining surface, therefore you have better handling of edges. The problem is that this isn\u0027t all that realistic.

IRL a rover on a low gravity moon is going to have to go very slowly, because less gravity = less tire traction, and on top of that there are no paved roads but rather loose, dusty regolith, which means *even less* traction. That said, I don\u0027t think it would be fun AT ALL to explore Mun in a rover going 15kph. Realistic, yes. But boring as heck, and I\u0027d rather just EVA a kerbal and jetpack to where I need to go.\n\nSo to up the fun factor, we need unrealistically good traction that lets us speed at 30m/s across rocky, uneven terrain.
