All of the spaceplane parts seem really...below the average quality of rocket parts. I mean, they\u0027re good for a mod, but for the stock game, they really need some work. I think they realize this and since they got B9(Artyom, I think) working for them, we might see some amazing spaceplane/shuttle parts coming whenever they get around to reworking the aerodynamics and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, \u003Cem\u003Euntil\u003C/em\u003E they rework aerodynamics, we don\u0027t really need new spaceplane parts. When we get science, life support, more station parts and so on...then we\u0027ll actually need something like a shuttle delivering those parts and modules to orbit regularly and that would be a really good time for them to introduce cargo bays, heat shielding(if they bother with that) and so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, it\u0027s going to happen...it has to. Unfortunately, we\u0027ve got to wait a while for it. On the plus side, the next couple patches are going to be really exciting, so we\u0027ll have plenty of stuff to keep us busy until they get around to reworking aerodynamics and spaceplane parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skylid","CreatedById":43125,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T20:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei agree, but the sooner the better\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dagg215","CreatedById":58382,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T22:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt should happen before beta, With B9 in Squad now.
