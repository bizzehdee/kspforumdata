Everytime you look up on the launch pad you\u0027ll see the faint crosshairs drift by. All they need to do is change those crosshairs to a white dot and it\u0027d be perfect. The range indicator would only show when you mouse over it..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is one thing that be hard to code in. The dot should only appear if the object is being lit up by the sun. Meaning you\u0027d only see it a few hours after sunset and before sunrise just as in real life depending on the crafts altitude. You won\u0027t be seeing any satellites at midnight..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s that apparent magnitude thing I mentioned. The brightness of the dot should go by the size of the craft and how many solar panels are on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another thing.. if its a piece of debris...
