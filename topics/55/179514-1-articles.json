Still, as I ALWAYS (and only :-D ) use infinite propellant.... (it\u00B4s on the 1.5.1. version, for win10 64bits)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may have noticed, but when you click \u0022Infinite Propellant\u0022, the electricity goes infinite as well. Despite it does NOT become activated on the F12 mark,\u00A0 once you\u00B4ve clicked the propellant, all the vehicles stop consuming electricity as well. It\u00A0does not work the same on the vice-versa, which means once you click \u0022infinite electricity\u0022, the propellant still goes down as you use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u00B4s deliberated, \u00B4cause I saw it happening\u00A0since my first gameplays (1.4.5 \u002B Making History).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCould it be \u0022rearranged\u0022 for future upgrades?
