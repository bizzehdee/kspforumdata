My alternate suggestion for what might be a quick and easy short-term fix, is to have some sort of warning popup on quick load instead, if you try to quick load a save that\u0027s older than a threshold, or maybe on all quick loads, telling you the date and time of the last quick save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grover","CreatedById":11972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T10:59:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit would be very hard to implement, since your quicksave is currently saved to your persistence file. there isnt really anything like a single flight going on, since every flight is being calculated at once, and some people fly composite spacecraft, with detachable (and occasionally re-attachable) landers, tugs, satellites etc, and these would all have their own version of autosave, but what happens if you make a first save with one flight, then another with a later flight, then influence the second flight with the first, then load the first flight? does the second flight also revert? if so, how?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eotherwise, i can only imagine that you want to run two missions at once, where the activity isnt totally on one vessel at a time, so you want to autosave before each moment of activity, but then if you autosave after each sucessful activity, then if you make a mistake, your autosave will always revert you to the last point you were still on track\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei cant personally see a benefit to making them flight specific, but a simple dialog box COULD work. though judging from your join date i doubt you were playing in the older versions where the \u0022End flight\u0022 button was on the ESC menu; even though there was a confirmation dialog box, people were so used to just pressing the button that they clicked it without thinking, then realising that they\u0027d destroyed their multi-mission space station in a matter of seconds\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T12:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo it should not.
