(in reality a free falling object rotated off center does rotate perfectly around its com only when you stop applying the torque and its rotating free, until that its center moves on a tiny elliptical spiral based on the starting resultant force. im not sure if im clear.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T17:25:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 05:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tuareg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T17:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe angular momentum of a closed system must remain 0.
