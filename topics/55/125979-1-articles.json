If I propose it is because I strongly think it is worth this effort, and it could bring this game from being one of the best of the decade, to one of the best EVER.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gave a brief look at the \u0022suggestions\u0022\u00A0in this forum thread. Most of them are about parts or other game features improvent, or just about some aesthetical thing, which I am afraid I am not that interested with. Very few suggestions are about a complete overhaul in the Game design and few take in consideration its details. A very few of them anyway contained something you will find here as well and I tried to elaborate them my way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMain improvements and overhauls for future KSP\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think KSP in the current state is a raw diamond. I\u0027m not criticizing developers in other way than using the 1.0.x number for the last 6 months versions. KSP is still far from being \u0022completed\u0022\u00A0and this is great news for everybody.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe overhauls or improvements I propose for the new 2.0 version of KSP are these (I will see only some of them in detail):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENoob/kids/scenarios/tutorial mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLet\u0027s face reality: KSP is a very HARD game, and recent updates (0.90 and 1.0.x) made it even harder. We definitely need some deep if not radical improvement in the way KSP is presented to both noob \u0022serious\u0022\u00A0and to casual/young players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I started playing back in 0.23 it was very hard to find out even the basics of ignite or manouvering your 1st rocket. It was really frustrating: I literally spent hours in understand it, and I am the patient/\u0022smart\u0022\u00A0of player. Things didn\u0027t improve in latest releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I recently had to explain basic KSP to some 8-11 years old kids, they understood all of it in few minutes, only because they had a teacher behind them. One of them even hooked on the game (her mother still somehow hates me). If those kids had been alone with the game they couldn\u0027t do NOTHING in literally days of playing and there would have been NO HOPE they wouldn\u0027t quit the game in maybe just a few minutes. This is a big goof IMHO. However I have many fantasies but no serious concrete idea on how to solve this. I bet there\u0027s plenty of ways anyway and KSP developers should redirect lot of efforts in this direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, KSP has...\u00A0NO MANUAL??? Or a simple \u0022How to get started\u0022\u00A0guide. This is hard to believe. There are people out there who don\u0027t go to the toilet without a manual! We almost completely rely on the user generated wiki or on video tutorials! this has to be solved.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELocalization\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo me puedo creer que un juego inventado en M\u00E9xico por una mayor\u00EDa de programadores mexicanos a\u00FAn no tenga una versi\u00F3n en espa\u00F1ol!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn opening to some of the most important languages (Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese...) is a must in order to widen to the potential young and casual public which KSP lacks mostly. Kids may love Kerbals if they could understand what they say!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplayer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for coming again on the subject. I will not treat this with any depth. I only want to stress out that developers should keep the multiplayer option open, which means that they should include in the code basic function to manage many players connecting to the same universe, and a time-management system, as well as examining some online service to helping multiplayer and massive multiplayer beeing a reality.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAI and automation\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAutomation of vehicles and very basic decision making should be included as soon as possible to help the player in otherwise repetitive manouevers and missions. E.g. some Mechjeb-like modes could be unlocked after a pilot has succesfully gained experience in some manouevres, and some automated hardware (such as the Mechjeb modeuls) will be available as soon as the player correctly manage to perform them once or a few number of times. AI should be developed also to improve the \u0022multiplayer\u0022 concept (the AI is the other player, or the AI replace players which can\u0027t play in some realtime running game)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe XXXX connection\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a huge fan of XXXX (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) games such the Civilization / Alpha centauri / Master of Orion sagas. The \u0022eXpand\u0022 feature is already built in the current game core concept, and it could hardly be better. The \u0022eXploit\u0022 one is also beginning to be included with the career concept and with the mining thing (more of it would do no harm, anyway). The \u0022eXterminate\u0022 one refers to the warfare nature of such XXXX games, which is not really that needed in KSP type of game. Anyway, the cooperative/competitive mode with humans/AIs should be integrate sooner or later in KSP, linking to the multiplayer thing already being discussed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I REALLY REALLY care of and miss is the \u0022eXploration\u0022 thing, which I\u0027ll discuss in the next point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe eXplore overhaul\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can the \u0022eXplore\u0022 thing have been left almost completely out of a spacefare game? The reason is that KSP started as a pure sandbox game without any restriction (unlike frequently compared game Minecraft).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode had been criticized by old players because it violated this \u0022free\u0022 style game. However this was a perspective issue: it has been career mode that started out an actual game out of a great but experimental toy which was KSP before 0.24 That was a great move, the greatest of all, and introduced the \u0022eXploit\u0022 concept in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, the game almost completely lack a serious \u0022eXplore\u0022 feature and this is the biggest of all KSP issues, by far. It is like building a fantastic game about car racing, creating a great graphical and physical engine with a lot of depth and great gameplay interface, in which you can drive in a detailed world with your great F1/rally/custombuilt car, and then failing to include actual car races in it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLook at the 2 of the most known and praised XXXX games listed above: they are about spacefaring and spaceexploring. That\u0027s not a coincidence: exploration of space is something that inspired generations of humans in many many decades now. eXploration is also a key feature in most game genres with more depthness, including RPG games such as Fallout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere did KSP failed in exploiting the \u0022eXplore\u0022 thing? By not including two major features,each of which could be considered an entire overhaul on its own, but which in my opinion are strongly connected and almost part of the same whole: the \u0022astronomy\u0022 overhaul, and the \u0022random procedural generated bodies\u0022 overhaul.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAstronomy overhaul [EDIT: some comments refer\u00A0at this as \u0022fog-of-war\u0022 feature]\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a current KSP game you are given from the beginning full knowledge of the entire Kerbol System, i.e. of the entire known universe. We already know where each planet and body is, with the exception of asteroids. We also can have a complete knowledge of distant bodies\u0027 surfaces and many scientific details, and actually see and read them in map mode, without even having built our 1st rocket. While some of these aspects are somewhat consistent with real life actual conditions (astronomy and solar system knowledge were already very advanced when the 1st space missions lift off our asses from the Earth surface), this still is a huge spoiler to a game which is \u0022scaled down\u0022 from actual reality to be more FUN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn actual \u0022ASTRONOMY\u0022 and \u0022PLANETARY SCIENCE\u0022 system should been implement in a way that the game gradually discover bodies as well as scientific details and images about them, beginning from a starting point in which we know of the existence of very few or no bodies, or we have only fuzzy info about them (fuzzy images, fuzzy orbital and physics details, inaccurate scientific datas...).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdvances in Astronomy, Planetary Science, KSC buildings, space telescopes and - even more important - actual Exploration Missions gradually improve our understanding of such objects (including Kerbin), gradually filling and improving our actual Map of the Universe, facts about bodies, and also bodies/aircraft orbit understanding and visualization. [A silly and fun way to start this in an actual game would be to send a Kerbal out of the KSC buildings and \u0022EVA report\u0022 looking up, discovering a very big fireball in the sky and call it \u0022Kerbol\u0022 or whichever name we give to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically speaking, this of course will not be as easy to implement as the \u0022fog-of-war\u0022-like features in XXXX games (undiscovered part of the planet/universe is blacked and unkwnown to the player) and it maybe requires a whole rethinking of the actual displaying mode of the universe both in Map mode and in actual normal view mode, in a way that the player can\u0027t have spoliers in any way. E.g. an actual Map of Kerbin (that is: the Map view mode) can be unlocked only after having \u0022understand\u0022 that it is round (e.g. as soon as a Kerbal reaches some height, or a probe reaches some distance from the KSC). A partially darkened map should then be displayed, till all parts of the planet are discovered through actual missions and observations. It would also be great to have different layers of knowledge about map (from fuzzy to more detailed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I have dozens more ideas about what this whole thing should actually look like. too many to list them here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural random generated bodies Overhaul\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock KSP bodies are great, really. However, if we implement the Astronomy Overhaul, and we keep the KSP stock bodies, we lose 50% of its purpose, and 99% of it beginning from the second career we play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the reason we should give the option (well, it should be the actual default option) to start a Non-Kerbol universe. At the start of a new (career) game, the program generates a new procedural random Solar System, either based on fixed default balanced parameters (to make sure we keep the pace and difficoult level of the game as close as possible to stock KSP) or on manually tweaked parameters (to have very different solar systems, maybe harder or easier to explore than stock one). Kerbin also should be somewhat random, both on physical properties (but only very slightly differing from stock ones) and in its map and biome configuration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome have pointed out that random generation could last hours. Well, if this is a real issue for some CPU, then a workaround could be building a whole online library of already built \u0022balanced default\u0022 - and maybe manually selected - downloadable solar systems. I bet it would be easy ot host literally dozens of them to make sure each player will not to come back to an old one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural Wiki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we implement the Astronomy overhaul and/or the Procedural Random bodies overhaul, we must put our hands on a procedural custum Wiki, i.e. one that slowly unfold and rectify as more details are known about the Universe, and which is able to display procedural generated data from each random generated universe. The concept can be expanded to include the technological improvement (articles about parts anc technical concepts will be revealed when needed) The wiki will definitely already include fixed articles about gameplay, ksp, kerbals, and general physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wiki could be available offline, \u0022in game\u0022, and/or online (each article is automatically generated and updated from the current game status and from the savegame and planetary seed, which may be stored in the server in case one wants to read some article when not playing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used the term Wiki however I fully understand that only part of it can be generated by users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this huge amount of ideas and suggestions will not scare developers.

Maybe the \u0022Kids mode\u0022 could be a difficulty option (not called \u0022kids\u0022, of course) kind of set before 0.90: no heating, basic-placeholder aerodynamics and some sort of guidance overlay for common maneuvers (ie, taking off). Heating and aerodynamics can be disabled now, but you have delve into the debug menu, instead of hitting a shiny, big, \u0022easy mode\u0022, button.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for an astronomy mode, well, it would break immersion if Kerbals didn\u0026#39;t know a lot of their solar system before they start to fire rockets, but some data could be hidden from view until either a probe gets send or an expensive telescope (say, a Kerbal version of the Hubble) gets built. So you start the game knowing, for instance:\u003Cbr\u003E\nMoho, Eve, Duna, Dres and Jool exist. Eeloo\u0026#39;s existence is still theoretical at this point (say, Pluto before 1930. I don\u0026#39;t think it breaks immersion). All moons except Gilly are also known. Eve, Jool and Duna are known to have an atmosphere, but details are fuzzy. Whether Laythe\u0026#39;s has an atmosphere is a matter of debate. Maybe Pol and Bop aren\u0026#39;t known either, similar to how the Voyager and Pioneer probes discovered plenty of moons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo you need to put a telescope (and unlock the technology for it) in LKO to unlock a lot of this information (for instance, confirmation of Eeloo and Gilly\u0026#39;s existence and orbits) and you don\u0026#39;t get information on the atmospheric composition nor surface maps of any body until you don\u0026#39;t send a ship there. This may encourage going \u0022probes first\u0022, or sending manned orbiters which may or may not include landers, because you don\u0026#39;t know for which conditions the landers are to be designed for (hey, right now you can\u0026#39;t see that information ingame either!). There is a mod that does something like this, but claiming so would be like not criticizing The Elder\u0026#39;s Scroll\u0026#39;s Oblivion\u0026#39;s leveling system because there are mods for it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOf course, this works best in procedural generated solar systems, as anyone could get all that information from a walkthrough on the Internet anyway on the fixed Kerbol System.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd critically, the game needs something to do once you finally land somewhere.

As you put it, random procedural solar system would add much more sense to the astronomical pack, and I would say also viceversa.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour point is good (we do know enough to be interested in the subject but too little to actually know what to do exactly before some more exploration and science). However, the quoted statement has its answer in my post. What you have to do is TO EXPLORE. That\u0026#39;s the reason I would without doubt start with some minimal knowledge of the Universe, and let the most obvious \u0022discoveries\u0022 were something like a how-to tutorial for basic interface usage. (To discover Kerbol you just have to have a EVA report in Kerbin), to find out Kerbin is round you need to go far away from KSC, and so on...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI saw literally dozens of good (and even not so good) games that rely on this very simple \u0022storytelling\u0022 structure: know just the bits at the beginning, and then discover more and more as you advance and refine your skills. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThe colonization thing is accessory and needed if you want to further discover more and more about outer planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr saying in othe way: you would love to colonize the Mun so you can build there a better shielded telescope to sound the very deeps of space. You\u0026#39;ll need to put your ass to Duna to harvest lot of precious fuel for interplanetary missions. And you just need a base on many bodies to have it easier to move around them and science the f**k out of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the key is that the player should actively desire more and more knowledge of the Universe (and Kerbin also is part of this mistery: some early exploration will be on Kerbin remote biomes and regions), and achieving this desire is very simple: just show a little bit of it (a phantom planet a drunk astronomer swear was there last night, glimpse of some liquid thing on Eve\u0026#39;s surface, something that shields Kerbol light with annoying regularity, scientific debate on if this body is actually twin planets, and so on...). \u003Cbr\u003E\nMystery will be the real reason to wake up every day and climb on a rocket (or build better crafts, or accept \u0022boring\u0022 contracts, or aim to some specific technology, or hiring more scientists...)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I see it: the general 1.0.x game balance and gameplay is already almost perfect for the task of implementing my suggestions of Astronomical and Procedural overhauls, and don\u0026#39;t need any real improvement other than performance ones because the kind of games that these new features would enable would be really gigantic.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso I read TODAY about the KSPedia. Sorry I really didn\u0026#39;t know it existed. Much better then: I hope the developers will put on it the right adjustments to grant future compatibility with procedural generated knowledge.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-26T19:02:28Z","Content":"\nFull support. Gonna rep you. But one thing I kinda would like to add on is that the procedural bodies can be in fact used to make moar solar systems. If a star generates then a certain # of planets can then generate in X amount of radius. And stars can only generate 10 k km from eeloo orbit. Btw, multiplayer is probably going to be seen in 2017 or maybe 2018 at best. Multiplayer implication into a physics game is going to take INSANE amounts of coding and looking at that it took them at best 9 months to port the game to u5(don\u0026#39;t rush this is not an offensive comment) it will take them waaay longer to implement multiplayer.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T03:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, entirely, OP, and about 1.5 years ago, my first few posts were all very similar to this one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe number one issue with \u0022career\u0022 is the lack of exploration due to everything being known.
