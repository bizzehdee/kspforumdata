Personally, I\u0027d like something that still required something to be built one either side. For the Star Gate type thing, it\u0027s just an entry and an exit. For the Mass Driver, I was imagining some kind of \u0022throw and catch\u0022 system. Personally I like the latter, simply because it seems closer to reality. In fact, it could add layers of difficulty. Because the \u0022throw\u0022 end would be accelerating a ship to interstellar speeds almost instantaneously, it would be ill suited for anything living. So you would have to build several gateways within the Kerbol system to accelerate, and then more in the other system (Alpha Kentaruai?) to \u0022catch\u0022 the ship at the other end. \u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t remember where it was that I saw this, but I do recall it was being considered as a realistic, albeit distant, concept for interstellar travel.

Don\u0027t get me wrong, a multiple star system, system, would be interesting and fun to explore, but it\u0027s not like anything that we\u0027ve seen.
