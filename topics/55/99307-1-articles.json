You come up with even a decent rocket in KSP, and it will literally never fail. There is no chance for random failures. What\u0027s the point of a launch escape system? There used to be some random failures on some designs (I had a rocket that would randomly explode in a spectacular fireball about 1 in 20 launches), but with the stronger parts patch in particular, these kinds of things have dissappeared. (Also, fixes of Kraken-like behavior helped remove random explosions.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that KSP is missing some explosions. Real rockets aren\u0027t as dependable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would propose a new system of random failures. It would have at least three aspects-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Random failures. Engines can randomly explode. Parts under stress can randomly break. Decouplers can randomly decouple. That sort of thing. It would make flying rockets much more interesting, because now there could be a chance that something would go wrong! Your Kerbals would actually be risking their lives when flying into space! You might actually need that launch escape system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Quality Control- Random failures, by themselves, would suck, and most people would hate them. There must be ways of controlling random failures and mitigating losses besides just blind luck. So I propose quality control. As you advance up the tech tree, you\u0027d get better quality control (reduced chances of failure). You could also apply quality control on an individual basis on rockets you fly, for an additional cost. For example, the same rocket could go fly inexpensively for unmanned payloads, but when carrying Kerbals, you would want to spend some additional funds on quality control to \u0022man rate\u0022 it. And you\u0027d spend an insane amount of funds on quality control for an interplanetary transfer ship, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC) Insurance- You could purchase insurance for your rockets, so that if they fail you are refunded- just like real commercial space launches! It might be difficult, however, designing a system that can accurately detect a failure. For example, if one of your rocket\u0027s fins fails, you\u0027ll probably be fine, but a blind insurance system, that just refunds you if there is a failure, would think your rocket failed. Perhaps the insurance could work like the \u0022revert\u0022 button, allowing you to file a \u0022claim\u0022, immediately ending the mission and refunding you. Your insurance payments would go up on future rockets if you file a claim, keeping you from abusing the feature. How that would work for manned flights though, I donno.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I think that random failures, and the features that would go with them like quality control and insurance, would be excellent additions to the game somewhere down the road when it goes off (new planned) feature freeze, or in KSP 2, if there ever is such a thing.

Perhaps a new kerb could be added in one of those buildings. However, I disagree with your example of random decouplers firing. As far as I know, decouplers use explosives to slice your rockets in half, so they would have to be handled carefully. Perhaps a better idea would be to have fuel tanks randomly start to leak.
