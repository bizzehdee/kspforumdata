This is useful (I definitely like the large diameter core), but the variety seems a bit pointless right now. As soon as you unlock the first probe, you\u0027ve got the full functionality of Kerbal programming, then you spend another thousand science points on fitting that computer into different boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I propose is that the different probes have different levels of functionality. The Stayputnik, for example, would be the simplest, capable only of activating stages. You could launch it using a fin-stabilized rocket, but you would be limited to suborbital (or escape, I suppose). You could still recover it for science, but it couldn\u0027t perform experiments, steer the ship, use rcs, sas, or anything else. In return, it would be extremely light, and use less power. The HECS core would be next, allowing basic maneuvering (but maybe only near Kerbin). They probes would become progressively more advanced, allowing SAS, RCS, maneuver node use, rover wheel control, and so on. The price for this would be increasing cost (science and money) and power requirements. Obviously, all of these capabilities should be available in all three sizes, I\u0027m not suggesting that capable computers have to be big. The manned pods would not be restricted in this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother capability would be in \u0027processing power\u0027. Basically, before any data can be transmitted, it is first processed by the onboard computers. If those computers are weak, the data volume is increased, and the maximum science value obtainable through transmission is reduced. This part would also apply to the manned pods. The one-man pod wouldn\u0027t have much computer capacity, the three-man would be better, the crew tank would be even better, but none would be as good as the best probe. This would give some incentive to bring a probe along as a processor, though it still wouldn\u0027t be as good as sample return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T17:32:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like a good idea, but I would be worried about certain peoples probes no longer functioning just because they liked the look or size of different probe bodies. This could be fixed if you could upgrade the earlier probe bodies with better capabilities. I\u0027m not sure how I feel about the data processing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T17:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I think that you should have it where, when you unlock the next tier probe core, all the previous cores are brought up to spec.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunaii","CreatedById":12026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T18:09:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to be able to use any probe shape you wanted, but my thinking was that even once the more advanced cores were unlocked, you might still choose to use a less advanced model to save on cost (an atmospheric probe deployed to Eve by a larger ship, for example, would only need staging control and transmission capability). Perhaps the player could choose which computer to load into the probe when it\u0027s placed? Or maybe, once tweakables are implemented, the cores could become storage units. You could choose one, then put in the various control systems, processing units and maybe data storage units. Each one would add a bit of mass and take up a bit of space, but a lot of power and $.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
