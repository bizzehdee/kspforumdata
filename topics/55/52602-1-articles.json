I think that works great for now. But do you think, with Career mode anyway, assembly might actually take time in the future? Like after you\u0027re done designing, in addition to the eventual cost in Kerbal dollars, there will also be a \u0022cost\u0022 in time; like a certain rocket will take 3 game days to assemble and prep for launch. I think it could add an interesting and challenging aspect to planning for launch windows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent here is not to make you sit there and watch a progress bar. It\u0027s about having to plan ahead, to think carefully and develop a strategy. If the rocket is going to take 3 days to build then all you have to do is advance time past that and you\u0027re good to go. So to go along with this I guess you would also need to ability to speed up time on the \u0022Space Center\u0022 screen, but that\u0027s a relatively minor change. So, it\u0027s not about forcing the player to sit there and wait for construction to finish \u0022just because.\u0022 It\u0027s about asking the player to make meaningful choices - \u003Cem\u003EI need to launch in 2 days... Adding those extra parachutes will take an extra day. Hmmm, I\u0027m sure the Kerbals will be fine without them! \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the depth and strategy I\u0027m already seeing with the tech tree.

One of the things that differentiated the U.S. And Soviet space programs early on was that NASA stacked their rockets on the launch pad, so it took a number of days to recycle the pad and get the next Gemini ready to fly a rendezvous mission, whereas the Soviets rolled their rockets out to the pad whole on rail transporters, so they could launch Vostoks a shorter time apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Odo","CreatedById":69000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T17:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s an awesome idea. and instead of building your rockets in the vab, you gotta make the blueprints in R\u0026amp;D building then open it in vab and the engineers will start making it and itlll be done in X amount of time. x amount of parts decides how much time it takes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-10T17:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a fan of the idea.
