I am have no opinion as to what it should or should not be. My issue is with the variability of the crash tolerance with the different crew carrying modules. The Mk2 cockpit has a crash tolerance of 45m/s, while the Mk2 crew cabin only has a crash tolerance of 6m/s. Why would they be any different?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T15:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just being consistent with the other part lines. Most cockpits and command pods have ridiculously high crash tolerances, while lander cans, the cupola module, the hitchhiker, and the crew cabin are destroyed already at 6-8 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
