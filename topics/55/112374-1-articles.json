It is very nice that we have reentry heating, but trying to land spaceplanes would be better left to magic than an actual attempt. Trying to enter without air brakes is extremely difficult, as random parts start exploding on my spaceplanes along with my wings. It would also be nice to see directional heating that doesn\u0027t just \u0022ghost\u0022 through parts behind wings. Many a time I have had batteries above my wings on the fuselage and somehow despite my reentry angle they explode anyway, I would love to see this fixed in the future. (Also goes with radial parts behind heat shields) Just a few things on my mind since the update \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think toggable heat shields would fix the random explosion of minor parts on crafts. The game already accounts for important tougher parts that need to survive re-entry such as wings and command pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I feel the heating system needs more balancing before we start talking about adding more functionality to the game. Currently the heating system is very forgiving when it comes to certain parts, but other parts will explode when hardly exposed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe just need to always remember SSTO\u0027s generally can\u0027t make use of heat shields and will be a part of this game. So making sure heatshields are still useful and not dead weight, but we also need to make sure SSTO wings don\u0027t get blow up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T05:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECertain parts get blown up because certain parts are meant to blow up.
