This will/could hurt the game in 1.0 because most people expect a continuous aesthetic in which all of the individual parts\\* compliment each other to make a good looking game.\n\nThe parts are all over the quality spectrum, as well as not having a definite tech level style. Porkjet\u0027s SP parts are futuristic and smooth, while many of the other parts are either have a very retro/homemade (like the batteries, some fuel tanks), and others are so-so, (pods, landers, structural elements). This is possibly the most troubling as it is the part of the game that the player spends the most time with, either building with the parts or flying the crafts they built with them.\n\nThe Space Centre\u0027s are also not at an even quality. The first tier\u0027s of career mode Space Centre\u0027s have an over all low quality, contrasted by the final tier/sandbox Space Centre. The buildings are the second most important aspect of the game, and having discordant styles and quality between tiers and buildings can, IMO, tract from the immersion of the game.\n\nThe UI/Building interiors are the most congruent to me, for the majority of UI\u0027s they use the same color scheme, buttons and interactions. While the current state the UI is good, there is some room for improvement. UI\u0027s are important for one of the most obvious reasons, they are what the player uses to interact with the game.\n\nRealism vs LOLsoKerbalism, if KSP does get an art upgrade, there is the question of whether it should have a more realistic look or a \u0027Kerbal\u0027 look.\n\nThis thread is *not* a \u0027oh I hate the way this part looks!\u0027 thread, or another barn thread. It is a discussion thread intended to produce ideas for improving the aesthetic of KSP, and finding a community consensus on what aesthetic KSP should have .\n\n\\*Read: Parts of the whole aesthetic, not rocket parts in this instance, otherwise referring to rocket parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T00:10:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 12:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Robotengineer**\n  \nGave a better title."},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T20:54:40Z","Content":"I totally quote OP.\n\nImho Squad has to look forward for a \u0022stock style\u0022 similar to the one introduced by PorkJet in this last upgrades, it\u0027s more fitted for a space exploration game where you can basically explore with manned ships ALL the Kerbol system, the old \u0022oil drums\u0022 of Rockomax series seems very \u0022old\u0022, not only by them style, but even in a graphic way, so (imo another time) they need absolutely an overhaul"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:04:30Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s good to have tech specific styles...

As for parts, I can totally get behind the Porkjet aesthetic but they could use a little more color. There are at least two retexture/reimagining mods that I know of for stock parts, and the textures are much cleaner, fitting in with the Porkjet aesthetic.\n\nThe UI is the most unified part but it also just feels sort of clunky and unresponsive, maybe because certain scenes aren\u0027t actually scenes but are overlays for the space center which means the ocean is rendering (in fact, let me just say that fixing ocean rendering would make the whole game feel snappier, not just the UI)."},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T22:39:16Z","Content":"Well, there is already KSP style, it\u0027s just divided in different substyles: 1.25 tanks, 2.5 tanks, inline RCS, surface RCS (engines including), spaceplanes, batteries, 2.5 spacecraft and everything else."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T23:11:47Z","Content":"I agree that the PorkParts are a bit monotone.

I would like to see possibility for player to extend one of them for the whole rocket - but not to lost them. \n\nBut the style is already there, and a destinctive one. FASA and BobCat\u0027s Historical Pack are not stockalike - they don\u0027t feel stock. Taurus and SXT are stockalike - they fit stock perfectly. Porkjet (both plane parts and habitat parts) is weird case - his parts were almost stockalike, good with stock yet destinctive, and now they are stock.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I agree that the PorkParts are a bit monotone.

A great model for a future redo of the stock parts, again, IMO.\n\nI would disagree. The main chunk of Tantares - capsules, cargo and spacecraft propulsion modules, to be precise - stands out compared to stock. I do like Tantares, but not for style. Tantares style is stuck in middle between realistic proportions and modularity, and the overall stye of parts are distinctively shaped.\n\nIf I asked to choose between \u0022stock goes all Porkjet\u0022 and \u0022stock goes all Tantares\u0022, I\u0027d like to choose neither, and if not neither - then Porkjet. Maybe with much more color accent (like currently on RCS fuselages, but more distinctive ones), but totally not Tantares. It just don\u0027t feel the same.\n\nOn the other hand, I do would like to see both Porkjet style and Tantares style in stock. They both look good with the parts that I put in \u0022everything else\u0022 category earlier, Porkjet-style parts look good with 2.5 spacecraft and 1.25 launchers and Tantares-style parts can be a nice set of it\u0027s own worth.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-13T06:30:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2015 06:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nothingSpecial**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T05:26:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Differences in rocket part art styles are handled in the guise of different Kerbal manufacturers for different lines of parts.\n\nAgreed.
