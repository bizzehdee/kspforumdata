This will/could hurt the game in 1.0 because most people expect a continuous aesthetic in which all of the individual parts* compliment each other to make a good looking game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts are all over the quality spectrum, as well as not having a definite tech level style. Porkjet\u0027s SP parts are futuristic and smooth, while many of the other parts are either have a very retro/homemade (like the batteries, some fuel tanks), and others are so-so, (pods, landers, structural elements). This is possibly the most troubling as it is the part of the game that the player spends the most time with, either building with the parts or flying the crafts they built with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Centre\u0027s are also not at an even quality. The first tier\u0027s of career mode Space Centre\u0027s have an over all low quality, contrasted by the final tier/sandbox Space Centre. The buildings are the second most important aspect of the game, and having discordant styles and quality between tiers and buildings can, IMO, tract from the immersion of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UI/Building interiors are the most congruent to me, for the majority of UI\u0027s they use the same color scheme, buttons and interactions. While the current state the UI is good, there is some room for improvement. UI\u0027s are important for one of the most obvious reasons, they are what the player uses to interact with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism vs LOLsoKerbalism, if KSP does get an art upgrade, there is the question of whether it should have a more realistic look or a \u0027Kerbal\u0027 look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a \u0027oh I hate the way this part looks!\u0027 thread, or another barn thread.
