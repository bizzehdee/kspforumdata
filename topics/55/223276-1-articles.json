That would offset the balance that the devs brought into the game (one can have a discussion on how good that balance is but I digress). The current system really forces players to explore beyond their comfortable boundaries. Most players don\u0027t go beyond Minmus and KSP2\u0027s mission system is kind of enforcing that with its lack of significant science points to be ground out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, having said that, I think there is plenty of room to create \u003Cem\u003Einstruments\u003C/em\u003E for those that want to do \u003Cem\u003Ereal \u003C/em\u003Escience\u2014the KSP1 parts like a thermometer, barometer, accelerometer,etc. The physical properties are there, so why not make parts that can measure them? Perhaps even with a log function to store to a text file, so you can plot temperature and pressure against altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would b a fantastic idea as there is a large group of players who misses those kind of instruments and go out and measure things. If there ever is going to be an educational version of KSP2 it would also support that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheFlyingKerman","CreatedById":182407,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-28T05:15:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO the only science part I miss is an asteroid sample collector for probes.
