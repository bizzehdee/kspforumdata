Because in almost all cases, the reason why I am switching between camera modes is because I have no control over its roll and I want to change that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T19:26:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay... that was quick. I only noticed it today but camera changes are now exactly how I suggested in this thread. I guess it must have been in the game already because I only posted this the day before release. Anyway - thank you Squad, really appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
