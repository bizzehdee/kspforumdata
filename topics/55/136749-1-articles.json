We already have contracts to rescue Kerbals stuck in orbit, so that could explain where they come from. Maybe you\u0027d get a contract to send an Engineer to the Mun and fix one of their rovers after they broke all the tires doing burnouts. Or they might have a permanent space station in LKO that gives you contracts to bring them shipments of consumables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-12T07:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222509229\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136749\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460438976\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022104207\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ser\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Ser said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh no.
