But if I\u0027m trying to decide between, say, upgrading the VAB versus upgrading the tracking center, then knowing just how many more parts and dimensions the VAB upgrade will give me, versus knowing what new features the tracking center upgrade will give me, is vital information to make that decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, as far as I can tell, that information exists only *outside* the game, in a post announcing the new 0.90 beta.
