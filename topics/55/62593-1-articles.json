I am here to suggest auto-piloting rovers and why it would be cool to have them. I think it would be very cool to add a separate part in the VAB that allows the auto-roving ability of a rover. This would be very cool because while your off flying other missions their off exploring. You could also add some science tools with it like an attachable arm to the rover that will slowly drip science. However, this arm will drain a lot of energy. If there are any mods like this, let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NQMT","CreatedById":79402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T00:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery good idea.
