Just a civil discussion among the players. Author loves KSP, mods and the community, and simply wants to hear your thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi everyone. Most of the time, I try to voice my concerns to the devs directly, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve realized that they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really listen. So now I want to talk to the general public to see if I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not the only one who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s worried with how things are going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the list of things that I find highly questionable and, actually, wrong:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My favorite, and a big one - lack of Delta-v indicator for ships and other important editor/in-flight info. According to devs, it would \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cruin\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the mystery of constructing stuff. In my opinion, the only thing that\u0027s ruined is time. Lack of such info wastes our own time that we could spend actually flying instead of re-building or calculating delta-v by hand. Also, here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an inconsistency - there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s an actual delta-v indicator for maneuvers, and lots of detailed info about the planets. But why, why no more basic info?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get why some of the players don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care much about delta-v and efficiency. Because the base game doesn\u0027t tell them anything in the first place, and they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know the difference between playing with Delta-v displayed and without it! So they consider it as a normal thing. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t used delta-v concept for a YEAR of playing KSP, until actually finding the formulas and started to calculate it by hand. Then quickly got Kerbal Engineer, since it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s PITA to calculate things by hand. It takes time, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m here to play the game. But now that I know what delta-v is, I can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see how can I play without using it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Lack of reentry heat. As a Tsialkovsky\u0027s rocket equation, it\u0027s quite important part of rocketry. Unfortunately, I think devs won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t ever implement it, at least not in a base game. And even if they would, as it was said, it would be done with something like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cradiators\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that diffuse heat, so they won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Climit possible designs to take any shapes player might want\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Apparently, there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s no such thing as inflatable heat shields and dynamic part creation (procedural parts, like fairings and heat shields).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, reentry heat makes returning stuff back to Kerbin even more rewarding. As a bonus, it creates more ways to die and explode, which is kinda a theme for KSP. And risks of losing Kerbals vs probe gives you even more choice here. But I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll talk about probes a bit later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tech tree as a mean to introduce parts to the new players (being a tutorial). This is just plain silly. Tech tree is not a tutorial, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a tech tree for a career mode. Tutorial (Training) is a separate thing in the main menu. I get that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still WIP, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m talking about the whole concept that developers try to follow here. Harv actually SAID that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s suppose to introduce parts to the new players, being a tutorial. But a tech tree is actually a part of the tycoon part of the game, so there should be different logic behind it, how it expands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Manned flights give too much advantages over the use of unmanned probes, while there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s little reason not to use kerbals. Also, lack of probe-sized experiments and few scientific equipment. Again, I get that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s still WIP, but the concept that devs, according to their own words, would use here is that probes would be just cheaper to use than kerbals. But why should they give that much science? You can get so much of it by doing EVA reports from polar orbit by flying over different biomes. You still can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t scoop soil samples with unmanned modules. Or even take photographs and million of other readings. Astronauts in space are mostly there for servicing (mostly to control and repair). Electronics do most of the stuff. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more. Kerbals don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to eat or breathe. But probes need to eat, electricity. I can go on here, but that should be enough to make a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. No public roadmap. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s bad for an early-access game (TotalBiscuit gave a good speech about this issue not some long time ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/CyGbbIB5eaM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E). People have to be able to know what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s planned, and what isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t. Priorities, features that are considered as a \u0022may bes\u0022, know about overall progress of the game. But whatever, you can keep people in the dark and be vague with most of the dev blogs. But it seems that they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even have their own internal road map. Even if there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t stick to it, which defies the whole purpose of having one.\u003Cp\u003E6. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThere\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s a mod for it, stop asking for it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 attitude. Devs don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t say that in our face literally, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be outrageous if they did, but you know what I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m talking about here, right? I love mods. But they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not the base game. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re not maintained by a paid developers. They have bugs, compatibility issues and brake with each update, and frequently get abandoned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with such attitude is that it comes up all the time when someone\u0027s not happy with the stock game. Mods are great, but if people think there\u0027s something wrong with the game, they have a right to criticize it, without being told to use mods and to create your own game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd #6 brings me to my final words. The biggest problem with everything I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve just talked about is that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m 99% sure that it won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t change until the 1.0 release. It saddens me to say that the devs made me don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care about what they do anymore, because of lots of their questionable (and wrong) actions. So while I still play with joy, I have to use mods, have to start over and over again every once in a while because of it, which is okay for an early-access game if you think of it. But now I just wait for them to finish. Not to see a finished product, but so that mods would stop break and I can have persistence peacefully.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a long post already, and I probably missed or forgot something, but I\u0027ll stop for now.

Game development never happens the way people think it does, the best games in the world are not how they were planned to be. You start with a good plan and then change it to be more fun as things go on and you see how things pan out. If they gave you a road map then the game would either be exactly like it and not so fun as it could be or fun but different from the given road map. I personally have supported a lot of early access games from early minecarft (indev that was before infdev that was before alpha that was before beta that was before the release) to Starbound to Minerwars to the dead linger. Some off these games KSP especially are very good games. Some like the dead linger are unplayablely bad. The differences between good and bad early access games basically boil down to three things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: Bugs. Crashes every twenty minutes, items disappearing, invisible monsters (that are meant to be visible) you get the idea (by the way all these and MORE can be found in \u0022the dead linger\u0022 lets just call it TDL from now on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB: Not enough content. This is when a game just hasn\u0027t had enough ideas or items added to it to make game-play fun after an hour or two. This also counts when a game has many items that are basically just the same and so add nothing to game-play (TDL has 30 types of melee weapons but there is no game-play difference between them so they don\u0027t matter).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC: Just not being fun: TDL does exactly the type of game-play they say they will. It is a zombie survival shooter. They say what will be added and do it. It is not fun. after playing it I can tell them what they NEED to do to make it more fun but they are sticking to their road plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I have watched the TotalBiscuit video and I agree with some of the things he said. He doesn\u0027t like playing early access games so that is a difference to begin with. He also was talking about quality control when it comes to steam this was linked in his talk to road maps but actually I do not agree that they are the best way to know if a game will be good because I do not think there is a way to know the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have played enough early access game to know a road map is not what I want. I want a fun game. These are not the same things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. I\u0027m not sure where I stand on this. On one hand I would like to see features from some mods in the vanilla game (some reentry heat, some life support, some more parts) but on the other I don\u0027t want all the mods implemented into the game-play. I do not use mechjeb and I would get board if I didn\u0027t even have to fly my own flights. I understand kethane but I personally don\u0027t want it. FAR is good sometimes but it slows down computers and although I can run it some peoples computers right now struggle with 100 parts in a non modded game. Which mods do you add and which not? Second do I want the developers spending their time replicating someone else\u0027s work? do I want a three month update to be mostly spent on adding something already available in a mod? yes it might run better, not crash and be forward compatible but while there are people making mods this isn\u0027t want I want the Devs to work on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso how could the Devs create a road-map AND add mods to the gameplay? Every new mod taken up by enough people would have to be added to the road-map making it pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt saddens me to say that the devs made me don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t care about what they do anymore, because of lots of their questionable (and wrong) actions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the biggest problem with early access, not that the DEV\u0027s have done anything wrong but that, because it is not a finished project people get the idea that they have somehow diverged from some perfect game. There is no such thing as a perfect game. At no point have I expected the Dev\u0027s to follow my ideas of how the game should be developed, at no point have I expected the game to be 100% want I want. All I expect is for the game to be fun and updated, the updates are up to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you are not the only person thinking this and I\u0027m also sure this will start a new flame war. I\u0027m just not sure why you are trying to control a successful game. If you want to change something then make a mod. You are welcome to but don\u0027t try and change my game without asking me and all the other people who play it (including NASA apparently). I have given my money to the Dev and this is what gives them the right to choose its path for right or wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
