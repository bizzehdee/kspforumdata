It would only take a very small part pack to open up virtually infinite possibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUpper-stage solids\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpper-stage solid kick motors are hugely used across the spaceflight industry, but the form factor and Isp of KSP\u0027s small solids just don\u0027t fit. Proposal: add one surface-attachable vacuum-optimized kick motor. It would have the same size\u00A0as the new R-4 Dumpling tank (and could even use the same model, albeit recolored) with a large, protruding nozzle. Vacuum isp of 260,\u00A0low empty vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E (~10:1), and very good mass fraction (6:1). So its Isp is comparable to the Puff engine, its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is slightly poorer than a Kickback, but its mass fraction is comparable to a Separatron.

Probably not worth it to make a larger variant because you can just cluster the smaller ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESegmented boosters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarger boosters with more customization options are sorely needed. To that end, I propose a total of three new parts: a 2.5m solid-fuel segment, a 2.5m Fixed Nozzle, and a 2.5m TVC Nozzle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach 2.5m solid segment would function like a separate solid booster and could have its thrust and fuel load adjusted. In order to be fired, however, they\u0027d have to be stacked vertically on top of a nozzle. When stacked on top of a nozzle and fired simultaneously, they\u0027d all have their own individual thrust levels and fuel depletion, but their thrust vectors would be located in the nozzle they were stacked on. You could create complex thrust curves by varying the thrust level (and/or fuel load) in each segment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nozzle part\u00A0would serve as the location of the staging option for the stack (so you can put solid segments into your rocket without a nozzle, but you have no way to stage them). Nozzles have no bottom node. The TVC nozzle has some vectoring ability and is twice the mass of the fixed nozzle. In theory, you can rotate the nozzle to do deflected thrust, though with 2.5m parts this wouldn\u0027t be as useful as with smaller SRBs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-20T16:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the segmented boosters...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA more expansive way of doing it would be to create a single solid-segment part with a selector similar to the node-count selector on the thrust plates, that cycles size through 0.625m up through 3.5m. Thus that single part would be able to be used to build multisegment boosters of multiple sizes, and you\u0027d only need the nozzle part for each individual size.

For example, suppose you stack three segments on top of each other: one with 100% fuel, one with 50% fuel, and one with 25% fuel. Then you\u0027d put an appropriately-sized nozzle underneath. Suppose that with the nozzle size you selected, burntime\u00A0of a single full segment is 20 seconds. The stack would produce 300% the thrust of a single segment for the first 5 seconds, then 200% for the next 5 seconds, then just 100% for the remaining 10 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nozzle thus serves to thrust-limit\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the connected segments, but each of the segments still acts essentially as its own separate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and stacking segments results in more total thrust rather than greater burntime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo your point -- you could have the following nozzle pack:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n0.625m fixed vacuum nozzle (vacuum Isp: 250)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n0.625m fixed SL nozzle (vacuum Isp: 180)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1.25m fixed vacuum nozzle (vacuum Isp: 260)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1.25m fixed SL nozzle (vacuum Isp: 200)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2.5m fixed SL nozzle (vacuum Isp: 190)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n2.5m TVC SL nozzle (vacuum Isp: 195)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n3.5m fixed SL nozzle (vacuum Isp: 180)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe nozzles function to limit the thrust of the segments above them. You can freely put an 0.625m nozzle underneath a 2.5m segment, but the thrust will be no greater than if you put it under a 1.25m or 0.625m segment. However, stacking two segments on top of an 0.625m nozzle results in twice as much thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
