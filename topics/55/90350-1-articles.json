More friendly chase camera so that can absorb hard movements from shaking the screen.

Placing things is a big problem since the start of the game and I think developers should take some time to improve placing things to sit nicely in place, more welding places - a lot of parts are able to place in only 1 position and it is quite unfriendly specialy with construction boxes and similar. same stuff for clipping parts, ok some construction parts should be able to clip but to place 1 fuel tank over another is not ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. More advanced edits for controls. this is about airplanes and rovers. There should be a possibility like on right click for invert steering for wheels and things to do for all moving parts. This is very important for advanced vessels to be friendly for controlling and also will make a lot more easy job for players, same thing with rcs. it does not look very nice when you have to rotate around your pod just to make things work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are still many things that should be fixed or improved but for the moment I would to see or hear what others think about this few things and also explanation from moderators why things are like this if it is not possible to change it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T13:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E #1 is possible if you dig into the settings.cfg file and tweak some things, but I\u0027m not totally sure on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 is already in the works, and looking pretty well done -- see the Devnote Tuesday from last week or the week before for a sneak preview of that. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for #3, inverted steering can already be rigged in the construction scenes (though it can\u0027t be changed on the fly as far as I know -- yet), and is done by right-clicking the wheels in question and selecting the appropriate option.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-15T14:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei just bought a joystick, cause I was tired of they way the SAS works with FAR. I was actually very happy with all the settings I could select and tweak (the only thing I couldn\u0027t do was using the thrust input properly). But the control settings in main menu are rly nice. And most other stuff can be done via tweakables and action groups (although those can be a little tricky). Some mods go further with the amount of tweakable options (B9, tweakable landing gear, FAR for example) but i expect at least a few of those to be in 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kinda agree on the camera thing although I just use auto-camer for this instead, so I don\u0027t consider this as an urgent problem.
