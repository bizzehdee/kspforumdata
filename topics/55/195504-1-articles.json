This is where the \u0022fuel setting\u0022 idea comes into play. It would be nice to be able to fill the oxidizer space vacated with more liquid fuel\u00A0with a new \u0022fuel type\u0022 option or something similar; no visual changes required (the current fuselage pieces separated by these options would be merged, any visual changes made color options like other fuel tanks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as quality of life goes, I\u0027ll try to avoid common part suggestions that are thrown around here all the time and stick with more broad gameplay features:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u0022Legacy\u0022 colors and variants for certain parts with all of their old models (smoothed out a bit to keep up with the graphics).
