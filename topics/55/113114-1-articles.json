The reason for this change was stated that it was impossible to appropriately balance the thermal masses in several command parts. \n\nI may be misunderstanding this, and hence the rest of this post may not be terribly relevant.\n\nWhile this is a good change, I still miss the interesting heat management from the drills in v1.0. I think keeping both heat systems would allow interesting game play while allowing balance for all appropriate systems.\n\nI think it would be interesting to keep both systems, and track external temperature and internal heat. Skin-atmosphere interactions generate \u0022skin heat\u0022, and machinery like drills and nukes generate \u0022core heat\u0022. Skin heat would dissipate into the environment via convection and radiation. Core heat would slowly conduct into the skin, where it would increase skin temperature and dissipate as above. Also, core heat could be reduced using radiators, which require electricity. Making the radiators \u0022active\u0022 helps because it represents that the system is pumping coolant around the vessel, so radiators can be placed anywhere and still dissipate core heat.\n\nParts can fail with surface temperature reach a certain threshold (hull rupture) or core heat exceeds a certain threshold (catastrophic explosion).\n\nBy limiting the use of radiators to dissipate core heat, the mechanism shouldn\u0027t be exploitable for removing skin heat generated during re-entry. Radiators shouldn\u0027t be effective at dissipating entry heat anyway.\n\nAnyway, just a thought on the heat systems.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T14:49:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Orbital Vagabond**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T16:05:31Z","Content":"I read it as the skin temperature mechanic being added in addition to the current thermal system rather than in place of it.

Mu\u0027s been putting hours into it, he noticed even before 1.0 that balancing heating for command pods and cockpits is mutually exclusive, so they\u0027re introducing a new heating system called Skin Heating - basically, rather than seeing a part as a part, you see it as things surrounded by a shell of metal that heats up and cools down quicker - this basically makes things easier to balance overall. Same system as in Deadly Re-Entry actually [...]\n\nSo there may have been nuances in what was said during the \u0027cast that I\u0027m not getting. To me, this sounds like a replacement heating system instead of an additional one, especially since they nerfed the bajebus out of the heat from drilling system, and changed the efficiency to be engineer based.\n\nI\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m not going to go watch the stream...

And the best, easiest way to handle those, IMO, is to make them work like the batteries and electricity producers do - if you have any radiators installed, any heat generated anywhere gets transferred to them automagically through invisible heat pipes, and radiated at whatever rate the radiators can handle. Any heat the radiators CAN\u0027T handle gets transferred to the parts next to the heat source, the way it works now. \n\nThis should probably also apply to reentry heat, but that wouldn\u0027t make it an easy cheat to avoid the weight of heat shields, as any decent size radiators would probably break off from aerodynamic forces during reentry. So heatshields would still be needed there. \n\nNo need to make it overly complicated. We need radiators that let us use hotter engines, and we need a reason to use heat shields. The above suggestion covers both, I think."},{"CreatedByName":"Orbital Vagabond","CreatedById":145561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T23:31:36Z","Content":"Just to be clear, in my view there are two distinct sources of heat generation: Internal generation (drills, nukes) and external generation (atmospheric interaction).\n\nHeat generated by internal sources shouldn\u0027t be able to be dissipated by methods designed for external sources, e.g. ablation\n\nHeat generated by external sources shouldn\u0027t be able to be dissipated by methods designed for internal sources, e.g. radiators (Radiators require a heat gradient between the inside of the vessel, and the outside.

The inwards pointing surface area of the type of radiator used road vehicles is entirely useless in space, as it loses the majority of its ability to function without air flow.
