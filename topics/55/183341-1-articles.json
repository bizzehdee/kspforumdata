Have kerbals scattered around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Considering we already have kerbals around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E editor flailing about with their engineers\u0027 reports screaming \u0022This ship will crash and burn!\u0022, maybe we could have some doing the same thing bout around the R\u0026amp;D facility?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Make those vehicles parked at the R\u0026amp;D facility move. At the moment, they\u0027re just static models, and I thought it would be cool to have some vehicles move about like in mods such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u002B\u002B, but not to the same extent. Otherwise, they just feel a bit pointless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Be able to knock on doors. Maybe this could trigger a quip from one of the workers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese were just some ideas because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E atm is a bit boring, especially on my mostly stock save. I feel Squad could easily do this considering there\u0027s already mods that do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
