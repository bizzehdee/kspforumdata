Since it does not have its own power supply, it doesn\u0027t have any electrical charge left. Now I can\u0027t change the type of it to debris and call it anything different than \u0022-insert vessel name here- probe\u0022. Btw the transfer stage does have its own probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to be able to change the name and vessel type regardless of the electrical charge of the vessel. Also I want to be able to do exactly that from the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, if I were to give my TV a name, it wouldn\u0027t have to be on for me to do that, would it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T14:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because it doesn\u0027t have a control center, though lacking power might also be an inhibitor. It makes sense in a way, since its identity might be stored as magnetic data within its hull. I don\u0027t ssee why the tracking stationn can\u0027t identify it differently on purpose, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-30T20:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve run into this as well. Very frustrating little quirk! Otherwise spent stages you intend for a graveyard orbit are impossible to class as debris if they have no power. A quick save file edit can fix, but still annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllowing us to rename/reclass objects from the tracking station would be outstanding, since I tend to forget to do so while in the middle of separating things and maneuvering. Before you know it, you have half a dozen \u0022xxx probes\u0022 you need to load back into scene one at a time just to change the text and icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klappertjes","CreatedById":83227,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-01T14:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe way I interpret it, KSP encourages you to terminate unused \u0022debris\u0022 rather than throw them in a graveyard orbit, because they\u0027ll be clogging up memory otherwise. Not realistic, but it\u0027s the realities of a computer program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving more control from the tracking station is I think a suggested (and planned?) feature already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mic_e","CreatedById":60757,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T04:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this thread.
