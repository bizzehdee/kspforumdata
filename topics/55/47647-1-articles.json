As far as I see the how the KSP economical model will work in the future, any recovered part may be used again with no or very low price. And making the special resque operations over the Kerbin will just complicate things. However in the current state of things it is really difficult to make fully recoverable craft since any part of the ship that will be detached and loose focus in the lower atmoshere will be deleted. You also can\u0027t switch vessels inside the atmosphere and your only way to do fully recoverable vessesl is SSTO ship, that can barely have any amount of usefull payload exempt the ship itself. So in order to make you care about loosing that booster tanks, devs shuld make it possible to save them first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T01:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a game and it\u0027s intention is provide fun, not to provide a mindnumbing boring simulation.
