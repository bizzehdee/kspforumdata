Perhaps a mission could be to adjust the orbit of a satellite to a new vector or velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaking the sound barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission could require the player to create an experimental flyer not unlike the X project with Chuck Yeager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting out mission requirements for max velocity, and operational ceilings to challenge players to create the perfect fighter craft for the military. Perhaps in this way, Aerospace technology and aerodynamics could be unlocked in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the military needs a spy plane. The craft would have to be fast, carry cameras and be able to reach VERY high operational ceilings and exceptional range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFighter craft: Mission to build a fighter (no weapons required just stats) with a moderate operational ceiling, but high manoeuvrability and able to perform high G turns without falling apart or killing the pilot. I really liked the mod with the drop tanks for this one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterceptor Fighter Craft: Mission to build a super-sonic fighter craft that can sustain supersonic flight for X number of kilometers or a set number of mission time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial Contracts for planes that can carry large loads over long distances perhaps? This would require large sections of habitable fuselage. First level could be a small passenger plane with a range of X number kilometers. Second level could be a MUCH larger passenger plane with a moderate operational ceiling and good range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother commercial contract could be for setting up a Kerbal Positioning System. The KPS would have to be deployed in specific orbits and velocities to achieve the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
