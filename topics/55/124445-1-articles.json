So the first time you quicksave it saves as quicksave #1. The next time, quicksave #2 (or quicksave #1 and the previous #1 is renamed #1, etc...), etc... You could have a max of x (user defined, dev defined) quicksaves and delete the x oldest one. Pressing reload quicksave would still reload the last quicksave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the point of this suggestion? Many times players do not realize how corrupted (unstable) a save is until after they have made it. It would be nice to go back to older more stable saves without having to specifically name each one with the Named Save feature. The devs might also have access to better troubleshooting information.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T20:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can make multiple quicksaves by pressing Alt\u002BF5 for saving, and Alt\u002BF9 for loading one of your quicksaves. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
