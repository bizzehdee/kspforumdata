Well... at least things which are melting... like ablating heat shields should be white hot. It would be possible to take a shallower (and or slower) path and not build up as much heat and thus not be white hot... The space shuttle heat tiles would be glowing orange where as the Apollo capsules heat shields would have been white hot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trail needs to be longer and then I think there should be a range of heat colors from red to white depending on speed and thickness of the atmosphere. As I recall the heat effect is just a colored light shining on it from the velocity vector. Shouldn\u0027t take much to vary that color. The difficult part as I see it is getting the long trail. I think the fur shader currently used looks fine close into the craft but doesn\u0027t look so good deeper into the tail. Where you start to be able to see the repeated fur texture instead of it all overlapping is where I think more work should be done if you want to make KSP reentry look more like real world reentry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in a nut shell I wanted to share the pic of real reentry and suggest reentry effects get another look at some point down the line.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-05T19:17:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2013 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by FITorion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T19:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen we have some reentry damage, it would be nice if parts about to explode shined brighter, yellow to white instead of orange.
