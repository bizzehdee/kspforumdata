The problem is, after you unlocked everything, the science points is useless. But IRL, science and learning never stop!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo should we need something to spend our science points on? An random idea jump in my mind is upgrade. For example, after you unlocked Heavier Rocketry, you get two new parts: Rockomax \u0022Skipper\u0022 and X200-32 fuel tank. Then you can spend relatively lesser science (160 for same tier or 300 to unlock higher tier), or, you can study to improve what you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Heat Transfer Optimization lv.1](cost 300 science): Increase maximum working temperature by 150K\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Advanced Structure Engineering lv.1](300 science): Increase impact tolerance by 1.0m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Next Generation Material Research lv.1](300 science): Decrease mass by 0.05t, decrease impact tolerance by 0.2m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeveling up can be infinite, like how the Cube World skill works, let\u0027s take [Heat Transfer Optimization] for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elv.1: 300 science, Max. Temp. \u002B150K (current max. temp. = 3750K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elv.2: 300 science, Max. Temp. \u002B250K (current max. temp. = 3850K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elv.3: 300 science, Max. Temp. \u002B317K (current max. temp. = 3917K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elv infinite: 300 science, Max. Temp. \u002B450K (current max. temp. = 4050K)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus even you have 4294967296 science points you can NOT upgrade everything, while you can upgrade everything to ~70% with only 3 level upgrade for each one. Friendly to new players, limited end game status.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T13:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I was thinking is something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see how SQUAD plains to merge the science system with the Resource and economics system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess only in that step will have sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow looks like silly, I would said almost ARCADE the way that science is manage it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is not about unlocking different sizes in tanks or different proportions in adapters, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen they implement an economic system, that would be the limit about the sizes of the things that we can build. Not the science..\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith science you can have different kinds of engines, with more or less efficiency, you can have solar cells with less or more efficiency. You can reduce the cost of old technologies at the same time you open some high cost new technologies. That is the science factor.. Not just unlock a minitank fuel when you already had different sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD wants to make a game that simulates a space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I guess they need to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
