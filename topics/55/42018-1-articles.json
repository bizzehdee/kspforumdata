HOWEVER... KSP does not support an form of Migrating save system, and its sad when you play only with stock parts and cannot continue the same progress on the other computer when you have to leave or play at a friends house and wanna show of the builds and progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is... Could KSP get an save system? Atleast an option for it. Or atleast would you guys look into it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T11:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut all of your saves and mods into \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDropbox\u003C/a\u003E, then \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esymlink\u003C/a\u003E the files into the game structure on both computers.
