Here on earth we hear such sharp and robustly defined sounds because air is just about the perfect medium to transfer the vibrations that make every sound. Since there is no air space sound has to pass through anything else there may be...the ship mainly, so typicaly youd only realy hear very high volume stuff(because more decibles = more vibration that can travel though poor conductors further), and even then it would sound somewhat akin to hearing something while at the bottom of a pool.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-25T02:01:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2013 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KhaosCorp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"epima09","CreatedById":90003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T02:32:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KhaosCorp\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@ OP: the reason you hear very little sound in space in KSP is because you hear very little in space in reality.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, i am aware of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if we were for realism than we would have take out the engine sound as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this is somewhat a game, user experience becomes more priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd i believe adding few sound effects could actually bring more immersive experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mean wind whistling sound in space,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut sounds for rcs,communications,eva(breathing sound?), ship crackling, instruments could really really be juicy to hear and actually make you feel more like you\u0027re there controlling a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right that game mechanics and assets should be more of a priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut just basic sounds for the current parts(rcs,science) that are lacking would be greatly beneficial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T04:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat bothers me most is the lack of any kinf of contact sound (between parts, or parts and ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERover wheels should have some kind of sound, too.
