I\u0027d add that while I think it should be scrapped and redone entirely, I agree completely that that\u0027s not even on the table, we need to have improvements that at least use the hooks that now exist. I don\u0027t disagree with anything on that post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking science meaningful is the critical take away. I\u0027m a huge proponent of a randomized solar system and fog of war, but with that off the table, there are other things that can be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod that predicts flight path through atmosphere... what if specific science turned that capability on, planet by planet? Do some science at Duna, gain the ability to more accurately land organically. Same for Kerbin. It turns on, but only for the worlds you have visited and done the right science for.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScansat-like capability. All ready sort of added, we need cameras, etc, and the ability to map. The current map needs to have fog of war. The map has a default camera position, and allows moving the camera to a certain altitude, and no lower. One, move the default camera view out to what you\u0027d see from Kerbin through a telescope. Two, set the minimum map camera altitude to correspond with the best data over that part of the world in question you have. If you sent a direct-impact camera to the Mun on the Kerbin side of it, you\u0027d be able to zoom in to the whole mun at the lowest alt the entire disk was available to your probe\u0027s camera, then in the region of impact, all the way down to 1:1 (in a smaller and smaller region, obviously). This makes mapping \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C/em\u003E. It also makes repeat science actually useful as long as you do it in a different location. Throw a probe in low munar polar orbit, and let it map away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002239636\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/39636-veeltch/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Veeltch\u003C/a\u003E makes a good point regarding specific science requirements for parts. One of my early posts on this forum suggested breaking science up into 3 types of science, spaceflight (astronautics?), planetary science, and medical/biological. The first are things like parts testing, or even contracts to do specific things (landing softly would count, or putting something in a specific orbit). Planetary science is most of what we have now. Medical would be for crew in space for certain time periods, science labs in space. Different parts could require different types of science (some might take all 3 ) to unlock, some might require specific parts testing contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70807-regex/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002270807\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/70807-regex/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@regex\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0points out that rejection works better now, but I\u0027d add that the current, misnamed strategies office should allow the player to control the relative abundance of some missions. Also, most contracts are so stupid that they need a global rewrite, IMO. Rescues imply a competing program, and the current paradigm means they are the best way to get crew. You get paid to get crew instead of paying, that\u0027s a terrible incentive. Rescues need a major rethinking, IMO, I\u0027d rather they were rare, but possibly\u00A0much more complex. My short comment is that the solution to awful, random contracts should not be to use the reject functionality, they should be made less random, and less awful---then we can use the reject functionality. Note also that the stock settings have a rep hit for rejection, and no hit for warping a couple days ahead, so the game disincentivizes using reject.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-14T14:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2016 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T23:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a thread in the general section that suggests that a majority of players never leave Kerbin SoI.

You\u00B4d activate a program and the game would give you missions associated with it, following some sort of tier-system. Like, say, you pick \u00B4mun-program\u00B4 and there are, say, 2 tier1 missions scripted to it: 1. Manned fly-by, 2. Probe in orbit. Once completed, each has follow up missions. For example: 1a) Manned Orbit and 2a) Probe in polar orbit below x. And so forth. You can complete higher tier missions, that are not yet presented to you, in advance and thus skip ahead, but the game wont tell you about these, before you havent \u00B4unlocked\u00B4 the \u00B4node\u00B4 below (so experienced players can rush through a mission-tree, if they know what will be asked of them). You only get rewards for completing goals of active programs, and each mission\u00B4s reward would shrink by a well balanced amount down to a well balanced cap as time passes. So once you\u00B4d activate a program, the \u00B4race\u00B4 would be on - not a race against some competing agency, but the race against the clock. It wouldn\u00B4t be a hard deadline like \u00B4before this decade is out\u00B4 or an expiration date, as we have in the game now, but more like a soft-cap, where you simply get more rewards, the sooner you complete each goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, we dont need REP decay and it\u00B4d be more forgiving than hard deadlines (no frustration from completing a mission just one hour \u00B4too late\u00B4, f.e.). Programs themselves could be tiered and certain, more advanced programs require you to collect some REP from lower tiered programs first, before they appear and can be activated. There could also be programs that become avaiable after a certain mission within another program is completed, as sort of a spin-off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have scripted programs like that, you can add in-game walkthroughs for them, which are presented piece by piece in a tutorial like fashion to any player with the according option in his/her game-setting activated. It would be a bit like having the option in modern 3D-RPGs to turn on/off these markers that tell you exactly where to go next in order to complete your active quest. For each mission there could be text-popups or hints from advisors, on what the player has to do and how.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince every program\u00B4s rewards could be tailored towards the missions it contains, there wouldnt be an issue arising from the great difference of time needed to reach different bodies: The mun-program\u00B4s rewards could decay say by 1% per day (pulling numbers from my rear for now, obviously), while the Jool-program\u00B4s rewards decay by 1% per month. Each to a cap of say 50%, so no matter how much time it takes you, you will at least get half the reward in the end - but it pays off to do it quicker, which is the point. Since the clock would start to tick on all missions within a program once it is activated, higher tier missions should either feature a disproportionally higher base reward or tick down slower than the lower tier ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrograms should be suspendable for a REP-cost, pausing its tick-down but also barring any rewards for it, until re-activated. To avoid exploits, some time needs to pass between suspension and re-activation of a program, which probably should also be program-specific (longer for inter-planetary programs than for kerbin-SOI programs). \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Since this would replace the 0/1-consequence of time-related failure to complete a mission with a soft continuum, more akin to the \u00B4land close to KSC\u00B4-mechanic, balancing it would probably not be so crucial after all. The amount of frustration that can arise from it this way is inherently limited, while still giving sufficient incentive to care. Like landing on the other side of Kerbin, an unplanned delay in completing a mission would be something you\u00B4d try to avoid, sure, but if it does happen it\u00B4s nothing to ragequit or even reload for, as it would only make you miss out on some percentage of the reward, not all of it. Assuming you are not playing on some really hard difficulty level, any reward you get on top of the capped minimum, due to completing a mission quickly, could be regarded as an extra \u00B4nice-to-have\u00B4. Crank up the difficulty, and you will either have to pick up these extras more or less regulary or occassionally complete one-shot commercial missions outside of programs to keep you in funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: Once all the programs are layed out and scripted, we\u00B4d also have a rough (!) idea, how long a game should take (in game-time). Say (for sake of example) these would be the programs (time to capped reward minimum in days):\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbin (50); Mun (100); Minmus (200); Kerbol, Eve\u002BGilly, Moho (1000 each); Duna\u002BIke (2000); Dres (3500); Jool \u002B moons except Laythe (5000), Laythe (spining off Jool-program, 5000), Elloo (8000). 8000\u002B5000\u002B5000\u002B3500\u002B2000\u002B3000\u002B350 = 26850 days ~ 63 kerbal years. Seems a bit long maybe... Anyways, point is, this would (assuming more thought out numbers) give us a ballpark of how fast tech should progress. Certainly, the tree should be completable well before you complete your final program (which would be pretty much \u00B4game won\u00B4). Assuming an expected playtime of 50 years (you will run some programs in parallel at times, i guess) the techtree should IMHO be completely unlockable, depending on effort put into it, between year 20 and 40. R\u0026amp;D-times, if implemented, be balanced accordingly (it seems their current SCI-point costs might fit quite nicely for a direct 1:1 transfer to kerbal days, incidentally) \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT3: Then i\u00B4d like to have the kerbal ressources (personel) reworked:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- flatten the initial lump sum to hire a kerbal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- have ground personel assigned to facilities. For now, only R\u0026amp;D, but could be expanded on later for other facilities. These cost wages and their number is limited by the tier of the R\u0026amp;D-building (expansion of which would be less costly). Obviously, these guys modify research-speed. The R\u0026amp;D-building works pretty much like a big science lab (that part) and all SCI collected would feed into it as data. Tech is picked in advance and science generated directly allocated to it. Say, each scientist generates 0.2 Sci/d and tier 1 holds upto 5, so you can research at 1 Sci/d. Tier 2 can hold 10 and Tier 3 20. Or somesuch. To avoid exploits, these guys get paid daily. Maybe you can overfund them in order to squeeze some extra out of them for disproportional cost (e.g. \u002B10% research speed for 20% more cost).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- kerbals in space get a salary depending on the duration of their current deployment. Something like 5000 per month started and an additional 1000 for each month passed upto a cap of 25,000 per month.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- a training facility where paid kerbals can hone their skills on the ground. XP cap and training speed depending on building tier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u00B4s all what i\u00B4d change in career mechanically that i can think of right now. Anything beyond that, like construction time or life support, i\u00B4d leave upto further consideration after the above is implemented first. Which, i think, is not too revolutionary to have a chance for it to happen.

There\u0027s a balance here I think. If the game is entirely linear you\u0027ve basically replaced a system of semi-random missions with a proscribed\u00A0list of spelled out missions that each player must do in the same\u00A0order. This actually makes the play experience even smaller, and reduces player freedom and the open sense of exploration. If the missions themselves are completely user defined scope and all then there\u0027s no real challenge and no real \u003Cem\u003Egame\u003C/em\u003E. Its just sandbox with a paint job.\u00A0The answer lies somewhere in the middle.\u00A0You need to have some constraints\u00A0on budget, parts, and mission availability in order to have structure and progression. Parts right now are \u003Cem\u003Epartially\u003C/em\u003E linear in that some are more \u0027expensive\u0027 than others and you have to work your way through the tree,\u00A0but that\u0027s so you can\u0027t just research a nuke or rapier as your second or fourth node. Parts are the main reward of the game, so they need to be somewhat linearized to produce any meaningful progression.\u00A0I get why we don\u0027t have the option to start with probes or planes; the fun of KSP is going to space and Squad wants to really hook new players with \u0022put a guy in a rocket and launch it!\u0022. I think that\u0027s great. At the same time though a few things, probe cores, plane parts, and solar panels specifically, could be moved up and 2.5m parts pushed back to get more on balance and allow for\u00A0a play-style choice earlier on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tend to think the best way to straddle that balance is to add a basic structure to contracts without limiting players ability to go where they want to go. Thats why I like making basic exploration contracts available but locking out advances until players build enough rep. Starting with Kerbin SOI and unlocking the inner and outer planets also gives some structure without pigeon-holing players to any particular mission. This isn\u0027t because this is the way I personally like to play, its because it gives a basic over-arching set of goals that most any player can work with.\u00A0Whatever\u00A0system you go with it\u00A0needs to be SIMPLE. New players should be able to look at the screen in any given building and have a clear idea of what\u0027s happening there. Part of this is UI, but a big part of it is just creating clear, easily understandable rules of the road. Players shouldn\u0027t be staring at the screen trying to understand what they\u0027re expected to do, they should look and in a moment say \u0022okay I get it, now how do I deal with this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock is by no means perfect in this respect. I pointed out earlier how making world firsts invisible in Mission control actually obfuscates what could be a central\u00A0component of the game. Reputation too is pretty opaque. Those of us who have played a while know getting more of it makes loftier missions more likely to pop up, but because those missions are randomized the question of \u0022How much rep do I need before x mission shows up?\u0022 is a total mystery. The lack of biome mapping similarly hides from the player one of the most basic mechanics of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll Im saying is we shouldn\u0027t be adding more layers of complication for complication\u0027s sake. Those changes need to be understandable and produce clear advantages to gameplay. Realism in this case doesn\u0027t actually matter much.\u00A0Its not as if we\u0027re testing alloys and filling out congressional budget requests. Chess doesn\u0027t suck because there are no supply chains, \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s actually more fun because it leaves them out\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0This is a game and everything happening on the screen is an abstraction.\u00A0What matters, ultimately, isn\u0027t that its satisfying one player or another\u0027s sense of role play, but that its producing fun, challenging gameplay. Im all for adding things like time-based upgrades and life support and all kinds of cool things to make it a richer, more believable play experience. It would actually be really cool if players were thinking to themselves, \u0022okay I could launch this probe now on LFO and get rep for it in a few months, or I could wait for ion drives to finish researching and launch a smaller, more affordable rocket.\u0022 But new players probably shouldn\u0027t need to worry about this kind of thing. Adding new layers of complication like this should really be a part of increasing\u00A0difficulty for long-time players and not the basis for\u00A0restructuring the underlying\u00A0game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T02:46:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
