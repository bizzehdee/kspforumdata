I do agree flag planting should be removed from XP list, as all it really does is require\u00A0each Kerbal on a mission\u00A0to EVA and plant a flag and then remove it, which is a little tedious. Landing on the surface should be sufficient. I also agree there should be some way of leveling up Kerbals in flight.
