(Was a pain but it works for me.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recently bought KSP for my laptop so I can take it with me\u00A0on holidays etc. So my question is, could I use the Dualshock controller to work exactly as it controls the game on PS4 (X works as Space on keyboard, etc, Throttle up with L1 and arrow up)? That way\u00A0I don\u0027t have to get used to the keyboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found older posts for older versions and they didn\u0027t seem relevant anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
