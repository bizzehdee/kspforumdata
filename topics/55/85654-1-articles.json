The reason I would like to see this is really simple, it would allow for parachutes and the LES (launch escape system) to be used in concert. One could put the LES on top of the parachute (with a decoupler in-between if the LES isn\u0027t upgraded to have one that can be stageable/mapped to an action group). The parachute part would be unable to deploy (or maybe would get destroyed) if it was activated with something attached to its top attachment point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR parachutes should have a top attachment point to allow them to be used with the LES but they wouldn\u0027t work as a parachute if the part attached to the top wasn\u0027t removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease feel free to improve/discuss this idea! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks:D\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T23:16:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaLVin-K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T12:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr a docking port/parachute combo.
