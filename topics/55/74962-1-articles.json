The system would be similar/identical to planting flags, so it shouldn\u0027t prove too difficult to do. Even better if something like The Final Frontier mod is ever officially implemented, the gravestones could display additional information like rank or service history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be a bit more difficult to do this in space, maybe creating a new craft shaped like an empty eva suit?
