I\u0027ve found that locking the gimbal often stabilizes the flight of a powerful rocket, especially with the new SAS. Very often, people lock the gimbal of the outer stages of rockets, and they leave the innermost engine free. I feel a standard button for this effect would be warranted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T04:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAction groups. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T05:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you right click on the engine (if it supports gimbal) there will be a clickable option button to select gimbal on or off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T08:59:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis still happens a lot with the new SAS? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve very rarely found that gimbal lock is needed any more.
