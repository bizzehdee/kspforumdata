I\u0027m curious why many of those features aren\u0027t also in the normal program? I\u0027m not sure entirely what they are but why would they make features for two versions of the program?! A lot of those are things that people have been asking for in the normal version forever by the looks of it. I wonder why they have seperate things in it they don\u0027t put in the regular one... Is this game first built around the edu version and then reduced in aspects for the normal. We seem to be getting the short end of the stick although we are paying the same ammount..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurely there is a better way to make it useful for schools without reducing the features in the main game. let alone a non unified program with all features. Why not something special for buying it via the edu options that nobody would want or need in the normal version. Maybe a small tech help line or something odd... Stuff that doesn\u0027t affect the features in the main game. Then you could add in home versions or something. Maybe that could be the thing. Home version(reduced access with times use) with a special app made to connect to the school version to turn in homework electronically. Then they could be unified programs but have the stuff to have the teacher accept stuff from the students. Then teacher could give temp licenses/keycodes to home users if needed if they don\u0027t already own the game. It could even work in a way as a trial for for the game in a sense. Although that is probably not a good way to look at it. 8) Maybe with individual license numbers that have like a school semester plus summer to use it before the software becomes inoperable or something simple. Then they could have dumby versions of the software in the library and downloadable at home and log in with the key number to do homework and submit it via the ingame software. Then it\u0027s a part of the main somftware everyone shares in but has special use/functions for people in schools! 8) BTW I\u0027m saying the code is times base on a school year potentially so they can log in multiple places and use the school aspect of it that has the main feature of hooking up to the teachers configured remote version. Like uploading a CFG file but remotely. It could be like a single player multiplayer. Or an early slightly different version of multiplayer! Submit file with name and teacher uses ship to test! 8) Homework done. Then with the multi use student key they could log in anywhere and the key could even be auto hooked to the teachers key/version to send the file to him when they choose to via an ingame submit button with minimal configuration!(Say he can put the key into his in an ingame simple network thing that makes their software autsend it to his computer!) Maybe it could also have hooked up settings that sync with the teachers so it has the same physics settings and they are all working in the same environment. That would be worth buying! Then the rest of the game could be ubiquitous and have the same stuff. Since the school could revolve around the special network features. Ones that could even be useful after normal multiplayer is developed as it would have use for features that normal multiplayer wouldn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Main bought licensed key for the teacher/school. (possible key for each teacher for network purposes.) And special time sensitive keys values with timed useage the teacher can generate for each student.(These can be reusable, throwaway, hand generated, or random generated, etc by the teacher could even set the time of usability like until the beginning of the next school year or a week for a project etc.) He/she could keep track of which student is which number etc. And they could be generated by the teacher over and over freely without license stuff being a part of it as it would just be part of the network hookup feature and help the teacher organize the class functions each semester/year. Unless it helps somehow to have a server somewhere. But the school probably could set one up cheap to check/aid the logins on their end if desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Network settings and special login version in opening are of game for EDU login that are linked specifically to that teachers key!(teacher generated with a list of students on his end and the key for each student)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Locked down version to dl anywhere with option to use EDU login. AKA dockable version. The option could exist in the normal KSP if they already own it but be the way to use the school login features for homework! if they ever buy the game they could input a different key to unlock it and show they own it or dl the full version etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. EDU version has special auto sync and lock on physics for teachers and students to all have the same setting during ship creation!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. EDU versions has special file sharing/upload feature that lets them send files to the teacher the key is hooked up to on the teachers end! This makes it totally in the teachers control.(possible in game chat but this may get annoying! maybe a toggleable feature or version where everyone can work together and a way for the teacher to set time for them to work together although maybe undesirable by teacher! 8))\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Whatever else sounds good. Maybe a nice feature for the teacher to use mods and auto sync them so the students automatically get the correct software on game loading after login. This could be uploaded via the teachers computer like a torrent file from that teachers computer or school network or from everywhere over the web or from special servers that mod creators can use. Although I would think mods could be at their own risk. Maybe some mods are made school ready and every works to get them working during that school phase and have a dedicated upload area with torrent file spreading background network features! 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. To make sure it\u0027s useful for homeschoolers it could be done via the same features but with the parent using the main key and the ability to use it across hand held devices for convenience! Then they can check if they are at work or at a friends house or something...
