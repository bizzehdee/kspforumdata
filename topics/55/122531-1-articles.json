If you\u0027re not asked to do anything that you can\u0027t do with your current KSC, then you will never feel the need to upgrade and it will be boring as hell\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame for landing contracts.

The examples I listed off there were just examples. My suggestion isn\u0027t about \u0022put these specific conditions in for these types of contracts\u0022 as much as it is a check/balance on what is offered, and keeping feats three tiers away from showing up. What point is there in offering something you can\u0027t do?

They watch your progression levels, your available technology, your facility upgrades, and your available assets. However, the harder contracts might intentionally push these boundaries a bit. ISRU contracts do watch for ISRU research, for instance. If they are appearing before you have researched ISRU technology, this might indicate that your contract configuration file has been altered somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the other examples are examples that not all players might agree with.
