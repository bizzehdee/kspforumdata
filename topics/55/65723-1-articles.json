The first setting would be more like it is right now and you would start out as the first space agency. The second setting would start you off well into the future and more as a private company then a large space agency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpace Agency Mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this mode you would start out similarly to you currently do with having nothing and needing to do research to invent new technologies and spacecraft parts. In this mode you would start out similarly to you currently do with having nothing and needing to do research to invent new technologies and spacecraft parts. It would be more like being NASA or the Soviet Space Program when they first started up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMoney\u003C/strong\u003E - You would start off with a small amount of money (or at least enough to do a good number of missions). In the beginning you would get more money every year (this could change if need to say every 6 months or something like that) and the amount of money received would be based on the pervious years performance. Failed launches, killing kerbals (or leaving them stranded in space), and anything else that would generally be considered bad would cause you to lose money form your annual income. Things that would cost money along with spacecraft parts would be building, research and kerbals. Killing a kerbal would cause you to have to pay some money to his/her family. Research along with science would cost money and \u0022science\u0022 as it is now will change. It would also cost money to build spacecraft along with each parts individual cost. Designing a new spacecraft would cost money as well meaning that using the ships you already built and using subassemblies will help save money. Along with using your already designed crafts to save money you could use your already built crafts too. After something as landed you can recover it (which will cost money and the farther away it is the more it costs). As the years progress companies would start to take interest in space and would offer you contracts to send a satellite or other stuff into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E - Science would change to be more categorized so that you cannot use the same science to research engines as you would to research docking ports. Along with that you would also gain science just form using parts so when you launch a rocket with a new engine you can gain science from learning how it performs. Gathering sciences form each biome or region and from the atmosphere, space and deep space with all of the environmental stuff will allow you to use the simulator in in that area. Some science such as surface samples can be used in both the simulator and in researching new technologies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDesign\u003C/strong\u003E - Designing a new vehicle will cost money, but using old vehicles will be free and using subassemblies will decreases the cost of designing new vehicles. Making a new vehicle from scratch will cost more then changing parts on a all ready designed vehicle. The more you change the more it will cost and some parts will be more expensive to modify. For example change the engines will cost more then say changing the solar panels. It is also recommend that you test all new vehicles in the simulator before building them and flying them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding\u003C/strong\u003E - Building new vehicles will cost money and time. Building a new vehicle will cost the cost of the parts plus the money need to build it. Bigger more complex vehicles will cost more to build and take more time. Each vehicle will take time to construct but more then one can be built at a time. While build is going on you can control other spacecraft and launch other vehicles. Time warp will work when build vehicles so you wont have to wait for one to finish. Assembly time can take a few days to several weeks up to even months for very large complex vehicles. Vehicles will also be able to be recovered and reused. Anything that falls back to Kerbin and dose not exploded can be recovered. Recovering anything will cost money and the farther it is from KSC the more it will cost, also the harder it is to get will increases the cost. So 30 Km away but on land would cost more/less then 20 Km but in water. Once a something it is recovered it could be in perfect working condition, need some small repairs, need major repairs, be totaled and only useable for parts or destroyed and only useful as a piece in a museum. Repairing will cost money depending on what is broken and how much needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts\u003C/strong\u003E - As time progresses companies will start to be interested in space and will have contracts for you to send stuff into space. If you have a high failure rate you will not get very money contracts or you could get none at all. When sending something into space you will be given a prebuilt object and parameters on where it needs to go. For example it could be launch this satellite into a 300Km circular orbit around Kerbin with a inclination of 12 degrees or land a rover on Duna a certain lat and long. They could also be resupply missions or missions to care other Kerbin\u0027s places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESimulator\u003C/strong\u003E - First off reverting and quick loading would be removed and replaced with the simulator. The simulator would allow you to test vehicles anywhere you have done sufficient research to be able to simulator flight there. Research would include anything related to atmospheric data and surface data for simulating flight and surface travel on a given planet and gravitational data and other such stuff for orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOther\u003C/strong\u003E - Over time other space agencies and private space companies would start to appear. As they do you can work with them and out source missions to them and you accept missions form them. You can also work together and share new technologies and help each other out. You can also work against each other and compete and fight to see who will launch the biggest baddest spaceships and share no technologies (sabotaging other spacecraft is not recommend or endorsed but doable (tho not easily) and will usually result in large fines and a lose of money in the next years income and more then likely canceled contracts and less overall business from other companies). (But \u0022accidents\u0022 do sometimes happen and there is nothing we can do about that (still not recommend)). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPrivate Space Company Mode\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the stuff from the other mode will be the same expect you will be one of the private space companies that comes at a later date. When you start there will already be spacecraft in orbit and much the technology will already be invented. You will take contracts as your main source of income.
