It\u0027s just so darn big for what it is. Here are some pictures that explain my thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/X1GRK8n.png\u0022 alt=\u0022X1GRK8n.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost half the height of the Rockomax 16 fuel tank. I mean, seriously.. Putting that on a relatively small lander or something can almost double its height. Why must this be so?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VaCAWWR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VaCAWWR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking at the thing and comparing it to the other decouplers, it should be about as big as from the bottom light rim to the top right rim or roughly half as big as it is now. There\u0027s just no sense in it being so darn tall.. Yeah, I guess you can hide things like monoprop tanks and batteries inside it but you wouldn\u0027t need to if those things weren\u0027t so darn big to begin with as well. I\u0027ve taken to using KWR\u0027s 2.5 decouplers because they\u0027re a sensible height and still look nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAesthetics aside, I know a lot of people have trouble with landing - having such a tall object pushes the CoM higher which makes toppling more likely. Yeah, you could always just not have it but some people also like to play realistically, even if they\u0027re not forced to. That and the Mk1-2 ladder position doesn\u0027t allow for many useful parachute attachments so you have to use either a lot (which adds weight and cost) and not enough (to slow the pod, tank and engine down to safe landing speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion? Make the decoupler like half as tall. Preferably less, like 1/3 as tall. As it is, it looks too big, too tall and just plain ridiculous.

It\u0027s been a while since I last poked around craft files in detail, so I could be wrong but I\u0027m fairly certain that all parts use absolute positioning relative to the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a very long way off doubling anything in practical usage, as you\u0027re going to have a pod and 16 tank pretty much as a useful minimum (yeah, there are a limited number of cases where you might want an 8 tank, but not that many really). Very roughly if you take it as half the height of a 16 and the pod as about the same as a 16, it\u0027s only increasing the height to 125% of the height with no decoupler, or representing 20% of the overall height. That\u0027s without factoring in an engine, and the Poodle is about the same as a 16, reducing it to only 14% of the total height.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, yeah it\u0027s fairly big, but it\u0027s not a serious problem, certainly not enough to justify breaking vast numbers of persistent.sfs and .craft files. Reduce touchdown speed to less than 1 m/s and there\u0027s no serious toppling issues. If you need more parachutes, attach some to the decoupler or tank (as well as the pod); and/or use some engine braking to reduce touchdown speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T11:50:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind its height so much as its width. 2.5m parts should be 2.5m, having the decoupler bulge out makes connecting things between stages needlessly difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-16T11:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought it seemed unnecessarily tall, considering the other decouplers.
