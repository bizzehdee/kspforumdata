Nostalgia\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an idea a while back to make KSC-2 a \u0022nostalgia zone.\u0022 The buildings would look a bit like the old ones, and by landing there you could gain access to parts that resemble the original parts that could be used as cheaper, lighter, less efficient alternatives to the heavier parts. The same could go for the island airstrip. By landing there, you could get airship and seaplane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Geostationary Hovering System (GHS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe GHS module would be activated to keep a craft in one spot and at a constant altitude inside of a planet\u0027s atmosphere using precise throttle and torque adjustments. Of course, the craft must be able to hover in order for this to work. This would be useful on Laythe where landing on the jagged islands is difficult. You could set the craft in a hovering position and, provided you have enough fuel for the task, deploy a vehicle or some Kerbonauts with my next idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tether systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese things speak for themselves. Lowering a rover or some other vehicle onto a planet\u0027s surface would be extremely useful, and seeing Kerbals rappel off of a hovering platform would be just plain fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T03:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of number 1. Perhaps as an easter-egg in the final version? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumber 2 is basically an SAS for throttle, which I would like. A lot of the time on my landers I don\u0027t have fine enough control with the default throttle to dial in a slow descent, mainly because I\u0027m losing weight with the fuel. That said, Mechjeb does have a mode which does this, so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd number three is basically the Kerbal Attachment System. Given how often Squad have co-opted mods into the main game, I can see it happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T04:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone already did that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/m7c8yg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m7c8yg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T04:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing about the hovering system I had in mind was that it would hover in one spot above the surface while matching the planet or moon\u0027s rotation, so that the ground itself doesn\u0027t seem to move away from the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T08:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the advanced SAS could be brought back as a non-standard SAS with increased capability. It would basically be a computer more advanced than those in the regular SAS and command modules, with some of the basic MechJeb functions like ability to hover or control an ascent/descent. It would be reasonable if it was expensive, high in the research tree, and cost a bit of space and weight. It coould have torque also to make up for the mounting space it takes up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luis","CreatedById":55075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T08:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t believe many landers have enough spare fuel that they can hover just above the surface for long enough that planetary rotation matters. Also, abseiling down the side of a rocket with the engines still running sounds highly dangerous. Although it might be fun, in a novelty, \u0022very kerbal\u0022 sort of way, in practice how often would anyone actually use this method? If the terrain didn\u0027t allow landing for some reason, wouldn\u0027t it be better to bail the kerbal out with a disposable parachute or jump seat lander of some kind?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T19:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking you could use jets on Laythe to hover with plenty of fuel to spare, but yeah, you could also use drop pods, but that would leave the pods everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I had in mind with the GHS was hovering aircraft carriers or landing pads.
