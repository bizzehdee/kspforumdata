They always have the same heads and the same suits, which sort of gets boring. Instead of just 2 heads, they should have a lot of different heads, and would be chosen like the name generator. Now, I know what you guys are about to say. Why not just use TextureReplacer or TextureReplacerReplaced? Hear me out: first of all, they are both very complicated to use for most players, and second, they are both outdated. Instead, an in-game UI like Kerbaliser should be implemented, so when you are trying to edit a kerbal through the cheat menu, you can just select a look and a suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-15T03:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% agreed.
