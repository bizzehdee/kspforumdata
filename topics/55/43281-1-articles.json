I wrote a lengthy post in one of the \u0027how to improve science\u0027 suggestion threads that led me to this very idea. I think sooner or later we are going to need some kind of automation from our Kerbals; whether it be piloting or assigning science experiments and such to run. When Squad implements something like this, it\u0027ll elevate KSP to levels beyond what anyone thought possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf would give some sort of purpose to bases/space stations because now they would be actively working on their own, only requiring maybe an occasional resupply or switching of the crews. Even better?! You never have to do anything you don\u0027t want to. Don\u0027t want to fly resupply missions? Don\u0027t! Let your rookie Kerbals do it for the experience... This way you get to focus on the missions you actually want to do and control them yourself, or not! Just like to design and build ships? Well then that\u0027s all you have to do!! No flying required... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**I didn\u0027t even notice how old this post was!

New players should be forced to learn how to get a rocket into orbit-- this is one of the reasons why the game is fun and educational. But once you know how to do it, it gets boring to have to do all the tedious tasks. When you become more experienced with the game, the design stage is more fun, and so, an autopilot that lets you sit back and let you manage your space program rather than fly every mission would be cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo clarify on the unlocking of autopilot modules, to get autolaunch, you need to perform a successful launch. To perform a targeted landing, you need to perform a targeted landing. These missions could be specified via contracts, and so, the game would know when you completed them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-19T20:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds really cool, and it makes sense to do it from Mission Control.
