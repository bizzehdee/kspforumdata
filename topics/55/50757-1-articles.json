However, when i eventually send Kerbals over there, I could have them collect this data and make it be worthwhile to store.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks For Reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T03:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs a means of transferring the data//samples//whatever between crafts?
