It\u0027s much easier to have in game information and as thorough as possible. I\u0027ve always wanted full charts for everything in the wiki and any other possible way of displaying in game information like delta v or past launches etc. Stuff to make it easier to analyse afterwords.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to make it fit the game better and help give more purpose to existing mechanics, they could all start empty(except existing equipment information) and you have to do work in game to fill them out. This means using equipment to take measurements and getting it back to kerbin in order to get data. This could allow a more realistic collection of data from science and give more reason to run missions. It could also heavily aid in learning the game as you could run missions and focus on data collection then go back to base and review the info to better improve your personal knowledge of the game or designs. It would also help keep long term references to things that are not written down like exact pressures or gravity at exact altitudes on planets or other random information you might want to look up later without calculating it heavily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere should be various charts to display the different info in game like showing altitude vs various information. Or the ability to bring up a specific launch and look at all the information involved like heat and fuel use. And enough different charts to display just about any information. In fact they should go through a process of trying to make a system of charts for everything in the game and keep adding them as players bring up new ways to display the game. It should be part of an engineering/science section of the game somehow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T06:21:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm surprised that there is no mid that does this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T06:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be fun to turn on scientific tools and record flight data. It would save me so much time. I\u0027ve always wished they would put this in. And it gives more use to nearly every piece of science and communication equipment in game. Plus it\u0027s a lot easier to turn them all on and look at data afterwords than trying to read a layout in flight to test gravity etc. It\u0027s so much more convenient to plunge a cheap satellite and record and send live. Plus you can more easily utilize the info from multiple sensors as it\u0027s really hard to watch them all while flying. Although this isn\u0027t as bad with the newer UI that lets you tag displays and keep them up. I would prefer to sit back and analyse my data afterwords.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be important to be able to label the data by game version though. Then it is easier to see the results and adjust the application. Not to mention confusing version data and trying to use and design something wrong. Unless it just happens to help of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-15T06:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2017 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-18T20:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be easily done with KRPC and the various python charting and graphing libraries. \u00A0Not as simple as an ingame checkbox on a bit of data you want graphed but it\u0027s fun and rewarding to play with!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-20T09:05:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223092165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497507705\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165635\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NSEP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2017-6-15 at 4:21 PM, NSEP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm surprised that there is no mid that does this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107461-part-13-graphotron-v043-may-27-2017-track-plot-sensor-flight-data/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
