There doesn\u0027t seem to be any good mechanical reason to use any of the 2.5m parts - you can always get the same capabilities by using multiple 1.25m modules stuck together - and even that\u0027s usually just the Mk1 Lander Can.\u00A0In the spirit of making each command module worth using without just outlawing half of them from the game, here\u0027s an attempt at a rebalance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the current stats of the pods (and the hitchhiker pod, which while technically not a command module is still relevant). Cockpits are not included - I simply don\u0027t have a good feel for those parts: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/ob8DB/95f5a8e8d5.png\u0022 title=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u002295f5a8e8d5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you look at mass-adjusted stats,\u00A0the Mk1 Lander Can simply beats the pants off any other part in both raw kerbal carrying capacity and\u00A0monoprop capacity. It\u0027s second to only the cupola in battery capacity, and third in torque. It isn\u0027t great in stats that don\u0027t vary on weight, but to be honest, those don\u0027t really matter. A Mk1 Lander Can with a parachute and an empty heatshield still only weighs as much as the next lightest command module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConversely, the Mk1-2 Command Pod is really truly awful. It beats only the cupola in kerbal-carrying capacity and is the outright worst part in every other stat. The mass-unadjusted stats are a little better - but those are generally pretty easily mitigated with additional parts that are ultimately much lighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking all of these effectively size-scaled copies of each other isn\u0027t\u00A0any better - we\u0027d still be functionally down to a single part.

As a general rule I wanted to maintain the weight of a seat in a category (command pods are 0.8t/seat, lander cans are 0.6t/seat)\u00A0but make the larger parts a little more useful in other aspects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk1 Command Pod:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Everything is already functionally balanced to this pod - starting engines, parachutes, fuel tanks - so I was totally uninterested in messing with it. Instead, I\u0027ve used it as a benchmark for roughly how useful a part should be in its niche. The full suite of changes I\u0027m proposing make the command pods the durable choice - particularly good for re-entry -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk1-2\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ECommand Pod:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This part already had triple the seats, monoprop capacity, battery, and torque of the Mk1 Pod, so the natural thing to do was to reduce it to triple the mass as well. The charge required per unit torque was reduced to make it a little more efficient than Mk1\u00A0Pod. The high impact and thermal tolerances really work with the \u0022durable re-entry module\u0022 theme of the command pods, so I left that.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk1 Lander Can:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Lander cans should be lightweight. They should not survive re-entry from Mun without any shielding. The thermal and impact tolerance nerfs should give the lander cans a defined role (other than \u0022awesome at everything\u0022, which is this part\u0027s current role). The part still felt too good to me, but I understood why monoprop would be useful in lunar-orbit rendezvous lander. Limiting the battery made the lander can worse than the command pod in every stat except weight and monoprop, which is about where it belongs in my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMk2 Lander Can:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The weight and critical skin tolerances brought this in line with the new Mk1 Can. It\u0027s now a little better in battery, monoprop, and torque than the Mk1 but still worse than either command pod in all of those except monoprop. This probably still won\u0027t be great for small landers, simply because 1.25m engines weigh less, but it\u0027ll be a good choice for slightly beefier ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHitchhiker Pod:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The Mk1 and Mk2 Crew Cabins both carry 2 seats per ton, and have 40\u002B m/s impact tolerances. This weight reduction brings the hitchhiker pod in line with those in terms of carrying capacity. I don\u0027t understand why it had such a low impact tolerance in the first place - the basic fin is the only part in stock with a lower impact tolerance than 6 m/s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ECupola:\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0This part is in a rough place for balance. This part obviously belongs on a space station (or a mothership - they\u0027re nearly the same thing), so impact and thermal tolerance aren\u0027t a big deal. On the other hand, it shouldn\u0027t be light enough to become a strong competitor for normal rockets. One step is to give this phenomenal battery, monoprop, and torque, and to make the reaction wheels\u00A0more efficient.\u00A0That still isn\u0027t really enough in my opinion, so I decided that the reasonable thing to do with the Cupola was to make it the next-best thing to a complete space station in a single part to help keep part count down\u00A0- and that meant adding a probe core so that the space station could still function even without a kerbal. The only things this part is really lacking are power generation and an antenna. For comparison, a Mk1 Pod with an OKTO,\u00A01k battery, large reaction wheel, and an empty 150 unit monoprop tank only weighs 1.4t, so this isn\u0027t really even particularly lighter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tested all of these in my own install, and they all seem reasonable to me.

That already justifies the part - because it offers ingame exactly what it does IRL, and the view from it is simply breathtaking. I agree with giving it some more usefulness - but it should stay true to the spirit of the part, not simply make it OP by giving it ridiculous amounts of torque, electricity and monoprop. That doesn\u0027t make the part interesting, it just removes the lander can from the list of interesting parts as controlling part for stations and makes the cupola the clearly best choice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
