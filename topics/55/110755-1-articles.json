I have 2 problems :\n\n-the 1.25m parts represent small rockets like Redstone, Atlas or Vega, so a cargo bay would be very weird on it since you won\u0027t recover it anyway... \n\nUnless you are talking about plane parts, but then i think that Mk2 is suited better : if you want a payload, use Mk2. If you want a observation jet, use the Mk1... etc etc\n\n-what will you ever fit in a Mk1 cargo bay ? Not Mk1 tanks obviously. Not Round8 since they are wide like mk1. The only things you can put inside are small (very small) ion probes or Oscar-Bs.\n\nI\u0027m not sure it is enough to justify adding a whole new part that will use memory and need to be designed and textured.\n\nIt\u0027s probably a cool thing to have anyway, but it\u0027s best suited in mods IMO"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T08:25:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...as well as \u0022you can fit a satellite in a service bay if you try hard enough\u0022.\n\nGreat little satellite Wanderfound...
