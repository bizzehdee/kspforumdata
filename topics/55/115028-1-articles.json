I have 2 Ideas for ways to add a radar altimeter to the HUD UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA radar altimeter is a pretty handy thing for me, as (most of?)the IVA views all have one somewhere, and it makes my occasional IVA landings possible and more reasonable. Still, the 3rd person views could use the radar altimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIdea #1. When you click your current speed on the navball, you can select between \u0022Orbit\u0022, \u0022Surface\u0022, and occasionally \u0022Target\u0022 modes. I suggest that when in surface mode, the altimeter defaults to displaying the distance to surface height, instead of the \u0022sealevel\u0022 height.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIdea #2. As stated above, you can click the navball speed window to change modes. When you click the altimeter numbers at the top of your screen, it would toggle sealevel or radar altimeter.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only problem with #2, is that moving the mouse up there might drop down the \u0022return to KSC\u0022 or the \u0022Recover vessel\u0022 buttons. It would be unfortunate for misclicks to result in accidents because of this feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EThere are various mods/plugins that add radar altimeters, this suggestion is for the stock game.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merandix","CreatedById":135352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T11:27:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModular GUI!
