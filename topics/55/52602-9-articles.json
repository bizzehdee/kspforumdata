It also helps with them being short, since 10 days or so is gonna be your launch window to Duna, if you start building too late it\u0027d be possible to go for a cheaper approach and still make it there.

It is very hard to balance it so that it doesn\u0027t become either a trivial exercise in timewarping or something that bores players out of the game. Under a shorter timeframe it is trivialized and becomes nothing more than an annoyance before launch, since you have to timewarp until the craft is ready or find something else to do. In fact, a shorter timeframe might even be beneficial to players like me since time is passing even faster during my short Kerbin flights while I amass enough unlocked science to be ready for a transfer window; in the end I have less time to timewarp until the transfer window. Under a longer timeframe the planning isn\u0027t exactly tough with a spreadsheet around (and who doesn\u0027t alt-tab to check the forums or plan a launch window) and you just end up timewarping even more often than the stock game. Alternatively, you just use KAC and ignore the entire process in the first place, spending most of your game time in timewarp waiting for stuff to happen.
