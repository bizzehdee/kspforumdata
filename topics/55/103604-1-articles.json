KER also provides this information. Generally you\u0027ll only really need/want to type in delta-V values when setting up a transfer; one trick you can use to get around the widget\u0027s limitations is to set one axis of the burn first and then set the other axis to increase the burn magnitude to where it needs to be. KSP now remembers what orbit the node was on when you drag it around the orbit so adjusting times is no longer a tedious exercise in constantly adjusting orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only thE: only thing KSP needs for the node gizmo is refined fine-tuning of the node and more information.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-07T16:32:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wnderer","CreatedById":102068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EObligatory \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-23-5-PreciseNode-0-12-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also love for this functionality to be in the stock game.
