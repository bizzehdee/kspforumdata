Don\u0027t get me wrong, I do like the Mk.2 parts a LOT, but they\u0027re supposed to be the DreamChaser-esque type of craft. What was supposed to be the toroidal and bulky Space Shuttle the days when we didn\u0027t have Cargo Bays were the Mk.3 parts, and his was really their only advanage against te Mk.1 line. Now that there are Cargo Bays in sock KSP, though, I cannot blame the people who happily replace authenticity with practicality, and the forums are flooded with the new Shuttle designs, which are basically Dreamchasers who decided to sit at the side of the Shuttle launcher instead of on top of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd apart from merely aesthetics reasons, a Mk.3 Cargo Bay would have some exra room in it, which can never be not appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only hope you see my point here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T20:42:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethey\u0027re already doing it - wait untill .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t use pre-built cargo bays anyway.... and my shuttle is WAY bigger than even those mk3 parts are going to be.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-14T20:46:14Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2014 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by zekes\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-14T21:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, Zekes!
