Now, if I\u0027m thinking to simple by the end of this comment do tell.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a designers perspective I\u0027d\u00A0set\u00A0the rule\u00A0to allow hatches or connection points as open doorways only when attached straight to existing attachment points. But it shouldn\u0027t work\u00A0when they\u0027re surface attached as the example from your picture.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf from any point in IVA you would\u00A0want to go straight left, straight down or all around you use the\u00A0Rockomax multi point connector. I can see myself making a whole maze of different angled entry points and tunnels and then cover it in structural pieces, wings, fuel tanks and engines to make a entire spaceship with internal IVA routing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe internal IVA of i.e. the\u00A0Hitchhiker storage container has trash and snacks cabinets on the walls so one could never render a opening on any of those places without making it look jagged and misplaced no matter how much good luck one wishes the one willing to code it. Because of this reason the example on your picture will never work as you say so yourself. So, don\u0027t code it, saves the time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy would we want it that complicated anyway?\u00A0Ask yourself, is that necessary?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my view that shouldn\u0027t be needed. If I refer to that picture you posted and I assumed\u00A0one were silly enough to surface attach a structural fuselage to the walls of a hitchhiker with this future implementation installed it would just be, a structural fuselage attached to the hitchhiker with no opening to go through. And at worst have it visible inside the hitchhiker storage container due to it clipping, luckily we have the move tool thingy to use for this. I also rarely see people attach modules together as in that picture. Is this what you do? Or just a worst case example? The latter I assume, so there\u0027s no need for tackling these extreme case variables\u00A0 then anyway, is there?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if there were another compartment on the other side of the left attached structural fuselage like the Cupola in your example you could still enter it from there. You should see one\u00A0seperated section\u00A0as a private privacy place where naughty Kerbal stuff happens....\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople talk about realism, realistically naughty stuff must happen.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo unless you think naughty privacy stuff should be public to everyone on board it is a good imagination to validate this as a\u00A0excuse that some parts of the ship shouldn\u0027t be accessible only from outside.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou just couldn\u0027t enter the left sided section with the cupola\u00A0from the hitchiker compartments, that\u0027s all.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI remember so many\u00A0sci-fi movies where the astronaut had to EVA to go from one side of a ship to another side. Usually because the ship broke due to whatever hostile intervention or having sections blown to smithereen. The way your extreme example has modules attached\u00A0together also looks broken and it isn\u0027t how I design my vessels in KSP to begin with, and I rarely see it also so I doubt that you do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you still wanted that from the picture\u00A0to work somewhat practically\u00A0by having\u00A0diagonal or non straight pathways\u00A0in general while having everything connected in straight lines this implementation for a future release\u00A0could\u00A0add\u00A0one or two\u00A0curved angled pieces of structure that are stackable. Or just one such a piece\u00A0that could be toggled between\u00A0a\u00A02.5\u00B0 and a\u00A05\u00B0 degrees or more\u00A0angle types that one could stack or completely toggle to create corners of 2.5\u00B0, 5\u00B0\u00A010\u00B0, 15\u00B0, 20\u00B0 or 22.5\u00B0 which when\u00A0created\u00A0are\u00A0hollowed structures\u00A0that allows for internal IVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETo expand on this whole idea a bit\u00A0further...\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst\u00A0I would add a 2.5m\u00A0multipoint hub that can be accessed at least 4 ways (5 ways?) with a floor/ceiling\u00A0and a 2.5m structural tube so you can create 2.5m connected living spaces on a planetary surface. The current 2.5m modules can only be accessed top or down perpendicular to any floor while under gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, all the compartments should have ledges, handles, ladders and/or ropes visible in the IVA compartments. They could also have\u00A0droppable rope ladders that automatically drop when inside of a low atmosphere under greater then 0.1G which themselves are only visual as the movement through compartments is still automated but the speed at which this happens depends on the gravity at the destination. You\u00A0would still use the simple WASD-QE controls but the camera would pitch and roll according to simulate Kerbal effort in climbing rather then floating as it would in space and movement would be restricted to and from grab/climbing points within the compartment so as not to\u00A0be as free moving like you would in space. All of this\u00A0bundled together in my eyes would make a very solid IVA experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope splendid imagination isn\u0027t deceiving myself this day but this doesn\u0027t seem in the vicinity of\u00A0impossibility\u00A0IMHO.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FireKerb","CreatedById":176562,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-27T07:24:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223405623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175935\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221530026019\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022186653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aeroboi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Aeroboi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would we want it that complicated anyway?\u00A0Ask yourself, is that necessary?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy should we have IVA\u00A0movement?
