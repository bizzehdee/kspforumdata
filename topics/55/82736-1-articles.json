As long as the fully fuelled CoM is adjusted to be a little ahead of the CoL, the same result is achieved by active management of your fuel load (either using stock fuel enable/disable and transfer, or one of the fuel balancer mods).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the stock game probably does need better dynamic fuel management in the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T02:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master Tao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Master Tao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure what problem this solves that shifting fuel around wouldn\u0027t solve with less dead weight.

The engines are very dense and their mass is all at the back of the plane. The cockpits are oddly light. This leads to KSP planes having their center of mass disproportionately far back toward the rear end, often making it difficult to put the center of lift behind the center of mass and still be using stabilizing fins on the nose. It doesn\u0027t make sense that a plane should have its center of mass as far back as 20% from the rear end.\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a better way to solve the problem would be to increase the weight of cockpits, and distribute engine weight further into the center of the plane (much like real planes), or just cheat and make them lighter. But I\u0027d still like having a counterbalance option. Even just a radial object that is small yet fairly dense would do it. I\u0027d use the radial RCS tanks but they\u0027re often too big.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T07:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to say : Real airliner does balance their CoM through fuel.

While it\u0027s possible to design static-CoM craft, there\u0027s really no need to do so, only to ensure than the fully fuelled and dry CoMs are both forward of CoL, and that the tank layout permits moving fuel forwards before reentry. Some would advocate ensuring that CoM is always forward of CoL, but that\u0027s not necessary either, only to ensure that it\u0027s possible to keep CoM in front of CoL during atmospheric flight (i.e. if your orbital burns pull CoM back behind CoL, it doesn\u0027t matter at all). Designing to keep CoM always forward can cause the undesirable compromise of having it too far in front of CoL when fully fuelled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
