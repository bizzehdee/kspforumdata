It\u0027s great that we have IVAs and it\u0027s great that we have multiple viewpoints due to having many seats in many Modules....however. In real spaceflight, astronauts aren\u0027t strapped to their seats for their entire trip and limited to one Point of View, they can get up and float around and look at everything from different angles. Allowing us to at least move the camera around the interiors of our modules in \u0022IVA\u0022 mode would add a greater sense of wonder for me (and many others, I\u0027m sure)...for example, imagine approaching Jool and being able to actually float over and look out the WINDOW and see it as opposed to only being able to see it out the window if the ship is oriented in JUST the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, queries, theories? Was this mentioned elsewhere and I missed it? I think it would be a great addition to the game and would help continue to bloat my \u0022Screenshot\u0022 folder! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T17:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor movement in IVA mode, I think something like that was planned.

You\u0027re going to be able to take your helmet off then supposedly you should be able to float about between parts using the hatches or something from the inside. There\u0027s also supposed to be things you can interact with inside of certain modules, but I\u0027ve no idea what those would be. Hopefully something like beds in habitation modules or experiments in science bays or suits in airlocks and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
