Why can\u0027t I switch between two craft while moving in the\u00A0atmosphere? I got what I thought at the time was a really good idea to make a flying aircraft carrier...

As long as those vehicles aren\u0027t moving. Try flying a plane, then switching to another plane while moving. I think you\u0027ll find it doesn\u0027t work because the game won\u0027t let you switch vehicles while moving. Believe me I\u0027ve tried.
