That was done by a rewrite of the old ModuleSAS part module, which before was pretty much just empty. Now it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s used in probes, to specify the level of SAS service provided. Higher-level probe cores provide more AP features, and are of course, much more expensive. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also spent a good deal of time revising the R\u0026amp;D placement for probes, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eso that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll find a nice gradual progression from the simplest model (the Stayputnik) to the top-of-the-line ones all along the control/unmanned branches of the tech tree.
