I think that, in the final-ish release of the game, there should be an extra game mode that allows you to create a new solar system to explore, similar to Universe Sandbox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have doubts, however, due to the fact that Universe Sandbox is a game in itself, so kinda merging to games together is going to be hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to have your say below! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T19:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiven how I believe the current planets are fairly hard-coded I don\u0027t think this would work.
