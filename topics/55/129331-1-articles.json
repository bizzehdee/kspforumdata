Or which way the control surface will turn without actually testing it. As such it would get rather confusing really fast to make use of this change in the current form. The same thing was found to be the case with the wheels that turn, inverting them gave no indication of which way they turn, or if they were even inverted. The differences is control surfaces are far more important and more complicated to understand in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ker-Plink","CreatedById":156509,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven more than this, I have attempted to use slats on the leading edge of wings of my large planes as well as flaps. \u00A0 The leading edge dips when I attempt to pitch up and my flaps flare up no matter what part of the plane I attach the part to. \u00A0It can be ahead of my COM or behind, the result is the same. \u00A0My tail planes work fine, however I cannot seem to find how to invert the surfaces. \u00A0This change seems minor (could probably even be modded) and would make spaceplanes more practical\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve encountered this as well but have had success in fixing the issue by going back into the SPH and flipping the offending control surface 180 degrees\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T22:45:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DoctorDavinci\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ker-Plink","CreatedById":156509,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T22:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, why not have the option to use your control surfaces in the vab and hangar? \u00A0to see your flaps move without having to launch would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit to address DoctorDavinci: \u00A0 \u00A0 I did try to flip and rotate the surfaces and unfortunately it did not work for me. \u00A0I was very hopeful it would work. \u00A0As for the wheels, launch once, find out which ones are wrong, revert, fix, and save. \u00A030 seconds to fix it. \u00A0Imagine not being able to invert steering at all. \u00A0That is what the slats going the wrong way is like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-05T23:51:57Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2016 11:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ker-Plink\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-05T23:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame thing happened to me.
