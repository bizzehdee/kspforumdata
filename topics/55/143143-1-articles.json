Having an in-game tech tree editor would make making mods so much easier (half the work is already there in the debug menu, just need to make the options that are already there editable, saveable).\u00A0 Also, we need more options in order for modders to make more varied and complex tech trees. I am thinking for example of tree arrows which can either go left or right, not top or bottom and also the ability to hide them. With this, the game could offer so many more game-play experiences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T10:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. What I always wanted was a tech tree where there are many themed trees (engines with engines, wings with wings, power with power, etc) that can be researched independently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
