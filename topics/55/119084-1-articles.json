A jet breathing atmosphere planet with an extremely elliptical orbit coming quite close in to GP2 at its perapsis but have a very far apoasis.

An additional jet breathing planet Val sized mid way out. This being an extremely rough planet with mountains / ridges extending above the atmosphere in spots so that landings can be done in vacuum or a skilled pilot can risk airbraking with the constant threat of lithobraking if you plot the wrong course.

I suggested a building upgrade because it was the only mechanism in stock that implements blanket changes too a set of parts. Making a whole new set of situational co2 intakes and engines would just double the issues I have with the current jet parts you see.
