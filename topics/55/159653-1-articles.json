While this does give it some kind of order, it does mean that once your list of active vessels starts to stretch into the dozens and beyond it becomes very hard to keep track of all the different craft-a system for sorting how vessels are displayed in the UI would go a long way to easing problems relating to vessel overload. You would have the default MET sorter, but also options to sort active craft by name (alphabetically) and\u00A0by MNV (so you don\u0027t have to watch for flashing numbers). Also, it would be very useful to be able to group them by vessel type (probe, ship, station etc) in their own sub-lists and be able to pin frequently visited vessels to the top of the list to save scrolling down every time, but these are perhaps surplus to requirements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I may have forgotten to check the common UI suggestions list first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-23T13:39:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2017 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by voicey99\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T17:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorting by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E would be nice too, and perhaps a search option (although by the time you\u0027d need that, you may be running into other issues).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also say that all of this could be applied to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E vessel lists, maybe even with a folder system. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T17:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSound like a good idea for a mod. \u00A0I\u0027ll look into adding some sort of filater window to it via The Janitor\u0027s Closet, but may be a little while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T18:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123438-add-quotmaneuversquot-tab-to-tracking-station/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Esimilar suggestions\u003C/a\u003E. \u00A0The\u00A0original post in this thread efficiently expresses the core desire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA relatively new contributor made a nice mod for this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/146568-122-maneuverqueue-v042/\u0026amp;page=2\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize the purpose of the original post, and of the sub-forum, is to make suggestions for stock, and I agree that vessel sorting would be quite good to have in the stock game. \u00A0I recommend ManeuverQueue for use now, and as\u00A0a concrete demonstration of (nearly?) what is being suggested here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-23T18:56:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2017 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by OHara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-23T19:36:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223031908\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221492969962\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259429\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GluttonyReaper\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, GluttonyReaper said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also say that all of this could be applied to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E vessel lists, maybe even with a folder system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor that matter, when\u00A0loading a ship in the editor, it\u0027d be nice to be able to browse my whole computer, to find a ship I built in a different install.
