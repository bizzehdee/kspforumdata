It\u0027s already going to get support with the unity engine, and that can be great for game stuff like IVA\u0027s If the devs wanted to do it. But Oculus recently made an acquisition that could be fantastic for the game, Nimble VR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Nimble VR does is basically hand motion tracking. So you could have on a VR headset, move your hands around IRL and than your hands move around in the game, and this could be fantastic for IVA\u0027s. Just imagine a fully intractable cockpit where you can flip all those buttons and switches and really feel like your controlling your spaceship. And in addition you could than fly around in EVA with virtual reality using your hands to grab onto the jetpack controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously the Oculus RIft is ages away, but it\u0027s just some ideas i wanted to throw out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
