So if you want just males or females, you choose your kerbals and then just press the refresh button to bring in a new batch of kerbals. This would also allow for getting kerbals with other attributes that you want (like stupidity and courage or class type) and also make it so that you don\u0027t have to exit, wait and come back for a new list of kerbals. It\u0027s not quite full customisability, but it does allow for some more choice and with more convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-17T14:36:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TyrannoFan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESig\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T12:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TyrannoFan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TyrannoFan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis would also allow for getting kerbals with other attributes that you want, like stupidity and courage\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but, they don\u0027t do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T14:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like the idea of limiting the gender of applicants, just hire the ones you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA button to create a new batch of applicants would be a nice idea though.
