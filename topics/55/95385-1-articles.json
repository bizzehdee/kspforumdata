Your craft could float with inand 3D aeros could show forces being applied. The aero size and animation could differ due to the amount of force. Sliders would allow the player to adjust speed, atmospheric pressure, and angle of attack, among other things. Something a bit more visual than FAR\u0027s analysis tools. Just a thought.

There would be all the preassure, wind speed and oxygen sliders \u002B the G one. That way we could see if the craft is able to launch from a certain body, or if the RCS is balanced. Something like the NASA pool but with 100% less water. Not sure how the ground should be displayed. Maybe with a laser line which hit, would stop the simulation. You could also record the flight with free camera movement, like it was in IL2 Sturmovik.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see what you think and how it could be improved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T17:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI give this idea two thumbs up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T17:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it -would help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T17:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should have a drop test that can simulate an earthquake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest the craft to destruction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTG","CreatedById":106203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T22:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would only be added after better aerodynamics, though.
