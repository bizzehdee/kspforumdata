Ven\u0027s parts are truly amazing and beautiful works that preserve the style of the stock parts in high quality and detail. There\u0027s a lot of design choices that are beneficial to the game even without the higher detail. The fact that tankbutts are gone from engines and the fuel tanks themselves have their own bulkheads allow for more customization. One thing I\u0027d like to see is tweakable interstage-fairings that allow aesthetically pleasing attachment from 1.25m engine bell to 2.5m decoupler, and the ability to simply get rid of the fairing altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/zLjez\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
