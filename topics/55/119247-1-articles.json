Squad has done a great job with the game. They\u0027ve added features like planes, etc, that I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d care for at first, but have ended up being fantastic additions. Contracts and resources have added meaning to the game. They\u0027ve added a plethora of parts for almost every occasion - except generic hinges. When I think of all the crazy stuff I could do with those...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know there are mods. I don\u0027t prefer mods. They often lag releases, mod maintainers go away, models break entirely between versions, and they often upset the game balance that Squad carefully created. I\u0027m not knocking some of the incredible work that the mod authors do, but I really like officially-supported parts, since I know those get the Squad touch, and are considered as part of the whole game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad, could you please, please, consider some basic, flat hinges? Say, small, medium, and large, with adjustable range of motion.

I fully agree with you, and with the newest release the magnitude of this omission is getting bigger and bigger. Before aerodynamics one could argue that while it\u0027s optically offensive there\u0027s no real penalty in having booms and crew quarters sticking out when launching. But that has changed since 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you could attach those parts later on with docking, but that\u0027s incredibly expensive in career mode, not to mention the time required to do so, and the resulting noodlification of your ship as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIR pretty much shows the way to go but at the same time is probably the reason Squad is weary implementing it. It\u0027s not just hinges; you\u0027ll need rotator plates and sliding rails as well (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cwhy do we have only hinges when we obviously need slider rails too?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2).
