[irrelevant detail: the first ship has a lot of fuel and was designed to push the asteroid. The second ship has little fuel and arrived later to pull following instability encountered in the first attempt]. I start translation and to avoid waiting 20 minutes I increase the time speed. When I exit the time warp, the ship which is already docked to the asteroid slams into it and is either detached from its klaw or detonates and sends the asteroid hurtling into the second ship. Is there no way of doing time warp without screwing up things like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T03:18:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the place for a bug report.
