Once you have a LOT of scientific experiments on your vessel/station - and we are going to have A LOT more with the upcoming DLC -, there would be great if we could open some kind of list/menu which shows them all in our assembling, so to, somehow, use them \u0022remotely\u0022 while in IVA;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) The action groups are great and pretty much useful! And, yeah, 10 groups is more than enough. But, sometimes, you want - or - NEED to change them after launching your stuff into space. Even more, if you couple two different vessels\u00A0together, things become messed up when you use\u00B4em action groups.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, here they are.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for your time, and let\u00B4s warm up for new breaking grounds!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-19T00:15:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2019 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Cataclism\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
