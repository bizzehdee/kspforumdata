I suggest (and have done so in my game) that the dry mass ratio be generalised like they are with the LFO tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have changed mine to all be 9:1 mass ratio (the same as LFO tanks, apart from the 3.75); whether this is too high or not i don\u0027t know, but it thought that because the MP engines and thrusters are quite inefficient they should get a decent amount of their lighter fuel in a tank (4kg/unit instead of LFO\u0027s 5kg), and also the amount of fuel in a tank compared to size doesn\u0027t fit right...

If they wanted a massless RCS engine, they should just make it just a throttleable Linear RCS Thruster, as they\u0027re really low powered anyway. As said in my first post though, I\u0027m not sure what dry mass ratio it should be, but a nice high one would be good for countering the engine\u0027s low ISP...
