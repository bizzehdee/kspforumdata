They\u0027d have a visible notch you\u0027d set via rotation in the VAB, and you\u0027d still have to eyeball the docking, but if it was within say 5 degrees, the 2 ships would rotate as they docked until they were spot-on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T04:46:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebetter still, keep the magnetism on, but don\u0027t lock the ports until we click some \u0022lock\u0022 button. then when you are magnetically attached, rotate the way you want, then lock the port.
