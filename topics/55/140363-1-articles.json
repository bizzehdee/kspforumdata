Perhaps it is already planned, but wouldn\u0027t it be great if the KSPedia included dynamic content as well in the future?

Since it uses standard Unity UI objects and asset bundles it makes it relatively trivial to take entries that anyone makes and incorporate those into that game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny step-by-step tutorial using unfamiliar software will look daunting. But coming up with clear and concise writing, appropriate images, and making sure that it\u0027s understandable to people who don\u0027t already know all of the information you are trying to convey is far more difficult and time consuming that learning how to make pages (which you\u0027ll only have to learn once).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the original point, yes it would be easy to edit KSPedia text content because, wait for it... they use Unity UI objects. You can point DebugStuff at KSPedia page and see the breakdown of all the Text objects. Squad\u0027s entries use less than helpful naming schemes (Text001, Text002, etc...), so it would be tedious for a mod to go in and edit the content of those objects. But it would be fairly straightforward for Squad to tag certain Text objects as being tied to in-game settings, celestial body parameters, or anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding buttons to KSPedia pages is another possibility, I\u0027m not sure why anyone would want that, but someone probably has a good reason. It would be a lot more trouble than editing Text objects, but I don\u0027t see any reason why it wouldn\u0027t be possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
