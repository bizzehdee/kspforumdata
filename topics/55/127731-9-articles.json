Players can warp when they like, and if you want to do something together, you can synchronize your time\u00A0forwards to match a player in your future. In DMP though, you can only sync forwards in time. Allowing players to go back in time causes paradoxes, and is generally to be avoided.

It even fixes some stock bugs in order to function properly.\u00A0Having a fully server-authoritative system will solve most - if not all -\u00A0cheating possibilities, raise the server requirements to ungodly levels, and create an overall better experience, which is what Squad should be attempting. Additionally, the movement to a new system should solve bugs inherently - most things will get a look-over and re-implementation in the move to a server-authoritative system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for part count, the new version of KSP should help with that, but I haven\u0027t really tested it with DMP. Remember though that slowness with DMP won\u0027t translate over to a server-authoritative system, because things would work completely differently - not just with the multiplayer code, but with how the client itself works. Ships also probably need some kind of simplification for graphical representation and placement or something. Maybe individual parts are only simulated on the server-end?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMP does work with mods, usually with no changes at all. Some will require server-side plugins, but not many, and there\u0027s only a handful of\u00A0plugins in existence.\u00A0In the move to a server-authoritative system, mods would need to be made a bit differently to work with multiplayer, and you\u0027d need client mods most likely too, but things would be a lot more controllable on the server side.\u00A0The new system would need to have objects and game-code added on the server side as well for simulation. Single player mods would also likely need major changes depending on their functionality, as Squad would likely make the single player game work on an\u00A0internal server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMP\u0027s main issue is that we do the position and rotation stuff really weird. This could actually probably be solved with a combination of a\u00A0bit of simplification/allowing the client to lie a little bit more, and increasing the update frequency.\u00A0Honestly, all it would probably take to get DMP working nicely would be for me or Chris to try at that problem for a day or two.
