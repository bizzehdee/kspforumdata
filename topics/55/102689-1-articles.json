Milestones -\u0026gt; Rep, Contracts -\u0026gt; funds, experiments -\u0026gt; science.

I think that these are pretty good milestone-ish things that players automatically strive to do and adding another feature to support it seems a tad redundant.

The milestones, you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d not have to select, you can just do them whenever. They are on a permanent list - some milestones might be hidden from it, maybe. One thing they\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d all have in common: They\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d all only give REP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs contracts should only give funds. As science should come from experiments only. It keeps things clean and simple. Need funds? Do a contract. Need REP? Check the milestone sheet or just try to do something you havent done before into the blue. Need science? Do new experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i find redundant, is having to select these milestones from a list of contracts. Plus, if you do some of these contracts in the game right now, without having selected them before, (say altitude records) you simply miss out on any rewards for them. If you land on the mun, without anybody having told you to, you dont get any REP for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Another idea: Maybe contracts should not come with these star-classifications and not at a fixed price. Instead, they\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d tell you what they want you to do and you tell them, how much you want/need (advance and on completion, with advance weighed more heavily of course) for that, trading REP for higher rewards. The \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4strategy\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 transfering REP to funds could then be based on time (x REP to y funds each z number of days - not x REP for y funds earned), emulating public funding (by gov or donations). With that, if you keep up a decent pace with it (and are effecient about it), you could live off of milestones mostly for quite a while, maybe, only having to do so many contracts, as to them not becoming repetetive and a chore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be basically two strategies. One more resembling a private company, and another more resembling an agency, with a continuum between the two. The first is to do some milestones (and possibly when they co-incite with lucrative contracts) and use the earned REP to earn more on contracts. This gives you income-peaks whenever you finish such a contract. The other way is to focus on the milestones, mostly ignore contracts, and use the earned REP to create a constant \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4trickle\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (or stream, depending on you success and effort) of income via the \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4strategy\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (=policy). Funding bigger projects, like the final building upgrades may still make you do a contract or two...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely final EDIT to this post: I can also imagine, that this makes the game easier to balance for the devs. For example, right now, there is an infinite amount of science (not too far) out there. As proposed, there would be hardcaps on both REP (well, it gets really hard to earn more after you have sent 10 kerbals everywhere) and SCI to be dished out by the game in total. I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d guess that it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s easier to distribute a finite amount of something rather than an infinite amount. Or: How much SCI/REP/FUN should this contract give? Well, reducing it to just one number by principle makes this problem rather trivial: Harder contracts earn more money (and nothing else), period.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T13:59:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T14:07:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, just a little final point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt keeps things clean and simple.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell...

But they are being shoehorned together with the profane.
