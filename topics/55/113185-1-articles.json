It\u0027s not fun. Just my opinion amigo\u0027s.\n\n*Note: People who like realism at it\u0027s grittiest will be fine, I think we need a poll but I suspect the majority think it\u0027s a PIA to do Interplanetary Transfers.*"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:03:03Z","Content":"I agree with you, that is unless there will be a way for mods to be introduced some how. Also i can imagine building to be extremely difficult without anything but a mouse. Think of the troubles we already have using a mouse to build with parts not snapping to where you want them and such. I think this will be worse on a controller and will test the patience of many."},{"CreatedByName":"nipulsansei","CreatedById":145030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:37:28Z","Content":"When I first started playing KSP, interplanetary transfers seemed nearly impossible. So I went and started learning things, such as delta-v requirements, Hohmann transfers, engine ISP ratings, mid-course correction burns, launch windows, etc. Afterward, transfers were manageable. With practice, they\u0027ve become routine.\n\nIt\u0027s still not easy, but by studying and practicing; with careful planning and design, it\u0027s one of the most rewarding experiences I\u0027ve had in a game. The only things I can think of that are more difficult, and rewarding, are ascending in Nethack, and 15% runs in Super Metroid.\n\nBut then, I do like my games hard."},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:53:22Z","Content":"Can\u0027t you stick to all of the other threads full of people whining about this without cluttering up the forum with more?"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:56:59Z","Content":"Lots of completely unsupported and unsubstantiated claims there selfish\\_meme, you\u0027re making assumptions on things you have not seen yet.\n\nThis thread is useless, closing."}]}
