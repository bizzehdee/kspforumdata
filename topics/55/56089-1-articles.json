I go away from the forums for a month or two and when I come back there\u0027s a brand new topic that everybody is up in arms about. It certainly seems like Squad has kicked a hornet\u0027s nest with this one, but before I give my opinion I\u0027d like to clarify that I haven\u0027t seen all of the Kerbalcon footage, and so probably missed the comment(s) that has(have) so incensed everyone. All of the input I have to provide on the matter comes from information I\u0027ve gathered through other posts around the forums, so there\u0027s that. If somebody could tell me what exactly was said, well I\u0027d appreciate that!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here we go...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources should most definitely be an integral part of the core game. I think Squad knows that some level of resource gathering would enhance the core gameplay\u0027s richness and provide more incentive for the exploration which is essentially the *entire* point of the game. That said, I think what is in question here is the extent to which resource gathering needs to be implemented. The resource chart provided by Squad is certainly complicated and could probably be simplified significantly without impacting the learning curve too hard. The main argument around here seems to be \u0022it\u0027s too complicated so new players wouldn\u0027t be able to figure it out and would probably give up playing,\u0022 to which I say \u0022there is nothing in the proposed mechanic that would explicitly require new players to learn and use this mechanic, making it completely optional.\u0022 Also, let us not forget that KSP is and always has been a game about space program management, which in itself requires a base level of ingenuity and wit. If somebody is able to learn and master all other mechanics in the game then I see no reason why resource management would be anything special.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also heard rumor that multiplayer has been officially announced. Again I did not hear this get said during Kerbalcon so perhaps somebody could enlighten me, but if this is indeed the case then I feel it is a gross misapplication of resources available to Squad. The formal stance has always been to provide an outstanding standalone single player experience to the player, wherein they could play around in a consequence-free sandbox mode or try their hand at a deeper and more rewarding career mode. Adding a third mode specifically for multiplayer seems extraneous, and in my opinion does not provide anything to the core experience unlike resource management.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I sincerely hope I am missing something, because if the new stance is \u0022resources no, multiplayer yes\u0022 then I am none too pleased with the development path KSP seems to be taking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T18:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I also haven\u0027t seen the whole Kerbalkon, but from what I have gathered around the forums, and from the clips I did see it seems that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- resources, if not scrapped completely will at least be massively simplified, and the whole idea is currently shelved indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Multiplayer seems like a real idea that is seriously being thought about by Squad, and it has been placed as the next item in the pipe line to develop/implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am personally having trouble imagining working multiplayer in a game that relies HEAVILY on time warp function.

Space stations have no use (game mechanics-wise) outside of orbital gas stations. Once you are done exploring, the refueling infrastructure rapidly loses its value. If you\u0027ve explored everything, you no longer need to refuel, so you don\u0027t need to refuel your stations and your space program basically stagnates.
