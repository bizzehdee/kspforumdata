I\u0027ve been playing KSP for around 6 months now, and always enjoy seeing peoples new ideas here in the forums, but I\u0027m starting to get concerned. Some people get impatient with SQUAD for not implementing their ideas for parts in stock, but I would argue that Harvester and Co. are being very wise.\u003Cp\u003EConsider the following. What if SQUAD introduced a new part that they later decided was a bad idea? (Maybe they\u0027ve had this experience with the \u0022ant engine\u0022.) Could they remove it from the game? What would that do to the thousands of people who are using it already in their saves? As KSP continues to evolve, there are bound to be some ideas that seemed great at the time, but later on just don\u0027t work for the build, or become redundant content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think we should try to hold back a little on our enthusiasm for thousands of new parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre there any parts that are in stock that you wish weren\u0027t put in?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would you like SQUAD to do if they started implementing an idea in one release they found out later was just not going to work later?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get back on topic I would say\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDo you think we should try to hold back a little on our enthusiasm for thousands of new parts?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, not really. It is our job to desire and the job of SQUAD to evaluate our desires and choose appropriate parts to include. The more thousands of parts we desire, the larger the base of options SQUAD has to choose from.

I\u0060d be OK with some \u0060zombie\u0060 parts.
