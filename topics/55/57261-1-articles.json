Rovers. The wheels currently in the game, as far as I can tell, have 100% grip when I don\u0027t want it, and no grip when I do. Their performance is, to me, rather counterintuitive. For example, when I\u0027m ascending a hill at an angle I find myself slipping down the slope when my wheels are moving, but not when I\u0027m braking. I don\u0027t think it should matter when the wheels are perpendicular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESudden turns also cause the wheels to dig in, flipping even the heaviest stuff I have built. However, at the same speed, braking head-on can let the same vessel travel an additional 200 meters before coming to a halt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of that is new, but I\u0027ve also recently noticed that my wheels\u0027 suspensions have a tendency to \u0027lock up.\u0027 When a rover goes over a rise, or any time the wheels reach their furthest suspension extension, they seem to be stuck there, bouncing my vessel along the surface until they get a hard enough shock to jolt it into working properly. It\u0027s this lockup that seems to kill my rovers the most often; when they\u0027re stiff like that, there is zero elasticity in the part which exaggerates any bump the vessel receives, and typically causes a fatal rollover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is, can this be fixed in Unity, and is there any way to let us adjust the suspension stiffness, either in the VAB or via EVA?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T05:35:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the first Tweakables update doesn\u0027t have suspension modifiers, I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s pretty certain that a future one will, hopefully not too far away.

That makes sense to me, cause if they have that power all the time with no cost, why not use it? It\u0027ll also make the non-kerbolarpanel electric generator more effective cause its smaller and can work at night, and the only reason you should have to increase suspension strength is if the rover is already really heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T07:51:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIronically, I don\u0027t want to stiffen suspension, I want to let it almost all out.
