Starting a new career, I worked my way to \u0027purchasing\u0027 with science, the entire science tree. Then I stopped. I recon there was at least half the contents in the science tree that I\u00A0never used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt bugged me often since then. I have never used neon kit. Never, in all the time I have had KSP since 2012. Then the light bulb moment from out of the blue as to why I lost interest after obtaining a full science tree, and how to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never had a love of the contracts system in the game. I have used them to get free or easy money, but I give the finger to tourists and testing things in flight. But this is where the major changes could be made to the whole of the science tree. Testing parts. Or more accurately, gaining experience and knowledge of technology and progress of that technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the way I feel, that the new Technological Knowledge (TK) Tree could work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny item in the tree could be subject to failure in use due mainly, to\u00A0the knowledge or lack of, of that item. To gain knowledge of an item, you will need to use it, either in testing on the ground, or in flight. The thing is though, to gain sufficient knowledge of an item, could take many more hours to test an item on the ground as opposed to testing it in an atmosphere or on a journey to the Mun for instance. To be decided just how many hours of knowledge would be needed of an item in order to release either its successor or an improved or bigger item, such as a fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe knowledge of an item would be displayed with the item in the tree with a knowledge bar, that fills as the required knowledge of an item is gained. As the knowledge bar fills, it has 2 effects. One being the improvement of the quality of the item , reducing to near zero its possible failure rate. But, and more importantly, when the bar becomes full, its successor will become available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow all that takes time. There are 2 other ways to reduce that time. Money and science. The knowledge, money and science (KMS) requirements for each item. Throwing resources at an item will always improve its reliability. How much money and/or science\u00A0and just how many hours of knowledge of an item is needed, would need to be worked out by the Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difficulties of obtaining\u00A0each item in the\u00A0tree would vary greatly. For instance, a bigger fuel tank would be much easier to obtain than an improved drone. eg. KMS ratio of a bigger FT being 1:9:0 with a total resource level of 1000, or for a drone KMS being 3:4:3 with a total resource level of 20000.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis idea will completely change the way you obtain a part in the game as it would require you to physically use an item to obtain others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere could be a requirement to gain knowledge from more than one item in order to get a technology upgrade. The options are endless as to the complexity of the new TK tree. KMS, ratios and resources required for an item could, to some extent, be randomised at the start of a new career, greatly changing the way the whole game plays out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, the science tree is replaced with a Technological knowledge tree. Each item in the tree being improved in quality by; time in use knowledge and/or\u00A0money and/or science\u00A0invested into it, using a KMS ratio.\u00A0Each item will have a knowledge bar which shows progress towards releasing its successor and/or other related items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EAdditional thoughts as to this idea as my thought processes develop\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could hover the mouse over a knowledge bar to get further info from those kerbals that matter. Early on in the development of an item you could get info from your chief scientist along the lines of \u0027I haven\u0027t got a clue what we need\u0027, and from your chief engineer something like \u0027I don\u0027t know enough, I need more time\u0027, he\u0027s crying as he says it. Further on into the development, your CS could say \u0027We need another 500. Just keep giving us more\u0027, or the engineer says \u0027I need another 50, I need another 50. Yeah, 50 should be enough\u0027. But you might get someone else that appears from nowhere, the Chancellor of the bank of money. He could say something like, \u0027there\u0027s no more money, your on your own\u0027. Or he could have had a good night with he\u0027s missus last night and say \u0027The chancellor has x amount of spare cash. You got 1 hour to splash it around before I change my mind\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-08T13:47:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2020 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by jagfour\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EImproved understanding of the idea.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"723179","CreatedById":207664,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-07T18:56:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223890340\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022198561\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221607288102\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002232331\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jagfour\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, jagfour said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach item will have a knowledge bar which shows progress towards releasing its successor and/or other related items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo rather than the knowledge tree we have now, it\u2019d be more of a part web?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IanCanberra","CreatedById":176895,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-07T20:10:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be a good addition.
