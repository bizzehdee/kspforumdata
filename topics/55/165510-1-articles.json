Cruder and less efficient than later afterburner systems would be after lots of R\u0026amp;D. Squirt some extra fuel into the hot exhaust and it\u0027s flame on!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI nominate the name J-25 \u0022Hera\u0022 for an afterburning J-20 \u0022Juno\u0022. I took a look at copying and editing bits from the Panther engine cfg to a copy of the Juno cfg. Parts of it are straightforward, like changing the base mode to dry and copying the wet mode modules, but then there\u0027s all the numbers to model the performance for wet mode afterburning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-15T07:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA flat 50% boost in power with 2x fuel consumption would be realistic. \u00A0Though the length should increase quite a lot (nearly double) with a small increase in weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJuno is a turbojet, not a turbofan like the Panther. \u00A0 \u00A0 Turbofans suck in extra air that bypasses the engine core, so there is more oxygen in the exhaust gas meaning you can have more of a boost from afterburning\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
