I struggle to review my stored\u00A0experiments in the Experiment Storage Unit. On long missions it is not uncommon to have \u0026gt;50 experiments stored, and I don\u0027t enjoy toggling through them all to find out if I already had done a particular experiment. It would be nice if they were presented in a table or list, rather than popups.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be surprised if nobody suggested it before, but I cannot find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is perhaps already a better way to view the stored experiments, I am all ears.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T14:14:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be pretty useful, as would with the ability to transfer individual results between containers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you haven\u0027t seen it already you might want to check out\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/107661-ksp-122-x-science-ksp-science-report-and-checklist-v54/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E[X] science\u003C/a\u003E.
