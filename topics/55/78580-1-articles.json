Some kind of long term goal for which the player can employ a long term strategy to tie their missions together into some kind of coherent overall game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETying things together can be difficult in a sandbox game. There\u0027s no plot to advance, and no actual end to the game that the player progresses towards. But long term goals that give the player something to work towards can still be created. I think the canonical example is Sim City. Your goal is to build a humming metropolis. Every time you build a house, a road, a power plant, you\u0027re working towards some idea as to how your city should eventaully work. The game never \u0022ends\u0022 as such, eventually the player simply admires their creation for a while, then tears it all down and starts again using some other long term strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this kind of idea could work well with KSP. I know not everyone wants a \u0022Tycoon\u0022 game, and right now we\u0027re all still excited by the new 0.24 features. But I think that, eventually, the endless supply of disjointed procedural contracts will leave people feeling empty. I would like the game world to evolve as I play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027d like to do in this thread is discuss features and mechanics that could provide this kind of long term strategic goal in KSP. I will provide my thoughts, and if others make suggestions I will try to work them into this post. Right up front I\u0027m incorporating ideas I\u0027ve seen posted by others in the forum. What I\u0027m trying to do is tie all of it together. In Sim City \u0022roads\u0022 by themselves don\u0027t do anything without a population, and \u0022power plants\u0022 don\u0027t make sense without something that requires power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunications Network\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the obvious place to start. The construction of a solar-system-wide communications network is obviously something that ties several launches into a long term goal. But I personally wouldn\u0027t do it quite like remotetech and require a comms link in order to control a robotic ship. Instead we could use it for other kinds of transmissions: The transmission of science data, and the transmission of contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea is this: Without a line of communication back to KSC, you can\u0027t transmit your data; you have to fly it home. Also, without a line of communication from KSC to a craft, that craft can\u0027t pick up new contracts while in flight. This brings me to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts, and the automatic acceptance and completion thereof\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine a procedural contract pops up asking me to land on Duna and perform some particular experiment. Now imagine that I already have a base on Duna with the necessary parts. The game could, then, automatically accept and complete that contract for us. We\u0027d get a notification that this had occurred, and we\u0027d earn a bit of money. It would be nice if there was a new screen somewhere at the space centre to help organize this. For example, if we had a base on Duna that did not have the necessary science experiment, the screen would show the flight with a little exclamation point or something next to it, to tell us that we have a flight in the right place to meet a contract requirement but which cannot do so because it is missing something it needs. But in order to auto-complete the contract, we\u0027d need the communications network from the previous point, otherwise we can\u0027t send the new mission to our Kerbal, nor can they send back notification of their completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re not \u0022wasting\u0022 contracts here, since contracts are endless. The idea is to have your evolving space empire provide you some benefit in terms of income. Note that you can sort of do this already in 0.24. If I have a base on Duna and then I get a contract for Duna, I can go to KSC, accept the contract, then go to the flight on Duna and complete the contract. I don\u0027t see why we shouldn\u0027t automate that away. This also provides a strategic reason to expand our \u0022space empire\u0022, with bases, space stations, and so on. Something to actually make use of the communcations network we built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously surface samples requiring return or other contracts of this nature would require that the player actually control the mission, so the player is directly responsible for \u0022high value\u0022 contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExpenses\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, obviously if we get to the point where we\u0027ve built some of a communications network and we have a few bases and space stations and science satellites around, the contracts mechanic would mean we can turn on time warp, sit back, and watch the money roll in as automatically generated contracts are automatically completed. That\u0027s not fun. At this point we\u0027re not really playing the game anymore. So there needs to be some counterbalancing mechanic. And that mechanic can\u0027t just be the cost of launching, because then we could just sit back without performing any launches and wait till our bank fills up. The requirement is this: If the player isn\u0027t really doing anything, then their bank balance should at best stay pretty much static, or (if their overall strategy has been a poor one) actually slowly decrease. A poorly executed long term strategy should result in a failed program unless the player makes adjustments to improve it. This would be akin to scrapping a Sim City metropolis in its early stages when you realize you\u0027ve done something that isn\u0027t going to work out. At the very least, you have to adjust your strategy to say afloat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s needed is some kind of maintenance cost. Now, to honest, I don\u0027t have any ideas for this that I think are particularly great. There are a lot of ways it could be done, but nothing really ideal springs to mind. So if anyone has a great idea for an expense mechanic that would work in an integrated, strategic environment, please post your thoughts! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I think is probably required is some kind of supply mechanic. Something like this: The hitchhiker module carrires three years worth of snacks for one Kerbal. Your kerbals never \u0022die\u0022 if they run out, but without snacks they get cranky and won\u0027t do any work (ie, no contract completions!). Snacks act like a resource, so they have mass. Perhaps we could also allow certain bodies other than Kerbin to \u0022generate\u0022 snacks. Say, the atmospheric bodies: Eve, Duna and Laythe. These could then become \u0022off world\u0022 bases from which to generate supply without having to carry all of the mass all the way from Kerbin. Robotic probes wouldn\u0027t need supply, but also would only be able to complete simple contracts (like temperature readings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETechnology\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than the current tech tree, here\u0027s what I propose. A set of parallel technology lines, independent from each other, and which cost funds to progress. Something like the picture below... which is just an example, the specific positions and costs aren\u0027t what\u0027s important here. The key points are that you can see what tech is available all the way to the end of each line, and highly advanced tech costs a *lot* to research:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N4Crbbt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022N4Crbbt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is controversial, but I\u0027d probably throw upgrades into technology as well, plus certain very specific rewards that can\u0027t be \u0022bought\u0022, but only unlocked by completing certain specific objectives. For example, flying through the atmosphere of Eve might teach you a lot about atmospheres and perhaps is the only way to unlock the aerospike. Landing on Minmus might be required to gather the goo needed to make the goo cannister available. Etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, what\u0027s the strategic goal?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe goal would be for the player to build a high tech, networked space civilization that can, eventually \u0022look after itself\u0022. Players choose their strategies.... what order to do things in, where to put comms relays, bases, stations, how much supply to provide up front, and so on. Once they have a fully functional empire covering the entire solar system, with communications to all points, and so on (IF they ever get there... their strategy might not work!) they\u0027ve basically \u0022won\u0022 the game. The game doesn\u0027t end... they can keep flying missions, keep playing with their empire if they want to. But when they\u0027ve done all they want to do, the player simply starts a new game and tries a new strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommunity Contributions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver on reddit /u/doofling suggested a way of tying ongoing expenses to the communications network. I struggled with the problem of electricity being infinite and free, but the suggestion was to give comms relays an inherent maintenance cost and associate it with the idea that the network requires command on control people on Kerbin. I like this idea a lot, it rewards you for building an efficient network, and it\u0027s a cost that naturally expands as your empire expands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-20T15:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2014 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T05:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I want to add....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone tells me that all of this can be actually done in a mod... an entirely new tech layout, a new space centre screen from which to \u0022manage\u0022 your empire, the auto acceptance and completion of contracts if your empire makes that possible, and so on, then perhaps I will look at creating that mod.
