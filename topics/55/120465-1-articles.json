The heat shields in the game now are \u0022abalative,\u0022 which means they work by shedding material. The material gets hot, then is eroded away by the gas flow, taking the heat with it. Relatively inexpensive materials can be used for this (\u003Cstrong\u003Erelatively!\u003C/strong\u003E), and they can only be used once. By contrast, the shuttle\u0027s shield was made out of unusual materials which would absorb and re-radiate a great deal of heat without suffering damage, but with the added problem that they would break or come loose occasionally, requiring maintenance between every flight. So they were re-useable in concept, but still couldn\u0027t go straight from one re-entry to another. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, re-useable shields are a very different thing, and would need to be handled differently in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RidingTheFlow","CreatedById":111197,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T21:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP asked about non-expendable (reusable shield), that\u0027s why I mentioned that shuttle wings make great reusable heatshields.
