What I DON\u0027T like about the bays is that they always open 180 degrees each side, clipping into wings and whatnot that are installed on the Mk2/M3 body centerline.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d really like is a slider bar in the VAB/SPH that selects how far the door or ramp can open. You could set it for, say, 120 degrees instead of the 180 degree default so it doesn\u0027t clip wings. Or have it open wider. Or set it to zero and have a hollow bay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWondering how hard that would be to code--am imagining it would require no change to the animation, just have the animation stop when it reaches the maximum pre-set value.
