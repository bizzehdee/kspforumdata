I \u0027lost\u0027 the chance to complete my first Orbital flight since i didn\u0027t have it accepted and did something in the meanwhile that required me to speed up time. Having them \u0027permanent\u0027 like the records seems like a better idea or just give them the expiry as the duration they\u0027re available to be accepted. Also, the window is too damned small to show multiple contracts at the same time, especially the fidgity \u0027300 to 500 m/s while at between 14000 and 150000\u0027 which you\u0027re trying to do at the same time as the 400 to 600/ 14000 to 180000 of another part.\n\nAlso, currently as of 1.0.2, with the stock hangar and more or less tier 1-2 parts maximum, achieving orbit is quite hard, while contracts advertising orbits are common.. and that\u0027s coming from someone that has played some KSP before (way before, but still counts).\n\nOverall i have to say i like career, but i\u0027d have some things flipped around on the research board. Struts, \u0027empty\u0027 structural components and pipes for example should be a lot easier to get. It\u0027s more a matter of getting locked in a choice of how to play instead of creative problem-solving with what you have on hand. Let\u0027s not even discuss planes."}]}
