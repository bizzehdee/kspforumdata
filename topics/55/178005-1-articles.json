I\u0027ve been everywhere. At some point between V0.17 and V1.4.4, I\u0027ve landed on every orbital body, I\u0027ve escaped the system, crashed into the sun, spaghettified, got kraken\u0027d, you name it. I\u0027m out of cool and interesting things to catapult Kerbals towards. And that\u0027s what I think the next major update should add in. Give us something cool to go to. Land on Duna twice...once at a snowy pole once off the ice...you\u0027ve seen it all. There\u0027s nothing new to be found landing in a different spot once you\u0027ve landed in those two spots. Land on Val? You\u0027ve seen everything there is to see, it\u0027s just the same texture tiled over and over and over and over. Anomalies? Yeah they were neat. Were. I explored them in Versions 0.18-0.21 or so, in fact I remember using the old precursor to SCANSat to find them(I forget what it\u0027s called). Same logic applies to pretty much every oribtal body, there\u0027s only a small handful of POIs on each one and once you\u0027ve ticked the boxes there\u0027s just not any reason to fly past the Mun. I\u0027ve even tried mod planets, which is amazing in and of itself....but they have the same problem. Once you land on them a couple times, that\u0027s it. They, like the vanilla planets, are just the same texture tiled over and over and over, and like the vanilla planets the terrain itself isn\u0027t really varied. You can tell just how \u0027digital\u0027 they really are when you drive across them and see how each area is a perfectly flat tile that\u0027s tilted to some degree.

There\u0027s tons of people who\u0027ve just got into the game recently, I\u0027m sure, and to them they still discover new things with every launch. But there\u0027s a lot of us here who\u0027ve already been there, done that, got the t-shirt, and I\u0027m sure the vast majority of us would come flocking back in droves if the next update to the game gave us a metric -beep-tonne of new things to explore, even if they\u0027re on the planets we already have. Varied terrain, weather patterns, things floating around in the solar system that aren\u0027t planets, let the imagination wander and then whatever it wanders to that the game engine supports should go into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dearly want to come back to KSP but I can\u0027t bring myself to do it. I usually load up the game, doddle around the space center for 20 minutes building a rover, launch it at a random planet, land, see nothing new, get bored, and go back to ATS or Fallout 4. Can I, and everyone else like me, get our wonderment and sense of discovery back?
