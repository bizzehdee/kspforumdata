People first learn to expect the confirmation dialog, because it\u0027s a part of the normal workflow, and then to ignore it, because it\u0027s almost always pointless and redundant. The user should only be asked for confirmation, if he/she is about to do something exceptional, which may have significant consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the player is about to delete a viable ship with several kerbals as crew, he/she probably doesn\u0027t mean it, so the game should ask for confirmation and tell the reasons why it believes that the action was a mistake. If the object is classified as debris, the player probably means to delete it, so no confirmation should be needed under most circumstances. Confirmation should still be asked, if the game believes that the object may have been miscategorized accidentally (for example, if it has crew in it) or if it seems like a useful piece of debris (a non-empty fuel tank with a docking port is the typical example). Even when the object has been deleted, it should be possible to undo the deletion, if the player notices his/her mistake just a bit too late.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
