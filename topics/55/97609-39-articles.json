There\u0027s all kinds of talk about experimentals, but I think we all know by now there\u0027s a lot of kinks that only get found in the open beta process, as well as balancing and abuse testing. With all this work being done behind the curtain, there should definitely be some open stress testing before you go declaring it\u0027s a complete game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, there are several items I feel would be missing from a 1.0 release, that really should be a part of the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1) Additional planets. The modding community has come up with ways to procedurally generate whole new systems, it should not be a huge hurdle to add new planetary systems to the base game in time for 1.0 release.

I understand this game has always been very seat-of-the-pants, but I feel this is a bit of much needed structure, and would give an easy ingame function for calculating DV costs for mission profiles before you run out of fuel halfway there, and properly plan for transfer windows, as well as discover opportunities for flybys well ahead of time and include a little extra in the fuel budget for such maneuvers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E3) An expansion of repairable parts, and inclusion of random part failures. The beta game has had enough bugs that I\u0027ve dealt with several Apollo 13 style mission events, but I would hope the 1.0 release is stable enough that these game bugs now need to be simulated as mission bugs. I\u0027m not saying every mission should see a catastrophic failure, but parts will fail over time, and there are always manufacturing defects. I see this as an essential and realistic difficulty function that can be scaled or turned off via the already ingame difficulty options.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E4) Life support systems: Once again looking to the modding community, there are already several proof of concept designs that can also play into resource harvesting. Jets and rockets run on the same fuel we do. In conjunction with repairable parts, getting an alert during mission planning for your Duna mission that your Minmus crew has suffered catastrophic life support failure and you need to immediately drop planning and focus on saving that crew would be awesome. Again, essential and realistic difficulty function that can be scaled or turned off.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E5) Weather systems to go with the new aerodynamics and whatnot. Weather conditions should at the very least be simulated. Launch weather conditions are a very real concern, and scrubbing a scheduled mission due to weather risks and missing a transfer window should absolutely be a part of the game that encourages better planning. Effects on engine performance and visual effects like water droplets on wind screens or total whiteout blizzards should be easy enough to implement, and the random effects they can have on flight performance enough to force delays. You don\u0027t actually have to have wind, you just need to simulate the effects based on roving regions. Deciding to fly during a hurricane? Have fun flying with random forces acting on your plane. Again, essential and realistic difficulty function that can be scaled or turned off.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of these may be harder to implement than others, but I believe they should all be relatively easily achievable before 1.0 hits, and absolutely essential to base game function, as well as building future DLCs and opportunities for the modding community.

It\u0027s the main reasons I enjoy SCANsat so much - it\u0027s fun to see your science give tangible, interesting results outside of just points and a bit of flavour text. If all the science in the game was that involved, it would add a bit more depth and interest to the missions.

I am of the fortunate few who can run two monitors and develop live mission profiles and do DV lookups and calculations for transfer windows, but there really needs to be some way to visualize this ingame(without mods). Not everyone is good at math or has the patience to slog through all of that when it could be easily accomplished by a mission planning aspect and a few mouse clicks. I believe inclusion of such a system, even if it\u0027s only available after upgrades or research, would greatly increase the accessibility to the game. I have bought probably a dozen copies of the game during Steam sales and given them to friends, and the number one response is the daunting learning curve, having to learn rocket science in order to calculate fuel costs and trajectories.

As it should be. It\u0027s one of the main reasons our own agencies have focused more on unmanned missions in the last few decades. Also, TAC LS is only complicated if you want it to be and get all fancy with the recyclers. Otherwise it\u0027s a fairly simple in/out system. I believe a basic form of LS could be easily implemented and rolled in with the current resource collection work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Weather conditions of course would be somewhat predictable, as much as they are in real life, and things like windspeed might scrub a small rocket but a larger rocket could handle it. It\u0027s a small realistic risk factor, and a judgement call. Maybe Jeb could handle the flight, but the rookie sure as hell can\u0027t. Honestly, what is the likelihood that Kerbin is blessed with constantly perfect weather, never has any accidents, the people don\u0027t need to eat drink or breathe, and yet is so sparsely populated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you can see how I believe some of these should come together to add a realism aspect to the game, and I really believe they should be base game. A farming game without droughts or washouts or blights isn\u0027t very realistic and quickly becomes too predictable. I would like for a dust storm on Duna to knock out a few solar panels and require maintenance work. The LS, failures, and weather would add reasonable and realistic difficulty and engagement, especially for EVA work, and the mission planning would make certain aspects much easier for beginners. Less time futzing around in the VAB and rough testing on the launch pad only to find out halfway there you\u0027re hosed(and actual consequences for leaving your dudes floating in space to die as a reputation hit), more time in missions getting things done.
