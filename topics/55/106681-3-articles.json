I had to limit its climb rate to 33\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and then it could even crack the Mach on its way up. Once over the drag hump, it sped up nicely.\n\nIn 1.0.1, the spaceplane refused to push through the transonic wall in a climb. So once I got to where the air was thinner and conditions were good for the RAPIER, I leveled off and was able to blast through the transonic drag divergence and begin seriously gaining speed.\n\nPerhaps your 1.0 designs just had better thrust than mine, in which case I expect you wouldn\u0027t notice a difference.

Right now i\u0027m too butthurt to offer a valid opinion, but i can at least say that making parachutes destructible is a good thing. There are a few more issues to sort out regarding drag at low altitudes or possibly the new fins are buggy.\n\nThe merits of finned rockets descending to low altitudes aside, it is surreal that a rocket pointing upwards sheds velocity, while the same rocket accelerates towards the ground when pointed down. Having a parachute attached but not fully deployed seems to have very very little effect. I don\u0027t know what is going on.

Im happy that you can go faster at lower altitudes and that there isnt a sorta hard cap (like there was in 0.90), but it still feels too thick and draggy for me.
