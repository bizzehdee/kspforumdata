This is because of the extreme [level of simplicity?]\u00A0this game has. Like, I don\u0027t know how to phrase this, \u0022level of simplicity\u0022 isn\u0027t quite the way to put it. I mean that, in current KSP, rocket construction is achieved by plainly stacking parts onto other parts. Instead, I\u0027d like to see configurable parts, that interlock with each other cleanly and create spacecraft that look\u00A0more complex. For example, say I want to create a launch vehicle: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E or not, this usually amounts to stacking cylinders and engines into something that looks like a tower of cylinders. Sure, this can look nice and smooth if done correctly, but it feels more like a bunch of cylinders than a complex rocket, if you know what I mean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say we add some more complexity: for example, instead of stacking fuel tanks that are by default filled with fuel and oxidizer, we can create each tank out of several simple parts: say, the player will have to connect a pill-shaped fuel tank, a pill-shaped\u00A0oxidizer tank, and a pressurizer bottle together, then surround this with a fairing. Perhaps, if we can have a building other than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, dedicated to creating rocket parts in this fashion \u003Cstrong\u003E(a. Combining the tanks, b. Loading them into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E as one part)\u003C/strong\u003E, we can reduce the part count that the extra tanks will give while raising the immersion, the feeling that you\u0027re building a rocket for real. Of course, there can be many ways of doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T16:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can \u0022sortof\u0022 do this by using procedural fuel tanks.\u00A0 Set one of the tanks to entirely oxidizer and another to entirely \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E (or if you use a realism mod i believe those tanks can be filled with realistic fuel types too) and stack them ontop of each other.\u00A0 It wont give you the exact effect you want, but its a little more realistic then the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E integrated into everything tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for stock rockets being boring, i can agree and disagree with that.\u00A0 I generally use rockets as a means and not an end and mostly only care about the payload (capital ships, carriers, starfighters, tanks, buildings, ect), so for me most rockets are just simple 3.5m parts with the biggest engines and fuel tank options since i could care less about what they look like or how the work.\u00A0 That said, a few of the rockets i use are actually engineering marvels since you cant always cram something the size of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E into a fairing and expect it to work properly.\u00A0 So it defenetely doesnt end up as a normal looking or easy to build rocket when it has to lift things akin to macey dean\u0027s carrier into orbit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, if rockets arent your thing there is plenty of other stuff to do in KSP.\u00A0 I suggest you give spaceplanes/SSTOs a shot, they are way more complicated to build then rockets.\u00A0 Caring more about sci-fi, the first ever thing i actually got into orbit in KSP was a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E (very few cool sci-fi movies actually use cylindrical rockets as anything but weapons on fighters).\u00A0 Its much more challenging and while its not entirely realistic (it seems you annoyance with stock rockets being they are less realistic because dont have individual fuel tanks for each propellant section), give it a shot if you are being bored by the stock rockets which i can totally agree, are way to simple to make (especially if you use 3.5m parts and your payload isnt in excess of 500t)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T16:42:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would make a great and useful mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the \u0022level of simplicity\u0022 is relative to hours and skill in the game and I feel that a complex rocket building addition to stock would add another level of difficulty to the learning curve new players go through.\u00A0 It would also make image diagnosis difficult for people posting in the gameplay questions section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-16T16:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thing that strikes me is that real rockets closely resemble a simple cylinder with an engine on the bottom too, and even so I have no problem making rockets look complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, there are plenty of mods which do something like what you want, procedural tanks, moddable tank contents, multi-part different shaped tanks like spheres, hemispheres, rings etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do like the sound of kinda creating \u0022custom\u0022 parts that are welded into a single part though, lots of scope to things like that.

Like it or not, real rockets are\u00A0kind of stacked cylinders. The only difference is, when making fuel tanks, the make it one tank instead of a couple of them stacked. Why? To make it more simple. There is a mod that allows you to create your own custom fuel tanks like this. Procedural parts.
