Might be better as a mod, but if it was added in stock- I\u0027d probably use it all the same. Since occasionally I do pop between engines to see which works best for the mission at hand. Most of the time I don\u0027t care (between the Wolfhound and the Spark engine, most of my needs are easily achieved without having to try), but on the few times where I do care (and if I played more in career this would be more useful) this would be a great asset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-09T19:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs someone with dual monitors and an excel licence it wouldn\u0027t be all that useful for me, but I could see it being useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-11T08:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, good call.
