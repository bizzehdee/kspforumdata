So I\u0027m quite happy that things stay where you put them. It\u0027s tricky enough setting up a good communications network that ensures all the satellites remain well spaced and don\u0027t bunch up round one side of the planet, without them having decaying orbits too.\n\nThat said, I can also see that it could be an interesting game mechanic to have in a limited capacity.

It would not really be a game mechanic that you could design for, it would be an inescapable annoyance. You could park you satellite or stations under 70km if you want the orbit to decay.

This is done for simplicity, game play and more or less computing power limitations. Having more detailed N body physics would be more interesting but is pretty much not going to happen for KSP. Not only would a player have to keep track of different levels of gravitational pulls from a huge number of factors, but the computer would have to do such all the time. \n\nNow orbital decay would be interesting, but its one of those things thrown in with Life Support. It can be done, but the game currently has little in the way of time management systems. How would you keep track of when your spacecraft will re-enter and die in relation to other crafts? At what Rate, will you have time to help it if you launch at this time ETC. Things will get complicated very fast and the game just isn\u0027t really outfitted for that sort of complex time management systems. Especially when it comes to time critical issues. \n\nSay you have a station in orbit around Duna, will you have enough time to send a pick-up mission and return before the station, AND the pick-up ship fall back into Duna\u0027s atmosphere. Not only would you have to content with that, any time-warp would need to be checked with all other missions as they could need to be handled so you don\u0027t come out of time warp with your KSS in the ocean.\n\ni like the current leave and forget system. It allows me to focus on more interesting tasks, rather than deal with handling very minor issues constantly."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:36:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to add to 5th Horseman\u0027s sentiment by saying that the lack of realism in this aspect removes a lot of frustration from the game.

In real life we have days, weeks, months, years before a typical orbit is perturbed enough to need maintenance. We also have months and years to wait for interplanetary transfers. In KSP, thanks to timewarp, we potentially have seconds and minutes to wait between interplanetary transfers if we choose and we therefore have seconds before a typical orbit is perturbed into oblivion.
