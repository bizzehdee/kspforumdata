That way, if something smacks into your base with enough force, the anchors could break and the craft would become physics-enabled once more. That would make it harder to do \u0027exploity\u0027 things with permanent bases, as they would not be totally indestructible and wouldn\u0027t be \u0022stackable\u0022 because of the need for anchor parts to be near the ground.

And furthermore, it would be possible to implement this (I think) with a plugin. Currently, we have a plugin called KerbTown, which adds buildings as static structures. But, it is only designed to make static structures that were created as static structures. What I think would be genius would be a plugin that could take your ship and weld it all together (like part welder), and then place it as a static structure. (could cause glitches if anything is nearby, since it would disappear as vehicle and reappear as a structure, but I think it could work)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T20:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eid love to be able to permanently anchor a base to the ground, and make the whole thing a static welded entity of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Force21","CreatedById":14852,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T23:28:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf something crashes into the anchored structure, instead of physics quickly being enabled on it, the whole thing could just blow up.

Like so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay you launched a space station into orbit. Say there were a minimum of 45 parts (not counting struts or fuel lines) on each.

Then the ship would be on rails, and would have to be in orbit with no decay (over 70km for Kerbin at the moment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA special module would be required. Most parts would not undergo physics but could function, like transferring fuel or electricity. Only open docking ports would have physics on at all times when within 2.5 kilometers. When something hits greater than 1 m/s, all parts in the blast radius of 5m would be taken out of physics. If they would effect there neighboring parts, they are taken out too. If a part is shot off into the black, then it gets set on rails and is called debris. Kerbals could transfer because only hit boxes would be checked by the engine. There you go. And also a limit to size, like 1000 parts or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
