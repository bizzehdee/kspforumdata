We seem to be stuck in this rut of thinking that anyone making money is evil, and only indie devs who are barely scraping by are worth our notice. Not to mention that we assume the worst possible outcome when someone mentions the term \u0022DLC\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets get something straight: DLC is not inherently evil - in fact, it\u0027s actually pretty awesome. The problem is that some developers have used it as a way to cheat their customers. I don\u0027t believe for a second that SQUAD would do such a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn recent times a number of companies have committed some serious breaches of trust against the gaming community. Microtransactions for pointless fluff content, pay-to-win, and on-disk \u0022DLC\u0022. Those things are bad, dishonest, and generally distasteful. But \u0022DLC\u0022 is not necessarily bad because companies do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood DLC has and still does happen. When you have a full complete game (KSP is scope complete, upon 1.0 we will have what we \u003Cem\u003Epaid\u003C/em\u003E for), and the developers then produce even more content for that game, it is reasonable for them to expect further compensation. Developer time is not free, nor is it cheap. SQUAD could call it quits at 1.0 and be perfectly within their rights, because they finished the game. The idea that we somehow deserve anything else they produce is absurd! What if they made a new completely unrelated game? Would we be entitled to that as well? Of course not. So why do we expect to get all future KSP content for free as well? That\u0027s insane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for one fully support DLC (so long as it\u0027s not microtransactions). And to get back on topic. . .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see interstellar content; airships and ocean going vessels would be cool; multiple competing space programs (AI run, as well as multiplayer) and multiple launch sites; and more content for rovers and stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are so many suggestions in this forum that are really cool, but tend to go beyond the scope of what the game is about - but they would be perfect as DLC. I want to see those things become a reality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T21:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad\u0027s not gonna have DLC.
