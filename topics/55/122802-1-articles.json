It started with thinking about how to make my ship stronger without struts. The obvious answer is welding etc. But that brought out another idea. IF welding techniques have to be learned different strengths of them or techniques could be unlocked in the tech tree. Then that brought to the final idea. If you find something specific and realistic enough you could add specific things instead of just generic point that also have to be done to unlock. Say you need science points and achievements to say you did the thing to learn that specific unlock. Then the game is not quite so linear. This could be applied to all other parts in some way. Wether you buy the parts and someone else unlocks(like and turn based game free tech unlock) or you develop it yourself through action in space etc. As things are thought out to help unlock a lot of ideas for new game items could be made and the game hashed out a bit more. And it could add stuff to do in space or on excursions. And add more to do to unlock tech giving the game a few more dynamics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the idea of added achievements you can carry out on mission to unlock the specific things on the tech tree. The welding was just my thought pattern. But a decent example. What would it take to develop this tech and what really would you have to run into or do to learn that skill etc. And as noted ways to buy free upgrades could exist so you can bypass them if you randomly get the chance in game and wish too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the achievements could reflect what it took in real life to develop that technology. Or be reflective of it in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-11T20:42:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2015 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
