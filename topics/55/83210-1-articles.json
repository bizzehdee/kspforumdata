Instead of MASSIVE amounts of science all at once, you could get small amounts of it at a constant rate. This thought came to me when I was playing career mode and I ran out of ways to do science, but I couldn\u0027t get to other planets yet(I was STUCK!). With the telescope though, you wouldn\u0027t ever run run out of science(It might be a long wait)! Let me know what you guys think.

Even if there\u0027s diminishing returns, it\u0027s still basically free Science which renders it pointless. And I assure you OP, you are not stuck. You just need to think creatively - docking ports are the key to interstellar travel. Until you unlock them, it\u0027s just about getting the most amount of dV into orbit and waiting for a transfer window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, Science is already too easy to get. It was possible to never have to leave the Kerbin system to complete the tech tree and now with contracts offering free science, it\u0027s possible to never even need to leave Kerbin itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: But yes, a stock telescope would be a nice addition, provided DOE and EVE also eventually get stock equivalents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-29T02:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Science over time\u0022 should be okay so long as it isn\u0027t too easy to set it up.

It will also completely overhaul science, so the problem of science being too easy to get is solved. However, it will be aimed towards the more experienced users of KSP and as such will be quite a bit more diffucult than stock. Not as difficult as RO, but still up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
