Their fate is entirely in their hands, which is why I strongly encourage them to address some of these issues.

SQUAD is making a good decision in aiming for the 99% of people who don\u0027t care about tiny details and just want to have fun, over the 1% who demand to play the most realistic games invented.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI certainly loved the version of KSP that I first started playing, but I would not have continued to play without some of the wonderful mods that are available. I still love KSP, as far as anyone can \u0022love\u0022 software. I would rate it as the single most entertaining piece of software I have used in the nearly 40 years of using computers. I want to see KSP and Squad succeed. I\u0027m not sure where you\u0027re going with your statement about Squad\u0027s \u0022decision in aiming for the 99%\u0022 and the part about \u0022the most realistic games invented\u0022. I assume you\u0027re attempting to further divert from the point I was trying to make, which had nothing to do with realism. My point ultimately boils down to: consumers expect a game to perform as advertised, which in this case includes mods. If it does not live up to expectations, then there will be consequnces in the market.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think we all agree that KSP is a fantastic game, and would like to see it thrive. Apologizing for weaknesses, or ignoring problems does nothing to help achieve that common goal. Constructively pointing out flaws or opportunities for improvement CAN halp, if Squad is willing and able to listen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T04:40:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same mod fetish and when i used to play minecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have fun on the stock game for a while, but then cant take it anymore and literally start downloading every mod i see that adds new content until the point where KSP cant take it and crashes, then i start removing the mods which i like the least until i can have an equal balance of lag and mods\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
