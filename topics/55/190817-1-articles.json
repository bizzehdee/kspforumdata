Different science experiments can provide a varying degree of each. Generic instruments could provide all three, while more specialized would only provide one or two. The purpose of the different science currencies would still be used to unlock tech nodes, which now cost different amounts of each.

The menu for this can be set very similarly to how contracts are now. An icon on the GUI can be added for science result logs and would flash once a new result is obtained from either a transmitted Data result, or a completed research project (See: R\u0026amp;D Building, Science Teams).

You can run an in-depth analysis for each of the Science types (Bio, Chem, and Mat). Each analysis destroys the sample as part of the research, and subsequent runs of the same analysis on samples from the same biome yield vastly diminishing returns and/or take longer.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIn addition to increased science returns, sample research/analysis from a Research Lab has a chance to trigger an event. Events can be beneficial, detrimental, or preferably provide a number of player choices. For example, a sample from Duna could be found to potentially have micro-organisms. You could have the choice of exposing them to radiation or some other substance. Each choice would have an associated cost and either a randomized result, or a specific one depending on the sample and the Event. Events can be wildly different with different choices, and the percentage of each could be adjusted as to be less randomized.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDevelopment Lab:\u003C/strong\u003E The development lab is the Tech Tree/Technology tab as it is in stock today. A couple of changes are that, like sample analysis, each node takes time to research. The cost of each node will now be one or more of the three new science types; depending on what it unlocks. Nodes for structural parts can cost more Material than other sciences, electrical or propulsion can cost more Chemistry, while manned or life support parts could cost more Biology.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOther desirable changes to the Tech Tree system could be implemented here as well. One such change is using nodes to unlocked upgrade technologies and not necessarily \u201Cparts\u201D alone. Nodes could even research \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E building upgrades, or Kerbal abilities. A tech node can unlock a part such as a manned capsule. The capsule has built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and auto-pilot but both are locked. Two nodes later on the tech tree could then \u201Cunlock\u201D the ability for new crafts with that capsule to use each the built-in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, or its probe core.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2ecc71;\u0022\u003ESCIENCE TEAMS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoth sample research and tech node research now take time and funds. Each active research takes a certain amount of funds per day to maintain research. Providing Additional or reduced funding will affect the time it takes to complete each project. Funding would be managed from the Admin Building, along with any other R\u0026amp;D Policies. Research Projects are done by Science Teams. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has one Science Team by default, plus one per level of the R\u0026amp;D Building for a total of four teams at the highest level. A science team can be assigned to either research a sample, or a tech tree node. Starting out, you may have both teams analyzing samples for early science gain, and then switch both to research tech nodes once enough is obtained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2ecc71;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMOBILE PROCESSING LABS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe MPL and other parts like it will function very similarly to the R\u0026amp;D Building in that it provides you with the same three sample analysis options. Instead of requiring funds, MPLs need to be crewed and provided with power (and maybe eventually life support). Each MPL will provide a new science team. The efficiency of the MPL will be based on the Kerbals\u2019 experience, and the results based on the location similar to stock now. Perhaps MPLs could also research tech tree nodes, especially if the tech tree is expanded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#2ecc71;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEXPERIMENT RESULT FLOWCHARTS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe following are flowcharts to show the process for running experiments and obtaining science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e67e22;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EINSTRUMENT EXAMPLE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this example, a simple instrument part is run.
