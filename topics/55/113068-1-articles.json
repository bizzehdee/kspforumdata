In the end I\u0027ve got so fed up with constantly having to stop and repair a wheel that I\u0027ve increased the TR-2L\u0027s impactTolerance from 300 to 450 and now it is a much more enjoyable experience. It still breaks if you flip the rover at speed, crash into something hard or take the full force of coming down a steep slope on one wheel and it still has it\u0027s 60m/s top speed limit. But it can drive around the bumps by the launch pad, do little jumps and mostly take it (if you land a jump unevenly a wheel or two still breaks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI arrived at 450 as a better impactTolerance through playing about with different values and comparing it to what the other wheels are set at. The M1 (the next size down) has an impactTolerance of 200 and the XL3 (the big one) has a tolerance of 800. So the default tolerance of 300 on the Ruggedized means it\u0027s quite close to the M1 in strength (which I\u0027m sure came off a small trailer). The XL3 really is a big wheel and intended to take much greater weights so the TR-2L shouldn\u0027t be anything like as strong as it is. So 450, a bit more than twice as strong as the M1, just under half as strong as the XL3, seems like a good balance. \u003Cstrong\u003Eand it is much more fun\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking about making it so the wheel can go faster, the 60m/s cap on speed is fine by me, what I want is better ability to handle rough terrain. My test rover (which is a very tough, almost unbreakable thing) is only 2.2 tons so 4 TR-2L\u0027s should be more than enough to support it\u0027s weight going over some bumps at around 20m/s. With this rover and the default impact tolerance if I drive at 20 m/s square on to the small ramps around the VAB (the ones over the pipe) the wheels will break from just hitting the ramp, with an impact tolerance of 450 they can do that fine, and I can drive fast (between 40-50m/s) over some of the bumpier parts of Duna and it can deal with the bumps ok (still get some breakages, but not nearly as often).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow before I get the realist arguments saying that rovers are not meant to be driven at anywhere close to 40m/s and they aren\u0027t supposed to be jumped!

Also the thing about the scenery boring at low speed, agreed, even with scattering terrain doesn\u0027t help very much. Some more fractal/procedural detail might help alleviate things here I guess. A lot of these are meant to be lightweight wheels for optimal delta-v during space transport so I guess they will always be a bit fragile compared to their earthbound counterparts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
