I think it should work differently. Say you want to make a jet engine. You take an LV-T30 and a Machine Upgrade piece and you unlock the Basic Jet, which can be researched to be improved. What if you want a better booster? If you want a BACC, take an RT-10 and stack it in the crafting menu and you will get a BACC Rockomax booster. A SABRE Engine would have you craft a rocket and a jet together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would also need to use science to craft things together, and when you\u0027ve crafted something, you unlock a section of the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously these recipes need work, but there is my concept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:12:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know that\u0027s not how enginering works right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T14:18:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s at least as close to the real thing as we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, though, I don\u0027t like it.

That\u0027s like an emergent property of Minecraft. I doubt the developers envisioned redstone for that in the first place. It\u0027s something the users came up with, and later more types of stuff was added to make all that complex stuff possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real \u0022problem\u0022 is the fact there are weird blocks with weird properties in MC. The torches are infinite sources of energy. Water doesn\u0027t flow properly. I could go on and on because it\u0027s in fact a magical world. It has a sense of reality because it\u0027s a game of survival in the middle of nowhere, but its elemental components are not realistic at all. They\u0027re completely weird, unlike KSP, which has a degree of liberty, but its basis is realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wouldn\u0027t like to see MC crafting in KSP.
