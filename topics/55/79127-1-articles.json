Here is one way in which I think contracts could add more fun and more challenge to those who were seeking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract Idea:\u003C/strong\u003E Place (x) number of (satellite/s) into orbit at (x) meters above the surface of (Planet/moon). Satellite/s must consist of (part A), (part \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, (part C).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContract Idea:\u003C/strong\u003E Place (Craft A) in orbit at (x) meters above the surface of (Planet/moon) with parts (A), (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E, \u00A9.

I think the parts should have a very loose set of restriction so players only have to follow a basic set of guidelines and can maintain their personal identity in how they construct their vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncentives could be offered upon completion of the contract besides those already offered. For example, upon completing a spacestation/satellite network you are given an amount money/science per unit of time. Maintenance of the stations and satellites could also be an option and required to maintain the station/satellite income/science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts as I battle through the already fun .24 missions\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
