I was really hoping that we could just get rid of the drouge chute altogether, and make it so parachutes can open immediately after entering the atmosphere, so that you can get the most out of the drag it produces. Obviously you couldn\u0027t have it fully deploy due to a lack of air pressure, but it would be really nice if you could allow it to partially deploy at 70k and fully deploy at much higher altitudes (like 15k). It would allow players to be able to turn the smaller parachutes into drogue chutes (since we only have 1m drogue chutes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T16:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from that there is also a [bUG] there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor drogue the minimum pressure is actually 0.01 when tweaking (as with every other chute) while it should be 0.007 as for default. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T17:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou still cannot tweak the drag value of the open chute. Even if you opened your main chute in vacuum, it could break your ship once you reenter. At least I think it could. Because the chute drag is applied to just one point where it is mounted, while during reentry, the drag is applied about evenly to all parts in the same direction. That\u0027s why ships have no problems surviving it (without heat effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, I think you can actually test it if you manage to open the chute below 500 m and still get to orbit (there was a challenge about this once).
