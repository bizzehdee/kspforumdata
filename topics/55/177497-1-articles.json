Phones just do not have the processing power required to run KSP, and there really isn\u0027t a way to get around that. The small profile restricts what\u0027s possible with the device, due to limits on the size of a transistor and because of cooling (or lack thereof). Also, a typical phone touchscreen doesn\u0027t have enough room to fit enough buttons to permit the playing of KSP. It\u0027s easier to list the keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard that KSP doesn\u0027t use than it is to list the ones it does. The second suffers from many of the same problems, considering the complexity of the editor controls (and there really is complexity in there), as well as the amount of KSP that you\u0027d have to port, and difficulties getting files to and from the phone. Oh, and the craft designer would be worthless for modded installs, as well as career and science mode, and you\u0027d have problems dealing with Making History. I can\u0027t think of a workable mechanism for pointing the designer at a KSP install on some remote machine, which makes it a bit difficult to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and the demand among the playerbase just isn\u0027t high enough to make an enormous project like this one worth it to the devs. The number of people who\u0027ve said \u0022Oh, I wish I could play KSP, but I only own a phone\u0022 is not very high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-11T19:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough running KSP as a whole on a phone is nigh impossible in today\u0027s technology, that isn\u0027t what most people want anyway.

I\u0027ve often used it parallel to playing or when I was away from my PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a similar app for KSP that lets u do things that contribute to ur actual gameplay would be a managable task and a nice way to connect the game and the player\u0027s\u00A0phone. It would probably require a connection to some account so everyone can access their own game data from the phone, but I think there\u0027s quite alot of useful things that can be done, mission planning for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets just say ur sittin\u0027 somewhere in a caf\u00E9 and waiting for a train, planning ur exact maneuvers using the familiar map of the Kerbol system and whatever else may be required for mission planning. The result would be the\u00A0EXACT value of delta-V required for this particular flight pattern, u could see wether the maneuver needs to be executed quickly with a powerful engine or can be done over time with an ion engine and probably much more that a notorius N00B like me doesn\u0027t even think of. Back at ur PC u can get building according to the exact values resulting from the plan made in the app. That wouldn\u0027t even require a connection to the actual game AND it would be mod-friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just my 2 cents on the topic and what I think would be the most useful purpose of an app that goes with KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalChamp2006","CreatedById":190555,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-20T16:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust get simplerockets 2 when it comes out for mobile\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161533-dualdeserteagle/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022161533\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/161533-dualdeserteagle/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DualDesertEagle\u003C/a\u003Ei really like your idea of a companion app rather then just a mobile version,\u00A0because sometimes i reeaally want to play ksp but im away from my computer.
