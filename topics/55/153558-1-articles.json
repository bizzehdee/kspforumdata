Thermal efficiency\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, efficiency takes a beating when you downscale, because of increased heat losses (volume goes down by 3rd power, outside area only by 2nd power, so smaller tanks/reactors have a relatively larger outside surface area). That\u0027s an inherent issue with downscaling processes that operate at temperatures other than ambient (although I am not sure there even is such a thing as ambient temperature in space).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2. Higher net costs lead to different design choices\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe costs of smaller processes are higher than the larger processes in terms of \u003Cem\u003Ecosts per mass of product.\u003C/em\u003E A simple rule of thumb for chemical processes is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale#Capital_and_operating_cost\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E0.6 power rule\u003C/a\u003E:\u003Cem\u003E \u0022changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio\u0022\u003C/em\u003E (text from wiki)\u003Cem\u003E. \u003C/em\u003EI want to note that this 0.6 power rule actually applies for chemical factories, and does not really apply for processes as small as our ISRUs, but there are few relevant simplified rules for small scale stuff, so I thought I would mention it anyway. The general idea that downscaling makes stuff more expensive still applies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, when downscaling, components become relatively more expensive. All your control systems (e.g. the electronics that measure temperature, and open/close valves) are not scaled at all, and will be just as costly on a larger rig as on the small scale one. Complex items where the machining costs of the manufacturing process are a major factor (and where the material costs are only a small factor) tend to not become much cheaper when scaled down. Think of the valves, pumps, for example. So, in terms of costs per ton of product, the smaller processes become much more expensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of the higher costs per ton of product at small scale processes, it may not always pay off to have complex separation/purification systems to use/recycle off-spec streams or waste streams. The choices are to either discard these (we can assume that the small Convert-o-tron does this) or accept the higher costs. Discarding waste streams instead of recycling/upgrading them will obviously affect the overall efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe increased cost leads to different design choices, and may lead to lower efficiency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr, Yes, the lower efficiency of the small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E compared to the big one makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EComment on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E differences, fuel cell efficiency and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E efficiency\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComparing the 125 and 250 Convert-o-trons, we have to be looking at two completely different processes that happen to have the same feedstock and products. The difference in efficiency is simply too large to originate from the same process. The difference in efficiency is about a factor 6, I think. I think that it\u0027s a bit much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that, I think it is weird that we can power the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E with a fuel cell. Especially the large \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E can easily generate a lot more fuel from ore than its necessary fuelcells consume to power it. If the ore consists of the oxidized version of the fuel, then that\u0027s completely unreasonable. Using fuel cells to power the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E should never have a net positive fuel production. Instead, it should drain the tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only explanation how the fuel production can cost so little electricity is that the ore is only partially oxidized. Because it is possible to turn the ore into fuel and oxidizer using quite little energy, some of the chemical energy should already be present inside the ore! Therefore, we should be able to react that ore (with itself) to a lower energy state. We should be able to use ore directly as a low-energy fuel, \u003Cem\u003Ewithout \u003C/em\u003Eany \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can live with this mismatch, because \u003Cem\u003Eit\u0027s only a game... \u003C/em\u003EThe design choices are interesting from a gaming perspective.
