When a node is selected, the DELETE/DEL key should delete it. Currently, if it is an active node, you must click the node, grab the circle, and drag the circle outwards until it becomes red. If it is a past node, you must click the little circle with the X. It would be much quicker to select the node and hit the DELETE key.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Moving the node with the arrow keys. Dragging the node with the little circle can be challenging sometimes, because you accidentally click one of the 6 modifier handles and drag it. Or, you drag the circle off the orbit until it becomes red and disappears. My suggestion is that the arrow keys also be used to move the node along the orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Left arrow, right arrow: move node 20 degrees backward or forward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. Shift-left, Shift-right arrow: move node 5 degrees backward or forward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Ctrl-left, Ctrl-right arrow: move node 1 degree backward or forward\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed.

Make the node circle bigger when selected.
