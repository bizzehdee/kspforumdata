Again, I\u0027m aware of various modular base and station parts, but what I\u0027m envisioning is, well, bigger. Somewhere to park my Mk3 Shuttle in the shade, or to strip it down for an overhaul out of the solar radiation. See what I mean?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody know of a mod for this?
