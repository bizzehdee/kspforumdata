I can never get a design that I\u0027m happy with that uses it. I think that it needs some re-working/additions. For one, the texture on the backside of the cockpit is off center. But beyond that the Mk-3 parts also don\u0027t have much use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mk-3 fuselage doesn\u0027t have oxidizer for de-orbiting a shuttle design.

I assume/hope the current parts are place holders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment MK2 and MK3 fuselages don\u0027t offer any functionality to make up for their size and lack of fuel. MK3 and MK2 fuselages should be cargo bays, with attachment points inside. this would allow the player to put External Command Seats inside to transport many Kerbals at once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MK3 looks like it has room for small cylinder parts with a little extra room for radial solar panels and such.
