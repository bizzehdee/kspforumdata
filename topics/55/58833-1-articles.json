The game isn\u0027t finished, so it is impossible to write a complete work at this time, but the \u0022alpha access\u0022 principle could be taken to literature as well. A lot of things are shown off in youtube videos (which are great), forum posts and individual websites. For a newbie or someone with a specific interest (calculating dv and stage setup, for example) this might be kind of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my suggestion: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) Write a manual for the KSP team to give away with the game, for a salary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Write an ebook for self-publishing on Amazon for a dollar or two, with the promise of updates until the game is done. This could be done both in English and German.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy background:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a bilingual mechanical engineer (English and German), and before I got my degree I worked in graphic design and advertising for nearly 6 years. Right now I\u0027m finishing my Master\u0027s while working an engineering student job in a semiconductor plant and raising a family. Technically I am capable of this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I start focussing on an endeavor such as this, I would need to know if there are any takers. I know how time consuming authoring and formatting a book is, so the prospect of actually doing this is a little frightening. At the same time I see a lot of success in some Amazon-based self-releases that came in cheap in the beginning (Wool by Hugh Howey for example, with a dollar or less for each short story). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA dev comment would be awesome as well, especially since I\u0027m not sure how their stand is towards allowing third-party publications regarding their product. I know there are strategy guides and such out there for numerous games and software, but I haven\u0027t gotten into the legal stuff for that yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mast","CreatedById":98292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T11:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spamal0t\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spamal0t\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA dev comment would be awesome as well, especially since I\u0027m not sure how their stand is towards allowing third-party publications regarding their product.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a dev and not intending to know what they think.
