Alternatively the game code could be changed to accept resource amounts in part .cfg\u0027s as either the legacy arbitrary-units parameters or a new mass-units parameter and convert automatically to display in mass units, thereby not changing existing mod parts.\n\nI feel this change would make the game more transparent. At present there\u0027s nothing to directly tell the player whether 100 units of fuel weighs more, less, or the same as as 100 units of monopropellant, or even how much they \\*do\\* weigh. It creates an additional needless barrier to understanding and using the rocket equation oneself, which is something I feel players should do - delta-V should not be a \u0022black box\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:07:25Z","Content":"I\u0027d like to see this as well.

It would just need to update the VAB, right click, and resource panel (does anybody use the stock one though? It\u0027s horrible). There is a bit of a usability issue though - Xenon in particular is used in very small quantities - 700 units is 0.07t (70kg). Of course if the indicators were better, they could automatically switch between scales (that\u0027s 70,000 grams, 70 kilograms, 0.070 tons, 0.000 070 kilotons, etc\\*) as required...\n\nAnother minor issue is that electric charge and EVA propellant is massless (the EVA propellant being massless is it\u0027s own separate epic fail)... that could be handled simply by displaying them in their legacy units of course (of course if you consider it carefully, you realize that the legacy units are probably a volume measure so.. 100 kerbal liters of electric charge?)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It creates an additional needless barrier to understanding and using the rocket equation oneself\n\nStrongly agree.
