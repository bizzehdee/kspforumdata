The joints between them are flexible; they allow a craft to flex and break. This is a perfectly acceptable situation. However, as the number of parts increases, the calculations become unmanagable. The performance of Ubiozur\u0027s welding mod (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ubioweldingltd/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/ubioweldingltd/\u003C/a\u003E), demonstrates that it is possible to simplify the calculations, while retaining gameplay (mostly). Is it not possible to dynamically \u0027weld\u0027 parts together or treat them as separate bodies, depending on the situation? Or even better, to treat the whole spacecraft as a single (wobbly) body, until a breakpoint becomes probable somewhere. It would be nice to be able to build mighty stuff in the mighty environment of KSP, with a less mighty PC. Of course, the introduction of larger parts in 0.23.5 will help with that, but large space stations or detailed motherships will remain a source of major lag. Any thoughts or news on this (old) issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T19:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe welding mod definitely helps with the physics simulation for large ships, but it\u0027s at a price of kind of cheating on physics of the ship. Welded parts are considered rigid bodies which affects how they transfer forces through the ship. Meaning a ship which would break under thrust will no longer break when its parts are welded, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny optimizations to the physics simulation would be very welcome but I believe these need to come from the physics engine itself, not from KSP developers building on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity is, however, constantly in development and recently it is preparing upgrade of the PhysX simulator to newer version. If nothing else, this version is known for its substantially improved performance.
