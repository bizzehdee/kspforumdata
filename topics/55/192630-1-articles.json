Basically you could create icons for staging, boosters, and so forth. I would place my iPad and iPhone in front of me and had all of my stages and commands on a visual display. This was AMAZING like being in a true capsule and utilizing a push button interface to give a spaceship commands. It would be AWESOME to have a Kerbal interface for smart phones that allowed you to edit commands for the touchscreen buttons, and even modify icons etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
