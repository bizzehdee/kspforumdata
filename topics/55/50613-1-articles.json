All other gas giants would have objects smaller than or comparable to Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Laythe: Very volcanic because of its proximity and the tidal forces from the other moons. Still oceans of water, but now with actual active volcanos with lava lakes (that destroy things)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Vall: Never liked the design of vall too much. I\u0027d like to make it a bit more like eeloo, with large cracks in the ice and a more chaotic surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Tylo: Never liked this either, also needs to be redone. Perhaps turned into a highly-contrasting body like Iapetus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - More tiny moons: Just a bunch of small moonlets, at least 20. Probably would be nameable by the player or given designations (ex. J-17 for the 17th moon of Jool discovered)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas planet 2: ~50% larger than Jool, with rings. Early version shown on a stream a while ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Eeloo: Relocated to orbit GP2, now with large geysers that can knock your ship around (prototyped several weeks ago, they function quite well)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Daphy: Unusually smooth and round ball of fluff. An asteroid which has accumulated material from the rings, practically no gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Potatus: Small moon with relatively high inclination relative to GP2\u0027s equator. Composed of ices surrounding a highly dense core. Very rapid rotation (21 minutes) causes it to be stretched into an oblate spheroid (prototyped a while ago, the physics actually work and are really cool)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Fonso: Largest moon, ~300 km radius. Very mountainous, with a thick atmosphere that only extends partway up the mountains (as in, the mountain peaks are in vacuum, while the proper surface is at two atmospheres)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Tiny moons: Same case as Jool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas planet 3: Perhaps not an actual gas planet, could be a 2000km rocky planet with a thick atmosphere (have fun landing under 6g and 30 atmospheres of pressure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Moon with rings?
