But I am disappointed to find it lacks any space station contracts. Now I know the specifics of a space station could be vauge and easily abused, but this concept can be explored in different areas. Here are some following examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. De-orbit a space station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

I agree with treejoe4--I would love to see space station-related contracts, and I would also love to see a lot more variety in the stranded kerbal contracts. Just because a mod does something is not a reason not to improve the stock game. Some of us even prefer to play vanilla and it should be fun for vanilla players, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully we will see some additions like those suggested in 0.25!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
