There are plenty of space simulation multiplayer games (Space Engineers is an example, though I may be wrong, I\u0027ve mostly just heard about the game) and this one just doesn\u0027t seem to work well with it. Time warping would be weird since it affects the Kerbol System, making celestial bodies move faster, and ships and stations orbit faster. I suppose if it was limited to Kerbin, but then it wouldn\u0027t be Kerbal SPACE Program. Sure it would be cool to be flying planes into each other, or working together on a massive Mun Base, but...
