The operating system is really good at looking after RAM, it is never going to decline a request when there is any way it can free up the RAM, and it\u0027s never going to offer RAM that\u0027s not needed. So there is nothing to gain by changing the total amount of ram allowed, best to just set the proposed drop-down menu to \u0027all the ram!\u0027 and leave it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a limit though: KSP is a 32 bit program, that means it can only handle 3.5GB or so. It just can\u0027t keep track of more than that, so will never ask the operating system for it. That\u0027s why most of your RAM is going unused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution would be to change KSP to be a 64 bit program, but that\u0027s easier said than done.

All 3D-models, textures and logic gets loaded into RAM. No matter whether or not you are using any of those parts in your spaceships / rockets / stations etc. Since i am using NovaPunch, which has another 150 parts, KSP instantly needs 2,5GB RAM on starting the application, with no savegame loaded or anything. When i look at my constructions, i can see that i am using barely 1/4 or 1/5 of all available parts in the game. So if KSP would only load the modules that are currently in use into RAM, it could use much less RAM - but if you build a new ship and use parts you haven\u0027t used before, it would need to load the parts from disk, which would always take a small moment for every part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince i have less than 4GB RAM, i would like to wait for parts to load when building a new rocket and keep some RAM free, resulting in no need for constant memory swapping to hard drive, instead of loading ALL parts into RAM no matter if they will ever be used. That - by the way - is the reason why KSP becomes unresponsive from time to time - because there is no more RAM available and the PC starts swapping, which is slow as hell. You can see that behavior by opening task manager and resource monitor on win7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be: Dont load ALL modules on application startup, but those needed - you can read them from persistant game file when loading / resuming a game. And load parts from disk when building a new rocket, since this wont be taking too long for single parts. And, from time to time, do some \u0022garbage collection\u0022 to get rid of the parts you are not using any more.

The operating systems for those 64-bit architectures generally support both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.[21]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne significant exception to this is the AS/400, whose software runs on a virtual Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) called TIMI (Technology Independent Machine Interface), which is translated to native machine code by low-level software before being executed. The translation software is all that has to be rewritten to move the entire OS and all software to a new platform, such as when IBM transitioned their line from the older 32/48-bit \u0022IMPI\u0022 instruction set to the 64-bit PowerPC-AS instruction set, codenamed \u0022Amazon\u0022 (the IMPI instruction set was quite different from the 32-bit PowerPC instruction set, so this was an even bigger transition than from a 32-bit version of an instruction set to a 64-bit version of the same instruction set).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn 64-bit hardware with x86-64 architecture (AMD64), most 32-bit operating systems and applications can run without compatibility issues. While the larger address space of 64-bit architectures makes working with large data sets in applications such as digital video, scientific computing, and large databases easier, there has been considerable debate on whether they or their 32-bit compatibility modes will be faster than comparably priced 32-bit systems for other tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA compiled Java program can run on a 32- or 64-bit Java virtual machine without modification.

UDK is cross platform as well if thats really a major thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea why software devs put them self in this position when they could use all the latest hardware then they would not have to spend so much time on trying to programme something really complex on something so limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplus i would be more then happy to even donate money for this proccess as i believe that the KSP is a good solid game that could be played over and over again. \u0022that is rare for me\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei dont believe its too late to change the game is still in early DEV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eback to try to get KSP support my mod pack \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E and my masssssssive Ships.... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itsme86","CreatedById":59895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T04:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dlmarti\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dlmarti\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince more that 99.9% of all software in the world is still 8bit, you have a damn long way to go to reach 64bit.\u003Cp\u003EIn fact there is still more 8bit development than 32bit going on right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere do you come up with this nonsense?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T08:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs FEichinger said earlier, a game engine swap out is not gonna happen, we\u0027re gonna stick with Unity all the way through, so discussing it is pretty useless. The devs have tried coming up with 64 bit versions of the game for Windows and OSX, but they never managed to create something stable enough to release it to the public, i.e. the game crashed as soon as you tried to start a flight. Don\u0027t worry, they are aware of the memory issues with the game, they are constantly trying to improve the performance, and as soon as a 64bit version is available, you can be sure that they\u0027ll release it as fast as they can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, since this whole thread is turning out into pointless arguments and fighting, and since both changing the game engine and 64 bit support is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewhat not to suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027ll close this thread now, it\u0027s gone it\u0027s way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
