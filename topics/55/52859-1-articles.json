This could be accessed by Alt\u002Bclicking the center of the node, to bring up a new set of controls: toggle Alert Mode, time to alert up, time to alert down, and reset alert time. The basic functionality of Alert Mode would be to scale back and halt time acceleration as the player approaches the alert time set, so they don\u0027t miss their node by accident. This would add one new interface element to the maneuver node indicator near the navball (time to alert) as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next suggestion is keyboard controls for maneuver nodes. When the navball is down in map mode, it would be great if we could control maneuver node increments simply by using the standard WASDQE controls, as well as switching to and from fine control on the increments with Caps Lock. It would be a fluid and natural control scheme setup, easily adapted to by players already familiar with the controls for rocket flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T20:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support most any maneuver node tweaks.
