You know that thing where you read the forums, post by post and everywhere you see reinforces an internal argument you have had with yourself for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me be the first (in this post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E ) to say that the ARM has added extremely keep stuff to the game, and for the most part I like the direction the game is headed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to contracts, there is something that bothers me a lot though. First, we got science, which I out of ignorance thought was meant to bring a bit of goals and progression to the game, when it fact it acts more like a \u0022guide\u0022 for beginners. This is fine to some extend even its a bit sad, considering the potential the premise of gather science has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now the contract system. In some posts where people discuss what they want and don\u0027t want, it seems clear that the reason people usually don\u0027t want something, is because of exactly how pointless it would be. Take the example of satellite contracts. This is complete conjecture, but lets assume a mission would look like this: \u0022Build a vessel with x specific parts, and bring it to stable orbit around y planet\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the problem with this mission? Well for starters satellites in the main game has no point. With no signal relaying required, satellites are pointless beyond the objective of putting it up there in the first place. Lets take another example. Say a mission wants you to go to Duna, and collect x different science experiments, and transmit/deliver the data back home. Now we are back to the guide thing again, which is something the science system already offers, except assuming that there\u0027ll be money/reputation/some form of currency involved, we have just added a a different layer guiding. If the goal is to make the game easier for newcomers, and if its done right this is a great thing, as it allows those who doesn\u0027t know the game well enough yet, to be guided in an interesting way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why do I think this is a problem? Well considering what the game is, I personally find it hardly doubtful that any large portion of players who would actually be interested in playing this game in the first place, would not also have the mind and interesting in figuring the game out. This might a completely faulty assumption on my behave though. I base this assumption on the fact that this game takes at least a bit of brains to find interesting, which is usually accompanied by a certain level of nerdiness, and that is exactly what is needed to \u0022master\u0022 it. Beyond that \u0022nerds\u0022 tend to find the figuring out portion of stuff part of the fun, not the guiding part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the contract system is actually meant to interest the people who actually play the game, then to me it seems we have a problem. As it stands every mission is pretty much going to a completely self contained thing. We have no life support to manage, and we have probes that use electricity. Thus we have no need to EVER really use probes. We have no need for signal relaying, so building orbital infrastructure is pointless beyond RP reasons or personal goals. We have no resource system, which would link up with the life support and electricity system, as well as maybe even construction, so infrastructure of any kind is rather pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it would seem that the game offers a sandbox, with extremely limited synergistic options, thus having no use for a missioning system/currency system. This brings me back around to the problem that I see with contracts as it is now, and that is it offers nothing. Progression via science has already been implemented as a guide, whether then any actual progression, so using contracts to limit your crafts through budgets/rep/whatever is not interesting for science progression, and due to lack of any other type of progression, doesn\u0027t offer anything of actual value to the playerbase as it is. Granted I don\u0027t know their plan, but I don\u0027t see any easy way around it either, though admittedly this could be due to lack of imagination on my part. They seem insistent on keeping the game at the level where personal goals and creativity is all you got, so it baffles me, that they are making it a priority to implement a missioning and currency system which will, due the former, be nothing but a space equivalent of \u0022go kill x amount of bears, then return for y amount of cash/rep/huh\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that said, this is not meant as hate. KSP is an amazing game, with an amazing community, and I\u0027d have gotten my moneys worth even if what we had right now was all got. It is simply a voice of concern/a plead for clarity. I\u0027m sure the absolutely amazing modding scene will take the system and make it applicable in combination with mods that already fix many of the problems mentioned above, but the contradicting design directions has me confused.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to hear other peoples opinion this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T12:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s premature to armchair quarterback what Squad is working on for .24.

And even with this, you could still easily stick some life stupport on a rocket, and go manned to Jool. That doesn\u0027t make the game more complicated, it just gives you a degree of management.

Not only do we not know how the game systems will be implemented (and I do mean the actual mechanics, not the style of content), but as far as we currently know the .24 implementation will be preliminary and completely optional to the player. Rowsdower has all but outright stated in one of his hundreds of posts that currency and reputation is coming at a later time, not in .24.
