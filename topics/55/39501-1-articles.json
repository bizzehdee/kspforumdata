I decided to put them all in the same thread to avoid cluttering up the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#1: Make the nuclear engine generate power even when inactive, and not consume oxidizer.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned by this site: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/docs/MarsRef/addendum/A5.htm#A5.3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/docs/MarsRef/addendum/A5.htm#A5.3\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The solid core NTR propulsion system represents a \u0022rich source of energy\u0022 in that it contains substantially more uranium-235 fuel in its reactor core than it consumes during its primary propulsion maneuvers. By configuring the NTR engine as a \u0022bimodal\u0022 system, abundant electrical power can also be generated for a variety of spacecraft needs. During power generation, the reactor core operates in essentially an \u0022idle mode\u0022 with a thermal power output of ~100 kilowatts. The reactor thermal energy is subsequently removed and routed to a turbo-alternator-compressor Brayton power conversion unit using a helium-xenon working fluid, as shown in Figure A5-6. A space radiator system rejects waste heat and also reduces decay heat propellant loss following propulsive burns.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, atomic rockets have a nice hot nuclear reactor sitting there which can generate all the power your ship needs. Also, they don\u0027t actually need any oxidizer. It\u0027s possible to inject oxidizer into the exhaust of an NTR to increase the thrust (usually called a \u0022LANTR\u0022), but if our nuclear engines did that they wouldn\u0027t be getting an ISP of 800 and their TWR would be better (even accounting for Kerbal engines having lower TWRs than real ones).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#2: Make Laythe\u0027s atmosphere provide fuel to air-breathing engines instead of oxidizer. Also, add \u0022oxidizer-only\u0022 fuel tanks.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistically, even with tidal heating and greenhouse effect Laythe should be too cold for liquid water; its ocean is more likely to be liquid ammonia (and its crust water ice). This also means that strong oxidizers would be horribly unstable in its atmosphere. However, methane is a perfectly reasonable substance to have in the atmosphere of an ammonia-ocean world, and it\u0027s what Kerbal rocket engines use for fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E#3: If a craft with landing legs touches down on sloped or uneven ground, have the legs automatically adjust to keep the vehicle vertical.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be toggled on and off.
