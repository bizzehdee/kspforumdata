The biggest single graphics hog is the terrain settings on planets with an ocean. Because of the way water works it\u0027s basically like rendering two planets at the same time. You can play around with terrain settings, or tweak the ocean terrain details in the settings.cfg file, but I\u0027ve found that just tilting the camera up to keep the ground out of view works just as well, which is why that is the only graphics related part of my instructions in the first post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to keep the instructions short and require as few steps as possible; never underestimate people\u0027s ability to ignore directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the other graphics settings don\u0027t have a huge effect on performance, rendering and texture settings make a bit of a difference (I don\u0027t think there is any terrain scatter around the KSC, so that probably doesn\u0027t really matter), but it doesn\u0027t take much of a GPU to handle those at their max values. Resolution obviously can make a big difference, but I assume most people running at very high resolutions (above 1080) also have decent graphics cards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also assuming that most people who have very powerful CPUs (and are therefore more likely to run into GPU limited situations) also have powerful graphics cards. I do see some results from laptops that look a little GPU limited though. Their framerates increase in more of a steady curve, instead of the stair step pattern I usually see. But the majority of the results I\u0027ve seen don\u0027t appear to be GPU limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf someone has a compareable 0.23 / 0.22 fraps frametime csv I can run a brief statistical analysis with frappo on them (no time to play/test myself at the moment).

Your results seem really slow and recording video with FRAPS can really kill the frame rate. The FX-8350 is pretty similar to the FX-4350, it just has 8 cores to the 4350\u0027s 4 cores (and more cache), so I would expect performance to be similar between the two. On the other hand the GT 240 is a pretty low end video card, so you could just be very GPU limited, especially with all of the settings maxed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose T2600 numbers actually look pretty good. They are somewhere around 50-75% higher than what similar types of CPUs were getting in 0.22, even if you are still running at 7 or 8 FPS that\u0027s a pretty big improvement. I can see how the HD4000 would limit the i7 3770 in your case. That\u0027s a pretty big disparity in CPU and GPU power. But the low quality results seem reasonable, they are similar to the i5 3470, which is about what I would expect since HT isn\u0027t really doing anything for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the frametime result labels for 0.22 and 0.23 are switched jfx. But those look interesting. It looks like each frame is alternating between two speeds primarily; one frame is 40ms then the next is 60ms, then back to 40ms. Then there are those occasional really slow frames, around 150ms per frame that really make things stuttery. I guess any reduction in those is good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T20:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting info here! It\u0027s nice to see how everything compares, I actually feel a little better after seeing all the figures side by side. I agree with you something is up with the test on the FX-8350. I could see how the graphics might bog it down a bit, my 260x isn\u0027t that much better in the grand scheme of things and I find it limiting my FPS in some situations, particularly looking at a large ship with Kerbin in the background in LKO. ETA: I would expect the 8350 with the .1ghz overclock to run pretty much neck and neck with my stock 4350 as the extra cores aren\u0027t really going to help in this game or most games for that matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may actually run this test again soon because I\u0027ve made a couple changes to the computer hardware that could make a slight difference. I reconfigured my RAM to run properly in dual channel mode (long story) and applied the Microsoft scheduling patch for AMD Bulldozer / Piledriver chips, also a slight GPU overclock but that will be irrelevant when my new card shows up. Before running dual channel the lack of the patch didn\u0027t make much difference but between the three configurations (dual channel w/o patch, single channel w/o patch, and dual channel with patch) there are noticeable differences in FPS stability, load times, and stuttering in my modded Skyrim. I just did it yesterday and haven\u0027t run KSP again yet to test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso something to note is that with some mods in KSP I noticed an unbearable FPS drop.

I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E Kethane was the culprit but I can\u0027t prove it because I removed another mod or two at the same time when it got bad and my framerates went back to normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T21:09:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 09:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOCD or something.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demodus","CreatedById":101745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T00:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAcidEric, were you recording video during all of your tests?
