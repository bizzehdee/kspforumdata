I didn\u0027t see anything wrong with that. Until recently after I flew a mission to Duna. My fuel was low and my first launch window for Kerbin required a lot of deltaV so I waited years for a smaller burn only to discover that I had plenty of remaining fuel to make that first burn. In the end what would have been a 2.5 year mission ended up taking nearly 5 years all because of my faulty guessing. Feeling like a failure, I looked up how to calculate the deltav and then wrote a simple program in c\u002B\u002B that calculates how much deltaV a rockets current stage has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the C\u002B\u002B code:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#include \u0026lt;math.h\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eusing namespace std;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eint main() \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E{\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E double totalMass, fuelMass, engineVelocity, deltaV, Isp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0022What is the total mass?\u0022 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; totalMass;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0022What is the fuel mass alone?\u0022 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; fuelMass;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0022What is the engines Isp?\u0022 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Isp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E engineVelocity = 9.8 * Isp;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E deltaV = engineVelocity * log(totalMass / (totalMass - fuelMass));\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0022The DeltaV is \u0022 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; deltaV \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0022.\u0022 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cin.get();\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E cin.get();\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter building this and using this little calculator for a few missions, I now feel idiotic for not doing this before.

In the least a level 5 pilot or engineer should be able to calculate the remaining deltav for the current rocket stage. Which could keep players like me all stock.
