However, I AM certain that it can be done with that part Nova posted in combination with a stock radial decoupler. Attach them in this order: From the Main rocket, attach a radial stack separator, then a radial decoupler, then whatever you wanted to attach to the main rocket. Set the staging so the radial decoupler fires first, then the radial stack separator. This way you can use the radial decoupler to kick the radial stack separator away from the main rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a way to make it use a single part, that\u0027s much better.

The \u0022parent\u0022 craft\u0027s staging sequence triggers the stack separator, decoupling it and the \u0022child craft\u0022 from the main rocket. The child craft and stack separator remain connected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The player switches focus to the child craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
