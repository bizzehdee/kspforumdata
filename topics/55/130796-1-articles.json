I\u0027d like it to have a bigger part in the game- to be able to weight what contract types a player gets. The types of contracts for example would be Rescue, Exploration, Commercial, Structural, Testing, and Science. In the Admin there will be sliders that a player can use to set the odds to get specific contract types.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL1 Building: Stock, no change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL2 Building: Player can set sliders with a maximum of a 30% chance (or whatever serves as a good balance) to get a certain contract type, and a minimum of 10%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL3 Building: Player can set sliders with up to a 40% chance (see above) to get a certain contract type, and a minimum of 5%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would allow a player to mold their space program into what they like, and at the same time, unlike the current idea of giving contracts based on past accepted ones, would allow the player to change their career based on how they want to play at that time. For example, you have killed most of your crew, up the rescue contracts. Ready to go interplanetary? Up the exploration ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T23:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about renaming the buildings as well? \u0022Mission Control\u0022 isn\u0027t.
