The rocket is suppose to escape atmosphere and rotate with the planet in order to stay in space without using any more power to escape its gravity.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo the ascent-path should escape drag from the atmosphere as quick as possible and when reaching vacuum long enough to be able to circle the planet before re-entry into atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlightpath should also be adjustable to hit a planet, because it\u0026#39;s impossible to get the best path to Gilly without. For example when travelling from Kerbin to Gilly directly, it\u0026#39;s best to hit Gilly in \u0022the back\u0022 of its rotation. Maneuver-tools are impossible when trying such path in the sub-system of another. And there isn\u0026#39;t a mod that can do it. Only some extremely expensive routes that first doesn\u0026#39;t even reach Eve, then have to be re-adjusted that later, then enter it\u0026#39;s system in only a certain distance to its center but completely random direction, that then has to be adjusted, which as known is very expensive in those \u0022purple\u0022 directions and so on and so on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe spaceviewer-building could have an upgrade to automatically forward time close to a \u0022window\u0022 to a selected planet.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe command modules only have steering controls, why not also the obvious speed controls, since it is possible to make a plan a flight-path, and it even shows the calculated time of approach to that path, why can\u0026#39;t it have an automatic turn on engine then and turn it off after the new maneuver is done?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe maneuver tool also miss two buttons - make a circle and reset!\n"}]}
