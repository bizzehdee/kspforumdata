One of these reasons is that SAS has no way of telling where you want it to point - only what the input levels are telling it. Since input in KSP is a virtual stick, SAS has to wait until the input level returns to zero, which might take a sizeable fraction of a second, especially in fine controls mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that SAS does have bugs, as any computer program is prone to, and the resulting behavior does indeed require fixing. The key, in my mind, is remembering that it is, after all, just a computer program. It has its own way of working, and it can only respond to what you\u0027re doing.
