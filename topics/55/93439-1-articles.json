I logged onto the forum (something I virtually never do) just to find out about this issue. This is brand new as of 0-90. It isn\u0027t just obnoxious. It is EXTREMELY disruptive to the entire experience of building in the SPH. I can\u0027t work in the SPH anymore yet is that is my home (I focus on spaceplanes, not rockets). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanging the camera height does not make this bug go away. -- YES, I am considering this a BUG in the sense that it creates abnormal gameplay conditions. -- Even if I put my craft on the SPH floor and tilt the camera overhead it will still zoom. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad, PLEASE FIX THIS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow on Earth/Kerbin did this feature become approved and added? It makes no sense!! I set my zoom distance while working in a certain area of my craft, then I rotate my camera in all directions to make sure what I am doing looks good from all angles, make sure my fit is right, or maybe get a better viewing angle on what I am trying to do. I can\u0027t do this anymore! Not while this zoom BUG is in place! Every time I tilt camera down my viewing distance changes, often putting my camera THROUGH my craft! How on earth was this camera behavior considered a good idea?!?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil Squad fixes this I\u0027m going back to 0-25. The only way to play KSP is to build craft.

It seems that you only moved your craft down, rather than the camera. I mapped them to different keys, but just use page up and down to navigate the height of the vab. A certain low height should do it. Apart from that, it is new. I\u0027ve seen nothing like this and i hate it too.
