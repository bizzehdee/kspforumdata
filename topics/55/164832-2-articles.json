Even DMP has more moments where it doesn\u0027t work versus moments where it does. And considering Squad just restructured the entire game\u0027s code to better fit the language localization...I don\u0027t think they\u0027re wanting to rebuild the game...again...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBest hope for multiplayer is honestly either paid dlc with dedicated multiplayer development and support or, dare I say it, \u0022Kerbal Space Program 2: The Kerbaling\u0022 directed by M.

Each player has their own \u0022universe\u0022 and if you want to enter someone else\u0027s, you merely \u0022sync\u0022 up to them. Then as long as neither of you time warp, you remain together. Friends and I have built entire space colonies together like this. The problem is the game not knowing where you are physically in relation to everything else, and thus you get the jumpy physics that can do some...real bad things....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMP runs at maybe 2 fps on the best computer I have \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223162924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164832\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221504317138\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179591\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Confused Scientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/1/2017 at 6:52 PM, Confused Scientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think multiplayer\u00A0would be great for in-atmo flight around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

My 2c is thus:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMultiplayer does NOT equal MMO. Most of the objections I\u0027ve read are MMO issues, and KSP frankly doesn\u0027t fit the bill for MMO in any form, and never will. The most we can possibly expect from multiplayer capability is being to share a LAN game with mates, either using one player\u0027s machine as the host or a server hosted on a separate machine on the LAN. So the issues of Trolls, for example, don\u0027t apply here - if your mate sitting next to you goes and crashes through your station, slap him upside the head and don\u0027t invite him next time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMods are easy: The server instance, whether it be a player\u0027s instance or dedicated host, dictates the mod setup. Any player connecting must match the installed mods and KSP version exactly, otherwise it refuses to connect because of incompatible mod versions or KSP version. Same as minecraft. End of discussion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere can only be one universe, which is that of the server. The server owns the universe and everything in it. If you disconnect, you are no longer in the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTimewarp is easy - I can\u0027t believe there\u0027s so much hype about this. The server dictates warp, and all players are subjected to the same warp speed. A voting system determines which players are wanting to warp. If all players want to warp, then the warp factor is set to the lowest warp requested. Bear in mind that 99% of the time, players are going to be either in the same room, or connected via a voice link so they can talk to each other.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSame applies to reverts: If one player messes up really badly and wants to revert, the remaining players get to vote on whether or not to permit the revert back to a certain point in time. If they all agree, then the server rolls back to the desired point for the universe (i.e. all players).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t looked at DarkMod yet, but intend to have a good look at it once it is patched for 1.3.1. I\u0027m just engaging this discussion because I see that the current custodian of DarkMod also has a day job and cannot maintain it anymore. In all honesty, I\u0027d only ever want to join a game with my son or with friends, so we can interact a bit with each other on missions, or help each other build a station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
