What if I want a \u0022stubby\u0022 jet that uses an intake, a quarter-size fuel tank, and the engine nozzle? The turbine will be hanging out in front of the intake looking derp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My proposed solution is a \u003Cstrong\u003Etoggleable engine turbine\u003C/strong\u003E via the tweakables menu (click a button to make it disappear or reappear, a la flag decals). I\u0027m even fine with it being visible by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to address recent concerns:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Yes! It IS only a visual effect and will have absolutely no effect on how the engines actually run. That is NOT my and the other dissenters\u0027 concern. We\u0027re concerned that our planes will look very ugly; even if we build a VTOL and then cover up the turbines sticking up, that just means the poor VTOL will have huge, thick wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The Harrier does indeed have turbines. It also has heavily customized jet engines with offset, rotating nozzles. Personally I\u0027d rather just use regular jet engines than add in yet more special-purpose parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- While the difference will be small, and more than made up for by the expected Unity 5 improvements, extra visual models WILL affect the performance of the game, even if hidden by other parts and even if they don\u0027t have colliders. Most of us are silently suffering under punishingly low framerates (KSP at 60 FPS is practically unheard of), so I\u0027m against anything that slows it down without adding an important new gameplay element or significant visual upgrade (as in clouds, not invisible engine turbines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.: I have one other solution if SQUAD doesn\u0027t like having the turbine toggleable: take the turbine model, exactly as it is, and \u003Cstrong\u003Estick it on the backs of the intakes instead\u003C/strong\u003E. IMO it sort of makes more sense there anyway, and it preserves the flexibility to build VTOLs better while maintaining the added realism. Generally people don\u0027t put a lot of sideways-facing stack-mounted intakes on anything anyway since they don\u0027t work at those angles; VTOL builders have down-facing engines, but generally stick to forward-facing intakes, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T20:04:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EP.S.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T20:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI vote for VTOL engines.

So, yeah. separate Turbine part would be a boon to the game. Making multiple turbines would be even better, replacing the current jet engine parts, and repurposing the current nozzle parts as being secondary to the turbine.
