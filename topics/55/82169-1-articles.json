Consists of heavy disk and electric motor, which changes rotation speed to produce rotational force. It have speed limits and uses a lot of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels are indeed weak and awkward to use, because they saturate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is gyrodyne: Device designed to change one or more angular coordinate. Constant speed gyroscope, attached to 1-3 coordinate powered gimbal. Powerful, efficient, but complex.
