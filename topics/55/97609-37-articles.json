I\u0027ll firstly say that I do not like much (if any) of this community, and I disagree strongly with Squad\u0027s [lack of] direction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the TL;DR of the rest of this post is this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP is not ready for Beta, let alone full release. Squad, if you go through with this, objective reviewers who don\u0027t already fondle themselves to KSP will tear you a new one and you will go back to being an unknown, run-down marketing unit.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E KSP is already known for being a [comparably] polished product among Early Access games and there is no external reason\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Efor such a sudden and rushed release; whatever is pushing you to shove KSP out the door is not the community or the [potential] playerbase, it\u0027s either internal BS (which has plagued your team since 0.15 and cost you both key developers and your best creative talent)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E or some tainted and otherwise misguided perception of the community\u0027s desires.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played KSP since version 0.11 and joined the forums when I bought it at version 0.14. I\u0027m one of the earliest players in the community. I\u0027ve played every version on the day of its release. I don\u0027t believe that gives me any authority here, but I figure it qualifies me as someone other than a 12-year old who just picked the game up yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou just went into Beta. Beta is typically when the game goes on feature lock and subsequent releases are focused on tuning and optimizing. 0.90 didn\u0027t optimize anything. I run the game on an i7 with 24 GB of RAM and a GTX 780, and I still get 10-40 FPS depending on the segment of the launch I\u0027m in and what craft I\u0027m using. That is far from acceptable. You cannot add entirely new systems for the 1.0 release and expect to have a positively reviewed product. Every release since version 0.15, when experimentals went behind closed doors, has released with major bugs, some of them game-breaking and requiring day 1 fixes. I don\u0027t give a damn how much time you spend in QA and experimentals, your testing team simply isn\u0027t large enough and diverse enough to beat the size and diversity of the community. If you release 1.0, it will be played immediately and reviewed on those immediate playthroughs. Those reviews will be bad and they will sink your project and any future projects of your team. Granted, said team seems to be mostly hired-modders-of-the-month and changes often, but whatever future team operates under \u0022from the makers of Kerbal Space Program\u0022 will already be viewed negatively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 just came out. You have an opportunity to finish these major new additions (aerodynamics and resources are fundamental systems, not just content), release another beta (0.91), fix the bugs that break everything on the first day (there will be some, I will bet on it), and spend an entire update upgrading KSP to Unity 5. I know it isn\u0027t a magic fix-all, but it\u0027s damn close. There will be plenty of improvements in graphics, performance, et cetera, and once THAT is polished up, then you can think about releasing a finished product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do I expect from a final product? Glad you asked. I want an optimized product free of bugs and that will perform as expected on my hardware. If I have a $2000 computer that can run most current AAA games at high settings, I expect equally high performance for this product. I would like something that isn\u0027t outdated at release, particularly referring to Unity 4. I would like a product worth the $60 you\u0027re probably going to try squeezing from it. I would like a 64 bit executable so I can use all the mods I need to make your game feel complete. Speaking of which, what\u0027s the KSP endgame? What\u0027s the objective of career mode? To unlock the whole tech tree? Then what? Explore? Why? Is there anything to discover, now that Nova is gone and with him the mystery of the anomalies and their backstory? Is there anything to do besides fly there, drive around there, plant a flag there, and leave? Is there another \u0022there\u0022 when all the \u0022there\u0022s in the solar system have been visited? Saying \u0022it\u0027s up to the player\u0022 is a cop out, but I\u0027ll give it to you. Still, you don\u0027t give the player much of anything for colonization or even an interesting story or mystery to uncover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in closing, Squad, don\u0027t be stupid. Wisen up. Focus on the product and not the money. You listened when the community told you to be more transparent. Listen now when they\u0027re telling you to polish your product before you throw it away. And if you choose to barge straight ahead, well, that\u0027s your own problem. I will make a bet with you, though. I want a dime for every review that says \u0022Don\u0027t let the exit from Early Access fool you, Kerbal Space Program is still very much unfinished and in need of work,\u0022 or some variant thereof. I should make back the ten bucks I gave you awful damn quick. You still have my card on file, since I bought the game before you ever even talked about a Steam release, so you can just credit the funds there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T01:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phawks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phawks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is my second post in almost two years.

I also believe the release price will strongly influence any reviews, so dire predictions of poor reviews are premature at best. On a similar note, comments such as \u0022 Focus on the product and not the money\u0022 are unfair and borderline insulting. Firstly they imply that Squad aren\u0027t already doing this, and secondly, whether the players like or it not, Squad have to focus on both. No point having 90% of a perfectly polished and bug free game that never gets released because the developers run out of cash.

If you can\u0027t even get in all the features Squad already confirmed for release, why this incredible desire to push for 1.0?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we\u0027ve said before, we have met the criteria we originally designed as 1.0, there no incredible desire as much as us being responsible. We\u0027re evaluating our current plan to make sure everything can get done in time, and is brought to the proper quality that it should be at in order for it to be 1.0. If that means holding back some of the minor additions to the 1.0 plan, then we are okay with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T23:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut if responsibility is your main focus, why not have an \u0022actual\u0022 beta testing phase (e.g. at least one iteration before 1.0) so the community can help you get rid of all the bugs and assist in game balancing so 1.0 will be as good as can be at release.
