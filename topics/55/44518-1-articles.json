Probes could be used for landing especially for atmospheric planets and Gene returns some feedback. Maybe just some simple charts so he doesn\u0027t flat out tell you. Also maybe you might have to land a few probes to get enough information for a full table about loss due to drag and things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be awesome for tips to be earned through a science program.

It would certainly bring together the information that\u0027s there now (but, for example, how do I know how high Duna\u0027s atmosphere is before I\u0027ve been there?). I basically want to look up and just see black, and find out that there are stars out there, and planets, and what those planets are, and how far away they are, etc. I don\u0027t want, necessarily, any implied information except that which is either required or necessary for fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
