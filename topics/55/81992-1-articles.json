Maybe call it \u0022scenario mode\u0022, since each mission is a scenario (i\u0027m thinking along the lines of the scenarios presented in the Civilization franchise).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it might be a good idea that for each scenario, there is a limited budget (not funds) and available parts (tech tree) as well as other requirements to restrict how the player can accomplish the objectives. However, players do not lose money if they fail, and the ships cost nothing to launch, they just have to accomplish the scenario within budget and using the available parts. The budget/available tech tree/parts could be tweaked to a desired difficulty setting (which i think the game should also have).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JtPB","CreatedById":103925,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T12:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eactually the point in this game is that you are the general manager, the CEO of the whole space agency. you\u0027re the one who decide what will be the next mission to execute. not just the engineer \u0026amp; the pilot. although that sounds neat to me, this mode isnt very kerbal behavior, is it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T14:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JtPB\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JtPB\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eactually the point in this game is that you are the general manager, the CEO of the whole space agency. you\u0027re the one who decide what will be the next mission to execute. not just the engineer \u0026amp; the pilot. although that sounds neat to me, this mode isnt very kerbal behavior, is it?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could use the same argument to do away with sandbox mode (since real space programs have to worry about funding and R\u0026amp;D).
