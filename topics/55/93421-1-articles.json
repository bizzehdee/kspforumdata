As it stands, you don\u0027t really know whether the orbit they want is prograde or retrograde until you go to the tracking station to check (which is a bit of a pain in the butt as well, but would be trickier to fix). It could save a lot of trouble and horribly inefficient U-turns in orbit if we knew before we launched which way the contract expected us to be launching the probe in. It would also help steer us away from accepting a contract and preparing for it to be part of a larger mission, only to discover upon actually launching that the probe needs to be going retrograde while the rest of the mission needs to be going prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T02:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually they do.

The problem is that you can\u0027t find out what direction the orbit is in until you check the tracking station.
