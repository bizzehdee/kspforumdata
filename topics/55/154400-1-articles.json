I think it would be a good idea, as it is easy to be able to set betas, in fact, KSP already has this for version 1.1.3 and 1.0.5.(For me atleast). I was thinking if all the versions could be accessible, for reasons such as to play mod(Or modpacks) that no longer have support, or for people to experience the old KSP. Also, it would be cool to see the magic boulder again!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
