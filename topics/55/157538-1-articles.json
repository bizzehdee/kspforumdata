A lot of early communication satellite concepts, for example, assumed that they\u0027d basically be big flying telephone switchboards - crewed by switchboard operators. Of course that didn\u0027t happen in the end because by the time spaceflight became feasible, we had reliable - and lighter -\u00A0solid state circuitry, making the \u0027switchboard operator in space\u0027\u00A0concept redundant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals may well have very different motivations for going to space,and\u00A0available technologies at the point where it becomes feasible for them.
