Once you have achieved a high enough reputation, you are presented with a major contract, the first probably being to construct a space station around Kerbin.

The reason is that I think science is way too tedious and boring already -- click a bunch of times, land in a new biome, click a bunch more times. Instead, contracts should provide you science, but require you to land in specific biomes. That way, biomes add to the gameplay challenge, but it doesn\u0027t encourage you to just biome hop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am actually thinking this more and more. As long as \u0022science\u0022 is lumped together to give nothing but points, the only way to make it seem like you are doing something is to tell the player the story. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Massively drop all the no-contract science rewards. Keep them, but make them much smaller in magnitude. That munar soil sample? Not 120 points, maybe 12 instead. Scientists can still up them, and if the base reward was lower, then the science skill could simply be a multiplier. Skill 5 scientist gets 60 instead of 12, 4 gets 48, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Science contracts would be done as progressives that make \u003Cem\u003Esense\u003C/em\u003E. These would have the large rewards in terms of science. Many would also unlock parts like test contracts. If the contract is to do a visual ID, which sets a spot for EVA and sample return, which then opens a couple landing spots to take seismic data in a new mission (samples have to be returned to set off last phase), it gives you the seismometer to do so. You get the idea, many of these get created.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myslius","CreatedById":134570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T00:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eto #1: So you would rather do contracts than do it all by yourself?

Its also going to be hard to keep both new and veteran players happy. I tend to think a good way to think about balance is that running 3 of any one type of flight should earn enough money and science to get you to the next type of flight. After 3 suborbital flights you have the parts for an orbital flight, after 3 orbital flights you have what you need for a Mun or Minmus mission. After 3 missions to each of those and 3 flights in the atmosphere and maybe building an orbital space station you should have what you need to get to Dres or Duna. Honestly, given how few players even get to this point I think an experienced player should be close to maxing out the current tech tree on normal after their first interplanetary mission. Whether science rewards are a product of conducting science or as contract rewards (I think they should be both) they should just generally pace with monetary rewards and building upgrades to make this possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think freedom of design and exploration is the real hidden beauty of this game. Locking things into a set progression would be a huge mistake in my opinion, as would dictating play styles. I think its okay if science contracts give a bonus on top of the the gathered science so long as the totals worked out, but I agree that the contract should direct you to an unexplored biome rather than an arbitrary location. This would make it easier to make efficient missions dovetailing multiple contracts and gathering new science together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId further suggest people try to think a bit differently about the tech tree in general. The point and fun of the game is to build things and fly them. Unlocking the tech tree is a means to this end, not the point of the game. It serves as a reward system for exploration, yes, but mainly it\u0027s to simplify things for new entrants and make the game manageable at the early levels. This means unlocking everything needn\u0027t be unnecessarily difficult, as its just the first step in setting up a real interplanetary network and building bigger and crazier new things.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-14T03:18:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2015 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T05:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Myslius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Myslius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eto #1: So you would rather do contracts than do it all by yourself?

There are 2 contracts to place various satellites (I\u0027d have their payloads added to the VAB as a subassembly (no cost to you, it\u0027s \u0022blue\u0022 like testing contracts)), your job is to put it someplace, then it ceases to be yours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour planning guys have been brainstorming and have the following ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Munar science. This mission plan includes a budget (funds up front as many contracts have) as well as a few parts and wants science from around the mun, including a few specific areas they want observed from fairly low altitude. Assuming this is successful, they\u0027d like to attempt a landing at one of the sites observed, and EVA/surface collection done.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Orbital Science. Again, a budget, and a few parts offered. The lads sat up over too much coffee and decided that if they could put a few guys in a can, and leave them in orbit for a while, they could determine how long it took for them to go completely nuts. The mission requires (and supplies like a part testing contract) the hitchhiker and a clamp-o-tron, with the idea of putting a small station aloft, and the experiment is over and science gained after XX days on orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. (these are based on progress, so they might vary based on total science you\u0027ve gained) Minmus science. Lower budget, just wants some preliminary orbital data for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 same deal, but less of a budget until you have more science, or a launch window is coming, then you get the full-Monty Duna mission ideas (from exploration to trial habitation, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always do whatever you like as well, you\u0027ll just get a less science than now---with a science astronaut, you\u0027d get 1/2 of what it is now, but seriously, who is not swimming in science by day 60 anyway?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
