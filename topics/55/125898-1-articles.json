It would be nice if there were some variety in the way they can gain experience, instead of the standard cycle of \u0022[I]orbit kerbin, eva, orbit mun, eva, plant flag, etc[/I]\u0022\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T12:36:26Z","Content":"\nYeah the experience system in general feels pretty hard to predict. To be honest mirroring experience exactly with world firsts and making it graphically obvious when kerbals are gaining it would go a long way.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T22:00:10Z","Content":"\nTo right to me it opens up a number of different strategies. \u003Cbr\u003E\nLike...\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you concentrate the firsts on one Kerbal to push them up to a high level or spread them around to get more kerbals up to a useful level?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you put a scientist on the first flight to kick start experience while the flights don\u0026#39;t need a lot of control?\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo you game the system and try and save firsts for other flights?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt really adds to game play and the role play value of the game.\n"}]}
