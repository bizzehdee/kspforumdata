It\u0027s a pretty awesome game, and it helps me forget about my frustration of aerospace not being funded enough. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment we have access to 2 solid boosters, which kind of limits the possibilities since you have to multiply the boosters to achieve your goal. I would love the idea of doing our own booster. To make it not to hard to design, this could include parameters such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELength of booster\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDiameter\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGrain geometry (star-shaped, cigarette burning type, or a simple circle for example... =\u0026gt; gives you basic thrust profiles)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and keep up the good work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goertzenator","CreatedById":63203,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T12:13:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think many part types could become parameterized like this; stacking liquid fuel tanks being a prime example. This could compress the part list significantly and make things easier to find.

That would make KSP much more realistic. There are 12 liquid engines and only 3 solid. It\u0027s annoying. There are a lot of solid-core rockets like Vega, Ariane6, Taurus, PSLV.
