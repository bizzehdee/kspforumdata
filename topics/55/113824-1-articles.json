After sitting on this over night, I\u0027m thinking it would be nice if the effect was taken as a percentage of the ablator at launch. \n\nTo explain better, at launch ablator would be at 100%, no matter where on the slider you put it. As it nears depletion (0%) it gradually changes to becoming completely black, rather than changing color based on where on the slider it is. I think that would be more realistic.\n\nUsing Heatshields as insulators? That sounds genius! XD I shall experiment..."}]}
