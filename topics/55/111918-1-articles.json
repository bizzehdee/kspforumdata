As it stands the options for adequately shielding large spacecraft are inadequate. There aren\u0027t any options for large landers or aerobraking interplanetary ships. It\u0027s obvious that most craft that need to enter atmospheres with the hope of returning (I\u0027m thinking of Eve here) are going to be large.\n\nAdding multiple heat shields radially just looks tacky, and besides, wouldn\u0027t it be nice to have reusable craft where a single heat shield can simply be un-docked and replaced when it runs out?\n\nI\u0027ve experimented by making protective cones out of triangular wings, but these are never aerodynamically stable and add issues with part count. \n\nI also refuse to resort to mods or making my own heat shields with config rescale factor."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T04:11:05Z","Content":"I concur, or maybe even just a single procedural heat shield.
