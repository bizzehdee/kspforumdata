If you read the accomplished mission objectives in chronological order reduced to a sentence or 2 each, written conversationally/descriptively, it would be nice if it made sense as a story.

The eject out of system ones are tedious and having done one I\u0027m not likely to do another (just because the only challenge is how good your patience is at sitting through a long burn). But the capture ones are pretty good and (sort-of) seem like they have a purpose, or at least you can then invent your own purpose for it. But there also needs to be more urgent ones to redirect potential threat asteroids.

Not necessarily to capture or redirect it, but to just grab hold of the target \u0027roid with a ship that has specific science parts. (and then actually be able to do materials/goo/other science readings from it). or maybe to take a specific survey team (ie two scientists and an engineer) to inspect asteroid X.

Mostly I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, didn\u0027t even know about the save-system. Than I becme an MJ junkie. In a few days I was sending motherships with multiple landers to Jool.

I sunk many hours into the game again. Still with the help of MJ, but it was limited too and I had to work hard to access my usual functions. It basically resurrected the game for me. And now there is career with missions and funding. Another limiting factor that gets me to do stuff that I normally wouldn\u0027t. I have never seen a point in learning to build and fly efficiently before. Five mainsails, ten jumbo tanks - universal solution for either a Moho-trip or just a Minimus landing, right? Same as manual orbit-changes: I never understood it, and never wanted to until the sat missions made me realize that it\u0027s easy and fun. Now I\u0027m doing the rescues too.

But who cares? It\u0027s Kerbals we are talking about. I believe all of us made things more stupid than our contractors require. And if not, we should be gald for them for further increasing the ridiculous-factor. I don\u0027t care if it makes no sense to test a Mainsail on a 10 km munar orbit. It\u0027s great fun to do so.

Yet, as gaming thought us min-maxing, this system inspires me to do stuff I normally wouldn\u0027t. It makes me find that certain operations aren\u0027t as boring as I thought.

They come back up in points via scientist skill, and via the survey missions, which direct the scientists to collect from specific areas of interest.

A more immersive mission would be to resupply a certain existing facility with X amount of fuel every XX days for a while. Set it up so that IRSU is the ideal (though not only) solution.
