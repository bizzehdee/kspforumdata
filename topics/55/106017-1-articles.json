I walked in the metaphorical door expecting a huge set of huge wings similar to those available in 0.90, and found a meager three or four. They don\u0027t snap together, they don\u0027t blend together, they cannot be put end-to-end...\n\nSo how should they be fixed? What new pieces need to be added to the MK3 series of spaceplane wings?\n\nI suggest some structural segments, similar to the rectangular small wings. The MK3 \u0022Main Wing\u0022 can stay, but it only seems to serve the purpose of the rear of a wing or the only wing on the craft. And considering its size and ungainly shape, it simply is not fit for the latter of the two options.\n\nLanding gear are missing a few touches as well. Their lack of steering is unfortunate. I would be fine with the big four-wheel model not having steering, but IMO the medium one should have at least a few degrees of freedom. The medium and large landing gear are also missing rolling animations."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:35:02Z","Content":"I was expecting the SP\u002B set scaled up.
