This would better represent real world publishing of scientific data for acclaim and possibly (\u003Cem\u003Epossibly\u003C/em\u003E) some research grants. I believe that each science point could net you anywhere from 1000 to 10000 currency units (depending on the already-established part costs, I\u0027m not picky as to the final cost) so you could buy parts with a budget that will only put out as much as you can make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also believe that it would be cool to trade extra cash back into science points, as a way of \u0022increasing R\u0026amp;D\u0027s budget\u0022 so you can generate even more cash. Starting a new career mode game would obviously give you a fairly respectable in-game budget that would allow you to set up basic rockets with the parts available from your current tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only exception being, of course, sandbox mode, with no tech tree and no budget whatsoever.
