I\u0027m running a part that generates lots of heat, and want to know whether the radiators are keeping up with it-- e.g. do I need to back off the throttle on the nukes? How much do I need to back off the throttle?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I\u0027m flying really close to the sun, and need to be careful of my ship orientation so as not to get fried. If I turn the ship \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E way or \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E way, how does it do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, the only way to tell is to watch the overheat bars and/or thermal overlay for a long time, which makes it awkward to control and hard to judge. (\u0022Gee, is that yellowy orange getting a little yellower, or a little redder?\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, the solution would be one that\u0027s informative, but simple and unobtrusive. Here\u0027s my idea of how one might implement this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a simple positive/negative vertical bar graph. When you\u0027re net gaining heat, the bar rises up from the central line and is red; when you\u0027re net losing heat, the bar extends downwards from the central line and is green (or something like that). It would be located over on the edge of the screen where it doesn\u0027t get in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s displayed only when the thermal overlay is turned on, or when any \u0022overheat\u0022 bars are being displayed, or both. That way, players who really like it can force it to display (by turning on the thermal overlay), and players who consider it an annoying distraction can force it to stay off (by turning off overheat bars).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T19:02:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe a thing on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T21:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nikokespprfan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nikokespprfan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr maybe a thing on the navball.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be wary of tinkering with the navball-- that\u0027s where people live, I think the bar needs to be really high about adding any additional clutter to it.

It\u0027s a diagnostic tool, not a navigational one. Having something off to the side, that doesn\u0027t get in people\u0027s faces and is automatically turned off when they turn off thermo diagnostic tools, seems cleaner to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
