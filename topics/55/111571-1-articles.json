Right now, the doors take ups a HUGE amount of the surface area, and only allow attachments on the 2, small \u0022hinge\u0022 sides. This means you cannot use they as a lower section of a lander, or near the CM if you want RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would be to make the 4 doors smaller, and spread out so that there are attachment points available in the cardinal directions for RCS or landing legs. They need work anyway, as they break parts off, wobble, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T04:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall my yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet us remove the top/bottom too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T08:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree collision geometry could use some adjusting, especially inside the 2.5m version. But I have no problem with the design and art style. They have a low-key look that says \u0022stock part\u0022 to me. I don\u0027t have a problem with not being able to use them as bottom part on crafts, with x4 symmetry. But the idea of an alternate part with 4 smaller doors allowing stuff to be placed outside in x4 symmetry, does sound interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past week I spent some time fitting parts into a 2.5m service bay, going back and forth to the Launchpad, to test object positions, until the doors would open/close absolutely smoothly. Once I figured out how close to the edges I could get without a door problem, I had no more problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Objects placed too close to the inside side walls may interfere with the doors, at any time, doors open or closed. Potentially leading to craft break-up, as noted in other threads and reports. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWork-around: For best object placement results, draw a mental box, with each door hinge at its corner, and don\u0027t let objects go outside the lines.
