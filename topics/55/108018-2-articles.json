And similarly next to none of the complaints are even existent in most other forums, or in all those threads below the reviews.\n\nIf you\u0027d actually take a look at thsoe, then you\u0027d notice a staggering amount of positive responses.\n\nOne thing: For those players who are playing this game for years numbers don\u0027t mean ..... It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s 1.0 or 0.95, everything is just another update, nothing more. It matters for reviews and new players who want a servicable game, and most of these players seem to be completely convinced it is one.\n\nSo, the release version wasn\u0027t to your liking?

Like I care, Squad has been rude to me in the past, and at one point was handing out bans to anyone who criticized them and nearly incited a forum revolt. Even if they later changed their mind, I still haven\u0027t forgiven Squad for the whole multiplayer \u003E resources fiasco. You want to talk about rude?\n\nI\u0027ll give Squad credit for striking gold with a creative idea for a game, but creative ideas don\u0027t make up for lousy community management, horrible communication practices with their players, god-awful management, failing to deliver on promised features and consistently falling short on those they did, and at some points dragging their feet so slowly that some of us thought the game was dead.\n\nFrankly, if 1.0 is still missing features, I don\u0027t blame their progress between 0.90 and 1.0, I blame their progress around .19 to .22, where their updates were so godawful and completely void of any useful content whatsoever that I don\u0027t even know why they bothered putting out updates at all. They basically dicked around for a year and accomplished almost nothing. You could\u0027ve combined everything they accomplished in that timespan and still had an update with less content than in the .18 patch. So if 1.0 is lacking, let\u0027s go back to 2013 when they were hiring community part creators and then losing them only a couple months later after they put out only a couple new parts (and we STILL don\u0027t have all the KSPX parts... the mod is still around in the Addons section and being updated), and the single most interesting thing in one of the updates was changing the KerbalCams from static image slideshows to a 3D model. Oh and I think they retextured the runway for that one. Wow, it took them four months to put a texture on a giant rectangle.\n\nEven after all that wait, .22 gave us the basics of career mode and it wasn\u0027t for another six months that we got the other half. And even then, since early 2014 we\u0027ve been telling them that career mode isn\u0027t fun, it\u0027s grindy, dull, one-dimensional, and uninteresting, and they haven\u0027t done anything to rectify that whatsoever.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T10:25:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 10:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:34:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...still haven\u0027t forgiven...\n\nThere is the issue.

Let\u0027s not forget that the difference between \u0027alpha,\u0027 \u0027beta,\u0027 and \u0027official\u0027 is mostly ceremonial, especially in the case of KSP. It marked the addition of all the features SQUAD originally envisioned for the project. I don\u0027t recall any promises of perfect releases or KSP being done, just that they decided to go \u0027official\u0027 because all the features were in. There\u0027s still work to be done and Squad was pretty clear about that.\n\nThis does not mean that we shouldn\u0027t help Squad by critiquing and letting them know where things went wrong. We need constructive criticism and a lot of these threads have not been constructive at all. They whine that Squad screwed the pooch or just care about money, but I have a hard time seeing that when they put out two hot-fixes after busting $#@ to put out their first deadlined release and maintain an official community on their website. They don\u0027t have to do either of those things.\n\nRemember, it\u0027s just a game, you don\u0027t own the developers just because you paid them money to play with the fruits of their labor, they have feelings, and they don\u0027t approach problems the same way you do. Be nice and try to be helpful when things go sideways rather than upset and vengeful because its not the way you want it."},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:32:01Z","Content":"Anybody played EvE Online?
