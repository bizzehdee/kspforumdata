The most exciting part about it for me is getting to a other worlds, seeing the beautiful planets and moons from man (or call it kerbal) point of view. And more importantly knowing that you\u0027ve achieved all of it with your own spacecraft, and a mission that you had to execute yourself. There\u0027s something incredible for me about being able to walk on other planets, not just look at it as some kind of ball floating in black space. Then I saw a mod which adds loads of other planets, and I really wanted to download it just because I really wanted to land on a planet with rings and see it from the ground as a tiny kerbal. Not because of a challenge or because I was bored of existing planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I saw space engine... It already has way better rendering, real scale (matches real world unlike ksp), endless space with endless scientifically accurate objects, with so much better procedural generation, atmosphere rendering, clouds, and so on. You can view everything from any angle, even from man\u0027s point of view on the planet, the views are breathtaking and can feel amazing. And they\u0027re planning to add another core element that ksp has and SE does not yet. Being able to fly across the universe (and land on objects) in spaceships in a realistic way, just like ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know ksp will have career with research, economy and even prestige. It\u0027ll have way more variation in spacecraft. And these things are very welcome and I can\u0027t wait for them. I\u0027ve already said why I love ksp, but it seems that SE has got almost everything I want from ksp, only the final bits are left to add to turn it into a game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d simply wish SE and KSP would somehow merge together to make a perfect game for me. But it\u0027ll be either be SE adding proper ksp-like gameplay. In which I am going to miss all the fun of building your own missions and spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr it will be ksp, since as I understood plans are to add procedural universe, but I am very afraid ksp will never reach such graphical beauty and perfection in general. And most importantly the scale will be kept down to make gameplay easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what are your thoughts on SE (space engine)? Do you think squad will make ksp very similar to it in terms of procedural generation and scale, rendering? (that\u0027s what I am sort of suggesting and asking you as well) Or will ksp be not so scientifically accurate objects, with only few (maybe proceduraly generated) solar systems and small scale?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOne of the long-term goals for the space engine: (copied from their website)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$35 000 - Single player space exploration game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Gameplay based on space flight simulation, space exploration, research and building\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Realistic spaceflight physics with both hardcore fully manual controls and handy semi-automatic controls\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Various spacecraft models\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Build ships, space stations, and bases on planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Collecting data about celestial objects using probes and satellites\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-28T18:05:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2014 06:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by iaureee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T20:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf KSP went on to the scale of space engine I would pay Squad \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00A31000 right here and now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T20:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs much as everyone who plays both games (including myself) want KSP to have the same level of texture quality, lighting quality, and sheer scale that Space Engine does, that would be impossible on at least two counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Every failure or success is determined by a complicated set of interactions that can seem random to us, but ultimately are things that follow ceetain laws that can be accounted for and corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, it is worth noting that the terrain in KSP is already procedurally generated.

In KSP the challenge is building, launching and landing succesfully the rockets and spacecrafts that you create. It\u0027s a sandbox with a nice degree of simulation, not a rogue-like where everything must be randomized or else it \u0022leads to boredom\u0022. Having a consistent solar system gives you the opportunity to master all the different techniques that you\u0027ll need if you don\u0027t want to fail miserably at the game. Plus, this is good for multiplayer, because all the players will play in the same playground, thus incresing the competition in a possible competitive multiplayer, and making things easier in a possible co-op.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
