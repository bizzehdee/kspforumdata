Rails: Seems quite easy to make atmospheric launch a lot safer with rails sort of like train tracks. All the fuel dumps on the way up that often end up in crashes, because they are just released while they should head behind the rocket as it goes forward. Rails are better than putting small rockets on the waste to fly it out, because while the rocket runs up the rails or opposite the waste run down, that can be done electrically, which means lesser weight. But perhaps safer launch is not intended, when the game is more exciting with explosions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Normal camera controls and fixed flight path editor and rocket sound: When entering map mode the rocket sound always becomes loud, but the rocket is far far away; \u0022normal\u0022 camera controls - what\u0026#39;s mostly used - is direct scrolling by moving mouse to screen edges and zooming in/out with wheel; the kerbal controls allows to turn the kerbal left/right, but not up/down which makes movement in space more difficult. But perhaps it\u0026#39;s meant to be difficult, since it\u0026#39;s in space far out. When the screen displays flight paths that cross over eachother there is no submenu to select individual paths, they are simply not selectable. And sometimes perhaps it is mostly when returning from a moonpath, the flightpath displayed is very difficult to mouseover for selection.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. A very verbal flight planner: It\u0026#39;s pretty funny to see some space dynamics how moons effects speed and path. So without any numbers just a verbal flight planner, fx. a list with encounters from Kerbin to Duna saying \u0022Kerbin, Mun, Duna\u0022 and Mun should have checkbox whether to use it as slingshot or not and whether to pass it above or below. If a Mun pass is included there should be possible checkboxes to excelerate before Mun pass or after BUT still before leaving Kerbin\u0026#39;s gravity field. The point is not just to display out the least costly or quickest route, but to display all kinds of different impossible routes verbally without numbers to get the space dynamics experience. Launch from kerbin should therefore have checkboxes for selecting a route with the globes rotation and also against it, and whether or not to wait for a \u0022window\u0022 with the alignment to Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Double sized fuel tanks should not be science developments, since it doesn\u0026#39;t take any kind of genius to make something of double size. Fuel should just be specified and then tanks should be adjustable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Seems like space dynamics could be explored further for fun in the game with \u0022gravity modulators\u0022. It doesn\u0026#39;t matter that they are not realistic, because the universe isn\u0026#39;t that either. The universe only holds two secrets, because it is a pyramid as shown in the Kerbal Space Program - for example if you want to go from Kerbin to Ike, you have to first leave Kerbin to enter the Sun\u0026#39;s gravity, then enter the Duna system where Ike is. So the Sun is top of this pyramid, while Kerbin and Duna are stones along sided and it is not possible to pass from one stone to another along-sided or below unless you first go above and then down the correct \u0022box\u0022 or system of \u0022stones\u0022. So the first secret of the universe is of course which globe is the topmost of them all holding it all together! And Kerbal Space Program doesn\u0026#39;t answer that question. But since it is a game you could make it a game mission for fun. The second secret to the pyramid universe is what is beyond the gravity field of the topmost \u0022stone\u0022 hold them all further out of the whole \u0022pyramid\u0022? But it\u0026#39;s not relevant in this suggestion thread, which is \u0022gravity modulators\u0022. Kerbals want to live above ground, because there\u0026#39;s better view and air. So they invent something that can modulate matter into weightlessness. But the problem is not just to have stuff floating. It must face correctly perhaps using Kerbin\u0026#39;s magnetic field and it must not float away it must be steady. That should be some fun dynamics to explore!\n"}]}
