However, I think the way contracts are handled seems off. For example, I had a mission on the way to the Mun for the first time. The science and fund rewards for making it to the Mun and back were less than for a simple parts test on a suborbital flight I ran while the Mun mission was in flight. There\u0027s something wrong with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d suggest breaking up contracts into three types, and having the rewards from them be primarily devoted to one of money/science/rep\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Exploration missions like planting flags, reaching orbit/landing on new bodies, etc, should give tons of reputation. Further missions to the same body should give declining amounts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Science missions (Send back science data from X, temperature reading, etc) give mostly science. Ditto on declining amounts- this will stop the \u0022Satellite with thermometer and antenna\u0022 auto-complete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Parts testing and satellite launching should give cash. The latter especially should be lucrative: it\u0027s how the commercial space industry makes money. Given the immense and growing costs later in the game, don\u0027t have the missions give less, but make them harder\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddenis","CreatedById":89784,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T19:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDiscussion related to this topic: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104167-Contracts-must-not-have-science-as-reward-or-contracts-have-to-be-separated-by-reward\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EContracts must not have science as reward or contracts have to be separated by reward\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T19:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso somewhat related: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104193-Abusable-Contract-Mechanics\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104193-Abusable-Contract-Mechanics\u003C/a\u003E, although this might be sufficiently different to both to warrant its own thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
