Most of the problems of using SoI can be handled by putting an asteroid/moon/planet in the center so you cannot enter the singularity-- all of this within KSP\u0027s existing engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with your idea (and the SoI idea) is that KSP, at present, cannot \u0022increase\u0022 the strength of gravity or otherwise \u0022manually\u0022 modify the orbit. The patched-conics solver uses the analytical solution to the 2-body gravity problem to determine what \u0022on the rails\u0022 is i.e. you need to specify two independent variables e.g. apoapsis and periapsis and the solver can determine your orbit. A \u0022lagrangian\u0022 orbit would not match the patched-conics orbit, and so, you\u0027d have to get squad to agree to make an alternate solver to use under certain conditions, and since its WNTS, good luck with that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T02:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EProbably a pretty dumb idea, but just a thought.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho said I thought the SOI Idea is \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E dumb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T03:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to go with what \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101954-Idea-for-Lagrange-Points-without-N-Body-Physics-via-SoI?p=1577544\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1577544\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esal_vager wrote 3 days ago\u003C/a\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sphere of Influence model is fundamentally incompatible with Lagrange points, but you should check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68502-WIP-Principia-N-Body-Gravitation-and-Better-Integrators-for-Kerbal-Space-Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrincipia, the WIP N-Body Gravitation mod\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are plenty of explanations already in the Suggestions forum, so I\u0027m going to have to close this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
