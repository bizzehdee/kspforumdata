I am not sure if this is just a matter of when the game checks for what device to use... I seem to always have to exit the game completely, re-change my default sound device, then re-load the game. I dont seem to have to do that with other games. Would that be possible/easy to fix?

Try doing that while on a youtube video, does that do it too? If it doesn\u0027t switch, usually you have to close and reopen the program.
