If there was some system to map out future biome changes on a timeline (or on the orbit) that would help a lot, and would be even better if there was a way to search for when a specific biome encounter will occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that this should be possible, though I\u0027m not sure how much work it would take to implement.\u00A0I doubt we would get this in stock anytime soon, but does anyone know if there is a mod like this? I tried searching for a mod that does this, but either I\u0027m using the wrong terms, or it just doesn\u0027t exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-03T06:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002257416\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed382225227\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72679-180-scansat-v1814-real-scanning-real-science-at-warp-speed-october-28-2019/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:212px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Admiral Naismith","CreatedById":201792,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-09T05:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh I didn\u0027t realize SCANsat would do that... is it actually possible to predict hundreds of orbits ahead with it?

The Trajectories mod, besides its main functionality,\u00A0can predict your position relative to the surface in map view an arbitrary number of orbits ahead, which you could combine with Scansat\u0027s overlay feature to see when you would over-fly specific biomes and adjust your orbital period accordingly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth noting is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/KerbNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbnet feature\u003C/a\u003E included in stock, which is sort of a Scansat-lite.
