I was tweaking the oxidizer and thought I could build a smaller lighter space plane if I could replace the removed oxidizer with fuel. Doing that I could use a smaller tank and still have all the fuel I need, it is a lot since I tend to over shoot the landing by a couple hundred Km. I am sure there could be other uses for this but space planes are the reason I thought of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
