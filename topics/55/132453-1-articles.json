It would allow you to \u0022contact aliens\u0022 in a more or less realistic way, based off of how we are already doing it here on Earth.\u00A0Unlike other buildings, it would not exist in a new save, and you\u0027d need to build it first. Building it and making it level 1 would require 1,500 science and 1,000,000 funds. The reason for the high cost is because it would end as something new for endgame players to do while conducting other missions. The high quantities of science and funds you could get from it would probably give a bit too much of an advantage on new saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ELevels:\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 1 (1,000,000 funds and 1.5k science): You can access the radio receiver and send out transmissions to potential aliens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 2 (800,000 funds): The chance of making contact with extraterrestrials is doubled, and the receiver will slowly send out transmissions automatically, 1 per every 10 seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLevel 3 (2,500,000 funds): You can decipher alien transmissions to figure out what they are saying. The receiver now sends out transmissions more quickly, 1 every second. Also increased chance of finding aliens and reduces time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETransmissions\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you enter the RR, you would be able to see previous successful transmission sent and current transmissions being sent. You would also have access to a button that every time you click, a transmission would be sent. For a level 1 facility, you\u0027d have a 1/15,000 chance of making contact per transmission. This would get lowered to a 1/10,000 chance for level 2, and a level 1/5,000 chance for level 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery transmission would take anywhere between 5 and 100 years to make potential alien contact. For level 1 and 2 receivers, the messages would appear unreadable and in a made up language that the aliens would speak. Level 3 receivers would be able to decipher a message, but doing so would require about 50,000 funds and 75 science, although the price would slightly fluctuate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA transmission would continue going for 100 years, and it would disappear. If it encounters a civilization, it would appear green, and you\u0027d have to wait an amount of time for whatever aliens there are there to send a transmission back to you, although they only would about a third of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAlien Contact:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you establish contact with aliens, they would sometimes send you a gift or just some quote.
