Saving would be *marginally* marginally. Time that could arguably be spent better elsewhere to gain bigger improvements.\n\nNot to mention the fact that right now practically anyone can make their own flag have fun with that.

Standard size agency flags get converted from png to dds fine, but the small flags don\u0027t get loaded by KSP (and they don\u0027t show previews in Windows Explorer either), forcing it to try creating a new scaled logo by shrinking the big file and choking when it runs GetPixels.\n\nConverting the scaled logo to dds in Photoshop works fine, so I would just suggest that mod authors convert all of their agency and flag icons to dds, using something other than the DDS converter from the forums.
