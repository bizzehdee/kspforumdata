Why do people on this forum consistently insist theirs is the only way to play the game?\u00A0This is about providing a tool. You don\u0027t have to use it. Other people don\u0027t have to use it.

I think the most satisfying\u00A0trial-and-error aspect of the game is tweaking your design to meet certain mission specifications and personal goals, not wondering whether you\u0027ll have enough fuel to even get there. I\u0027m all about pursuing\u00A0ultra-efficiency, because I find elegance in those kinds of solutions. Everybody plays the game differently, though. There are mission-design oriented players, there are flight-sim oriented players, and much more. You are not the exemplary KSP player, because there isn\u0027t one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions are time-consuming. I\u0027d be willing to bet that on even a Mun landing, a new player would get discouraged enough after playing for 20 minutes and discovering they can\u0027t get back off the Mun. I\u0027ve had my fair share of times I spent hours getting somewhere and messed up because I didn\u0027t have enough fuel. If I weren\u0027t an utter space-nut, I\u0027d have dropped this game in a heartbeat back in 2013 when I first started playing. The learning curve for non-science/engineering-oriented peoples is VERY steep. A delta-V readout would make it LESS steep.
