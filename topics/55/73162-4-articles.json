For the kinds of ISRU NASA is talking, finding a compatible biome would be sufficient, they\u0027re not talking about trying to find the equivalent of natural gas or oil deposits, which for the most part gets rid of, or at least greatly simplifies, scanning.

Water has been discovered on the moon as well, so it\u0027s possible that the moon may be in a similar situation, though with lower amounts of water per Kg of soil and it may be harder to extract.

That has to be the weakest argument against resources in my opinion, because it has no real weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one, it wouldn\u0027t even be necessary for people to utilize it. ISRU as a concept is meant to help reduce the costs of space travel as well as providing a way to extend the distances that we can actually reach. We can reach the Moon without having to utilize its resources, and we can also reach Mars without doing so. The point in suggesting it however is so that doing such things can be more easily backed financially. But where ISRU shines is when you want to go farther than that. We could build a rocket (or several) that could send a manned mission to say, Jupiter or even Neptune. But without ISRU you\u0027d end up spending a vast amount more than you would have to make the mission a success. And thats because ISRU would cut out a massive amount of the payloads you\u0027d need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s how it would be in KSP, and exactly how it works in mods that provide such things. It isn\u0027t necessary to integrate it into every single mission, but going for it will reduce a lot of what could be required. For instance, instead of packing in the fuel needed for both transfers between Jool and Kerbin, you can pack in fuel for just one transfer, and refuel in Jool\u0027s SOI. \u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo, even if they put in a system like the one in that picture, is still not even complicated. The only complicated part about it would be learning the different converters and what you need to find for them to work (and honestly, who upon opening KSP for the first time looked at all the parts and automatically understood what they were all for and how they functioned?). Actually using those parts wouldn\u0027t be (and definitely shouldn\u0027t be) any harder then hitting the space button.

And as far as the dev\u0027s go, with Kethane being present (and Interstellar to a lesser extent), I can agree that they\u0027d be better off focusing on other things. If anything, I\u0027d rather see Kethane get a complexity pass rather than see it become stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, it still really isn\u0027t complicated at all.

ARM parts (while admittedly slightly more efficient they should be) are meant to be used for payloads that are much larger than most people have gotten accustomed to building. Things like interplanetary vehicles that don\u0027t have to be constructed in orbit or larger space station components, for example. Just because for smaller payloads they\u0027re completely overpowered for the job doesn\u0027t mean you should use them for those payloads. Real rockets aren\u0027t built like that. You don\u0027t take just any old payload and shove the largest most powerful rocket under it when a smaller rocket can be constructed to specifically lift that payloads weight range into orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even so, a lot of these issues stem from the fact that KSP isn\u0027t limited like real rockets are. At least as far as career players are concerned, budgets are going to eliminate a lot of these issues.

By inclination, I\u0027m a science geek. I\u0027ve been just a teeny-weeny bit apprehensive of what adding contracts to the game might bring to it until I read in one of the earlier posts about money and science and reputation (? first I\u0027ve heard of reputation in the game, but I can imagine ways that could be incorporated) being likely to be inetrchangeable.

For this, all I can say is \u0027thank you SQUAD, a thousand times thank you!\u0027. That means that I can gradually add mods to increase the realism until one day I\u0027ll be ready to start a game in which I attempt Duna Direct , the Kerbal-fied version of Zubrin\u0027s Mars Direct plan (and which last I knew, NASA was kind of going for in a surprisingly only slightly less efficient form called Mars semi-Direct). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

Kethane is the ultimate simple of resource-gathering as you already know. KSPi\u0027s resource gathering does strike a nice balance of complexity though (which I know you probably know, Nemoricus, but not everyone has tried KSPi yet). It\u0027s not a horrendous map of chemical reactions requiring degrees in organic and inorganic chemistry, but there\u0027s more than one type of thing you can do. Alumina plus water electrolysis for hybrid engines. Basically you can drop yourself down anywhere on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, which is all alumina with a small water concentration, fire up the ISRU, and fuel up. Thorium/uranium mining for the beamed-power reactors. Nuclear reprocessing for making the nuclear fuel last longer.
