So you cannot exploit an exhausted science experiment. Also, make this type of contract experiment-specific. One company might wanna get data from the blob, another might wanna know how hot/cold it\u0027s up there, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also could be biome-specific, so after a while, you would get a mission to visit all available biomes with all kinds of different scientific equipment. Also take into account which experiments already have been finished outside of missions, so you only get valid missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
