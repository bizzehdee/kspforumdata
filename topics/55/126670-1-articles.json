Great concept for a contract!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe deadline to accept the contract was fine, but the deadline to complete it was 2 years. How bad of an emergency is it that it can wait two years? \u00A0There was also a contract to replace an imminently failing power module, but imminent for this contract was also a long ways away.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d expect, for those kind of contracts, the deadline to perform them would be a matter of days or maybe weeks.
