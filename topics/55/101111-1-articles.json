The way KAS manages them is very simple (for the player) and allows many different base/miner setups.\n\nI\u0027m not asking for KAS to become stock, I\u0027m just asking for a similar way to manage pipe connections while landed. KAS is much more than these pipes, but the ability to connect two ships while landed is going to be very useful, even if we can\u0027t place connectors in EVA and need to build the ships whith them pre-installed.\n\nCheers,"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T21:57:22Z","Content":"Additional methods of resource transfer would definitely be nice, although I would be very happy if KAS became stock altogether."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T22:17:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Additional methods of resource transfer would definitely be nice, although I would be very happy if KAS became stock altogether.\n\n^ exactly and precisely this."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T23:04:29Z","Content":"KAS is pretty amazing for base design, I have to say, and I only use the links and spare parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T01:22:18Z","Content":"**A hose!
