I\u0027m thinking of putting a probe body radially on all my planes and control it from there, but that would mess up the artificial horizon/navball. It would be nice to have a separate set of controls based on whether a vehicle has been designed in the space plane hangar, or the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
