But what if there was a constant in the control surfaces config that modified the max rotational speed a control surface can deflect at? As far as I can tell, there has been no one addressing this issue, and I\u0027ve been searching all afternoon. What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
