I get what your point is. But that doesn\u0027t change the point that it is a realistic mechanic, sure it does expand the PvE element of the game but it is still considered a hardcore feature. Look we can argue about this until the cows come home. You have some good points, you really do. But you have to also consider those players who struggle to fly/aerobreak/land ect. I\u0027m not just talking about new players by the way, and that deadly reentry would make the game even more difficult and unplayable. Basically what I\u0027m saying is that you have to consider those on a much lower par then you skill wise.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T23:26:43Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 11:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dodgey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T02:42:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003Enon up to date docs, inconplete docs, \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not clear to me what you mean by this.

If you don\u0027t like the way something is being handled, if you believe it should be done another way, post about it in the Development sub-forum. They *can\u0027t* make everyone happy and they won\u0027t do everything the way you personally might want things done, but they do listen and consider player opinions. There\u0027s no need to be so angry about it, and there\u0027s no need to (as other threads like this have done) start throwing around accusations of incompetence and dishonesty.
