In practice, a lot. A momentum wheel needs relatively large mass and high speed, with speed variance not being very important.

I coupled that with cost reductions to RCS (currently, a quad of quads and the 1.25m RCS tank costs about as much as a Skipper...), RCS-only becomes very attractive, especially on shorter missions.

I performed a prograde burn then told Jeb to prepare for a retrograde burn. How does he do this? Does he spin up the reaction wheels just enough to get the ship turning, then spin them the other direction to stop rotation close to a retrograde orientation? Absolutely not, this is Jeb and he does everything as much as possible for as long as possible. The station starts careening wildly towards retrograde. Quickly the retrograde marker is seen on the navball, but Jeb doesn\u0027t slow down the ship\u0027s rotation. He gives those wheels all the juice they\u0027ll take up to the instant that the ship is facing retrograde. Then Jeb slams the reaction wheels into reverse stripping the gears, cracking the axle, and shattering the wheel. Hundreds of pieces of shrapnel tear though the ship and crew leaving a cloud metallic confetti in orbit, if reaction wheels were any where near realistic. Instead the rotation slows and finally stops about 90\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E beyond retrograde. So Jeb keeps spinning those wheels until once again the ship is heading retrograde before he starts them countering the rotation.

If you suspend the bat on a string so the axis is always the same, the same torque applied will create the same rotation regardless of where along its length it is applied.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T12:59:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReal life reaction wheels don\u0027t work any better at CoM, the torque they impart is the same regardless of location. KSP RWs apply their force at their location, build a flexy ship with wheels at the ends and you can see the effect clearly.

The moment of inertial is minimum around an axis that passes through the CoM, so it\u0027s \u0022harder\u0022 to get the object to rotate around an off-CoM axis. also, if there isnt a fixed axis (the center of rotation isnt pinned to an infinitely heavy object) the object u wanna rotate off-centre will move away on a spiral trajectory as the centripetal forces are off-centre too, aka its far better to place the RW into CM. its an other question that KSP (and unity) doesnt calculate these forces fight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
