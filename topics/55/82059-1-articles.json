This way it should be easier to judge if your rocket is going to instantly flip out due to, say, a large amount of very small parts on top of a tall lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T17:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ve misunderstood the drag model in KSP.
