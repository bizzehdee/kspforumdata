It\u0027s not worth the energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 20k contract with 20% Outsourced R\u0026amp;D nets roughly 133 science. That\u0027s easily enough to clean out the low end of the tech tree. Resetting contracts until you get a few you can run in low orbit and land attached to your mini-pod gets you most of your cash back except the lifter, which usually runs from 3-15k depending on weight, at least early on. Slap in a \u0027science from Kerbin orbit\u0027 and \u0027Rescue Imagoner Kermin\u0027 throws in the rest of what you need to pop out to tier 4/5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe contracts get more valuable there, and you can clean up the tree pretty quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming I\u0027m running those 20k contracts on Tier 5 items (Landing gear seems to come up a lot), which are 90 science to open, ratios work out looking like the following at 20%:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E100:1 ( 4000:40) - This seems alright, until you look at a recent contract I had for 100k of testing some large engine pack in orbit at 100k (heavy as heck to lift a ground engine up) : 400 science. That seems reasonable for the end of the tree though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 50:1 (4000:80) - This would roughly match what the item\u0027s tier is. Once again, I\u0027d have no reason to bother deploying science items at all. Contracts would be the way to go, just be a little selective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 225:1 (4000: 18) - This would roughly rate the contract cost equivalent to the tier of science the part comes from. At 100% funds into the contract, I could open the tier the item was on, roughly. I\u0027d still want to bring along some of my own science to supplement the run, unless I could stick 3/4 experiments onto the ship already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all depends on how the balance is desired. If the goal is to force us to do our own science with gear, then we need to bring that ratio down, WAY down. Almost 500:1 levels. If the idea is that we can easily split between the two ideas of running our own science or doing contracts instead, the 225:1 ratio is reasonable. If it\u0027s to be able to avoid running your own science landers completely, 100:1 is a nice round number and gives decent progression. It all depends on Squad\u0027s vision for what they want us to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can tell you that I hope they lean away from forcing us to go orbit 7 planets with 4,000 experiments grinding away to be able to open the end of the tree though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does, on the flipside, allow a new player to sacrifice their science to keep a badly ran space agency afloat if the ratios remain anywhere near equivalent. That\u0027s something that should be considered as well. When a can of goo, a soil sample, and a MatBay over in the badlands can launch your next rocket, there\u0027s an unbalancing there too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whaleberg","CreatedById":22215,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T03:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that Outsourced R\u0026amp;D is *way* out of balance for just about any scenario. At it\u0027s current rate, just the advance for Orbit Kerbin gives 98 science, and completing it gives 419. That\u0027s way more than you can get from orbiting all the early science parts. A 500:1 ratio would bring this more in line with what I\u0027d expect it to do, a substantial increase in science at a substantial cost in funds.
