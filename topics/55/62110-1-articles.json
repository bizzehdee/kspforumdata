This is somewhere along the lines of how I believe the Asteroid Mission Pack will be in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI for one, am looking forward to the Asteroid Pack, and I believe it won\u0027t be a scenario. Rather, I think that in career mode, once you begin to explore and take contracts for NKO missions, a contract will pop up asking you to retrieve an asteroid for easier manned study in kerbin (Or munar) orbit. At this point, if you accept, the asteroid will appear on map view as an uncontrollable, interactive celestial body. (It will probably have other requirements, such as no aerobraking or damaging it with engine backthrust, because it renders the entire mission useless if the asteroid is damaged as then no accurate scientific knowledge will be able to be gained.) In this case, We would get a bit of everything we want: \u003Cp\u003E - Large steps towards asteroid belt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - NASA/SQUAD Collaborative Mission Pack\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - The tutorials are getting redone, which will make the game easier to get started on, which in turn allows for a little more diversity in the Career mode. (Dificulty setting by tech tree? Career tutorial with current tree, and a harder, more realistic career mode for the standard mode.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Asteroids will be hard to manoeuvre and control, so we will most likely see some KAS-like parts. (After all, You can\u0027t just slap a docking port on the side of an asteroid.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Probably some part balancing here and there *cough* Nerf the 48-7S *cough*, possibly removing some redundant parts, adding some cool new stuff in, [speculation] new antennae functions such as distance?
