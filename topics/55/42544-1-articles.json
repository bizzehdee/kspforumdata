Also, in future R\u0026amp;D, perhaps you could fly to KSC-2 and gain access to the old pre-0.18 parts. The parts would be updated with smoother textures (still resembling the old textures) and post-0.18 statistics, of course, but they could act as cheaper, lighter, less efficient alternatives in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same thing could go for the island airstrip near KSC-1.
