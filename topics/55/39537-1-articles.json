I was playing KSP as I often do, and had a thought about the appearance of the space center. The mission control building looks excellent, but right now that\u0027s all it does. Now that\u0027s not a bad thing, but it got me thinking - If we can get buildings as eye-candy, why not take the appearances even farther? I think what\u0027d look really nice is a layer of tarmac around the buildings. Some roads or walkways connecting them. Maybe even some residential buildings on site. Something to make it look like a working, functioning space center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think about this, and what kinds of aesthetic changes would you make to the space center?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T23:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I am a bit surprised that for all the work they did adding tarmac surrounding all of the buildings, they didn\u0027t bother to connect them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlmarti","CreatedById":70037,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:16:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was the first thing I thought of when I saw the new design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are the roads and parking lots?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm.
