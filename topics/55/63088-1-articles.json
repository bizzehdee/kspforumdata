It would also help a lot when planning an ion \u0022burn\u0022, since you would be seeing the predicted path rather than the instantaneous projection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T16:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a word, no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal life does not make good game balance.

In that case at the very least the simulation would have to fall back to realtime to recalculate the new situation. At least, the fuel consumption is a constant rate, but while power consumption is too constant, power replenishment is not. It does however seem that power generation from solar panels and the like is still calculated while the simulation is running in an accelerated state.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:02:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I understand the position you\u0027re in while on rails is calculated in \u0022steps.\u0022 There\u0027s a certain amount of steps per second calculated, and the higher the time warp, the less steps are taken. That\u0027s why it\u0027s possible to warp entirely through planets with high time warp values since the step sizes are so large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about if you\u0027re using an ion engine, you can start warp with the throttle on and the throttle will be locked until you return to 1x warp. For each step that is taken in time warp, a certain amount of velocity will be imparted into the orbital path. It shouldn\u0027t be that hard considering how solar panels and batteries currently function in timewarp.
