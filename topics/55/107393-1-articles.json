So far as I can see they did a pretty decent job. Regular dev notes from the lead developer including a direct warning regarding the new aerodynamics model, listening to feedback on the small stuff like the Round 8 tank, getting the \u0027tuning\u0027 releases in ASAP, so that players only have to change a few days worth of new designs, rather than sticking their fingers in their ears and leaving the discussion to fester.

That\u0027s pretty clear expectation setting right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a sandbox style game that deals with a complex subject.

Once you get over the novelty of learning how to build and fly rockets to other planets, you find that the planets themselves are actually quite boring. At least designing and building the crafts to get there is interesting.\u003Cp\u003EWhat this game really needs is a major polish pass once all the core features are in place.
