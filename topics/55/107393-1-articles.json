Why dont they fly some rockets/planes themselves prior to release so they could have released v1.02 as v1.\n\nOr...\n\nAssuming we get a 1.03, 1.04 in a short future timespan or moar...\n\nAll the fixes these updates add are quite transparent ones.\n\nIt would have been far better for squad to postpone their 1.0 release with the transparent bugfixes already incorporated.\n\nMost notably the \n\n\u0022I can not make up my mind kind of attitude over the aerodynamic model\u0022\n\nIf they\u0027d have actually flown a plane in 1.0 and find out how aircraft accelerate to mach 3 at sea level they could have already incorporated the fixes in the main release. And this is just one of many examples.\n\nMy idea about game making is that a main release is a complete publication with overlooked bugs and deficits.\n\nI can\u0027t grasp how some of the in game 1.0 bugs could ever have been overlooked.\n\nWhy am I annoyed by all this?\n\nBecause I keep redownloading a new version just because pre-release testing is not part of the developers strategy.\n\nMod developers who worked hard to update their mods have to recode their plugins for every little update to come. Mind you that 1.02 is most likely not the last of many future patches.\n\nAnd it ruined my carreer mode atleast a bit. Mod parts like mechjeb and many others that dont cross operate between v1.x version to the next left my VAB full of rockets with the \u0022contains invalid parts\u0022 message.\n\nMaybe this attitude and ways of operating a programming campaign is just part of the strategy for developers of a indie game.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just arrogant from me to demand high end professionalism for paying \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC28,00.\n\nBut regardless of whether what I wish for is acceptable to demand from the devs I do think I have a point.\n\nEven although I might have impressed myself as a complainer I hate being one.\n\nAnd this complaint is about the only one in a sea of sympathy and compliments. And as for v1.0 in general it made ksp whole and complete to a large degree. Better said I defenitely enjoy myself.\n\nBut pre release testing and implementing ways to reduce frequent patching would be highly appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T16:29:57Z","Content":"I agree with this, you\u0027re not the only one frustrated with how Squad is handling this release.

Just by adding bunch of small parts that can have multiple uses will make the game more fun and greatly expand the gameplay time before getting bored.\n\nThere is kerbalEDU which is supposed to help in education and i believe by adding stuff that does real science (same as NASA) we could not only have fun, but learn about something. before i started playing KSP i knew pretty much nothing about how orbital mechanics work.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:03:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sudslv**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:55:54Z","Content":"@Sudslv\n\nThat would be a worst case scenario.

So far as I can see they did a pretty decent job. Regular dev notes from the lead developer including a direct warning regarding the new aerodynamics model, listening to feedback on the small stuff like the Round 8 tank, getting the \u0027tuning\u0027 releases in ASAP, so that players only have to change a few days worth of new designs, rather than sticking their fingers in their ears and leaving the discussion to fester. Yes it sucks to have your 1.0 craft not work so well in 1.02 but better to sort that out now rather than at whenever 1.1 comes out and everyone has to rework/relearn months worth of stuff.\n\nThe new aero/heat models (which I think is where most of the vitriol is coming from) were highlighted as \u0027something that will break some designs but something that we\u0027re trying to balance to keep some of the crazy contraption spirit of KSP alive\u0027 (my wording but I think the tone is about right). That\u0027s pretty clear expectation setting right there.\n\nKSP is a sandbox style game that deals with a complex subject. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any realistic way of balancing that \u0027correctly\u0027 so that it suits all tastes. I\u0027m not even sure if the parallel beta approach would help that much (although that is a good and positive suggestion) - assuming Squad could find a build to make all the Beta testers more or less happy, I can almost guarantee that we\u0027d get the same kind of responses from everyone else that we\u0027ve seen so far once the beta releases were merged into the main build.\n\nI think the Squad approach of listening to feedback, responding to some (but not all) requests and making the game moddable enough that folks can tweak the rest to suit themselves is the right one for this style of game. Trying to accommodate absolutely everyone\u0027s requests in Stock will just lead to the gaming equivalent of a camel - a horse designed by committee.\n\nThankfully, the KSP community is pretty level headed on the whole. I don\u0027t even want to think about the levels of forum rage this kind of thing would have generated in other communities.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Like sudslv said in his post, there really aren\u0027t that many interesting places to visit beyond a handful of easter eggs.

Quick example - I like the extra bits of flavour text you get for completing various contracts. But the tech tree flavour text could use some reworking - the description of the FL-100 tank makes no sense unless you already know it was added to the game after the 400 tank, for example.\n\nThat might be a nice little project actually, if I can find the time. A small mod that keeps the current tech tree structure but makes the flavour text consistent.\n\nI also agree that more stuff to do planet-side would be nice but that also sounds like a pretty big job. Paid expansion territory to my mind but I appreciate that that\u0027s a whole other can of worms.

I do appreciate the devnotes to get an idea of what\u0027s going on, but they gave the impression that everything was going great, but if you watched closely you would see them abruptly stop talking about some feature (like some of the overlays) and then come release find out it had been quietly cut. A bit more honesty on the state of the game would have been nice.\n\u003E \n\u003E I was expecting the major changes to the systems in 1.0, that didn\u0027t bother me at all. But I did expect the systems to work without needing two hotfixes in less than a week (with more tweaking and balancing likely to come in the next update) \\*snipped other stuff that I agree with\\*\n\nThanks for the reasoned response. \n\nHave to admit that I don\u0027t remember the overlays - I keep an eye on the dev notes but those passed me by. On the other hand, I do remember the Barn, the initial iteration of the crew experience system and especially, the first draft resources system where the dev team were very engaged with the community and/or honest about why stuff got ditched. They didn\u0027t necessarily give the answer that everybody wanted to hear (we ditched this because we didn\u0027t think it was fun), but they were honest. Likewise, I was impressed with a recent comment from HarvesteR about the \u0027changing sphere of influence at high warp\u0027 bug, where he admitted that it had actually turned out to be a pretty simple one to squash.\n\nHonesty also works both ways. Gamers are an enthusiastic bunch (which is great!) but sometimes I think it would be better (and more conducive to further honesty) if some of that enthusiasm was tempered a bit. It\u0027s gotta be difficult for the dev team to do any kind of thinking aloud about the state of the game and what they plan for it, when their smallest utterance (no matter how carefully hedged) is a cue to stoke up the Hype Train. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nRegarding passing KSP off as a full release - I think this is always going to be one of those grey areas. Personally, I think Squad have been pretty up-front about what *they* consider to be the release version - and for what its worth I think they\u0027ve priced the release version in-line with that vision. If they had released KSP at AAA price levels then I\u0027d totally agree with you. But they haven\u0027t.\n\nAlso, on a personal note, I do agree with you to an extent. To my mind, Career mode could do with being a bit richer and I\u0027ve posted several comments to that effect. On the other hand, I am also very pleasantly surprised about how much difference a couple of extra contract types (especially the overhaul to the World First contracts), some new flavour text and a reworked tech tree has made. (Yes, I admit it - I like the new tech tree! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) Career mode feels much more strategic to me now, which it didn\u0027t before."},{"CreatedByName":"Cdr_Zeta","CreatedById":59015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:57:13Z","Content":"Hello,\n\nI am in agreement wit most posts here...1.0 then 1.02 I dont know what changed but if there were major changes in such a small update...0.1, 0.2? and 1.0 was supposed to be a full release?
