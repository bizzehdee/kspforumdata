I think someone even came up with a demo at some point but I can\u0027t find the link. It\u0027s a great idea and would greatly enhance the atmosphere of the game. As it stands now, I just turn music off and play my own soundtrack in the background. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
