Treat solar systems like planets around a point of gravity. To achieve this change Kerbol to be just a point of gravity in space (or something else, I don\u0027t know), then add a new Kerbol and put it in orbit around it with the planets and stuff in orbit around that. Similar things have been done by members of the community using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65401-WIP-PlanetFactory-CE?highlight=Krag\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlanetfactory CE\u003C/a\u003E but the solar systems have always orbited the original Kerbol star.

When viewing it in the Tracking Station, all the planets would be visible but only as \u0022dots\u0022 until you launch a ship to go there. Once you do, you could either bring a telescope with you to survey all the planets at once or just encounter and survey them one at a time.
