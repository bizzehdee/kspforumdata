You couldn\u0027t autostrut to a \u0022default\u0022 part because what part would that be then?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHeaviest part or root part is notoriously used to create rigidity on parts attached to other stacks as these will often autostrut to a center stack using heaviest or root as that is where root or heaviest parts are often located. And while that is often the obvious locations for root and heaviest part it does depend per vessel. If any vessel had it\u0027s \u0022Heaviest part\u0022 at a spot near the bottom it would be rigid with the parts at the top connected to it, but if that heaviest part would be near the middle or near the top then that rocket wouldn\u0027t be as rigid anymore, probably even wobbly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince there are to many variables in vessel creation I cannot foresee a algorithm that can be written or even conjured lol.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother things is that ships that dock or undock from one another will have it\u0027s heaviest or root part change causing physics to krakenize the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA default autostrut function allowing random locations of heaviest or root part will seriously annoy you with kraken type things when doing docking.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only solution is auto-strut grandparent part by default.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, that usually doesn\u0027t really make the vessel rigid especially if it has stacks hanging on it\u0027s side.

I think I understand your comment. And yet when I build heavy boosters with hundreds of parts for payloads of 1500 tons or more I find that a global auto-strut to Heaviest works well in building stable reliable ships. Even smaller boosters using ring staging benefit from this. Of course, it is easy to text edit the save file with a global replace. Still, no algorithm would be required to implement this option in-game, only a setting to allow a selection to change the current \u0027Disabled\u0027 default to another. That would be faster than my having to use an editor, which is what I do now. Or worse, changing each by hand. And I try not to use any mods, only \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E. I guess for me it is a numbers game. It would just be a little easier for my building to start with all Heaviest and then change what required another mode either while building or later in flight.

I wanted to post a picture of a booster that is 369 parts, 3431 total tons wet, with a payload of a little over 500 tons.
