It seems to me the game is doing pretty good in terms of people playing and, more importantly, buying the DLCs. I do wonder how much more content they could make for future DLCs. I do know I will probably buy future content. This game is cheap in $/hr of entertainment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the future I would like to see some improvements in performance, career mode, and graphics. Sure there are mods for graphics but they can reduce performance. Maybe there is an optimization that can be made somewhere modders cannot access. DX11 support maybe?\u00A0 Performance is a big issue for me because I like to build extremely large stations. I am not sure what could even be done to improve that. I have heard that rigid body physics calcs are hard/impossible to multithread. Maybe there is a way for the game to cheat a bit to improve speed. I\u0027ve already done what I can on my end by putting together a rather strong computer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCareer mode is something I would like to see totally revamped. Contracts need some form of personalization. They need to give a better sense of accomplishment. The funding system is mostly bad. I would like to see something along the lines of a budget. You get x funds allotted and have to pay active and training crew, part development, constuction, and operating cost along with being given directives of things to achieve and a time limit on them. If the budget allows then secondary objectives can be tried. What if you got restricted to a selection of boosters until you developed other ones? I think constraints can actually increase the fun. I actually wouldn\u0027t mind any kind of change to career mode as long as it changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T22:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223631465\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022186182\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221562610321\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022124625\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VITAS\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, VITAS said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni wonder what you think the future of KSP currently is,....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee, this is a contradiction.\u00A0 The future is not \u0022current\u0022 because then it would be \u0022now\u0022 :D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing we can know for sure is that when the future gets here, the entropy level of the universe will be somewhat higher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-08T22:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2019 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VITAS","CreatedById":124625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T22:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes i was asking what you NOW think the FUTURE (of KSP)\u00A0 is. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EIn the end everything will be even.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-08T22:35:38Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2019 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by VITAS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-08T22:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore graphical revamps and\u00A0another\u00A0DLC, which will introduce a unique feature and a half-baked reimplementation of a popular mod.
