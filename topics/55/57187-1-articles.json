The goal of Project Orion was to propel rockets across the solar system by using nuclear explosions as a form of rocket propulsion. However, since the government made this project top secret due to obvious reasons, the only funding that the project got was through government grants, which in the late 50\u0027s, early 60\u0027s was cut due to the lack of progress. And soon enough, the project went bust. The reason I bring this up is because the idea of using explosions in order to propel rockets seems quite \u0022Kerbal\u0022 to me, and probably everybody else who plays this game, as well. So if there is possibly a way to implement this feature in the game, I would like to see it.
