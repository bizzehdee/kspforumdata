Is there any reason why a jet engine could not be attached in line with something else?

A long, long time ago, with a different aero, you couldn\u0027t make spaceplanes witouth an incredibly efficient rocket motor. Of course, this would be overpowered in rockets, that\u0027s why the aerospike has no attachment points, and other things such as no gimbal(despite that the real aerospike had gimbal). But it\u0027s also logical: how would you safely fix a decoupler RING on the top of a SPIKE?! (witouth using magic). Jet engines used to have attachment points, wich were removed. Maybe again, to prevent their usage with rockets. They had no fairings as well, wich looked quite weird."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T11:24:35Z","Content":"Yes, please. Seems like a needless restriction in assembly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But it\u0027s also logical: how would you safely fix a decoupler RING on the top of a SPIKE?! (witouth using magic).\n\nUpper stages don\u0027t rest on their engine bells on the stage below, they use an interstage truss, often part of a fairing, to join the stages together ([like this](http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72c1590912446df5d68862a879abe42c?convert_to_webp=true)). No reason an aerospike couldn\u0027t be enclosed in such a structure."},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T11:40:16Z","Content":"I could do this for you if you wanted. I know you want it to be official but if you really want it would take like 2 seconds.\n\nI could duplicate the parts or just alter them.\n\nI could even make a simple little mod release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-28T13:24:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2015 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by clown\\_baby**"}]}
