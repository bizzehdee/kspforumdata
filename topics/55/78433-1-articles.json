The Best Game Ever ) Has A Plan To Add Multiplier, A Few Things That I Think Would Improve The Game For When Multiplier Is Released, Is A Mod Api That Allows You To Download Mods In The Game, And Installs Them Automatically When You Connect To A Server With Said Mods. Multiple Space Centers, I Mean Your Not Going To Have NASA, The Soviet Union, Space X, And Virgin Galactic All Using One Space Center, Being Able To Chose An Available Space Center When You Join. Customize-able Space Suits, Not In A Large Scale Just The Two Basic Colors To Tell Whose Kerbals Are Whose, Example The Default Colors Are red And White. Being Able To Lock Ships, So Only You And People Who You Allow Will Be-able To Assess Your Ships. Being Able To Have Multiple Logos, Example Being Able To Have The NASA Logo On One Pod And The Kerbal Space Program Flag On Another Pod On The Same Ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~ John To The Brogan\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T16:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA- A typo on Multiplayer.

It would be nice, I\u0027ll admit, but there are other things that a lot of people would like to have first, i.e. better aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T17:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI lol\u0027d. 7/10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
