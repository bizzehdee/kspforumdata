What in particular is wrong with the way planes fly? QWEASD seems to be a perfectly good way to fly a plane. It gives control over the rudder (AD), the elevators (WS), and the Ailerons (QE) with sensible keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to switch something (activate some rockets, etc), use an action group.
