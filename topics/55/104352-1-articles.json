Ditching fairings should increase your usable dV because you\u0027re carrying less mass.\n\n**Addendum 2**\n\nEngines should not be prevented from being activated while \u0022stowed.\u0022 Rocket engines work in a vacuum, so there\u0027s no reason they can\u0027t work inside a fairing. There is no good reason for this engine behavior, and it causes more bugs than necessary.\n\n**Addendum 3**\n\nFairing mass should be reasonable, and not so heavy that they hurt dV more than they help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T00:59:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:17:30Z","Content":"that was fast...\n\nI agree. \u002B1"},{"CreatedByName":"KotDemopan","CreatedById":98561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:21:45Z","Content":"The top seperation looks like it is safer for houses.

While I don\u0027t necessarily believe we will be forced to have fairings that separate like a too-vigorously-opened bag of chips, I really hope it\u0027s not what we get.

I do however very much hope it will be possible to fix this behaviour. If we hate it enough Squad might decided to make them separate together.\n\nI think the problem here is that the each bit of a fiaring is its own part, unlike Procedural Fairings where each part is a whole part."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:43:10Z","Content":"Heres the thing for me.

Sometimes people will forget about the good things and focus on the bad ones. Maybe the fairings decouple will work like that because of the procedural system. In the end of the day, procedural fairings are a good thing. Better than none.\n\nNow some people may say \u0022shut up you were bitc\\*\\*\\*\\* about the ROUND8 tank. Why can\u0027t I bitc\\* about the fairings?!\u0022 I\u0027m not being hypocritical here. The ROUND8 is a well known part and we all know how much we would miss it if it was to be replaced.
