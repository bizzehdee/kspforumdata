Wouldn\u0027t it be simpler if we can just move a lot of kerbals together? My suggestion is using old-school RPG party stacking method, where you can merge many kerbals into one kerbal when they are on EVA, and unmerge into the original number of kerbals when you want. This way you only need to do one EVA trip, instead of repeating the trip for each kerbal. Also, entering a ship or a rover requires you to unmerge first, so you can\u0027t cheat and use a one-seated rover for 3 kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jordanpumah","CreatedById":47395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T15:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can see it sort of as if it were one of those clone flash games, but in ksp, where they all move the same amount but in a different space, say, 2 or 3 feet apart,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could\u0027ve used this yesterday, had 3 kerbs stuck in a pod with no rcs, and i got one over, the other one deorbited (had parachute) and the third is still in the opod, but much to far from the station now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could\u0027ve gotten them out, put them into formation, and did cool guy stuff, and then seperarated them at the station and put them in,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr good idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T19:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer more of a squad command function where once you get them all on EVA you can have the one your controlling order the others to follow as Jordanpumah suggested.
