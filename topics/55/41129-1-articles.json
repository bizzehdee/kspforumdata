While not *really* needed, we weren\u0027t sure that the couch design was up to an uncushioned landing, particularly if the capsule came down on land, so the landing bag design was used. (This also led to a number of near-heart attacks and the shortening of John Glenn\u0027s Mercury flight when they got a spurious indication that his landing bag had deployed in orbit, complete with leaving the retrofire package on the spacecraft during re-entry to hope that it would hold the heatshield in place. While it hadn\u0027t done so, the mere thought that it might certainly didn\u0027t improve the odds of Gemini or Apollo having a landing bag.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIronically, the Soviets, when confronted with the same issue of needing to cushion their landings (since they planned for land landings from the start), came up with two simple solutions--the Vostok spacecraft simply had an ejection seat, and the pilot parachuted down separately, allowing the spacecraft to land harder, since it was tougher than the bag of bones that it was carrying; Soyuz, on the other hand, included (and still includes) a ring of solid rockets that fire about one second before touchdown to provide additional braking and cut the impact speed roughly in half. (I\u0027m not sure what technique was used in Voshkod, but then, Voshkod only flew twice, IIRC.) As a side note, the Soviets kept Vostok\u0027s precise recovery system details secret for a very long time, because under F\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9deration A\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9ronautique Internationale rules, to be considered a successful manned flight, the pilot must land inside the vehicle he took off in, and thus the Vostok system would have been disqualified from being the \u0022first manned spaceflight\u0022 under the FAI rules that were internationally accepted for firsts and record attempts--indeed, since that was revealed, the FAI record books now list Alan Shepard in Freedom Seven (MR-3) as the first manned spaceflight, and John Glenn in Friendship Seven (MA-6) as the first manned orbital spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
