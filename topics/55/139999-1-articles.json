I\u0027ll start by saying I don\u0027t actually have a strong one-way opinion on any of these, but I think the topic could be really interesting and important to how KSP works and feels. The central question is this: d\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Eoes the time-and-frustration-saving effect of reverts and quicksaves outweigh the drama and tension of suffering real consequences? Certainly some will feel one way and some will feel another, and right now those players can chose no-reverts hard mode or no-consequences easy mode. Im wondering though for people who might want a bit of both what some good solutions might be to allow reverts and quickloads\u00A0but give them some kind of penalty that would encourage them to live the real thing and feel some\u00A0genuine drama. Another thing that could be done is to reduce the actual cost of failure so it wouldn\u0027t seem quite so devastating.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some ideas for each:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0027Simulations\u0027\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0- This has been suggested before and under most circumstances Id think it silly to have a simulation inside a simulation, but if they came with an effective game mechanic I might feel differently. This could be done in two ways: First, in the VAB you could either select \u0022launch\u0022 or \u0022simulate\u0022. In career mode simulate could come with some nominal price, say 2% of construction costs, that would be cheap enough to consider it for a test launch but expensive enough to make players think twice about it. The second way, which is cagey I think, is to give a cost to \u003Cem\u003Ereverts and quickloads\u00A0themselves\u003C/em\u003E. So you could launch, and if things went wrong you could sort of ret-con the the time since launch or quicksave as a \u0022simulation\u0022 and pay a similarly small but noticeable penalty. Im sure this has been suggested before but I can most recently attribute the idea to Tater, and I like it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEjection seats Parachutes\u003C/strong\u003E - This too has been requested many times, but not for some time it seems. What would be great is to encourage players to think carefully about safety and the abort function. I\u0027ll be honest I\u0027ve never used the escape tower,... because I just revert! Im embarrassed but its true. I don\u0027t pick no-reverts because Im a perfectionist and Im chicken, but if something like the above \u0027simulations\u0027 were made stock I might be encouraged to be a bit harder on myself. If so what I\u0027d absolutely love would be to add ejection seats to the cockpits and the give parachutes to kerbals, both tied to the Abort button. Sometimes things might fail so catastrophically that all would be lost, but if all of sudden I lost control or my rocket started to get the wobbles it would be great to have some way to more easily\u00A0save the crew.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of this is strictly necessary of course, as there are options to have crews respawn etc. What this might provide is a bit of subtly and a middle-way so people who are on the fence could choose in the moment whether they were just testing things out or wanted to go full apollo 13.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?

Once the free ones are used, then you\u0027d pay in funds, and/or science. Reverts over and above the free ones might be pegged to the cost of the craft.

By definition you can\u0027t keep any results of your simulation, so you\u0027re already spending playing-time with something you know doesn\u0027t materially advance your progress in the game; it shouldn\u0027t cost you money on top of this.

We can thrash out what the exact costs should be, but I lean toward expensive. If I\u0027m reverting, it\u0027s for two reasons: to save the crew from disaster, or to make sure an interplanetary setup is perfect (e.g. aerobraking at Duna).

However, I\u0027ve thought of something that might work: when you enable either costly reverts or no reverts, the game autosaves periodically (like it already does), but unlike at present you can revert to the last saved point. Further, the game should keep two: one current, one previous, so that you can go further back in case of a bug-strike. This shouldn\u0027t cost you, and it wouldn\u0027t be simply the same as our current system of reverts or quicksaves/quickloads because you don\u0027t get to make a decision as to when the game decides to autosave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T06:12:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an R\u0026amp;D save with revert and respawn enabled for just mucking about and testing stuff, which I use as my simulator substitute. \u00A0When I play properly I have revert off and permadeath on, but allow f5/f9 just in case, but usually forget to use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA \u0027simulate\u0027 option in the editors would be a good feature IMO. \u00A0It should charge funds \u0027by the hour\u0027 but not advance normal game time or leave any trace or progress in the game proper. \u00A0Also the graphics could be turned down a bit (grainier /\u00A0toned down colours /\u00A0monochrome etc ) so you don\u0027t get the full experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T07:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the game would need some more tools first before a true \u0022no revert\u0022 mode is possible.

When your launch window is,\u00A0a delta V estimate for each leg of the trip, an estimate of the total time the mission will take, and some other bibs and bobs.

Ok you can\u0027t build a seat which ejects from a cockpit, but you can make ejectable cockpits (at the cost of adding some more weight) or you can choose not to and save the weight. \u00A0That\u0027s a choice that should be left to the player. It could be a toggleable\u00A0option on cockpits, but isn\u0027t having to design functionality like that yourself part of what makes KSP great?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem there is you will run up against the realism folks.\u00A0 Planes in the early space programs had ejection seats, they didn\u0027t eject their whole cockpit off the plane.\u00A0 Not only would that look ridiculous and IMO make the plane incredibly ugly, but it simply isn\u0027t real.\u00A0 Perhaps, only the Mk1 and maybe Mk2 should have them, neither the STS or Buran had ejection seats, as far as I know the DreamChaser will not either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-19T17:56:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2016 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T18:02:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first Shuttle orbiter did have ejection seats, actually, they were in place for STS missions 1 through 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T22:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222591029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139999\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463680953\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first Shuttle orbiter did have ejection seats, actually, they were in place for STS missions 1 through 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had no idea!\u00A0 That is fascinating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-19T22:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had to man-rate a spacecraft the first time they flew it with crew aboard.
