The mod is amazing in the ways like parachuting KERBALS to building a rover on eva, Problem is these structures are very breakable. You can attach a ground pylon with a special tool but if your KERBAL runs at it, it will move. In my sense that\u0027s not sturdy, I really want to make bases and other sorts of structures for fun, but it\u0027s very limited. I would personally love if \u003Cstrong\u003EKIS/KAS\u003C/strong\u003E got implemented into the game, it is useful and a bit more realistic to the fact that KERBALS can go EVA and fix a ship, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven a system as the architects building where you can design a house style thing, or planetary habitat modules that can get built on other planets by sending special robots to mine for ores to transform into iron and stuff to put into the 3D Building printer (using the resources needed) building your structure piece by piece.
