I can\u0027t say I\u0027m impressed. It looks kind of dull. No moons. No color. No air. Anyway I\u0027m writing this log today because I feel that logs should be available to all crewmembers in all universes after Hyperyear 1.1. A log is a very useful too for building up characters during long voyages. It can be used to describe one\u0027s thoughts about a situation. It may not have any science value and the public may not care too much for books (although if they did the space program may get a small cash bonus!), but taking pictures and writing words next to them can help to remember an important experience.\n\nSo yeah. Jeb Kerman said it best. These would function similarly to flag plaques, where you get to write a message in the flag, except it is in log format and you can add screenshots to it. Logs could be output as a text file, or read in-game, or even just used solely for the sake of adding a small bit of immersion. They could even be used for taking important notes, all without breaking immersion by using notepad or word. I\u0027m not saying everyone should use it or that it should be a big feature, but I can see some people finding it useful.\n\n*Bob Kerman\u0027s Log Y17 D11 MET 1 Year and 4 days.*\n\nNote to self: Nuclear engines explode when you crash them into mountains at orbital velocity.\n\nMax safe altitude of Dres: \u003E 3 km.\n\nAdditionally, Jeb ate the snacks, so we will have to take the fuel lander and try to refine some snacks out of the Dresilian Regolith.\n\n*Bob Kerman\u0027s Log, supplemental.*\n\nStranded on Dres. Dres is bigger than Minmus. Should have taken Mun lander."},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T01:20:54Z","Content":"Ooh, this would be awesome!
