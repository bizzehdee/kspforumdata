The ultimate sandbox! To keep it simple, road paving equipment with tracks instead of wheels, that can be attached to rovers to build roads, bridges, and runways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.gomaco.com/Resources/worldstories/world28_3/photos/coffman/HW-050017_12A.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HW-050017_12A.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne that can fit inside a cargo bay... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://www.gomaco.com/Resources/worldstories/world38_1/photos/ashtrom/SH-090817-D-16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SH-090817-D-16.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou would make the road paver to be the active unit. From the side menu you would then select the type, road, bridge, or runway just like you do for parts now. That road, bridge, or runway \u0022square\u0022 would become a 3D cursor that you would then pick a starting point on the ground and drag it to an end point, highlighting the direction on the ground where you want to build. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have the ability to build base structures. What I\u0027m suggesting is bigger and less CPU extensive. Domed buildings with multiple underground levels that you can wander around in IVA mode and wouldn\u0027t impact CPU rate. Launch pads, and offshore platforms that would require parts to build a larger mobile construction unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/01/multi-dome_base_being_constructed/12502111-1-eng-GB/Multi-dome_base_being_constructed_node_full_image_2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Multi-dome_base_being_constructed_node_full_image_2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.esa.int/Highlights/Lunar_3D_printing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehttp://www.esa.int/Highlights/Lunar_3D_printing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with the road paver the building construction unit would have it\u0027s own set of buildings to choose from, placed on the location you choose.
