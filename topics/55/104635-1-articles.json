The ultimate sandbox! To keep it simple, road paving equipment with tracks instead of wheels, that can be attached to rovers to build roads, bridges, and runways.\n\n![HW-050017_12A.jpg](http://www.gomaco.com/Resources/worldstories/world28_3/photos/coffman/HW-050017_12A.jpg)\n\nOne that can fit inside a cargo bay... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![SH-090817-D-16.jpg](https://www.gomaco.com/Resources/worldstories/world38_1/photos/ashtrom/SH-090817-D-16.jpg)\n\nYou would make the road paver to be the active unit. From the side menu you would then select the type, road, bridge, or runway just like you do for parts now. That road, bridge, or runway \u0022square\u0022 would become a 3D cursor that you would then pick a starting point on the ground and drag it to an end point, highlighting the direction on the ground where you want to build. \n\nWe already have the ability to build base structures. What I\u0027m suggesting is bigger and less CPU extensive. Domed buildings with multiple underground levels that you can wander around in IVA mode and wouldn\u0027t impact CPU rate. Launch pads, and offshore platforms that would require parts to build a larger mobile construction unit.\n\n![Multi-dome_base_being_constructed_node_full_image_2.jpg](http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/01/multi-dome_base_being_constructed/12502111-1-eng-GB/Multi-dome_base_being_constructed_node_full_image_2.jpg)\n\nLink: [**http://www.esa.int/Highlights/Lunar\\_3D\\_printing**](http://www.esa.int/Highlights/Lunar_3D_printing)\n\nAs with the road paver the building construction unit would have it\u0027s own set of buildings to choose from, placed on the location you choose. A single click to place in this case.\n\nConstruction would then be an automated event that takes time to finish. Roads would be faster than runways, which would be faster than bridges. Buildings of course would take even longer. \n\nMaterials would consist of local materials and structural/construction materials ferried from Kerbin.\n\nI\u0027d like to hear your ideas for Kerbal DLC.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T00:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Landge**"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T00:58:14Z","Content":"To be honest, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s time to worry about DLC yet. The devs have stated that they intend to continue working on KSP, though not for an indefinite amount of time. I\u0027d expect at the very least that we\u0027ll get multiplayer and Unity 5 before they start working on DLC. Hopefully, if the fairings are in fact breaking into lots of little pieces, we\u0027ll get an option to set them to something more normal.

KSP isn\u0027t really \u0022strong content\u0022 based; SQUAD doesn\u0027t really have much to actually SELL on. They could get a few suckers to buy things like parts packs; maybe even sell a new planet; but we can do that already, and some people don\u0027t even like SQUAD content.

What does the OP mean by DLC? Every patch/update so far has technically been DLC, but I dont consider that \u0027DLC\u0027. \n\nTo me DLC is stuff like expansion packs, new maps, extra content that is independent from the main complete\\* game.\n\nfor example, multiplayer should not be DLC, it should be part of the base game. Multiplayer should be added through an update or patch. My previous comment in this thread about clouds was sarcasm, clouds should also be part of the base game.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The devs already said at least the first post 1.0 would be a free one. I\u0027m certain it will be Unity 5 or Multiplayer (or both).\n\nwhat does this mean? we might potentially have to pay for 1.2(or whatever # it is)?\n\nWe need to distinguish the difference between an update to the game, and extra content DLC.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T22:23:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r**"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:29:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The devs already said at least the first post 1.0 would be a free one.

Easter eggs on the planet which portray the bases. There would be parts added to be ranger and endurance and lander stuff, and new orange suit Kerbals with the names of the astronauts in the movie.\n\nThen the cool physics need to be made.\n\nFirst, a version of general relativity would need to be added for the time dilation stuff. Then a huge tidal wave added to Miller\u0027s Planet. For Mann\u0027s Planet, you would have to basically ditch the PQS system for another type of procedurally generated frozen porous planet thing. Another object, a Neutron Star is also orbiting Gargantua, it\u0027s actually where Edmunds\u0027 Planet is. Nothing that interesting is going on on Edmunds. Just a generic desert planet.\n\nYou know what, maybe I shouldn\u0027t go into too much detail.
