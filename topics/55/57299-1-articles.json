Currently, Squad have said they will be re-doing the space plane parts completely, and will not be editing them before then. Also, IIRC, updates 0.22 through 0.30 are primarily for career mode, so dont expect it too happen soon. Technically these aren\u0027t unfinished features, they are just placeholder remenants from C7\u0027s aerospace mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the only cockpits missing IVA\u0027s are the MK2 and MK3, so I dont know what you mean about all this \u0022many cockpits\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T13:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, \u0022More IVA Views\u0022 (i.e., more internal model meshes so that IVA works in the cockpits that don\u0027t have them, etc.) is on the [thread=36863]What Not to Suggest List[/thread]. As Deathsoul097 mentioned, the cockpits without IVA views are just placeholders, remnants from C7\u0027s part pack (pre-0.17) that the devs want to re-do or replace with something a bit different before wasting valuable time making the internal meshes. I believe some other crewable parts lack IVA views as well -- most notably the science lab and (I think) the Hitchhiker...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, as this is on the What Not to Suggest List, I\u0027m going to have to close this one. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
