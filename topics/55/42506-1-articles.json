At least, that\u0027s what they said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the multiplayer, the only way I personally see any kind of multiplayer being implemented into KSP without breaking things is like making a Moonbase Alpha type of game-mode, where you load up a base or space station that you\u0027ve made and have your friends load in with you. You can\u0027t control vehicles(except rovers(vehicles with no rockets, just wheels and rover seats)), just EVA/IVA around with your friends. You could dig up samples, perform simple/silly experiments with each other, maintain or repair structures and basically just show off things you\u0027ve created with your buddies, while having small busywork to give you somethin\u0027 to do while you\u0027re there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere could maybe be a kind of shuttle ferry that could essentially teleport you(because you can\u0027t control rockets in this coop mode) to another base or station for a change of scenery...maybe with the ability to travel to one of \u003Cem\u003Etheir\u003C/em\u003E crafts as well. Bases could even be essentially enclosed spaces with maybe like a big invisible wall around the root command module for the base/vehicle you\u0027re loading to. Simple, not as complicated to figure out as actual multiplayer with physics and junk and it\u0027d still be fun enough to be a game-mode, bouncin\u0027 around on the surface with your friends.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roboto","CreatedById":79154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust for conversations sake, this kind of game has always been in the back of my mind. I got into programming for the purpose of building a game EXACTLY like this. Early in my day dreaming phase, multiplayer was one of the things I was really interested in working out, but I knew for a game like this, it would be very tough to pull it off in a way that is not a total mess. It bring up a lot of problems that are not easy to see until you are neck deep. That said, one of the ideas I tried to work out was multiplayer via a crew mechanic, where each crew member (player) could be assigned a set of operations that only they were able to manipulate during multiyplayer game play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor example: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA multi-crew ship could separate out navigation tasks to one player. They would be in charge of planning nodes and orbital mechanics. Another could be captain that commands flight controls and physical maneuvering, another could be Scientist or Engineer or something to that effect, and they control the deployment of instruments or experiments etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example: Even for a single crew member flight, ground crew/mission control could be one player or players, and the flight crew could be one. The ground crew could monitor and plan nodes while the player in the ship executes the maneuvering to and from the nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m am sure there are programmatic pitfalls associated with approaching it in this way as well. But I thought it was an interesting way to go about it. I\u0027m a big fan of co-op game play, and I think it would be a blast to set off on a science and exploration mission, where we had to depend on our fellow crew members to each accomplish their responsibilities correctly for us to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would probably work for another game but not so much for KSP.

Let\u0027s say for this example, 64. You may end flights at another space center, but landing there or occupying that space at the same time the owning player of that runway/launch pad rolls out a spacecraft, your craft is effectively recovered/destroyed and the player\u0027s creation is spawned. Possibly, a countdown timer is presented to both players and the person launching a craft can choose to abort loading because they wouldn\u0027t want to see the craft at their space center destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime Warp: This issue is effectively solved in the Introversion game, DEFCON: Everybody Dies. The basics of it is, if someone has a slower warp selected, that\u0027s what the server uses. Of course physics warp would have to be disabled because if someone has 100000x selected on their large Joolian mission and someone in a space plane selects 4x, that mission will surely blow up, but maybe these aspects can be handled by the server administrator though configuration files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking: Docking could be just like spacecraft control, but who will be left will be decided by a vote by the two players docking, or in the case of a draw, a coin flip followed by the looser proceeding to spectator mode. Also, docking should be limited to a white-list, like spacecraft control, just so someone couldn\u0027t just rendevous and grab your satellite by the tail and reenter it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeapons: Macey Dean has showed me that, \u0022Yes, it is possible to mash other people\u0027s ships to a pulp with torpedoes with a low part count ship.\u0022 This possibility means that some *explicit* could sneak up on you and blow you up, but just like in minecraft, griefers are banned, and so are weaponizers. Maybe just like Kerbal Livefeed, a live picture feed, updating roughly every 5 seconds is made between all ships so people can sense incoming doom. In the event that people would like to have a real-time war in KSP, the livefeed system could be reconfigured to only allow feeds between teammates, defined in the savefile. Possible referring to the cluttered space centers, each team would get closely spaced space centers so they could coordinate launch attacks. Maybe even a voice system could be implemented, or teamspeak could suffice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, in my eyes, the multiplayer functionality of KSP shouldn\u0027t be engraved in stone, and just like the conics system in the KSP config file, people can change it to their needs and their friends needs and have KSP multiplayer behave how they like it, that way everyone\u0027s happy.

All the players are free to come and go as they please and time warp however they please. However, all their telemetry data is logged into the server with timestamps and then sent to the clients at the appropriate time.
