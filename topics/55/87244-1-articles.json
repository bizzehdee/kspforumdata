But that\u0027s not really what most people think of nowadays when they think of sci-fi. KSP is very realistic. It\u0027s reminiscent of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/macguffinite.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERocketpunk\u003C/a\u003E, and it doesn\u0027t deal with the future or the past, but more with the present. (I realize it\u0027s odd to consider the 1960s \u0022present\u0022, but bear with me.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience Fiction nowadays refers to futuristic things. And that\u0027s okay, but standard ideas of science fiction will never fit into KSP. (And neither will Greeble.) Needlessly sleek and futuristic designs probably shouldn\u0027t ever be in the game or in official expansion packs, in my opinion. But here\u0027s an idea for a future expansion pack, something that doesn\u0027t fit into the scope of the original game but builds off of it. Obviously we\u0027re talking quite a bit after release. Now what you are about to see is a speculative look into the future of KSP (both the game and the space program! The article is written as a release announcement by squad.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal: The Next Generation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKTNG (Kayting) is a fully blown expansion pack for Kerbal Space Program. It adds plausible and realistic interstellar technologies to the endgame of Career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EFeatures\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EStockalike models\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the new parts added by KTNG share the stock-part aesthetic, and have no unnecessary greeble and sleekness seen in modern Sci-Fi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbal Galaxy\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals are truly not alone in the galaxy. The Skybox is gone, replaced with the true images of thousands of stars around the galaxy. Only a few of these stars have life, and less still have intelligence. Most stars are procedurally generated, but they\u0027re always the same for every game, just like the craters on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERelativity Simulation\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecial and General relativity are now both accounted for in the universe. If you move at near the speed of light, time will speed up for you. Back at home, however, it\u0027s the same time. Being near a gravitational source also accounts for time dilation as well. The speed of light in the Kerbal Universe is 11% of the real speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EInterstellar Dust\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen travelling at relativistic speeds, care must be taken to keep the ship from being blasted by dust and particles travelling rapidly towards you. The system is actually based on the Re-Entry Heating system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWarp Drive\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the likely principle for warp drive propulsion, known as the \u0022Alcubbiere Drive\u0022, Kerbals can eventually explore the further reaches of the galaxy. It works by compressing space in front of the ship and dilating it in the rear. It allows faster than light travel and bypasses relativity (because time travel simulation is a little out of the scope of KTNG). In the game itself it works merely by setting the ships velocity to a constant relative to the direction the ship is pointing. There are other advanced propulsion systems, more on this below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAutopilots, Ansibles, and A.I.s\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes in stock KSP seem to defy the speed of light by having instant reaction times. No more. For proper control of crafts, you must fit an Advanced A.I. module to a craft instead of a probe core, which allows it to be flown as though a pilot is flying, but without the life support requirements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControlling ships with low technology levels is clearly a problem, so a pre-programmed control module is available on all probes. The AutoJeb autopilot can be used to give commands to probes that are too far from Kerbin for seamless communication. AutoJeb can also be programmed by the user for specific tasks, using the popular KerbalScript language used by kOS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, after a considerable amount of gameplay in Interstellar space using Kerbals and/or A.I. Modules, Ansible comms systems are available. These devices can be used to have instant control over spacecraft at any distance, provided they actually have an Ansible intalled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELightspeed Comms delay can be toggled in savefile settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAway Teams\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals can be set up in away teams. These are parties that stay together and follow the leader. New science tools are available to Kerbals, such as the Tricorder. The Tricorder can be most efficiently utilized in arrangement, with multiple crewmembers scanning at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAliens and Animals\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin now has native life forms other than the Kerbals. The cow-like Woks, for instance. Fish and Krakens can be found in the ocean. Laythe also has some life forms as well. All planets with life have procedurally generated (and identical for every save on the same planet) life forms as well. There are as much as two animals for every biome. (Yes, we realize this is not a valid ecosystem, but that\u0027s not the point.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnimals can be abducted using things such as nets for the purposes of studying them for science. There is also a chance they can be used as food for Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EColonization\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals can now truly settle elsewhere. On barren planets like Duna or Eve, they are are kept inside outposts. n Laythe and other more habitable worlds, Kerbals can go outside in minimal survival gear, and set up space centers on other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EOther Races\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThere are now eight alien races to play as in separate solar systems. These can also be interacted with from other planets. The core gameplay is the same, but in different star systems. Each of these systems are specially designed, and are only as procedural as the Kerbolar System is. Each species has a specific design to their stock parts.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoofy: 70%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe: 5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAngry: 5%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFriendly: 50%\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbals are a race of little green people in the Kerbolar System on the Planet Kerbin.

No propellant is required, but there is a huge power requirement. The PL-SM4 Rocket Motor is an engine that can use any fuel, with variable effect. Monopropellant gives higher thrust with low Isp, LFO gives higher Isp with lower thrust, and XenonGas gives MUCH higher Isp with MUCH lower thrust. Then there\u0027s the Wormhole, which functions as an instant portal through spacetime, but is useless without a ship to go through the wormhole, and the wormhole ending has to already be in the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo satisfy the immense power requirements, new power sources are available. The Nuclear Reactor is the lowest tech of these, and is available near the end of the stock tech tree. The Fusion Reactor is far more advanced, and can supply much more power. The Antimatter Reactor is unrealistically advanced, and can provide huge amounts of power required for a high-power Warp drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPolitics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation in post-endgame is very majorly focused on relations with alien races.
