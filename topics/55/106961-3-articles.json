Even the curve at a normal wing root into the fuselage is impossible to recreate in KSP and have it perform the same way.\n\nThat\u0027s your subjective opinion. See, what I suggest is that we should be able to build successfully like that - if we like it - but that maybe yes, the marginally or clearly optimal solution should be a more clean design as demonstrated by a multitude of builders at this point (basically a bunch of Mk2 fuselage sections and two wings). I advocate *increased* creativity, I advocate *more* choice in design and I believe that the player should have more liberty in deciding what their spaceplane looks like, not just \u0022follow the shape of the parts\u0022. By doing things the way I suggest, we can have *both* what you like and what I like. Isn\u0027t that better?\n\nEDIT: to truly see the effects of wing drag on an airframe, I decided to slightly modify one of my standard atmospheric (non-spaceplane) aircraft and compare the new version against the old one with respect to sea level speed. The two aircraft can be seen below, the differences between the (new) FA-2B on the left and the original FA-2 on the right being a reduced wing piece count on the former (16 smaller wing pieces were used, above and below, on the FA-2 to hide the cleavage between the two engine and fuel sections, whereas these were removed on the B version) and that the two engine-fuel fuselage sections were moved closer to the centerline on the FA-2B (with only cosmetic effects, this did not impact sea level speed). In both images, the aircraft have payload, but this was dropped immediately after takeoff for the speed test.\n\nThe result? The FA-2B, with its 16 fewer small wing pieces (which overall do not cover a very large area and have been put in such a way that they are not hit by the airflow) has a sea level top speed at least 550 m/s higher than the FA-2. Why do I say \u0027at least\u0027? The reason is that the B version eventually burns up as it accelerates beyond 950 m/s. The FA-2 struggles to hit a speed above 400 m/s. So, that is the difference that 16 small wing pieces can make - now imagine if we try to build with larger wing pieces... to achieve larger wings...\n\n![mHnJAkz.png](http://i.imgur.com/mHnJAkz.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T00:22:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:16:54Z","Content":"So we\u0027ve successfully drilled down to the heart of the matter; planes actually work fine and its still pretty trivial to make a plane that will get into orbit.\n\nWhat HAS been eliminated is the ability to freeform construct things out of piles of wings without giving any thought to how it would fly.

The 1.0 model was *managable*, but the drag changes in 1.0.1 just managed to ruin what foothold we still had. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E and 100\u002B wing segments because they add a HUGE amount of drag;\n\nIf you put them together, they should realistically be regarded as one wing - so why do individual wing segments add so much drag? If I create a structural shell of wings, the leading pieces should stand for the most drag and the rest of the structure shouldn\u0027t be as much of an airbrake. 16 pieces of small wings put along the fuselage shouldn\u0027t mean a 500 m/s difference of speed at sea level.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is entirely realistic,\n\nNo.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E and ANY sane aerodynamic system would have caused this.\n\nAny sane aerodynamic system in a *game* would take into consideration creativity and that people would use different pieces in novel fashions. We have already established that KSP isn\u0027t, cannot be and shouldn\u0027t be a simulation. Therefore the drag model has to be more lenient, especially towards wings and fuselage sections.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Quite frankly you were exploiting the extremely limited flight system before and I am sorry to say that time of your life is over (with stock settings anyway)\n\nQuite frankly you are being too presumptive. I simply don\u0027t want to be limited to the shapes provided in the part selection screen, I want to be able to build things beyond that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Three things to do:\n\u003E Explore the new system and learn more about aircraft. Learn how to build again, challenge yourself to work within the (now sane) limits you have. There are now real actual engineering challenges to experiences. It\u0027s like graduating from Legos to model rockets. Welcome to KSP!\n\nYeah, I\u0027m learning more about aircraft and especially *realistic* spaceplanes by the hour.\n\n![TiA2PB5.png](http://i.imgur.com/TiA2PB5.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Create a new install and then set up sandbox via settings, the alt\u002BF12 debug menu settings, and what you can change in the Physics config file in the KSP directory; with that you can probably set it up where your zany planes with 400 parts will fly again. You can finally deliver that VCR-shaped plane to Bob on Eeloo. (Does anyone even know what VCRs are anymore?)\n\u003E Create or add CONSTRUCTIVE feedback to an appropriate thread asking for a feature to use wing parts as structural pieces again. Leave out the hyperbole, don\u0027t claim that Squad hates you or what you want to do. You might also find a mod that enables this as well.\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not going to go back to the way you want it, but it\u0027s not the end of the world.\n\nMods and changing physics.cfg files are not the answer to improving the stock game, and this argument needs to find some rest.\n\nAnd I am providing suggestions for solutions - revert the drag changes generally, introduce aesthetic structural parts which do not generate lift but in turn have considerably less drag and mass than wings, reduce the drag of the wings and fuselage sections specifically, reduce the drag of stacked wing parts along the angle of attack etc. etc. But it\u0027s just impossible to have a constructive discussion when one is being accused of using exploits from one direction and wanting to fly X-wings from the other (which is currently possible anyway so I truly don\u0027t get the point).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T00:52:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 12:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aanker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Chronosheep","CreatedById":135661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:57:09Z","Content":"Let me introduce the future of spaceplane SSTOs:\n\n[![C07xxmPl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/C07xxmPl.jpg)](http://imgur.com/C07xxmP)\n\nSeriously.
