I hope that we can have variations of almost any part in any size. I was very very happy when they added the new Rockomax 48-7S engine, because you don\u0027t always want two radially mounted. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T00:14:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t we wait until the update is actually released?

I don\u0027t know, I figured that whatever they implement into the next update would be just basic stuff to get the ball rolling and make sure the R\u0026amp;D stuff works for everyone and is enjoyable, more or less. After that, they\u0027ll probably toss in new parts every other patch or so...or just have a big functional parts patch someday. Who knows? Either way, it\u0027s a bit too early to be requesting things like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
