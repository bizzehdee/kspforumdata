I don\u0027t think any propulsion systems should be integrated, though, since that would somewhat defeat the purpose of the \u0022lego\u0022 style design concept the devs have stated a preference for (basically, it\u0027s the reason we don\u0027t have procedural tanks of any kind)."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T23:53:18Z","Content":"Yeah, it would be more \u0022stockalike\u0022 if the 2 mods above had a fuel tank, rcs tank, and engine instead of all in 1, even if that raises part counts. The way ksp does things, the additional crew space on the Soyuz is wasted, though, and would artificially create crew spots for stations or even transport even though the spaces are quite small."}]}
