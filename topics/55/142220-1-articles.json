Which is, selling a very wide collection of games through a application which is only there to commercialize, bond and unify a gaming community, and work as a platform for lot\u0027s of people using it. Which is probably the only reason why Steam ever became great. Due to these reasons Steam became a trend in the PC gaming community, and it\u0027s power grew.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt seems to me from a \u0022gut feeling standpoint\u0022 \u003Cem\u003E(only saying because we lack facts, and you have to theorize to find them, meaning it\u0027s my opinion)\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat Steam is a bit of a spoiled throne sitter, shuffling around games now and then for profit and unattending their services in many areas. If they did put attention to their services they would have aproached Squad, because I\u0027m sure the same steam users do not only go to forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com to share their complaints.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn fact, when I google KSP related content I often get directed to the steam community.

I used Steam years ago when I was a active gamer, and back then I suffered from other game related issues (non KSP related)\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow Steam ever got to this position considering their very good service to it\u0027s customers (ultimate sarcasm) is beyond me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf this is not the problem between the Squad and Steam relationship but just a flawed theory, let Squad be so free to elaborate on the subject if they\u0027re willing to. And explain to me why these issues aren\u0027t resolved.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s both profit for Squad and Steam to have satisfied customers, so I think this move will be in order one day eventually or let it boil down to it. We\u0027ll see. If it\u0027s not profit on Steams side, then they have a to big to fail and KSP is unimportant mentality.

My critique is to portray the problem which has to be resolved on both sides. With more Steam critique involved from my point of view. Which isn\u0027t fair, because fact or fact about whos responsible, both sides are responsible to make things better. Steam has the guts to make huge amount of profits just because of management and distribution. That opinion of mine has 2 sides. On one side it\u0027s prejudice, yes I admit, and on the other hand it\u0027s making use of products made by others.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe latter is completely normal. Because hardware stores sell hardware, they do not make it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut when I walk into one I have the right to refund, professional assistance, and item exchange. Why does steam has no item exchange to swap V1 of a game with version 0.5?

I want that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI merely stating that this distributor / customer relationship fact is hitting on the customer. The same accounts for a Samsung TV bought at Walmart.

I thought we moved on since then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout discussing this relationship at all and just stating the facts we made through agreements between two parties will never change anything.
