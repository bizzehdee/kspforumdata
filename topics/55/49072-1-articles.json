I kind of jumped on this late, but am getting up to speed the past couple weeks on this program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have one suggestions on your tech tree....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the Nose Cone to your first level under Aerodynamic. This will make it so we can create rockets that are not dependent on command module and can start with basic rocketry before submitting Kerbals to our abuse of initial rocket development. I think the command module should be moved to perhaps the third tier and perhaps move the stayputnik to the second. This way you have a natural progression of challenges etc. on the rocketry tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for taking input. Look forward to future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
