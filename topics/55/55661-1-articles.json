I thought it could be a good way for Squad to raise money as well, they could auction off parts of the map, so an area of flat, featureless ice cap wouldn\u0027t get much, but I can see someone paying a fair amount for the rights to officially name the mountains near KSC, or the islands with the insular space centre on it. Perhaps you could click on features to see their names, or else it would tell you where you had landed (The Ferram desert, the Manley Mountains, The Jebediah Straits). It\u0027s something that would add a little flavour to the game, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterthought: So long as there were terms and conditions to your naming rights made clear, so you don\u0027t get people naming things \u0022Mount Hitlercock\u0022, and Squad having to go along with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gojira","CreatedById":10884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T20:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t like the idea of donations for naming.
