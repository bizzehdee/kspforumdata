FAIRINGS ! the fairings are by far the ugliest things in the game (in addition to be crappy gameplay-wise).

I feel it should be scaled down a bit.\n\nAs for an art pass, at least the Command Pod Mk2 should get one. It\u0027s a bit ugly. In the long run, all the textures should be updated to give a more consistent feel. This mash-up of textures was covered in one of bac9\u0027s blogs, you can read it [HERE](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/747-The-Making-Of-New). When he made the new KSC buildings, he made sure to keep the textures simple, and consistent between buildings. For parts, perhaps they should not be simple textures (who doesn\u0027t love a little detail-work), but they should all have a consistent art style. Right now you\u0027ve got parts from old Kerbal Space Program, parts from the newer versions, the ARM parts, Porkjet\u0027s Spaceplane Plus parts... it\u0027s a lot to take in.
