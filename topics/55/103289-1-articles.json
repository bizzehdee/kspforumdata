The new aerodynamics will be based on craft shape like FAR. While Squad hasn\u0027t specifically said this, they did say that mods will be able to add flaps, spoilers, and air brakes and they will \u0022just work\u0022. The only way that would be possible is if aerodynamics used craft shape instead of arbitrary lift values. So, yeah Mk3 will have a lifting body in 1.0, and so will every other body (like FAR... or you know, real).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T03:46:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T03:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis discussion about KSP\u0027s development has been moved to Suggestions and Development Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, more-or-less what Alshain said.
