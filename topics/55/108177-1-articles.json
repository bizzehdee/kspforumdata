So, from an educational perspective about what solar-systems look like, it could be argued that it shouldn\u0027t be included in KSP. (Though, having it there could educate people to the fact that counter-orbital planets do exist too, so it does have educational value ..until this thread I don\u0027t think I was aware such things existed.) \n\nI would argue, from the perspective of a game that teaches people orbital mechanics .. and, as a game that\u0027s presumably adding planets that are interesting and challenging to get to, it should absolutely be in there. So it could be argued either way. Exactly how much restraint (for the sake of realism) is used in designing this game is down to Squad to decide, I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T23:30:19Z","Content":"Perhaps add Kuiper belt style bodies.
