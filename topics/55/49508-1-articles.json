IE Mysterious goo always collects 10 data (not a real figure) and the Science bay always collects 25 (ditto). The location and number of times you have previously collected that data will affect the value of the data. Transmission is basically a wireless recovery, it collects the data off the ship while the ship is still on it\u0027s mission. The percent of data returned is also completely worthless at the moment but is a good mechanic that I feel will eventually evolve into something great. A quirk of the data system is that identical experiments cannot be stored twice on the same pod. For example, if I land with a two man lander can then I can take one sample and one EVA report from the surface in that location. However, you can store an infinite number of EVA reports from different locations. This makes polar orbits a great way to gain science in the beginning of the game. If my craft however were to instead use two 1 man pods, I could then take two of each type of science activity back to Kerbin with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EWhat works with the Data System\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe data system is robust at the moment and handles to the same experiment across the universe in a fun, engaging fashion. I was jubilated to discover the mun\u0027s science factor of three on my first landing. This works great! Keep it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EWhat is wrong with the Data System?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently there is no mechanism to collect repetitive data. In the above example the 2 man lander will effectively do less science than two one man capsules. Also the current science system values breth over depth. 1 landing in any given location is 95% of the science you can do. Data can be returned from just about anywhere on a whim, and power has very little to do with the situation after your first solar panel. Right now doing experiments in space is slightly different than most would expect. Exposing a material sample in a science bay requires you to return the ENTIRE science bay to Kerbin, usually in a unwieldy fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EHow to fix it?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Break it down. Use data for things that are actually data like temperature, crew reports, photos, pressure, etc. Anything that is measured in Gigabytes should be transmittable at 100% efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make it storable. Instead of the current system of one type of each per capsule there should be \u0022data banks\u0022 of a certain amount of storage. Each capsule should have some built in storage, and additional parts should be provided. It should be the players choice if he/she/it wants to bring back 25 EVA reports from the same place. Allow transfer between vessels when docked. This is a much better and more sensible mechanic than the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Add samples. Just like data it would be stored up to a certain amount per capsule, and additional containers could be provided. These sample would have to be returned to Kerbin for science. Later in the game a mechanic could be implemented to allow off site analysis to turn \u0022samples\u0022 into \u0022data\u0022 the data could then be transmitted. Samples could be transferred between docked craft. This would make much more sense then the current system of sample collection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Make Science Bays \u0022harvestable\u0022. This is a little bit of a future searching proposition, however I foresee additional science parts that will generate samples like the science bay and will incur a penalty if the entire thing is not returned to Kerbin. However when the future part is actually a giant research laboratory that you barley managed to get to orbit, that becomes less fesable. Instead Kerbals could \u0022harvest\u0022 the samples from the lab and replace them with new ones. This would allow for the harvested samples to be put into the containers from suggestion 3 and returned to Kerbin. This could also allow for \u0022resupply\u0022 flights to restock the labs supply of unused samples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. I have a feeling it\u0027s planned but I will suggest it anyways, duration experiments. Parts that must be manned by Kerbals to generate data/samples over a period of time when supplied with power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. More conditions on collection then just the biomes. Wouldn\u0027t it make sense that samples obtained during a Dunian winter would different? Or the night side of the moon may be uneventful, but during the day would some ice in the bottom of craters melt? This would add some incentives to remain in a location to collect science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. New Transmission mechanics. Remote Tech was far to strict but they got one thing very right. Space infrastructure is necessary for deep space exploration. Maybe some form of less strict Line of Sight and distance limited transmitters would be fun, and also add a reason to store data until the next transmission window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer, I know the whole system is in development, this isn\u0027t a condemnation, just a suggestion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer Pt II, I love .22 with every single molecular bond between carbon and hydrogen in my body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EMiscellaneous Science Addendum\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Science Bonus for certain Kerbonauts. Some would be trained in things other than blowing stuff up, It would make crew planning pretty awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A way to expose the biome map. Knowing what different areas to explore would be cool, make disguise it as a geological survey tool. Basically kinda like mapsat. Have it worth science points as it nears completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. EVA science tools. Drills, shovels deploy-able handheld gizmos, more things to do for science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Change the Science curve. Right now the amount of science you get drops significantly once you take your first sample. Maybe instead the first sample should be worth less and the second should be worth more. Real science can\u0027t learn everything from just one moon rock, I doubt the Kerbals can\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Unmanned science parts. Unmanned probes are highly undervalued in the current system. EVA reports represent so much % of the science that not using at least 1 Kerb is going to make getting through the tech tree nigh impossible. Curiosity has done so much science, don\u0027t forget the hundreds of other unmanned craft that have graced the skies throughout the space age.
