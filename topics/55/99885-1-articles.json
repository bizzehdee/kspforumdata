Following suit, the Lander Cans are lightweight and have a much lower impact tolerance rating. For example, the Mk1-2 Command Pod, the three-seater, can tolerate impacts of 45 m/s, according to the wiki. The 2.5m Mk2 Lander Can can survive an impact of only 8 m/s. Even the pod\u0027s in-game description states: \u003Cem\u003EThis cozy capsule seats two, and is very lightweight. However, don\u0027t expect it to survive atmospheric entry or even a sneeze.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yet these lander cans have the exact same max. temperature rating (3400 degrees K) as the regular heat-shielded* command pods, and in fact I use the Mk1 Lander Can as a very useful lightweight capsule for completing contracts and performing Munar and Minmus landings, complete with parachute. From a gameplay standpoint, sure, it\u0027s a fun element, and I will admit that the Mk1 Lander Can can be used to create a much cooler-looking manned spacecraft than the Mk-1 Command Pod can (don\u0027t even get me started on the IVA views from the lander can... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E), but from a realism standpoint it\u0027s horribly out of whack. Jim McDivitt, an Apollo astronaut, said of the LM: \u0022When I saw a model of the Lunar Model, it had these rigid sides, and really looked strong.
