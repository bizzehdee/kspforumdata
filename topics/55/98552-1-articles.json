(considering Tavert\u0027s charts, this is quite justified)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut with the atmosphere changes... I think we could see a huge rebalance...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could do nerfs across the board so that you need an equally big rocket to get to orbit... (and going other places is much harder) or they could just leave the first milestone as easier to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there are other things that need to be looked at, what are your thoughts on them/ suggest more:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1) Air breathing engines, fuel consumption and maximum velocity... the latter should be nerfed as in NEAR/FAR, the former we\u0027re already somewhat prepared for because if the better liquid fuel tanks we have available\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) Engine thrust - with a new aero model, we\u0027re encouraged to build tall, skinny rockets. That means we may need more thrust under a single stack. Perhaps some engine thrust should be buffed (mass can increase to keep TWR the same)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#3) Specific engine balance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* there\u0027s already a thread for that\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#4) Engine balance in general\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need more engines with ISP ranges like the LVN, the poodle, the KR-2L, and the 25x4: 220-800, 270-390, 280-380, 320-360\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-What we see here is that the better the vacuum ISP, the worse the atmospheric ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, the 25x4 is better suited as a lower stage, and the KR-2L as an upper stage... but the better TWR of the KR-2L sort of skews that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, there should be a pretty standard TWR for each engine diameter (perhaps skewed a little higher for engine with worse vacuum ISP), and all that varies is weight, and the ISP spread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO the poodle-skipper-mainsail line is a pretty good model (but I\u0027d nerf the atmospheric ISP of the skipper down to 310) for the rest to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#5) Ion propulsion - sure we don\u0027t have thrusting during high timewarp, or a way of doing maneuver nodes for very long thrusts... so for gameplay/engine limitations, high TWR is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, back when they quadrupled the Ion engine thrust, they should have nerfed its ISP by half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso.... Xenon gas is about 400x the cost per kg of standard rocket fuel...

The smaller engines are ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mainsail and the KS-25x4 have roughly the same thrust per unit area. Their thrust is about the same as the weight of a 30 m stack of fuel tanks. A 2.5 m rocket powered by a Mainsail can be almost too tall and too thin, while a 3.75 m rocket powered by a KS-25x4 looks too short. This could be fixed by making the engine cluster comparable to the LFB: 4500 kN of thrust with a low Isp. (On the other hand, the KS-25x4 is supposed to be a low-thrust high-efficiency engine cluster that can\u0027t even lift the SLS first stage on its own.

Our perception of speed is based on optic flow (the rate of stuff rushing past your eyes) and the problem with KSP is the terrain is so sparse that it doesn\u0027t provide much stimulus for optic flow, so you have to go even faster to feel the speed. This is why many of us want unnatural speeds out of our rovers and why \u0022pottering\u0022 around at 50m/s (~110mph) feels slow. If the terrain was more detailed, the speed fiends would be content with lower velocities, alternatively; in this unnaturally sparse terrain I feel unnaturally powerful engines are acceptable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also feel the Jet engines are a rather special case. They\u0027re the only form of propulsion in KSP that is restricted to just two bodies, so their scope of use is very much more limited than the other engines (so be nice to them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). Aside from SSTO applications their other purpose is to open up exploration of Kerbin, so that needs to remain efficient, fun and something that is enticing (ie doesn\u0027t make you feel like your playing a long-haul flight sim) because Kerbin is really worth exploring, its quite possibly the most interesting planet!
