Not something that keeps other mods from loading on game start, but something that can be toggled in game to show/hide mods in the parts list. Something like a drop-down that allows us to select which folder parts are displayed from would be \u0022over the top\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternative to this idea would be to prefix all stock parts so they load first in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I love about the sandbox is the challenges.
