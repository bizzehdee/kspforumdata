I am quite fond of the structural fuselage and the girders. Two very useful additions would be round structural members that could be used for items like roll-cages and hard pipes. The lengths listed below would correspond appropriately with the Modular Girder XL.\n\n**1) Hard Pipe/Tube**\n\nUse: Primarily for connection of base modules or spacecraft to move fuel and electricity but not crew. It could eventually also be used to move heat to a remote radiator (once we get radiator and heat pump parts).\n\nSize: 0.75 m x 2.5 m; one length only\n\nImpact: 10-20 m/s\n\nTexture: White or silver with a random scratch or two\n\nShape: Cylinder with beveled ends that mate cleanly to the Clamp-O-Tron Jr. (and to allow clean clipping at angles and \u0022joints\u0022 when laid end to end)\n\nAttachment: Node/end only; other parts may be attached radially\n\nTransfer: Fuel, electricity, heat\n\nName: STX-3 Material Transfer Conduit\n\n**2) Structural Metal Alloy Members (2 sizes)**\n\nUse: Roll cages, masts, hard-landing legs, etc..\n\nSize: Diameter at 3/4x or 1x of the M-beam height, length at 2.5 m and 1.25 m or 1/3 of large member. Not sure on best length.\n\nImpact: 40-60 m/s\n\nTexture: Grey? Maybe black...\n\nShape: Cylinder with beveled ends (clipping at angles but no joint when snapped end to end)\n\nAttachment: Node \u0026 radial; other parts may be attached radially\n\nTransfer: Electricity\n\nName: Seamless T-250/T-125\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T21:25:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pax Kerbana**"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T23:38:18Z","Content":"Id like to have more structural stuff, especially larger things as right now low part count capital ships are basically impossible, as are massive stations."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:18:42Z","Content":"Roll cages!

Along those lines I would like a larger plate, longer truss, and longer structural fuselage. While we\u0027re at it, a box girder would be more appropriate than the M-beam.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to build stations with enough clearance to dock large ships. The Mk 3 tanks can be used for length considerations but they are unattractive for stations IMO. \n\nWelding was good for structural members but appears to be broken now. Also Squad seems to have changed something about how the part orientation is coded.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Roll cages! Why didn\u0027t I think of tha? That is truly brilliant!

Genius!\n\u003E Hopefully that\u0027s what you mean. Pipes would be great too.\n\nThat is exactly what I mean. There was a mod (that I never used) that had a good looking roll cage and pretty awesome tires. Don\u0027t know what it\u0027s status is ATM. Right now I use the M-beam... A bit unsightly for this application but it works. I\u0027ll post a pic tomorrow my favorite buggy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Remember, the build tree system doesn\u0027t support \u0022loop\u0022 connections outside of struts and fuel lines, which limits this functionality somewhat.\n\nThat is true. I build from the center by offsetting the furthest part and then connect the ends to the vehicle body if needed. Found this works quite well at protecting the little frogs that wear space suits."}]}
