I like the idea of being able to tell the endpoints apart, and would love to be able to REVERSE the direction of flow. Even better if you could do it in flight, too."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T22:02:08Z","Content":"I like the idea about endpoints being different colors.\n\nDunno about bi-directional transfer. Seems easy enough to put another fuel line just the other way around. I did that on spaceplanes before jets drained fuel from all of the vessel\u0027s tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T03:52:27Z","Content":"And lo it came to pass, in the most Kerbal of fashions...\n\n- The endpoints of the vaunted fuel ducts shall be tinted opposing/contrasting colors that are colorblind-friendly.\n- The fuel ducts shall have 3 modes: Normal, Inverse, Crossfeed.\n- The fuel duct endpoint colors shall reflect the internal flow state of the fuel duct.\n- So say we all."},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T04:36:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Bi-directional would cause problems, no?\n\nCan cause problems, doesn\u0027t always. Which is enough of a reason to me to oppose this, unless they can change something so that it doesn\u0027t cause problems.\n\nThe rest of the suggestion is good to me."}]}
