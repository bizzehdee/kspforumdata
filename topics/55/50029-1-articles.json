There was talk of the current one, which is a flat bitmap texture, being replaced by a procedural skybox, which for one would look more realistic and way better especially when using zoom. But talk of the new skybox was a few months ago, so I guess more important features took priority. Not likely to change it before if the current one is just a placeholder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso your idea would be easier to implement with it I think, you could make stars fade in and out depending on sunlight exposure and specific parts of the sky (would also work for sunrises/sunsets), if your point of view is in the shadow or not. I\u0027m just not sure how taxing on GPUs it would be but then again solar panels detecting exposure and shadow individually aren\u0027t so I guess that wouldn\u0027t be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
