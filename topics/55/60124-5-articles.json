It doesn\u0027t need to be the full blown accurate areodynamics model - just that one thing would help get rid of the biggest annoyance - unrealistic flipovers and spinouts.

If it was applied to each part, the fact that facing the tail into the wind drags the tail more would cause the tail to try to decelerate relative to the rest of the craft\u0027s parts, and thus tend to rotate the craft back into a position where the tail is in back. The groundwork for this is all already there, since when the craft is in space the rotations the craft experiences because of applying a force to individual parts is being calculated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T15:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pizzaoverhead\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERandom terrain is not the same as procedural terrain. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a Venn Diagram, \u0022random terrain\u0022 is contained entirely inside \u0022procedural terrain\u0022.
