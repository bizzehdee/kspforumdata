It seems like the parachutes create enormous drag in 1.0 and are indestructible. The drag level may actually be perfectly fine but since they are indestructible and parts do not seem hurt by massive G\u0027s there is no reason to bother with proper re-entries or heat shields. You can just slam your pod into the atmosphere and pop your chute and all will be okay no matter your velocity or altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:38:45Z","Content":"Bu then theres the problem of the new aero : if you launch a basic capsule\u002Bheatshield and small chute on a eccentric suborbital flight, the re-entry is pretty steep : while not using the chutes you decelerate WAY too slowly when not using a chute. If you dont open it you hit the sea at 400m/s (and the terminal velocity of the pod is way less!)\n\nSo if we balance the chutes in a somehow realistic way (make them burn if theres fire and plasma, make them tear apart if you are going at 3000m/s, or if you get 30g) we will not be able to open them before the craft hits the ground !!"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:48:44Z","Content":"I see your point. Well, obviously it works IRL so there must be some solution. I honestly don\u0027t even understand why there is a new aero physics at all, it was fine the way it was.

The atmosphere is thin so one of two things hapenned:\n\n1) Parachutes didn\u0027t kill enough speed so there was a litho-brake with a big explosion.\n\n2) Parachutes were too big and opened too high which led to disassembly of the craft.\n\nSo it took me a lot of fine-tuning to get working parameters. Since I am in no mood for long calculations I used trial and error method and added a lot of struts (12 struts only to keep the parachute capsule from tearing off).\n\nI can\u0027t say it were the best 2 hours I spent in my life but I don\u0027t like the way parachutes work in 1.0 either."}]}
