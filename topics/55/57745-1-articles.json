The wings came off and most of the girders except the ones on the bottom. I used the rest of the fuel to jet around through the water and was like, \u0022Man, this is just as fun as the plane!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, overall, I believe there should be a rocket boat jetty of some sort. Just to place things into the water, instead of attempting to land them perfectly without death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if it\u0027s been posted before, but man, I\u0027ve been having a helluva good time in Kerbal!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this game and when I made my first space plane(Appropriately called the PaperPlane, AND IT FLEW!), I was excited and happy to see it actually work considering I didn\u0027t have many parts, and all previous attempt were futile until I obtained the moveable winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrian\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T07:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should read the what not to suggest list in pretty sure that this is on there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T08:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we do need something like this - it can even be justified with \u0022serious\u0022 reasons, like needing somewhere for tug boats to tow splashed-down boosters, or for testing submersible probes which could be used on Eve/Laythe/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a dock/pier is ever added, it should definitely include a diving board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe an ice-cream stand too...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T09:50:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha, a friend of mine and me, we had the same idea this weekend. we were testing boat designs (stock and firespitter) and the trip from the runway was really annoying (firespitter\u0027s \u0022start in water\u0022 didn\u0027t work somehow).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a drydock, pier and dedicated floating/aquadynamic parts would be a great addition to the game. but perhaps better as a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egameplay like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022hm, my capsule with science and crew weights 6 t and displaces 3 t.
