After adding more struts, I realized that I forgot to revert to spaceplane hangar. Normally, this is no problem, but when you have around 50 fuel tanks floating around, littering the KCS beach, it will take away some FPS, not to mention how annoying it is. But when I\u00A0tried to recover them from the KSC, I had to do it one by one, making it a very tedious project. What I propose is this, when in the KSC, you can left click and drag to select multiple craft in the same area, allowing you to recover them all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RZrX7AW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RZrX7AW.png\u0022\u003E(artist\u0027s rendition)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there is an easier way to do it, let me know, but I think this should be in the stock game.
