I have to exit all the way to the Tracking Station, select my flight, and select \u0022Recover\u0022. It just takes an unnecessary amount of work when that \u0027Recover\u0027 button could be added to the pause menu (if you\u0027re within range of KSC, of course). I\u0027d be fine with keeping the \u0027Terminate\u0027 option in the Tracking Station only as a precaution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing: Reverting. Why am I only able to revert at that very moment when I mess up, and not at any other time (in terms of exiting to the Space Center or Tracking Station)? I\u0027ve already accidentally gone to KSC without reverting anything (by leaning forward and my midsection clicking my trackpad) and ended up losing the kerbals involved. I think the whole idea of reverting is flawed in this way. Why should you be allowed to do this in Career mode, anyway? If we want to keep it, why allow it only immediately after crashing? Why should the whole death-of-kerbals thing matter in Sandbox mode? (I am unsure if the kerbals will eventually respawn or not.
