And I know that my ship is not too far from that. But I cannot visualize it in any way. I\u0027m shooting blind. Sometimes I find a close approach. it says something like 5 million km. then i fiddle a bit with the manuever. and i gradually reduce that until... it disappears. and get replaced by another close approach that\u0027s bound to happen in 25 years, at tens of millions of km. I keep getting \u0022close approach\u0022 markers at the farthest points from the nodes, where I cannot possibly get an approach. And I\u0027m growing quite angry at it. this has nothing to do with skill, it\u0027s a limitation in the game\u0027s ability to give informations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I conceived an easy solution: the ability to set up where you want your close approach. So I would be able to point on eeloo at the orbital node and say \u0022I want to have an approach here\u0022, and then the game will always show me the closest approach there, it will show me how close I am to hitting eeloo on the node. It would show where my ship would be when eeloo is in the chosen position. perhaps a nice time interval, \u0022give me the closest approach in a time window between 3 years 300 days and 4 years 100 days from now\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat can\u0027t be too hard to implement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IanCanberra","CreatedById":176895,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-12T07:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you use Mech Jeb there is the editor.

For simple orbital geometry this is sufficient, but you appear to have found one of the cases where it is not (planning a direct transfer from kerbin to Moho is another one). Fortunately, there is a workaround, not altogether unlike the solution you have described.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen placing maneuver nodes, the closest approach algorithm starts searching from the time of the final node in the plan. If you know approximately when your intercept will be, you can place an empty node at that time, and the closest approach indicator will snap to the time of the node, or the next minimum distance after it (usually the former, in my experience). From here, you can do a two-step dance;\u00A0tweaking the burn vector slightly and adjusting the time of the dummy node\u00A0until you achieve an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-14T18:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s so hard to program a predictor (they\u0027ve tried before.
