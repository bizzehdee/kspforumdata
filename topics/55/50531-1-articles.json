As well as a changelog to keep track of the changes and development. It\u0027s put in into the vessel\u0027s file (like Doxygen does) because this way the vessel always carries it\u0027s information with it. Sadly the vessel description field is limited to 1000 characters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you increase the size of a vessel\u0027s description field?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am sure no-one is going to write an entire book in those fields*, but it\u0027s - at least for me - the only way to make notes about vessels and missions without the use of mods. This way the notes and informations are intrinsically tied to the vessel and can\u0027t be lost without loosing the vessel itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E*I know what\u0027s inevitable now. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
