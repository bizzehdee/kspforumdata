I am a fan of KSP, as I am sure most of everyone else here is. Recent updates have brought a lot of new features that I enjoy; however, I am really looking forward to Multiplayer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to put your Multiplayer ideas on this topic, I will be listing mine below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpace Race: (Max of 16 players)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESetup:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach player chooses:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. A flag and name for their space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A color for the accents of\u00A0their kerbal\u0027s suit and/or color of suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

Game Moderator/Owner of the server decides normal game options when they make the server, and get to choose the max amount of players they want on their server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGame:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMostly the same as singleplayer, except you are competing with other players for the max amount of science (First to make a discovery gets the max amount, second gets less, third gets even less, ect.), world first milestones, and achievements like beating the other players\u00A0to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove that competing players can sabotage others or make alliances. Rockets can be used to destroy players \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s or vessels, and force them to declare bankruptcy (a loss in multiplayer). Players can also share plans for rockets, money, and kerbals. If they really want to they can declare\u00A0another person an ally, or go to war with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETime Warp:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis essentially is the hardest part of designing Multiplayer, and there is no perfect option for time warp shared with multiple people, so I have a few suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. There is a max amount of timewarp given for each play session. (Ex. everyone has 50 days to work with during this play session.) at the end of the max amount, a player will be told that all current missions are\u00A0saved, and then have the option to log out or to spectate other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. At the end of a play session, everyone\u0027s time syncs up to the person who has used the most timewarp. A notification is displayed as you log out describing how far ahead you will skip. (A game moderator can decide whether or not the time a player has skipped ahead is unreasonable and talk to the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. (Not my idea) Lowest time warp is used. (Ex: P1 - 4x, P2- 10x = 4x is used across the entire server)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. (Suggested by\u00A0mattinoz) Various zones or spheres of influence have a fixed warp that is higher where space is emptier. Player can slow down from warp back to normal time but only for a fixed period after which the server forces them back to warp \u002B syncing warp to catch up with the timeline of the sphere. That way no one can get \u0022physically\u0022 in front of the another player unless they fly faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOthers:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. No two players can have the same color, flag, or name for their agency on a server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. The list of contracts are global, everyone has access to the same list, and once one is taken by another player, it is not available anymore unless it is declined/discarded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Mods are allowed,\u00A0but only ones that are agreed on by the moderator of a server.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am open to other suggestions, as well as ways people think I can improve my ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-07T14:59:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/07/2017 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by AstroRisen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efound new time warp idea\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-07T05:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTimewarp option 4 could be workable for a space race.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- various zones or spheres of influence have a fixed warp that is higher where space is emptier.
