However this has brought to light a problem which I am fairly sure that you guys would never really anticipated in that the game is incredibly hard for little kids. \n\nThus I would like to suggest to either modders who might like to do something kid friendly or even to the developers proper to make what is essentially a game mode that is playable by a smart tech-savvy 3 year old. Simple one-click mouse stuff with bright colours, pre-planned missions that you can\u0027t really fail unless you really screw up and an over-the-top UI tutorial all designed in such a way so as to allow a generation of prospective kerbanauts to enjoy the game without them getting upset because of the amazing level of complexity that you have in the game.\n\nI also think that it might be very helpful as well to first time players too."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T08:14:37Z","Content":"I suggested something once that would fit in well with this - an Unkillable Kerbals feature.\n\nWhen a Kerbal hits the ground, they just bounce, then stand up, brush themselves off and get back to work.\n\nWhen a manned capsule hits the ground, the Kerbals are ejected, then bounce and stand back up."},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T09:45:59Z","Content":"Not a bad idea at all.
