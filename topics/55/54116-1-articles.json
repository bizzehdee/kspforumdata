I\u0027m not here to talk about what persistent world means, but the games referenced gives me an idea of how career mode can be structured. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Space Program, in my opinion, is a construction and management simulation at its core. Other games of similar nature (which are not quite Simcity but screw it, I\u0027m using them as examples) include Tropico, Zoo Tycoon, Theme Park, Age of Empires etc., and in them, most new missions in campaign/story mode basically goes like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You start off in a mostly empty world, devoid of any sign of the previous world you played in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Most of the tech/building/perks are locked, even if you\u0027ve unlocked them in a previous scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Similar to above, you start with very little resources, no matter how much you amass previously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You\u0027re free to build however you want, use any strategy you like, but there\u0027s a specific requirement (and sometimes restriction) for finishing that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\u0027s career mode could work like that; you start off every mission in a clean solar system, lowest tech, no science nor reputation/prestige, very little money, and you basically build your space program from the ground up every time. Every mission is basically a chapter of the overall story; from the humble beginning of Kerbal Space Program, to its growth, the turmoil, the rise, whatever, and culminating in the final chapters requiring your full knowledge and skill of rocket science to finish. Of course, re-earning science to unlock things you have previously unlocked may sound ridiculous, but so does amassing 500 citizen/visitors to unlock a large toilet or something every time, and it worked just fine for those kind of games. It won\u0027t be \u0027career\u0027 per se (maybe another mode?), and it may have to remove or limit some add-on functionality to work, but I think it fits very good with the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-23T16:48:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2013 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Algiark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-23T17:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Algiark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Algiark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI prefer the Dwarf Fortress or Minecraft model, where you don\u0027t have any specific \u0022missions\u0022 or developer-set goals (but instead make your own), but overall I think the devs are going for a structure of some sort along with a progression for each new save.
