I don\u0027t want to delete old designs because I never know when I might want to pull something off-the-shelf from yesteryear and give it a slight modification vs. doing a re-design.

Send those historic ships off to the museum and if you ever need it back on the roster, call it back into circulation. Basically, this is just an archive function, so I can de-clutter my active list of ships, without the permanency of delete. Bonus: Museum archive ships from Career are available to import into Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Modders can go on to enhance the Kerbal Space Museum with prestige earning, social media design sharing, and community ranking, etc. (Kids, this is the ship that first landed on the Mun in under 7 days elapsed!!
