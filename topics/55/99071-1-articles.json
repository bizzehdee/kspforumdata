I decided to load an autosave. I don\u0027t normally use autosaves, but it\u0027s been a tough day and I wasn\u0027t prepared to repeat the entire mission. I had assumed the game autosaves whenever entering a new SOI or moving into a sub-orbital trajectory - it seems to do this some of the time but not all of the time. It loaded up an autosave from several weeks ago, undoing a signifiicant amount of progress. As soon as it loaded up this save I immediately Ctrl-Alt-del\u0027d out and terminated the program but it was too late. My save is gone, i\u0027ve checked. I particularly miss the space station I constructed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestions are these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Auto-save should be regular and more consistent - every time you enter a new SOI or enter/leave a sub-orbital trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Multiple stored Auto-saves. About 5 should be plenty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Give the dates (both real world and in-game) and number of active missions in the selectable save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese features should provide enough redundancy that a mistake like the one I made would be easily recovered from. It\u0027s also a pretty common feature in most modern games that feature a save system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T01:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found between Auto Create Persistence File Backup \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71624\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/71624\u003C/a\u003E - save every game exit and Kerbal Alarm clock \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786\u003C/a\u003E that (I think) backs up when you switch craft through the addon - I have plenty of backups.
