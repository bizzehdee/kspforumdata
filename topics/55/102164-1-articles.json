I think at a certain point in career mode you should be able to unlock a gravity test chamber. Basically a VAB with a gravity slider. Or You could unlock lower gravity and atmospheric settings in stages. \n\nThe US Air Force employs atmospheric test hangars and to me this just makes sense. I get annoyed having to basically test everything on mission in space. \n\nI understand F12 allows gravity hack, but i don\u0027t think any player should have to use F12 just to test designs."},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:11:37Z","Content":"The only problem is that there is no real-world analogue for a Gravity Chamber.

In other words, no amount of handwavium or \u0022lolitsmagic\u0022 would be able to justify the creation of an anti-gravity chamber - if they did have such a chamber or the technology to nullify gravity, why would they even need rockets to fly to space in the first place?\n\nWhat I tend to do is to test my designs in a separate sandbox savegame with Hyperedit, and then move the craft file to my official science/career savegame once I\u0027m happy it would perform as intended."},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei","CreatedById":139058,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:44:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just find as a \\*game\\* it is very frustrating to have to abuse quick-load or the dang debug panel just to test your new design that seems more immersion breaking than a gravity test lab in a video game with little green men.\n\nWe don\u0027t have \u0022gravity chambers\u0022 IRL either. You\u0027ll just have to fly it to orbit to test it (I recommend planning it properly in advance to not have to do this so many times) like NASA also has to if they want to do zero gravity tests...\n\nOther option is to just play KSP as a \u0022game\u0022 as you say. For that you already have a way to essentially use \u0022zero-G chamber\u0022 it\u0027s called F12-button. So just use it as a gravity chamber or do \u0022real\u0022 tests on LKO... Why is debug panel so bad for you? If you want to use it\u0027s features (zero-G or anything else) just do so. If you don\u0027t want to then don\u0027t. Simple.

But I don\u0027t rly like a whole test chamber. I like the moment of surprise and the whole experience of adventure/exploration. Real space agencies had/have no idea what the exact characteristics of an enviroment are before they send a mission over there and determine why certain parts behave unexpected.\n\nexamples: nobody knew if a heavy craft might sink in the dust on the moon. That was a concern during the apollo aera. They were pretty sure that nothing bad was going to happen though.\n\nVenus is another example. The thick atmosphere made it rly hard to get a clear idea of what the lower atmosphere and surface would actually be like.\n\naside crom that, I usually test my landers right on the launch pad to find out if they fly straight and the laders deploy. The rest is guestimation and the use of a delta-v map. Testing is an Import part of mission preparation, but after a certain amount of tests I just have to go fof it and hope for the best. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn\u0027t.
