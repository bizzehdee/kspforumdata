But usually while I\u0027m doing some wizardry with the node, I will forget where the throttle was, so the estimated burn time number is typically useless for me, and I have to do the math by hand (ugh).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad should add a small pip, or some other GUI element to show you where the throttle was right before you last hit \u0027X\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
