First, and of least importance, realism - on Earth science tells us more about the Universe, how to predict it\u0027s workings and how to get out there; on Kerbin science merely concerns itself with the parts we can use to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and more important reason is that it ramps the feature set up for new players in addition to the part catalogue. This avoids too daunting an initial experience, whilst gradually introducing players to advanced tools for even greater adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, it gives a reason for space infrastructure. At present, if you send a probe to gather Duna orbit science and return it to Kerbin, there\u0027s absolutely no reason to ever send another mission to put a satellite around Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA case in point would be delta-v calculations. Squad have said (rightly in my view) that they prefer the trial and error approach that not having a delta-v calculator encourages. Failure should always be fun, and in KSP, failure is often more fun than success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, whilst trial and error will get you into orbit, will see you land on the Mun, and will see your second rescue mission save your intrepid first pioneer, I\u0027d argue it\u0027s largely impossible to design, say, a multi part Jool tour, or a grand tour, or an Eve return craft without a delta-v calculator. Either you sit down for minutes/hours with a notepad and Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation, you download a mod, you repeatedly massively under or over estimate craft design, or you simply don\u0027t go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhat if the process of say, landing on the Mun, or getting a couple of satellites in orbit gave your little green scientists the experience and knowledge required to better calculate \u0026amp; predict rocket behaviour such that they can now calculate delta-v of a craft as it\u0027s designed? \u003Cstrong\u003EFeature unlocked! Basic delta-v calculator appears in design buildings.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELanding a probe equipped with a graviton sensor and/or atmospheric sensor on a planet/moon could give the built in delta-v calculator the knowledge of approximate delta-v \u0026amp; thrust to take off/land from that given body. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022It looks like you\u0027re designing a Dres lander - we\u0027ve landed a probe there! We now know it\u0027ll take approximately X delta-v to take off/land\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E. This allows for the initial visit to still retain some of that trial and error approach, but gives appropriate tools for subsequent more ambitious visits.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaintaining a satellite or two around a given body (perhaps one equipped with particular science gear, eg graviton sensor) could allow top Kerbin minds to better predict orbital paths. \u003Cstrong\u003EFeature unlocked! Approximate launch window costs are now displayed in the tracking centre for that body.\u003C/strong\u003E Finally a reason to maintain satellites rather than as a mere one-shot science grind! Again, the first couple of visits you didn\u0027t know much about launch windows, you used trial and error, which was fun - but now you\u0027re able to better predict optimum launch windows for your future missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a big fan of trial and error. It\u0027s fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s effectively impossible to visit some of the more exotic locales or undertake ambitious tours without knowing what the current planetary alignment will do to your launch window costs, roughly how much it\u0027ll take to get there, land, take off \u0026amp; get back, and what the individual stages of your current craft is capable of. We currently gather all this knowledge either from external sources or we download a mod or two (or we painstakingly work it all out with a notepad, I\u0027m discounting that as, for the majority, \u003Cem\u003Enot fun\u003C/em\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELighter, simpler, missions which can be trial \u0026amp; error\u0027d open up that knowledge for more ambitious future missions, keeping knowledge in the game rather than alt-tabbed, and introducing it at the appropriate time. It also gives purpose to maintaining permanent space infrastructure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
