This can give us a reason to do manned missions instead of probed ones, since we can simply perform the experiments where we wish to, collect them, discard the science part and go back home with the results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second suggestion is in regard to antennae, to have some purpose in keeping them open, make them passively produce science while they\u0027re extended, at the cost of electricity(or not), to help prevent farming of science through this method, make the quantity of science produced by it exponentially decrease, so it never stops giving out science, but it very quickly starts to do it a lot slower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
