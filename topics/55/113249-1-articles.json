There\u0027s no way to move through the menus faster, and all I want to do is get back to what I was doing when I left.\n\nThis is a two-part request:\n\n1. An option in the settings menu to disable menu animations.\n\n2. A \u0022Resume Last\u0022 option. This would immediately place me at the KSC screen for the last persistent save that I had been playing."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T21:06:06Z","Content":"What menu animations are you even talking about ? If you are talking about the main starting menu.... You only need to watch them once, and they are half a second long each. there are literally 3 buttons to click to \u0022resume last\u0022 : start game-\u003Esaved-\u003Esave.\n\nIs it \\*that\\* annoying for you ?\n\ni\u0027d rather want squad not to lose time to implement that kind of useless feature that would only have an effect on the start menu.
