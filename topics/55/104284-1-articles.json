I prefer that to having to complete a bunch of contracts to collect funds. The next time I start a new game it will likely be a Science game rather than a Career game.

Allow the player to pick and choose which features to include, and then allow the usual difficulty settings after the initial choices are made. This would allow for the most flexibility. Mix and match and take only the features you care about. You could have funds \u002B contracts, but skip upgradable buildings."}]}
