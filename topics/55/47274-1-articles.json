All you have is a flat compass. After first flights with a normal plane like thing (maybe even after just getting it some feet high of the ground) you get enough research points to get a real navball. The next research points give you better items again to explorer space. After the first few points from there, you get the maneuvers feature which is currently standard. This could go as far as (I know we are not supposed to suggest it) an autopilot which gets better by training it with maneuvers like starting, orbiting, landing in different difficulties, docking and so on. Not just \u0022plop, there you go with the autopilot\u0022, but you have to actually train it to know moves and train it more to improve them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, back to the first few parts of the Idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Techtree without parts could look like something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompass -\u0026gt; Nav-Ball -\u0026gt; Maneuver-Ring -\u0026gt;Targetting of Moons/Planets -\u0026gt; Targetting of Kerb-Made Vesels -\u0026gt; Docking Cam -\u0026gt; Improved SAS -\u0026gt; Improved RCS -\u0026gt; Improved Maneuver-Ring (you can enter numbers and don\u0027t just have to pull it) -\u0026gt; Autopilot which can start and get the Rocket it was first launched with into Orbit with a failure rate of 50% (every successfull orbit will decrease the failure rate) -\u0026gt; Unlock more and more autopilot possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you like the Idea?
