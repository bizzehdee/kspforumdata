This happens whether the engines are single-nozzle designs (most stock engines), or multiple-nozzle ones (LFB, KS-25 cluster, RAPIER). As a result, a heavy rocket at launch will respond predictably when turning around, but almost never actually rolling when commanded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder, is it difficult to make Mainsails at opposite sides of a rocket gimbal themselves in opposition to their counterparts in order to roll the rocket?
