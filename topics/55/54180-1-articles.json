Capacity for tanks and thrust for engines for example. This makes a lot of the parts redundant.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImplementing a new size means adding a lot of parts which are basicaly already there, just not in the right configuration.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to have configurable parts. This means that, for example, you can choose a \u0022RT-10 Solid Fuel Booster\u0022 and configure it to your needs setting some parameters like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDiameter, where you can choose from the available sizes \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELength, where you again can choose from the available sizes and which increases the fuel capacity and length of the tank of course\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELifting capability, where you can choose between \u0022Heavy Lifter\u0022 which has a high thrust and short burning time, \u0022Standard\u0022 and \u0022Endurance\u0022 with lower thrust but longer burning time.

There are plugins which you can launch fuel tanks empty.
