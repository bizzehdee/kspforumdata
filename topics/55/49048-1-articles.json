Don\u0027t get me wrong I know is the first step towards a much much bigger career mode but, will it be time-based experiments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is for example, deploy a satellite with an experiment module and begin experimenting once in orbit, but the module should consume electricy, depending on the type of experiment you\u0027re conducting. That\u0027s my other idea, be able to choose the science field you want to experiment, physics, chemistry, astronomy, science materials, electronics, etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is my suggestion to the developers. I don\u0027t know if they already had thought about it or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T3chnic","CreatedById":83263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T22:16:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this, another reason for electricity use and perhaps a Science experiment where you would need to obtain some resources from other planets that are used in some of the experiments!
