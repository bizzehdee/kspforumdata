Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to be able to reset your action groups and reassign them midflight?

Not sure what would be better, being able to change this in-flight, or maybe in the tracking station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince in-flight you would have the advantage that you are already looking at the ship, however it might be rotating, which might make it harder to select parts. But in the action-group mode you could also lock the orientation of the camera to the ship, just like chasecam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut managing action groups in the tracking station would also be a possibility I think. I do think that it would be useful to see a model of the vessel when selecting it in the tracking station (might also prevent loading the wrong one). And this way you can manage all your vessels from the same spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: not sure if anyone has already made a post/request for this, but since it is very small, I thought I would added here as well: adding resources levels in the info bar (on the wiki it is called Knowledge Base) so liquid fuel, oxidizer, electricity, monopropellent, xenon gas. Since this can also be viewed in the tracking station, so this would allow you to find vessels which need refueling very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T01:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is suggested quite often, and for good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll too often people building orbital stations will have a mismatch in their action groups leading to unpredictable behavior and ruined craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpySat1","CreatedById":74355,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-19T18:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would super love this feature... especially that each time the game updates, sometimes it seems to override my action groups I already set for my projects in orbit or on the mun.
