And See if part Y can survive G-forces of over Z."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T21:08:48Z","Content":"Seems to me like the \u0022provide X acceleration to part Y\u0022 contract could most easily be fulfilled by building a centrifuge. Long horizontal girder with horizontal solid boosters on either end pointed in opposite directions, and just enough vertical thrust to get it a few hundred meters up... then activate the solid boosters and watch your navball go crazy.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOne neat thing I can see about contracts that require a certain temperature or a certain acceleration: it would make thermometers and accelerometers a lot more important!"}]}
