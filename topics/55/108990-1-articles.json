I noticed last night all my active and completed contracts disappeared. I thought it might have something to do with how I was reverting a lot of flights to the assembly building and launch (trying to design and test a base building system). Unfortunately, it sounds like crashing (in your case) and reverting (in my case) is unrelated to the bug since neither is common to both cases. I hope to recover at least some contracts via editing the save file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
