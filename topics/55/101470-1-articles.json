Other tweaks include turning off sun tracking for solar panels, torque of SAS wheels, etc.\n\nI usually side step the radial decoupler bug by turning the ejection force to 0 and using sepratrons to push a spent booster away."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T19:39:30Z","Content":"You could just use a docking port instead, as they work just as well.
