It\u0027s a just a list displayer, small, and the thumbnails are tiny, it always confuse me...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, keep your craft in order with good names help a lot, but you\u0027ll eventually end up with 50 or more files, all mixed together without any\u00A0criterion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that\u00A0the load craft GUI will make good use\u00A0of a custom folders system!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrouping craft file into folders will help a lot organize a big number of craft files...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if you simply create folders for tie a craft to his prototypes\u00A0you spend a lot less time searching for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you can group the folder into other folders by\u00A0mission or craft purpose, and so on, generating and organized tree of craft files!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is needed really badly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, i would love to see a Player\u00A0folder to save my most used crafts... any time i need some of my most used crafts, i need to go to the folder outgame at\u00A0one of my other career or sandbox\u00A0save and copy them into my new save or keep the whole mass of files into the stock craft folder, creating an even bigger mess... it\u0027s a really bad system to manage and share files...
