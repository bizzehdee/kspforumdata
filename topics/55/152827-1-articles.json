I had an idea that it would be pretty neat to have the option to add sub classes to Kerbals. So each kerbal could have 2 duties. I envision something like once a kerbal has reached level 1 or 2 in there respective field they could choose a sub class which would not level but add that functionality to there repertoire. For instance if a pilot had a sub class of scientist he would be able to reset experiments and operate them outside the craft. However he would not give mobile processing labs any boost in science. Another example would be if a scientist had a sub class of pilot he would be able to hold stability and that is it, no prograde/retrograde hold or any other node hold nor would he have control of the craft without communications.\u00A0Basically the sub class would be the regular profession as if it were un-leveled with a few exceptions. let me know what you think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-leafy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T16:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been trying to find a plugin modder willing to do the just about same thing, \u00A0but a little more in depth for a while now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://stockvisualmods.com/careerhub/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://stockvisualmods.com/careerhub/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you want is possible by just editing a config in your squad folder.

Really, and this is anathema to many, kerbals should be able to function autonomously.
