So why are we using black and white icons? Is this a salute to the golden age of television or something?

I generally try to keep my suggestions to ideas that seem profoundly simple to implement. At least as much as I can, given my limited understanding of coding."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T10:53:05Z","Content":"I don\u0027t actually mind icons being black and white. They stand out really nicely in the colorful background that is Kerbin\u0027s surface. They could be changed a tad, though. Especially the capsule one to something looking more like Apollo\u0027s CSM. Also a new icon for spaceplanes would be cool to have."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T10:56:34Z","Content":"You don\u0027t have a hard time finding the ship you\u0027re looking for when they are all the same color?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T11:06:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You don\u0027t have a hard time finding the ship you\u0027re looking for when they are all the same color?\n\nNope!"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T11:48:05Z","Content":"I also think they are ok as-is. White gives good contrast against most of the possible backgrounds, coloured would greatly increase the instances of them blending into the background.\n\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s broken, and do not think it should be fixed. I don\u0027t think coloured icons would offer any improvement. If anything is changed, please include an option to use white-only icons."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:02:02Z","Content":"I agree with Murph and Veeltch.

Over the last year they have been removing color from some icons, causing consternation among those used to the old icons. Their usability studies show that players are able to identify icons faster by shape alone, than when color is added. That\u0027s not to say color isn\u0027t helpful... it\u0027s just proven to be \u0022less helpful\u0022 than distinctive shapes. (And so, they are also going back and forth with players over the shapes, lol.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T16:04:05Z","Content":"I like the current icons, they look nice, clean, and finished. We need one for planes though. Re: thumbnails, I\u0027m not sure how well the 128x128 (or whatever) ship thumbnails would translate to a 32x32 (at best) icon."}]}
