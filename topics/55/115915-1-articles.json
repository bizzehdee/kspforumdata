Flowmode Tweakable","CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:43:59Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T17:43:59Z","Content":"Having just gone through a bit of exploration regarding how Fuel Cells operate in the game I have a few observations and a suggestion:\n\nTypically, in real life a Fuel Cell is a self contained device with fuel and generator in one. It consumes its internal resources and outputs electrical power and water (assuming its an oxygen and Hydrogen unit).\n\nIn KSP we obviously are not dealing with H and 0 but some other magical propellent mixture - but regardless it assumes that \u0022burning\u0022 it in the right mechanism can generate electrical output.\n\nI\u0027m OK with that. Its a game-ified solution that works ok in my opinion.\n\nWhat doesn\u0027t work for me is that regardless of where you place a fuel cell, it will consume propellent mixture from the farthest reaches of your vessel - including the inner tanks of a complex landing craft. And what\u0027s worse is that there is no way to regulate it or control where the fuel cell device draws its fuel.\n\nSo after exploring the \u0022Flowmode\u0022 variable, I have discovered that a minor change in the Fuel cell part config will allow a player to either use fuel cells as the currently work AND if desired (by placing a crossfeed blocking part in the correct place) you can create an isolated fuel cell which once it consumes its allocated fuel, will not consume any fuel from the vessel (of course you can transfer fuel to get it going again).\n\nThe change I have tested relates to the Flowmode setting for LF and Oxidiser resources in the Fuelcell cfg file.\n\n**Specifically, Changing flowmode from \u0022STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW\u0022 to \u0022STACK\\_PRIORITY\\_SEARCH\u0022 allows this type of behaviour.**\n\nMy suggestion to the DEVs is to make this change stock.\n\nAlternatively, if they added a tweakable setting which allowed the user to switch flowmode for a fuel cell part in game, that would be completely and totally awesome.\n\nSure, I could be off-base here, but thanks for listening.\n\nCheers,\n\nW.\n\nPS\u003E yes and for the record I know USI has fuel cells - very nice. I\u0027m talking here about a stock part which would benefit from a reasonable and very very very minor change.\n\nPPS\u003E Thanks to you who know who you are for contributing to my exploration in another thread!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T16:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator**\n  \nClarifications"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T05:38:35Z","Content":"Hmmm perhaps a bit too esoteric for most.

THe fuel flow logic change with jet engines is completely whack to the point of RAPIERs ignoring decouplers (I logged this as a bug in unmodded support). It only makes sense the fuel cells should obey more understandable fuel flow logic.

Sierra mentions above concerning Engines, YES... I see it is all related.\n\nI think a tweakable is definitely a correct \u0022Fix\u0022 to this.\n\nA player should be a allowed to select \u0022As Designed\u0022 or \u0022Default/Balanced\u0022 for flowmode for any part which consumes fuel. \n\n**\u0022Default\u0022 or \u0022Balanced\u0022** (Call it what you like) would cause the part to follow the flowmode which the devs seem to like (flowmode = STAGE\\_PRIORITY\\_FLOW)\n\n**\u0022As Designed\u0022** would give the player the ability to influence fuel flow and consumption using fuel lines and crossfeed capabilities (flowmode = STACK\\_PRIORITY\\_SEARCH).\n\nI think this an issue which the Devs may have tried to do what they thought was the right thing, but they just didn\u0027t (have/take the time to) think it through completely. With this tweakable, a player could choose which parts behave in what manner - and more importantly it increases the creative options available.\n\n**\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E\u003E DEVS: If you make this change then everyone will likely be satisfied. \u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C\u003C**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T16:45:34Z","Content":"I think I can come up with a simple MM patch.
