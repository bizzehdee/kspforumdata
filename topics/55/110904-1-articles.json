(ie: Swept wing but double length, Or 2 by 1 wing but at 4 by 2) \n\nI dunno about anyone else but this would knock about 60% of my part count off.\n\nAlso larger fuel tanks.\n\nThe MK2 fuel tanks as an example, you have a half version and a full version. How about a double length version. (Same with the mono propellant tanks and jet fuel tanks.\n\nJust simple things like that would help lower the part count significantly.\n\nI am aware the devs are porting over to unity 5 (Witch will take a fair amount of time) But I suspect sommin like the above would only take a day or so to do ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).\n\nJust my thoughts, See you in space (In on the ground in bits ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T15:43:11Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums!\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this will help, but there is a mod named TweakScale, a quick Google search should find it.

If they could provide at least parts 4x size of the current - it\u0027d be a noticeable, positive difference."}]}
