For all of the parts available for thrust and flight and science, we still have only two dedicated power generators available. Solar Panels and Radioisotope Thermal Generators. This feels lacking, as spaceships from the dawn of space have had power generation that falls under neither category.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Fuel Cells - Definitely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Cells make power by combining the fuel and oxydizer. It would be an excellent early tech power system, which would slowly consume a little fuel and oxydizer to make a little power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Engine Generator - Maybe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is technically feasible, if one can make an engine that works in space (feed fuel and oxydizer and manage the vaccum backpressure problem) for more power in early tech. Also would mean you can say you have a diesel punk spaceship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Nuclear Reactor - The Big Daddy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear Reactor in space?

Fuel Cells or Engine Generators should be the first kind of dedicated power generators, not solar panels. If Kerbals are discovering electricity from rocket engines, they should be devising the first power generators from engines then, not solar power, which should be higher up on the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, engine type generators use fuel to generate power - as long as you have the fuel, you will have power. It will use a very small amount compared to rocket engines, but nonetheless, you don\u0027t have to deal with the dark side of the planet or having the colossal weight and parts count of an RTG corncob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the same logic, we do not need RAPIER engine, or RCS engines, or monoprop engines, or a billion different parts for planes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T00:31:47Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 12:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Blaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T00:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have the second one in a way.
