I hope these two ideas will be considered for inclusion in the new framework.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) At all times, automatically fill any empty science \u0022slot\u0022 with any first-time measurement as it becomes available\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see this being implemented as a task on a ~10s counter, or once per time-warp step above 10x timewarp, that cycles through all available science options and automatically fires any collections as long as A) the science \u0022slot\u0022 is currently empty, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the current biome has not yet been sampled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the current model, the player can always discard the automatically collected science and take another biome measurement so this is a no-brainer: it\u0027s always the right thing to do, the only question is whether the player knows enough/remembers to do it. If the 0.23 model makes it impossible to discard and repeat measurements, this wouldn\u0027t work - maybe a prompt instead? Maybe a config option to make it auto, prompt, or do nothing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking no-brainer collection automatic (or prompting for it) also serves as an intro to new players who may not know how many biomes there are, or how many options they have for science collection - on their very first rocket launch every instrument would fire immediately on the pad, letting them know exactly what their craft can do, and also that there is value on doing science on Kerbin itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Add a \u0022Probe Mode\u0022 toggle that does the above whenever there is still value in sampling the current biome (not just first sample), and also enables auto-transmission of the data.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know the transmission model will change in 0.23, but I assume there will still be some value to transmissions. Hopefully the small, data-only instruments (thermometer, seismic, gravioli) will get 100% from transmission, as they are just sending numbers anyway. But that remains to be seen, and isn\u0027t really the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, a \u0022Probe mode\u0022 would allow players to go hands-free on science and removes a lot of redundant clicking without changing anything else about the game mechanics. Data rate is still limited by electrical charge, you still have to pilot your craft to the right spots, this would really just automate the tedium of clicking through 10 \u0022collect-transmit-recharge\u0022 cycles during a Jool flyby. It would also enable most probe Science to be done during timewarp - believe it or not, having to babysit Science collection by clicking your craft repeatedly in 5 locations for 10-minutes at x1 timewarp isn\u0027t very much fun. I\u0027d much rather blow through the flyby at 10x warp and actually enjoy the view for a minute or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if you agree, disagree, or have any similar ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T18:40:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NeilC\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UberFuber","CreatedById":90736,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:46:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDev answered this already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/66138708921/devnote-tuesday-the-leftover-candy-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/66138708921/devnote-tuesday-the-leftover-candy-edition\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/234-0-23-Update-News\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/234-0-23-Update-News\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnsure, endless repeating experiment is no longer possible (or at least pointless).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel like the current clicking grind that people are complaining about is because they are already trying to game the system by transmitting everything.
