For example if you set your focus to Duna in the orbit view you can click the info and parameter button on the right to learn about the celestial body. I think it would be neat if specific information like gravity, atmosphere, temperature, escape velocity, etc. had to be learned by sending a probe with the required modules to the planet and report its findings back to Kerbin. Basically things that Kerbals couldn\u0027t figure out from observations at Kerbin had to be learned this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be tied into the career mode/contracts as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this hasn\u0027t been suggested before and if it was I apologize. I did a basic search and checked the stickies but couldn\u0027t find anything similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T22:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds really cool, almost like *gasp!* actual science. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I think KSP would benefit a lot from that, so long as it was a career-mode only thing.

I think you could even expand on it and have Planets appear as question marks until you have visited. Once you have entered a sphere of influence make the planet and its moons visible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T01:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has actually been suggested before, but not seen it mentioned recently. I personally like the idea of discovering details about the planets this way, although I recall that there were quite a lot of people really anti this idea. I\u0027m not quite sure why though. Anyway, i\u0027d like to see it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
