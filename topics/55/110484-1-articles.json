Neither one requires a return, and they are basically the same dV.\n\nSo, what is needed is a system to allow the player to have more control over the direction and types of contracts.\n\n\\* First, would be turning the explore and flyby contracts into the auto-complete \u0022record\u0022 variety.\n\n\\* Second, would be re-using many of the UI elements of the research archives to make a more in depths contracts window.\n\nLet players click on the various bodies, and search contracts for each one. Maybe you\u0027ll need a certain amount of rep to have multiple bodies open for contracts at once.\n\nIe if rep \u003E or = to X, allow contract offers at Y celestial bodies at once.\n\nThen the player can select bodies for the \u0022program focus\u0022, and contracts at those bodies will be generated.\n\nThen, just as we have the ability to select biomes in the research UI, and view the research reports, perhaps we could select contract types:\n\nScience contracts (temp readings, grav scans, science data from.... etc)\n\nCommercial contracts (tourism, position a sat in orbit X, etc)\n\nInfrastructure contracts (construct surface base, orbital station, mine X ore, etc).\n\nLetting playes choose the focus of the contracts would go a long way towards making the experience better.\n\nI shouldn\u0027t have to hold off on sending a probe to eve (or forever lose the explore and flyby contracts), because the game determines I should explore Ike first.\n\nWe already have a UI that could be readily adapted for this purpose.\n\nAnyone agree?\n\nIs my suggestion unclear?"}]}
