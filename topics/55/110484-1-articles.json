Neither one requires a return, and they are basically the same dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what is needed is a system to allow the player to have more control over the direction and types of contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* First, would be turning the explore and flyby contracts into the auto-complete \u0022record\u0022 variety.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Second, would be re-using many of the UI elements of the research archives to make a more in depths contracts window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet players click on the various bodies, and search contracts for each one. Maybe you\u0027ll need a certain amount of rep to have multiple bodies open for contracts at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIe if rep \u0026gt; or = to X, allow contract offers at Y celestial bodies at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the player can select bodies for the \u0022program focus\u0022, and contracts at those bodies will be generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, just as we have the ability to select biomes in the research UI, and view the research reports, perhaps we could select contract types:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience contracts (temp readings, grav scans, science data from.... etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommercial contracts (tourism, position a sat in orbit X, etc)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfrastructure contracts (construct surface base, orbital station, mine X ore, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELetting playes choose the focus of the contracts would go a long way towards making the experience better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI shouldn\u0027t have to hold off on sending a probe to eve (or forever lose the explore and flyby contracts), because the game determines I should explore Ike first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a UI that could be readily adapted for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone agree?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs my suggestion unclear?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
