I\u0027ve never done so much math and not hated it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, the game on career mode still feels a little flat- it seems like adding a bit of personality to the game would really round it out. For instance, I just finished my first successful Mun landing and after the initial elation and safe return there was...... well nothing. A summary screen of science earned, money recovered and XP earned, and that\u0027s it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt all feels a bit, well Soviet. It would be nice to get a little *something*, in the form of *something* that shows how far you\u0027ve come. As Americans some of our greatest cultural achievements have come in the form of our space program, it would be nice to see something reflecting the elation of hordes of Kerbalkind in achieving extraordinary steps in space. Vanity statues and memorials spontaneously erected by jubilant masses maybe? Imagine a 100 foot tall Jebediah, forever capturing his fateful first step onto the Mun in gleaming iron for all eternity! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love this game, just feels like it needs a little rounding out, some flavor, because apparently neither my dog nor my girlfriend could honestly care about my Mun landing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T10:43:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELanguage check\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
