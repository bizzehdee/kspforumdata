I\u0027m stating that \u0022realism\u0022 is an invalid reason to claim that struts should remain as debris when an unrealistic aspect of the game is the reason the struts are even there in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:50:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shand\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shand\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand yes struts are realistic - in fact at the moment i think they still dont have mass, so they are OP. in RL if your current design of decoupler or tank joint isnt rigid enough you either design your own part* or use a series of rigid structural objects to reenforce the joint. the only difference is that in RL \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou can put these internally.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I highlighted in bold is exactly my point.

Normally it would be true that struts cannot become separate debris because one end or the other remains stuck to one side or the other of the break. The one and only exception to this has to do with, not how STRUTS work, but rather how separator rings work. When you have a separator ring (one of those blue things rather than the yellow ones) to break a stage, they run a routine to unglue themselves from EVERYTHING they\u0027re touching, and I mean EVERYTHING - not just the two halves of the ship on either side of the ring, but also anything attached to the sides of the ring - including struts. So the way it happens is this. If you have a strut that begins on a separator ring then:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFIRST, the two halves separate from each other, and only one side of the strut is preserved, the side attached to the ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT THEN, as part of detaching itself from everything the ring also detaches the struts from itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResult: The little strut nubs float away from the ring as separate debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while it\u0027s true that running the struts in the opposite direction fixes it, it\u0027s NOT because of a feature of struts but because of a feature of the separator ring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
