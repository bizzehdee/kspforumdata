And then doing experiments in kerbin orbit becomes unusefull but in the reality astronauts were doing experiments in space since 1960, of course ksp isn\u0027t the reality but i would like to be able to do more experiments in ksp orbit,, they shouldn\u0027t report a lot of science points maybe 10-15 points and they should take some time to be done, maybe 2-3 real life minutes, also I think that this experiments should get back to kerbin surface to get the science like in the ISS where the astronauts send half tonn of scientific material on the Dragon X capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPD: Sorry for my English I\u0027m from Spain\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T13:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion is that more science should be added when it is needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, all the science needed to uncover the whole tech tree can be found on Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus and you don\u0027t need any more science for anything. Yet. You don\u0027t need to go further, you don\u0027t even need to scan these completely, you can even do it with just Kerbin and Mun if you\u0027re thorough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
