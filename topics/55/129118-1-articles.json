Say\u00A0I have 2 saves, one save where I was experimenting for fun and finished up with (among a lot of other stuff) a pretty cool mining operation and\u00A0refueling station around Minmus, and another save for my Jool expedition, for which I have several probes already in the\u00A0Jool system. \u00A0I realise that my Jool mission could take advantage of my Minmus refueling station, but it can\u0027t because it exists in an alternate reality. \u00A0If i could copy the Minmus stuff into the Jool save (or vice-versa) then I could avoid needing to duplicate a lot of work I\u0027d already done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk... \u00A0 IRL space agencies, like NASA, have lots of different missions\u00A0and flights\u00A0on the go at any one time, some may be related to some others and some not. \u00A0But say NASA decided (or was ordered) to re-purpose one of its cluster of weather satellites for \u0027other purposes\u0027? Easy, after filling in the relevant documentation, they just hand over control to the guy in the secret \u0027other purposes\u00A0office\u0027. \u00A0Now in KSP I can\u0027t do that, because the \u0027other purposes\u00A0office\u0027 is effectively in a different dimension.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo. A way to copy individual flights to other saves and/or merge two saves into one could be quite handy in circumstances like this. \u00A0Obviously, there would need to be some \u0027rules\u0027 that deal with time differences etc as no two saves will be at the same point in time, but is it a viable option and does anyone else think it could be useful?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T18:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you want to port your minmus station, with orbital characteristics and all, to another save?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T18:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s no \u0022easy\u0022 facility as such, but you can move active ships from one save to another by editing the save file (persistent.sfs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen persistent.sfs and find the \u0022FLIGHTSTATE\u0022 line, beneath which there will be the version number and the UT (time) of the current save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that information look for \u0022VESSEL\u0022. Between the bracket following that and the corresponding closing bracket (indentation aligns, so it\u0027s easy enough to see where the block ends) is the information about an active vessel, including flight data and the part data and its corresponding action groups and modules. Copy that entire block from VESSEL { until the closing bracket into any other KSP save and your ship will (or should, mishaps permitting) be exactly where it was in the other save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust be aware that a saved ship from the persistent file is...er...quite long.

Just save the current vessel and its orbital parameters to a file, then load that up as a new vessel in the other save. Should be extremely simple, the hardest part would be providing an interface for it (I like the idea of just adding a button to the tracking station to \u0022export\u0022 a vessel and another to \u0022import\u0022 one). Handling where the vessel would be in time is already done by KSP: the orbital parameters give the orbit and the current location in the orbit is computed based on the current time (the joys of KSP\u0027s patched conics model, it\u0027s only a 1.5 body problem and is solved exactly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere might be issues with Kerbals, so they might have to not be transferred over.
