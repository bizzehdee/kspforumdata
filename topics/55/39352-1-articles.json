Then docking ports of any size could be added to those points and you could use the template on other craft to ensure alignment. Another suggestion which would be even better but more work would be to have an additional \u0022user\u0022 tab next to the science tab that let you drag and drop up to 5 assemblies (example) for use on other craft. You could build a docking port assembly or any other item, drag it to slot one in the user tab then open another craft and drag a copy of it out to that craft You could do a lot more than docking port assemblies this way. Pic demonstrates possible menu slots...I dont think a rendering of the item needs to be in each slot...maybe a small text pop up that\u0027s user defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1229.photobucket.com/albums/ee474/strokedmaro/menu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022menu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T09:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why they made the dockingport Sr, and it does it\u0027S intended job really well.
