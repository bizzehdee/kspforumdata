They\u0027re a fun way for experienced players to exploit physics to have fun. They\u0027re also the closest things stock players have to futuristic interstellar drives, like Alcubierre rings and such. The kraken even seems to be getting his own fandom due to this wonderful technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor this reason, it\u0027s kind of sad to see that kraken drives have been all but taken out of the game. The new blocked leg mechanic makes them impossible to clip and glitch, making kraken drives impossible to\u00A0create with them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, my simple request is to add a new landing leg/gear. One that doesn\u0027t break from stress and doesn\u0027t register when it\u0027s blocked. I know it\u0027s possible. It was in the experimentals for 1.1. It would make the game so much better though, because we could bring back kraken drives.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T01:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYEZ!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T12:31:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeliberately putting physics glitches \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C/em\u003E into the game because one of them happens to be a bit of exploity fun?
