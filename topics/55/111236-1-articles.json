There is an amazing discrepancy in part textures on low resolution. On IVA, you simply cannot read any of the instruments, and the navball is a guestimating tool. At the same time, the resolution of parts like the LV-T45 or Poodle is decent.\n\nWhat kind of creative solutions to this problem can you think of? I\u0027d suggest dots on the navball and decouplers to denote their respective important marks. I realize that this is a complicated problem, and does not affect everyone, but it is a problem nonetheless."}]}
