It would really be a good addition. But, that would be overpowered. Slap on a bunch of solar arrays and generators on and you are good to go. So, I have and idea how to fix that. There should be weaker engines and stronger engines that require a **LOT** of power. That is my idea for electric engines. I hope you like it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)!\n\nPs: I know that there are engines which use xenon gas and electricity, but my idea is electricity only engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T17:46:26Z","Content":"KSP is built around the concept of Newton\u0027s Third Law - aside from some minor quibbles about this or that, it\u0027s relatively close to actual physics.

Besides that, an electric-only space thruster would either break all interplanetary transfer burns forever, or be too weak to ever be useful (i.e. hour long burns at best) if you take game balance into account.\n\nThere could, I guess, be stuff like electrodynamic tethers or something, but that would be impossible to properly simulate with the way KSP\u0027s physics work.\n\nI would, however, like to suggest implementing some variety of ion/plasma engines a-la Nertea\u0027s Near Future Propulsion mod. Small thrusters, large thrusters, weak thrusters, strong thrusters! Xenon, Argon, Hydrogen! All the variety you could ever want, with very good stock-styled models and decent balance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T17:55:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 05:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sean Mirrsen**"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T18:45:34Z","Content":"I think that the reactor and some engine of KSPI would fit very nice"},{"CreatedByName":"wizzlebippi","CreatedById":85324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T19:41:40Z","Content":"What do you mean by electric engines?

This might be because ion drives sound like something out of a science fiction movie, so the name might not sit well with aerospace executives. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nSolar electric drive uses solar panels to provide power. The power output offered by the panels is quite small compared to their weight, leading to the situations we see with the KSP ion engine. If a more powerful electric drive were added to the game, players would need to add **very large** arrays of solar panels to their ships. The mass of these arrays would be considerable, leading to poor thrust to weight ratios and long burn times. Despite being heavy, the saving in fuel would lower the overall mass required, especially on high dV interplanetary transfers. This could make solar electric drives competitive with nuclear thermal rockets.\n\nAn alternative would be to use nuclear electric drive. This would be powered by a small nuclear reactor, which would weigh a lot less than the huge array of solar panels. The thrust to weight ratio would still be quite poor, but it would still be a considerable improvement over solar panels.\n\nIRL Electric drives such as VASIMR have been proposed as ways to speed astronauts through space to reduce their exposure to radiation and zero gravity. This all sounds fine until you start looking at how much electricity these things need! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T21:13:32Z","Content":"Haven\u0027t you heard of a K-drive... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIf you are talking about electric propellers then I completely agree! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIf you are talking about EM drives then no.
