By endgame, that was meant \u0022late career\u0022 (which in 2013 barely existed). They were talking about designing stuff that was only accessible at the late stages, not that there was an end-game condition. One could argue the ISRU is end-game content (which by the way was started around that time and postponed), so to answer the original question is you have it already.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T17:48:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 05:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-Bouw","CreatedById":21500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T17:45:50Z","Content":"Well, I don\u0027t like having my KSP end on me at any point, but it wouldn\u0027t be impossible to have some sort of epic mother of all missions to complete.\n\nOne that once you\u0027ve finished it leaves you hanging with the feeling: Wow!
