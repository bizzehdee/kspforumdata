Even hard difficulty in science mode has everyone start at 5 stars right away. This wasn\u0027t a thing that needed funds to unlock like the buildings, so I wonder why it\u0027s career only. At least the option to turn it on or off with a science mode save would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T00:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah that would be nice. There\u0027s really no reason not to have that if it\u0027s in Career mode - training astronauts doesn\u0027t cost funds or reputation, and their abilities have no impact on any resources except science in the case of scientists \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
