Right now, I don\u0027t really think it\u0027s very realistic to be able to balance an entire 500t\u002B ship on a single launch clamp without any sort of stress. A system could be implemented where physics is applied to the clamps, allowing them to stretch, bend, and break, as well as allowing them to share the load of heavier ships with other clamps. Different types of clamps could also be added for heavier/lighter weights with corresponding prices.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-FCI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
