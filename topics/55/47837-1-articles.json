This would help with the creation of shuttle crafts in addition to being able to launch payloads with an offset center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option that would require an update to the user interface would be an engine with a manually controlled change in angle.

However, new SAS tweaks in 0.22 allow for a much greater gimbal range with SAS enabled, so this should definitely be doable. I would love to see some stock engines with 10 or 15 \u002B/- deg gimbal range in a future update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
