This is a compilation of things I\u0027ve thought while playing the game, and watching others do. They wouldn\u0027t be difficult to implement (I think), and would change gameplay a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The plane landing gear are massless in-flight. Kinda cheaty, isn\u0027t it? People use it for eve ascent vehicles, and it doesn\u0027t make any sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The plane landing gear\u0027s lights consume no electricity. Why don\u0027t they?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The structural pylon doesn\u0027t fit with the rest of the parts. It\u0027s been ignored since .18, and should get a tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s extremely bendy, it doesn\u0027t use the new decoupler \u0022module\u0022 in the .cft (AFAIK), and it doesn\u0027t leave any \u0022debris\u0022 on the parent part after it\u0027s decoupled. Kinda weird, isn\u0027t it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) The new subassembly system is awesome, but kinda unorganized. In the old subassembly saver/loader, and the newer subassembly manager, we had \u0022folders\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool and logical to have these on the core system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I\u0027m creating a new space station, and want to save parts of it. I create a new folder called \u0022ss pieces\u0022 and save them there. When the construction is done, I can simply delete the folder and the subassembleis saved in it. Also, sub-folders would be nice too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) The \u0022Ant\u0022 and ion engines have no fuel \u0022bars\u0022. I see no particular reason for this, an it\u0027s kinda annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) The \u0022Oscar B\u0022 tank doesn\u0027t attach radially. Same as 5, is there a reason for this? I\u0027ve had to do some clever engineering to get it where I want, with no benefit. Especially part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) I\u0027m not saying \u0022Me wantz mor partz, BLERGH!\u0022, but the only 0.675m fuel tank is the oscar B. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStacks made of these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA- Are bendy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB- Look ugly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC- Are FPS killers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe really need more \u0022small\u0022 sized fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I know I can simply rescale the stock 1.25 tanks, but... well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) The 2.5--\u0026gt;1.25 \u0022flat\u0022 adapter is backwards on the building menu. It\u0027s a matter of two W presses, but shouldn\u0027t be like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) The VAB orientation doesn\u0027t match the real orientation when launching a vessel. Again, I could simply select the entire rocket and press Q, but it should not happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10) The radial air intake is super strong. People even use it as a warhead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it\u0027s just a typo in the .cfg, but it hasn\u0027t been adressed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) The \u0022Ant\u0022 engine makes a horrible sound. I know this would come with a FX update, but simply replacing it would be enough for the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12) The hatch for the 3-man capsule isn\u0027t where it should. It\u0027s been like this since 0.16, and I don\u0027t see any thoughts on changing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13) Again, the 3-man capsule is a relatively old part, but it\u0027s missing it\u0027s heatshield! The 1-man \u0022mercury-like\u0022 capsule has one, so why doesn\u0027t this one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe DeadlyReentry mod has a heatshield that fits it perfectly, and it\u0027s description even mocks the manufacturers for forgetting about it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any simple suggestions/tweaks, post them here.
