With regards to mods and the idea proposed to not show said parts to a player that does not use said mod, well, then what exactly is the purpose of being in a multiplayer situation then?

With regards to trolls, not once has anyone given a logical workable way to deal with them. Some have suggested private servers with passwords to protect them, but who shall fund the upkeep for said servers? Players? Squad? TT? TT is a prime example of trolls running wildly amok, just look at GTAO. You cant get anything done unless you find away to get a server to yourself or have an armada of heavily armed escorts or in my case a fully armored gun runner 18 wheeler with massive cannons fore and aft running security. My point is this, for KSP to be a multiplayer enabled game, it would have to take a page from MMO\u0027s and have a persistent world always up and open for those who wish to use it. How then would you stop someone from going to a station you worked hours and hours and maybe days to weeks to get into place, like say the station used in Hottips conquering KSP as I think thats by far one of the most exemplary stations ive seen, from attaching a massive ship to it and forcibly deorbiting it? OR ramming it \u0022Gravity\u0022 style with debris? Does that station vanish from the game when the player who made it logs off? If thats the case then again, whats the point? OR whats to stop someone from doing something horrible to it while he \u0026lt;Hottips that is\u0026gt; off at say Duna working on a base or tweaking something at his Minmus base from utterly destroying it? There are as many examples of what can go wrong and how as there are stars in the sky. You simply cannot account for them all. How do you police such a thing? TL:Didnt bother to read this point? Short and sweet: people are jerks, how do you stop that from happening?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf need be I will expand later again, but, this is whats on my mind.
