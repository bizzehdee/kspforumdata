On a rocket of mass 10 made up entirely of parts with drag coefficient 0.2, the drag is (constant)*2*v^2 [constant depends on the atmospheric density, but not on the ship itself or on the velocity]; this gives an acceleration due to drag of (constant)*.2*v^2. Adding a part with mass 1 and drag coefficient 0.1 will increase the force of drag by only (constant)*0.1*v^2, for a net drag of (constant)*2.1*v^2; the acceleration is then (constant)*.19*v^2, less than before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquivalently (and this is how the wiki defines the drag formula), ship drag is proportional to v^2, to ship mass, and to the net drag coefficient. To get acceleration, you wipe out the mass term, so the acceleration due to drag is proportional to v^2 and the net drag coefficient. The net drag coefficient is the weighted average of the drag coefficients of each part, with the weights being the masses of the parts. Adding a part with lower-than-average drag coefficient reduces the net drag coefficient, thus reducing acceleration due to drag in atmosphere. The trouble is that the drag of a part is factored in the same way no matter what the situation is; that means fairings do *not* reduce drag of the parts behind them, and only have a tiny impact on the drag of the ship. Also, under power, you care more about the actual force due to drag, which does go up whenever a part is added (when not under power, you only care about acceleration).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T16:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat would be wasting programmer time on adding multiplayer.
