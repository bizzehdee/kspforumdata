The problem is that with the small size of the landing gear, I simply cannot angle the plane up much at all without the rear contacting the terrain... the terrain needs to drop away enough for the AoA to get high enough on takeoff.\u003Cp\u003EIts normally not a problem, but due to the bad way vehicles handle on the ground, it can be a problem... leaving me simply annoyed thinking \u0022what idiot put those there\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I restart, and if I manage to keep it on the centerline, have a successful takeoff and orbital insertion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the dropoff wasn\u0027t there to be used, then it would be irrelevant... but they\u0027ve put that very useful dropoff there at the end of the runway, and then just annoying obstacles that combine with weird handling on wheels to make it simply frustrating, not some fun challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree with you that the game would deserve better aerodynamic model. I also completely agree with you that it would be nice to have more aircraft parts, including higher landing gear. There are mods providing both, but as a non-mod-user I can also understand if you don\u0027t want to use these mods and want to stick to stock parts and stock aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour request for these lights to be removed is completely legitimate. It is the purpose of this part of forums to provide players a place where they can put their ideas how to make the game better and reducing some obstacles making flying your airplanes easier definitely does count as improving the quality of the game for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just don\u0027t think it is necessary to remove them or that they are serious obstacle. That\u0027s my opinion on the matter. It by no way means your opinion on it is wrong, it just means we don\u0027t agree on something. Neither of the opinions is better or worse and there is no point in trying to convince each other that either opinion is wrong and should be changed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible developers will change those lights in some future release, or they will leave them as they are. In the meantime the best we can do is to make sure we avoid them when launching our airplanes, one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there\u0027s no reason to further discuss legitimity of your request. It is completely legitimate and fine, regardless of what others think about the matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe may discuss, though, what could be done with your plane so they are not that much of an obstacle they appear to be now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TarkinLarson","CreatedById":106615,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T13:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI partially agree with you with perhaps moving the lights or making them shorter or into the runway like catseyes style lights. However there would normally be obstacles at the end of the runway at \u0027normal\u0027 airfields like trees and pylons etc. I too have often created things that struggle to take off, but have found this to do with the landing gear being too far back of the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould do with them fancy lights at the beginning of the runway that tell you if you\u0027re coming in too high or low. I think they\u0027re (after a quick google) Precision approach path indicators (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_approach_path_indicator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_approach_path_indicator\u003C/a\u003E).

So having them turn off would be good too, but they could help no-end with having an optimal approach angle especially for new people and those who tend to struggle with depth perception in a 2d (as in the game is a 3d projection onto a 2d screen with no \u0027real\u0027 depth perception unless you use 3d glasses etc) game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T13:21:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 01:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TarkinLarson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ES.P.A.G.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
