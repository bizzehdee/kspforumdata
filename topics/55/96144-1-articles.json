Flames emit light by two separate processes. One is that exhaust gas molecules are in excited state after forming. Their electrons fall back to ground states and emit light. It causes typically faint blue light. Other process is thermal radiation of solid combustion products. It can be from red to yellow and white and it\u0027s brightness depends how much there are suitable particles in exhaust gas and what is temperature. In many cases it wins electron excitation effect and flames seem to be bright yellowish. Kerosine contains carbon, which produce small particles. Amount depends on conditions. In many cases rocket engines are burned with fuel rich mixture, so there are excess carbon. Solid rocket boosters produce huge amount of small particles and their flames are extremely bright and smoke production is enormous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the second stage of Saturn V used hydrogen and oxygen. They can not produce any solid small particles and only light come from excited water molecules. There are much high quality video material from Space shuttle main engines.
