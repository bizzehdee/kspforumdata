Very cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thread got me looking at impact tolerance of parts, and had me reading a technical paper about the landing dynamics of all the Apollo lunar landings. Yet another thread was about the tier 0 runway, and why using that is dangerous to aircraft wheels, but landing at speed someplace that should be fatal (anywhere, on any world that is not a paved runway) is not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I land with chutes and/or landing legs, and I do so at LEM-like sink rates at touchdown, I never notice the impact stuff, except watching crasher stages hitting sometimes below me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that all the engine parts should have the impact tolerance reduced to effectively zero. Maybe 1 m/s. The engines should be incredibly delicate things you would never land on, ever. Oddly (not really, I suppose, because \u0022spaceplanes!\u0022) the spaceplane engines are magically set to far higher impact tolerance for some reason(rapier, etc).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that in the past there were not so many parts, and you needed to land on wings, etc, but that\u0027s simply no longer the case. Making parts more delicate where appropriate creates design challenges, which is sort of the point of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESimple proposals\u003C/strong\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Add more runways around Kerbin, some at tier 0 level, all the way up to paved and long. Fix tier 0 to be not so awful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Make everywhere else in the solar system at least as bad as the current tier 0 runway to land on for aircraft wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Make launch clamps and some landing gear/legs to tier 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Reduce the impact tolerance of all the engines in the game to near 0, the jet nacelles can be slightly higher (by slightly I mean maybe 1 m/s higher). A Apollo\u00A0LEM descent engine buckled not from impact with the lunar surface, but from overpressure due to running \u003Cem\u003Enear\u003C/em\u003E the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese can all be easily designed around with the game as it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBetter damage\u003C/strong\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, there might be a couple levels of damage instead of perfect --\u0026gt; #LOLEXPLOSION. Some parts like landing legs and wheels (do aircraft gear, I don\u0027t make planes?) already have this. Add this to other parts, and it could be as simple as a damaged texture. Damaged tanks could leak at some rate, damaged engines would simply not work. Damaged structural parts have impact tolerance reduced by half or something. Engineers could perhaps patch leaks, or allow an engine to work. Damage could occur at the tolerance, and destruction at (tolerance)*3 or some value that works. This gives them something to do, and makes landing something to actually have to think about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T15:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember when tanks and engines had better impact tolerance then landing gear. \u00A0I think there may be a problem with how\u00A0the physics works. \u00A0If you set tank tolerance to 1 m/s. \u00A0Then land at 5 m/s the gear will absorb 3 m/s and transfer 2 m/s to the tank and make it explode. \u00A0I am pretty sure the physics transfers the impact through the entire structure with no absorption by higher impact tolerance parts other then gear and wheels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-11T15:33:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2016 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nich\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skybird0","CreatedById":161024,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T15:54:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222508010\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136694\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460388715\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145678\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nich\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, Nich said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember when tanks and engines had better impact tolerance then landing gear. \u00A0I think there may be a problem with how\u00A0the physics works. \u00A0If you set tank tolerance to 1 m/s. \u00A0Then land at 5 m/s the gear will absorb 3 m/s and transfer 2 m/s to the tank and make it explode. \u00A0I am pretty sure the physics transfers the impact through the entire structure with no absorption by higher impact tolerance parts other then gear and wheels.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo make it query whether or not it is touching the ground and if so, change the impact tolerance. \u00A0Otherwise the impact tolerance (Hereby structural tolerance.) \u00A0stays the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should be something you can change in a setting, for instance, you would not want this system to be in effect for new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T16:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how the code works but in my mind the best case scenario a rewrite of the entire physics logic on Squads side. \u00A0Worst case it is part of the Unity engine and is not modifiable by squad. \u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002275006\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/75006-nathankell/\u0022\u003E@NathanKell\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0knows a lot about the aero so he might know about collisions or can point in the right direction. \u00A0I do have to agree a lot of the parts have crazy impact tolerance but I suspect this is a cause of model constraints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-11T17:14:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, I suppose I could do some drop tests to see what the deal is with how impact is mitigated by gear/legs.
