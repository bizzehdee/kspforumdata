This is a confusing name, especially since toggling it in the editor seems to do nothing, and it only takes effect in a specific situation that you might not encounter while testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it should be renamed to \u0022Deploy While Stowed\u0022 or something similar, which would make more sense and match the warning message: \u0022Cannot
