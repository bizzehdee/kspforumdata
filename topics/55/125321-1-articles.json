When I do exactly as you described, throttle to 0 and decouple while sitting on the launch pad all is fine - that\u0026#39;s true. But as soon as the smallest percentage of thrust is set for the engine you get the explosion. I tried several times, in 1.0.5 even a sneeze will let the stage explode.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:01:43Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Snark\u0027]I think the real issue isn\u0026#39;t \u0022they added explosions\u0022. I think the real issue is that KSP doesn\u0026#39;t model \u0022part explosiveness\u0022 well, and never has, and the new 1.0.5 is simply making that particular problem a lot more noticeable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSP, [I][U]any[/U][/I] part that\u0026#39;s destroyed will explode in a massive camera-shaking, screen-filling fireball. Doesn\u0026#39;t matter if it\u0026#39;s a fuel tank full of tons of explosive rocket fuel, or a lowly OX-STAT solar panel. (Or a spent decoupler on a discarded stage, in the current instance.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is immersion-breaking and a Bad Thing. I love that KSP is as immersive as it is, I love the little adrenaline rush I get on a risky re-entry. But when even small, inert components erupt in earth-shattering gouts of flame when they go to that Great Recycle Bin in the Sky, it ends up emotionally devaluing the explosions because they\u0026#39;re crying wolf all the time. Pretty soon the explosions are just noise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI really wish that KSP would add \u0022graded explosiveness.\u0022 You should only get the big fireball if something large and genuinely explosive goes kaboom. For something small and inert, it should just be a brief sizzle and a little puff of smoke.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot only would that make the [I][U]real[/U][/I] explosions much more emotionally effective, but it would also reduce player confusion. For example, in the current instance, what\u0026#39;s happening is that the stack decoupler on top of the jettisoned stage is getting destroyed. If that was just going [SIZE=1]pfft[/SIZE] and emitting a small puff of smoke, it wouldn\u0026#39;t be so off-putting. In fact, it might add some visual eye-candy to the staging operation.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI disagree, all the things you pointed out as being wrong in my view are part of the Kerbal-ness of the game.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T19:55:12Z","Content":"\nNow that I know how it works, I\u0026#39;ve been playing around and blowing up stages on purpose.
