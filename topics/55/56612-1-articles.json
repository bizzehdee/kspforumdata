Many spacecraft have to be completely redesigned around it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking about the Node Placement glitch. Sometimes when you try to place one part on another part (no pun intended), they completely freak out. It\u0027s a bit like a slot machine, actually: There\u0027s a set pattern for the flickering parts, but you only have a one-in-a-thousand shot to actually place it correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting a bit tired of it, myself, and I know I\u0027m not the only one having this problem. Even Scott Manley can be seen struggling with it occaisionally. For some things, the fix is simple: For an inline battery, for example, you could just flip it upside down and it\u0027s just fine. But I, for one, have been wrestling with some docking ports for 15 minutes before just giving up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had some severe troubles with this glitch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Squad, please fix!
