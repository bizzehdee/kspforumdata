Mainly for a \u0022more science\u0022 sort of a vibe (the more experiments I can do, the happier I am!), but also for if life support is ever implemented, ensuring you don\u0027t put your Kerbals up for a prolonged stay in Jool\u0027s van Allen belts could be a cool feature. Maybe once you\u0027ve sent a probe into the belts with the appropriate instrumentation, you could then toggle them as a feature on map view, like debris and flags.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RadHazard","CreatedById":80815,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T17:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43839-0-22-KSP-Interstellar-%28Science-Integration-Heat-Mechanics%29-Version-0-7-4-%28Beta%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Interstellar\u003C/a\u003E has a really nice implementation of magnetospheres, and version 0.8 looks like it\u0027ll add radiation as well.
