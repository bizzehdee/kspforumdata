Well claw is not designed to catch crafts, so its problematic and docking ports are bad, because they can be squeezed even under 1.5 TWR. That make problems when you want to create modular design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea fix docking ports to be more like structural parts, we shouldn\u0027t be able to squeeze them so easily and parts connected with ports shouldn\u0027t wobble \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor add new part... umbilical housing like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/EFDPO/LCSO/MPCV/images/SM_Components.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SM_Components.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rrvt5r66rcM/VCdIqW_mmLI/AAAAAAAACmw/Q7odgPUHOak/s1600/Orion_2009_version%2Bb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Orion_2009_version%2Bb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this would be radially attached part that would snap in and hold other parts, it could be hard to implement and hard to use to keep CoM where it should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it should be ring-like part for each size (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75) and we would be able to hold only part in spot where green node is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it wouldn\u0027t be working exactly like claw, being able to grab everything in every point, for example orange tank in middle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new part should grab and hold orange tank only on top or bottom where are green nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it would improve lots of designs and decreased part counts for many orbital constructions.

I would rather prefer the implementation of kerbals being able to place struts on eva. That would be most likely more effective and since it is already part of a mod, I don\u0027t think it would require a huge amount of work. Struts on docked modules would finally bring the advantages of orbital construction to ksp.
