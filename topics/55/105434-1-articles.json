A typical reentry happens at about 1.8 km/s, right? It seems like I can instantly decelerate from these speeds at dozens of Gs with a single parachute and seemingly bypass the requirements for reentry entirely, with no drawbacks; parachutes neither burn up, nor do the insane G-forces have any adverse effect on the kerbals.\n\nAm I missing something here?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:09:53Z","Content":"High g forces didn\u0027t rip up chutes either in 0.90, so that\u0027s not exactly new."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T00:12:54Z","Content":"At least Squad gave the parachutes *some* attention.
