But I have a (small) suggestion. Squad, can you make it possible to assign an analog axis to a button binding? That it just \u0022Presses the button\u0022 if you press it fully? For instance that would make it possible to assign the brakes to the LT so you can drive with a rover like you would normally do in driving games using RT to accelerate and LT to brake.\n\nI actually don\u0027t know how small this is to implement, but I would love to see it.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nviccie211"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:31:56Z","Content":"Yes.\n\nAlso, it\u0027d be nice to have default settings for a 360 controller. It\u0027s becoming common place to assume modern games will recognize the 360 controller out of the box."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:32:54Z","Content":"This is unlikely to happen unfortunately, as KSP is dependent on the Unity3D game engine for control assignments, the brakes (or any other control the player might want) would have to be explicitly setup in the Unity editor to accept an analogue axis as a valid input, while not a big issue for a console game this becomes an issue with the large number of controls typical of a PC game.\n\nHowever, game controllers can have their buttons and axis reassigned in other software to reproduce a keyboard key, in your case you\u0027d want to change the xbox trigger axis to send a \u0022b\u0022 to KSP to operate the brakes.\n\n[**JoyToKey**](http://joytokey.net/en/) is a small freeware application that can do this for you on Windows, Linux users can install joy2key from their distribution package manager, and OS X users can try the version found [**here.**](http://www.freecode.com/projects/joy2key)\n\nHope this helps ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"viccie211","CreatedById":96654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:14:03Z","Content":"I know things as Joytokey and Glovepie, I just hoped KSP could natively support it, Alas."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:40:35Z","Content":"There are certainly a multitude of controllers for the PC, but the 360 controller has become a standard of sorts. Most new games I\u0027ve played have recognized it straight away.

I don\u0027t think it\u0027s as effective to press reverse as the full-on brakes, but you risk less tumbling and it\u0027s variable-power."}]}
