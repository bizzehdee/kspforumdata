It\u0027s almost always good game design to give players as many options as possible so that each individual can tailor the game to their own preferences. But keeping something from players who want it will have one of three possible effects: Either the player has to download and install the desired functionality from a third party (which, granted, is both relatively safe and easy with KSP), they calculate it by hand, or they do without. None of those are qualities of good game design.\u003Cp\u003EAs has been mentioned already, \u0022doing without\u0022 is usually no major issue for Kerbin SOI missions, but becomes a serious one when mission complexity increases. I don\u0027t do many Jool missions myself for exactly that reason. Just getting there takes a couple hours of real-life time to fly (three-and-a-half hours was my last one-way time, including trial-and-error aerobraking attempts) and I\u0027d rather not have to wait until after I\u0027ve spent those hours to discover that I hadn\u0027t packed enough fuel.

Critical data readouts don\u0027t really fall within either category, so there seems to be no good reason to delegate that functionality to the modding community. I don\u0027t have anything against mods (I actually installed MechJeb after that Jool mission to see if I could make it back), but every time I get MechJeb or Kerbal Engineer to allow mission planning, I wish I wouldn\u0027t have to. Plus, having one of their instruments on my craft slows the game down noticeably for me. If it were stock, I imagine the implementation would run more smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, having it be an option in a menu seems like a no-loss decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, the argument that having the data would intimidate new players or confuse them is, I think, under-estimating their intelligence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExcellent post, thank you.

I was able to learn quickly about fuel consumption and stages with some trial and error. Epic failures were part of the fun.

As you learn their use and complete missions, you are awarded more parts and more complex parts. So, why not do the same for engineering data (weight, thrust, deltaV, etc. etc.)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe after you complete your first orbital mission you are awarded a \u0022basic kerbal engineering module\u0022 which displays stats about wight, thrust, and fuel available (both VAB and in flight). A little later, as you complete a few more missions (or collect enough science) you unlock a \u0022basic kerbal computer\u0022 which can calculate deltaV. As you continue to progress, you can unlock advanced engineering modules and computers which have all the goodies that rocket scientists love. In this manor, the learning curve is lowered for the starting players, who get some fun by trial and error. But, as you progress, you get access to more powerful tools that help with the tough missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if this advanced information was implemented as a module (ie kerbal computer), people could choose if they want to add it to their designs.

To them, proposing something prim and proper like a NASA VAB could be built by Kerbals is ridiculous. Well, I disagree. Take a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine. Those are cleanly executed pieces of impressive technology. Kerbals are indifferent to safety precautions and are very excited about explosions, yes, but they make an impression of extremely capable and very competent engineers. Sure, we know they probably turned a construction crane into a vomit carousel or raced on bulldozers in the process, but I don\u0027t doubt for one second they can build buildings similar to real ones, and I don\u0027t think it would be out of character for them. Plenty of other stuff like engines is fairly close to how our human rockets look. It\u0027s unfair to mistake Kerbals for Orks from a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCertain Universe With 40k In The Name,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 or to expect them to build sloppy duct-taped huts.\u003Cp\u003EOverall, I\u0027m convinced the obsession with disasters and perception of Kerbals as worthless engineers only caring about explosions is destructive for the game. KSP deserves much more than being a glorified disaster simulator where rockets falling apart and crews being killed is the prime entertainment and the only expected result. The achievements of players who strive to be successful, who create beautiful, well-engineered, reliable designs, should never be devalued, and the opinion that going to space is impossibly hard deserves to be crushed and disproved over and over again. Kerbals are capable engineers and it\u0027s up to the player to utilize their technology well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis same mindset is harming the game in many other areas as well. The bugs of the physics system aren\u0027t there because we thought they would be fun and don\u0027t deserve to be defended as some players surprisingly do. The achievements of reaching orbit, landing on another body or even establishing a permanent base somewhere should not be perceived as something impossibly hard and unreachable for anyone but hardcore players. Everything is possible if you are willing to learn and there is no reason to restrict yourself to playing a disaster simulator with rocket cars or insta-exploding space planes.
