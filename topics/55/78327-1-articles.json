With 0.24 and specifically contracts however, it feels like the idea has some new aspects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea is that there would be a second KSC, with a different faction. Basically it would just be some buildings and a runway. Nothing you can really interact with besides the physical objects. I\u0027m pretty sure Squad wouldn\u0027t add a competing faction with funds and etc of their own. And this isn\u0027t what this idea is about. It\u0027s more about adding story if you will and more purpose for contracts. Examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue missions could be kerbals stranded by KSC2, and now you have to carry out the rescue because KSC2 doesn\u0027t have the funds/technology/whatever. Be it lone kerbal stranded in orbit. Vessel stranded orbiting minmus without fuel(your contract is then to dock and refuel said vessel).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet to the mun before KSC2 does. Shorter deadline and perhaps more reputation gain. If you fail, perhaps a flag could be spawned by KSC2 to show their landing site and your shame in defeat(along with a jab on the plaque or something).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeliver parts to KSC2. Would involve flying over there and landing within a set distance with parts attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscort contracts. You have to deliver a kerbal to KSC2s space station/landed science station/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure where Squad stands on adding CPU vessels though. Just having them spawn/despawn at given locations would be fun. Having them fly in real time would be more fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-19T01:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh... I don\u0027t know, the possibilities seem cool but it would be difficult to program, I assume.
