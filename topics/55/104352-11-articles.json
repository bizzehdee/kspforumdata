Although not a \u0027perfect\u0027 solution, I wouldn\u0027t be too worried about CoM shift, if the developers wanted to shortcut that part of an improvement. I think whole idea may have been overlooked, or internally down-voted in importance, because in most non-inter-stage cases, you\u0027re done with the previous stage, once the fairing is separated. If we want to bring back first or second stages for recovery, the baseplate could be jettisoned with a stack separator.\nEdit 1: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E After a couple of tests, I found that the mass of the fairings are fixed.
