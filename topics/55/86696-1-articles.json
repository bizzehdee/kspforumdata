But if Duna had more water to begin with, then it would probably take longer for it to lose it. We\u0027re just at a point in Duna\u0027s history where it\u0027s still slowly losing water, and in another billion years, its icecaps will be no bigger than the Martian ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has some interesting possibilities for surface conditions. Duna probably has most of its water not just in the icecaps but in permafrost around the planet. Maybe during local summer conditions warm enough that some of these areas (probably around the equator) thaw for a while, creating muddy or sludgy conditions, perhaps even spots of quicksand (quickdust?) that could trap unwary kerbonauts. Possibly a few light, sparse rains might dot the planet during the summers before the planet freezes up again. With each summer, some water escapes to the upper atmosphere, where photo-dissociation breaks it down.
