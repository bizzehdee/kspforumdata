If your plane isn\u0027t exactly level, the lift from the main wings sort of bleeds out and deflects your heading slightly left or right, which the SAS attempts to correct for by altering yaw. We know that real airplanes would change their roll in order to do that instead, so I was trying to think of a way to do that without affecting how rockets would fly. My idea was to use the old avionics package; give it a toggle-able module which reads the yaw control input and then modifies the roll setting to reflect it. For instance, if SAS is trying to apply 20% yaw left, then the avionics package could ask for an extra 4% roll left from the SAS. What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
