I carefully inspect each mod I am interested in, determining things like version compatibility, general stability, conflicts with other mods and assess the benefits against the possible risk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I only have a few essential plugins and part packs that don\u0027t overlap in terms of functionality. I also strip down some packs when I know I won\u0027t use certain parts, or if another pack has better equivalent parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I use KW Rocketry, an absolute must, but there are a few pieces in NovaPunch I like, specifically the control wheels and bulkheads, but that pack also comes with hundreds of other parts including fuel tanks and engines. Since Rocketry is perfect for the latter, I can happily delete almost all of NovaPunch and save literally hundreds of megabytes of files it has to load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course more memory can help, to a point, but being smart about using mods is possibly more important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T17:57:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DeeplyLovesCoffee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DeeplyLovesCoffee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Guys, \u003Cp\u003EI really love Mods!

KSP is a 32 bit application, which means that once it uses 3.5 GB of RAM or more, it crashes to the desktop. There are two solutions for this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) As Bobe has already suggested, only install the mods that you actually need and use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Use this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-2-12-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59005-0-23-Release-2-12-Active-Texture-Management-Save-RAM-without-reduction-packs\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I will run the Texture Compressor with B9 Aerospace, Space shuttle engines, and KW Rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
