You should lose some for killing kerbals (crew \u0026amp; tourists) and for suspending programs. But it should not decay over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat should decay over time is a portion (say 50%) of the financial reward you get for completing missions inside active programs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way the relevance of time becomes more program/mission specific and balancing becomes a lot easier. If you chose to focus on just your Jool-program, you get taxed in REP once for any other active program you want to suspend, in order to prevent its rewards from decaying, while you are busy with Jool. Once you did that, your entire game runs on the timescale of Jool-missions and you dont have to do any \u0022filler\u0022-missions, at all. That would accomodate the \u00B4one mission at a time\u00B4-playstyle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOTOH, this would not prevent the \u00B4multiple-missions-at-once\u00B4-playstyle at all, either, because if that floats your boat, you could opt not to suspend your other programs and carry on with them, at their own reward-decay-rates, while your Jool-mission is en route.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother reason not to have REP decay with time, is that i\u00B4d like to imagine certain levels of REP to be pre-requisites to activate certain programs - if it decays with time, you could run into a deadend-street, just for taking too long to figure things out. That the mun-landing is 50 years in the past should not prohibit you from initiating a duna-program.

What we want is to incentivize the player to attach some importance to time - no more, no less. Ideally, a player would want to have a certain idea on how to progress through every program in quick progression, even before he/she activates it, and be rewarded for all his/her planing ahead and trying to achieve multiple goals with single launches. Yet, failure to do so should not lead the player crushing against a wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The idea is, that you, as head of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, announce what program (=body-specific mission-tree) to persue and the quicker you deliver, the higher the reward. Sure, this is not 100% realistic, but it\u00B4s close enough, in my book and facilitates interesting gameplay. Universal REP-decay is problematic as outlined above. So, when you announce to the kerbal public \u0022The mun is our next goal\u0022, the difference in achieving your first orbit the next week or the next year, needs to be money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u00B4d persue that program upto your abilities and/or ambitions and then announce \u0022We have gotten as far as is sensible on the mun, for the time being\u0022, suspend the program at a mediocre rep-cost, and then move on to the next program (or have multiple run in parallel or just take a break from the programs entirely and focus on commercial mission, aka contracts, as we have them now) and announce \u0022now, it\u00B4s time for minmus (say)\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the while, outside of catastophic desasters and crazy amounts of program-suspending, you accumulate REP. This way REP becomes a bit like the completion scores of old adventure games. Later missions of any program would be harder to achieve than earlier ones, but also yield more REP. Your REP is your score, so to say: If you only complete the first 3 or so tiers (out of say 10) of any program, just enough to accumulate enough to initiate the next program, you might be able to visit all planets and moons, but your \u00B4score\u00B4 would be pretty low, when compared to a player who focuses on completing entire programs in one go without suspending. Once you completed all programs, your REP could be normalized against your difficulty settings and give you a final score with an entry to a \u00B4high score\u00B4 list (while still offering the option to play on, anyways).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if science requires money, too, then quick completion of programs/missions becomes self-amplifying: If you are able to reap the bonus for quick completion entirely, you will have more money on your hand, enabling you to research quicker, which in turn, will enable you to complete the next mission quicker, which yields you its quick-completion-bonus, which in turn... you get the idea. I think that\u00B4s enough incentive to get and keep things rolling. There really neednt be this sword of damocles hanging over your head called \u00B4out-of-REP - game over\u00B4. Rather keep things positive, let inexperienced players progress at their own pace, while offering experienced ones the possibilty to figure ever more effecient ways to get about progressing through the game and allow them to have \u00B4slingshot\u00B4-experiences, where they, due to planing really clever, rip through the programs at light speed, utilizing the aforementioned self-amplifying effect, as well as synergies between programs and missions (e.g. complete various missions in one launch, even across programs, when applicable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: The above is for a model, that doesnt have budget-intervals, which i\u00B4d find preferable, at least for now, even if only as a transition stage to a budget-interval model. Your science staff on the ground could simply cost daily wages, which gets deduced daily. But that\u00B4s not really a budget-interval-model, yet, in my book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a model that presents you with budgets on certain intervals and grants you money on these, based on your REP, the missions inside programs should probably not give any financial reward at all, and instead the REP-reward you gain for completing them, should start to decay once you activate the program (again down to a cap - so not 100% of it would decay away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, this seems much harder to balance, and i\u00B4d like to push any further thought on such a model beyond the point, where time-relevant mechanics are implemented at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-30T13:59:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2016 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mr. Scruffy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T14:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222654856\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467290603\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002238540\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr. Scruffy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Mr. Scruffy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a model that presents you with budgets on certain intervals and grants you money on these, based on your REP, the missions inside programs should probably not give any financial reward at all, and instead the REP-reward you gain for completing them, should start to decay once you activate the program (again down to a cap - so not 100% of it would decay away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I agree.

There\u00B4s also a Tier1-Exploration(lightblue)-mission, which requires you to reach a sub-orbital trajectory, with a basic reward of 50K, followed up with a Tier2-mission, which requires you to reach orbital, for 100K.

The threshold for the mun and minmus programs is 3 to see, what their first missions will require, and 5 to activate (these arent paid, just needed to be collected: so you need 5 REP to activate both - not 10 - and you would still have at least 5 REP afterwards). Mun has an interval of 2 days, Minmus of 10 (say), suspending either costs 2 REP, and each have their own mission trees, like Kerbin\u00B4s, but designed to fit the body at hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decay would work like this.

On the one hand, your suggestion is simpler, which is a good thing. On the other, being able to hire scientists and having to pay them constantly, might be an interesting game-mechanic in and off itself: It would be about the choice of pushing R\u0026amp;D upto your financial limits and, when you are getting short of these, reducing the staff to save money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think, especially if we\u00B4d aim for a flat tech tree, the rate of research must rise throughout the game, to prevent the really neat stuff to be researched first. Things like the Rapier (to name just one arbitiary example) should almost be prohibitve to research at the start of the game, while being affordable later, and researchable in a reasonable amount of time. That would require a raise in the rate of research across the game. Simply making the Rapier super expensive might have a comparable effect, technically, but might come off quite different in its appearance to the player - namely that of a \u00B4pay-wall\u00B4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if the research rate would be constant troughout the game, you\u00B4d lose a vital part of the game\u00B4s equation as i envision it. You\u00B4d want to reap the early completion boni of missions, primarilly to sustain a high research rate (to enable you to take on the next mission and so forth). Progression through the programs and the rate of research are like interlocking gears which you\u00B4d want to keep in sync with each other at as high a speed as you can manage(! important word here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, to increase the rate of research during the game, simply upgrading the R\u0026amp;D facility could suffice. Still, each \u00B4node\u00B4 of the tech tree would have to have something like \u00B4SCI\u00B4 attached to it, simply to quantifiy the amount of time needed to research it at different rates of research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yeah, maybe scientists (on ground) are not needed. Different research rates are, though (imho). Hired scientists would give the player some mini-mechanic to fine tune that rate, according to his/her needs and financial resources, that would tie in neatly with reward-decay-mechanic, translating reaped boni into an increased rate of research, which needs to be maintained, though, and isnt a pay-once\u0026amp;forget affair (like simply upgrading the R\u0026amp;D-facility would).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf i understand you correctly, under your model, a \u00B4node\u00B4 or a \u00B4part\u00B4 (doesnt matter for now) would just have a monetary value attached to it, which you\u00B4d pay upfront, and then research begins on it, at a fixed rate, which, as i understand, must be something like x money per day. So, if that part you want costs 10K and the fixed research rate is 0.5K per day, you\u00B4d take 20 days to research it. Always. If you have surplus money, all you can do, is put more items on the queue, but that wont affect how fast you research any of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe paying upfront part as pros and cons: The pro is, that it\u00B4s easier to manage - pay once and forget about it. The con is, that you have to have the amount avaiable in its entirety even before you start working on it. The fixed rate is a clear con, though, in my book, since it puts a fixed speed on game-progression and turns R\u0026amp;D into a boolean affair (either you do have the money to research something, or you dont - if you do, it will happen at a fixed speed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, with hired scientists, that part you want might cost 10 \u00B4SCI\u00B4 (\u0022beakers\u0022, whatever). How fast you can accumulate that amount depends on how many scientists you have employed. Say, it\u00B4s not vital for you next planed mission, and you are short on cash before you complete that -\u0026gt; fire a couple of scientists. Say, it is vital for you next mission, and you dont even need to consider a launch for it without that part, but the program is already active, and you have some spare cash: Max-out on scientists, maybe upgrade the R\u0026amp;D-building in order to be able to hire even more. Sure, that will leave you just enough money for the actual launch, but if that succeeds and the mission runs well, you\u00B4ll get a couple of Ks in early completion bonus, which will pay your R\u0026amp;D-efforts later on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-02T12:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, yeah.

It could end up running his/her finances into the ground, especially, if he/she focuses on long-term programs (like Jool). With hired scientists, when you focus on long-term programs and already have most of what you need for it, you could simply fire some scientists. When you have researched everything you\u00B4ll ever want or need, you can fire them all for good and avoid any further expenditure on something you are done with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- These hard caps, which we currently have inside the R\u0026amp;D-building, is something i distinctively dont like. Do you? I\u00B4d much rather like to have the freedom to research whatever i find to be affordable and judge what is, by myself. If i am okay with my next project taking 6 months (maybe, because i am waiting for a transfer-window and have no active programs), i should be free to research big stuff even at low research capacity. Also, if i just want a temporary surge of high-speed research (or just one \u00B4expensive\u00B4 part), i dont want to be forced to pay for that for the rest of the game with high building maintrainance cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a sidenote: I also wouldnt make the difference in the tiers of the R\u0026amp;D building too steep. If 10 hireable scientists would be the cap for tier1, i\u00B4d maybe have tier 2 have 20 and tier 3 40 (or 25/50, something like that). Missions later on will tend to be longer, anyways, and that will cancel out higher \u0022SCI\u0022-cost for items partially, on its own. As you begin focusing on more distant targets, the pace of the game will tend to have you timewarp more and more expensive techs may take longer, even when researched at their \u00B4appropriate\u00B4 time. The average time to research something en par with your current progress in the game may go from days to months during the course of the game. So if the cost-layout for techs is something like it is now (ranging from ~10 to ~1000, i dont remember exactly, but ballpark suffices), quadroupling maximum research rate throughout the course of a game seems about right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Actually, this is something that would make the player go to more distant targets in the first place - if the next item on your research-list takes like 200 days, anyways, you could as well start your first interplantery program, now. If intervals keep being too short for too long, you will always go \u0022hmm, i\u00B4ll wait for this tech to finish first before i activate program X\u0022, so long as you can afford it. It\u00B4d be like in civ, when you are 3 turns away from your next military upgrade - constantly - and you\u00B4d never end up actually building \u00B4units\u00B4 unless you reaaallly need to.

I think it\u0027s an excellent overhaul of career mode. The science system always struck me as a little weird. I don\u0027t like the fact that currently you pay increasing amounts of money to hire each astronaut. The idea of having the facilities use different Kerbals is an awesome one. I have an idea or two to add tho. Perhaps if the R\u0026amp;D facility would use scientists you could hire in the Astronaut Complex, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E used engineers, and the faster you want to research, the more scientists you have to hire. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the way it could work has two potential uses:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The bigger you want to build your rocket, the more engineers you have to have, say if you\u0027re building the KerbalX, it would take three engineers, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. You could also incorporate the build times concept, only the more engineers you have, the faster you can build them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow hiring might work: You would hire all your Kerbals in the Astronaut Complex, only they\u0027d start out as civilians. Civilians would be cheap to hire, and you\u0027d have your limit for how many you can have in T1-2 be higher than for the astronauts. There would be a button to assign the selected\u00A0Kerbal to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, or R\u0026amp;D facilities. The Engineers would work best in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, and the scientists would work best in the R\u0026amp;D facility. If you want, you can \u0027promote\u0027 them to be astronauts, but training costs money and time. You can also demote the Kerbal to be a civilian, but at the cost of a teensy amount of reputation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFunding. I like the idea of a monthly budget, and also the idea of Kerbal salaries. So let\u0027s combine them! The way this would work is that when you start out, you\u0027d have a set (small) monthly budget, a set amount of money, and a set amount of workers in each facility. The workers\u0027 pay would perfectly offset the monthly budget, making it impossible to warp for funds. Contracts would add to your monthly budget, which, if nothing is done in that contract for a certain time period, would drift back down to that equilibrium over a couple months. If you hire Staff and place them in facilities, the budget would increase over a year to match it. The interval is longer to prevent it being taken advantage of. This budget is \u0027time warp proof\u0027 since your space center will not run out of funds while you\u0027re visiting Jool. Other things could be tacked on, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T20:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222728205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472060039\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022158484\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mycroft\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Mycroft said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe workers\u0027 pay would perfectly offset the monthly budget, making it impossible to warp for funds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat wouldn\u0027t be a problem if the budget reset each month/year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, you a new month just started.
