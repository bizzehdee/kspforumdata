Once they can consistently build rockets that get into orbit, their first mission to another planet is always the Mun, and they take forever to build something that can slow them down fast enough to land. After completing this and steeling themselves for Minmus, they are annoyed to find that they completely overengineered their rocket and could have gotten there with little trouble. The fact that the Mun is physically closer threw them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of this has to do with the fact that it\u0027s really not intuitive to newer players how difficult certain planets are to reach, land on, and escape from, so the difficulty curve of their mission choices spike all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose something like this on the map view for each planet:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEve Difficulty\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo Reach- 4/10\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo Land- 2/10 (parachutes), 8/10 (powered)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ETo Escape- 10/10\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose numbers are fairly arbitrary (and I have no idea how accurate they are), but it should at least give players a sense of how to engineer for each mission rather than having to go by trial and error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T18:43:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Trial and error is the point of KSP. And as You say, the numbers You give are arbitrary - but so would be any numbers given by SQUAD. Difficulty of the mission is really set by this community on grassroots level*. No number can describe anything here.
