The general consensus usually was that it would never happen. The core game would have to be drastically changed which would be very controversial. And there is the time warp. There is no good way to handle time warp with multiple players in the same instance of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor instance, I could see things like different roles for different players based on their preference. One player would run a station and maintain it: handle tech development, resupply, construction and maintenance, another would run a research facility while other players would focus on other things, running missions, exploration and trade with stations (both in goods and tech). But yeah, that would be a completely different game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
