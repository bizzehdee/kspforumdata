While with Stay-putnik the question is irrelevant, the other probes are not so obvious. It might be that I didn\u0027t pay too much attention, but from what I gather, you cannot tell where\u0027s the \u0027UP\u0027 of a probe by its sight. They all look the same from both up and down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/9/9a/Probehuge.png/190px-Probehuge.png\u0022 alt=\u0022190px-Probehuge.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/e/e1/Probestack.png/190px-Probestack.png\u0022 alt=\u0022190px-Probestack.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we come to the first suggestion: \u003Cstrong\u003Emake probes look differently from its up and down (at least paint them in different colors).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following issue extends the first one. While in flight (usually when the lander is separated and only a probe-controlled tug remains in orbit) I sometimes find out that I installed the probe core \u0027upside down\u0027. Now\u0027s nothing can be done at that point - just remember, that your prograde marker is now retrograde and vice-versa (forget about maneuver nodes too - you\u0027ll need to remember how much dv you needed and by it\u0027s increase during the burn you should guess, how much did you spend).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the second suggestion is: \u003Cstrong\u003Emake the option \u0027Reverse prograde\u0027 in the probe\u0027s right-click menu.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-10T11:16:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2014 11:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cicatrix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded pics\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T11:40:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re having problems with checking which side of a probe core is \u0022up\u0022, pick it up in the VAB (or SPH) and hit the spacebar.
