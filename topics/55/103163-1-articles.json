For example, pay $10 to unlock the full tech tree, and pay $5 a month to unlock career mode.\n- Match up players IP addresses with the IP\u0027s of Squad critics on the forum to hack their computers and remove KSP, important documents, family photos, and install ransom-ware.\n- Restrict modding to only be allowed on Curse.\n- Make mods a commercial service, where modders receive pennies on the dollar for every mod purchase, and Squad keeps the rest.\n- Flat-out remove mods that disagree with the \u0027ethos\u0027 of KSP, such as RealFuels and RealismOverhaul.\n- All proceeds from youtube vids or twitch streams of KSP must go to Squad.\n- Use ridiculous DRM that has to be connected to the internet constantly.\n- Use the money earned by aforementioned tactics to ruthlessly pursue copyright violators in the court system.\n\nI\u0027m sure that you all agree that this is the best way forward for KSP.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E In the rare possibility that you are humor impaired, this is a joke, and does *not* reflect my views on the future of KSP.
