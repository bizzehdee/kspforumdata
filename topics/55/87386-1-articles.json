The most important aspect of the engines are its gimbal. As without it a player must partake in a lengthy trial and error approach to balance out an asymmetric design, which I feel is as iconic to spaceflight as any stack rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now the highest gimbal goes to the RAPIER which is basically a jet engine hybrid that lacks the thrust to compete with a traditional rocket engine. So there isn\u0027t an engine that fills the niche of high gimbal high thrust in the smaller size ranges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to get crazier designs, or more importantly ICONIC SPACE FLIGHT designs into space we need one more engine thats only job is to get less straight foward designs into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one more step and we can finally say KSP can recreate grand-daddy Orbiter and go to space not on a stack rocket, or an inline SSTO or hell even a flat asparagus monster, but a beutiful Semi-Reusable Asymmetricalcal Shuttle with a cargobay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.25 SP\u002B mark 2 cargo bay isn\u0027t really big enough for general 1.25m stuff, as there\u0027s no space for small radial attached things on the payload (more than 2x symmetry). Current mark 3 is about right for 1.25m\u002Blegs size stuff. For 2.5m payloads, we need a lot more than just larger cargo space; namely bigger wings, gear, etc. The current wings may be modular, but that is not sufficient for larger spaceplanes, as the part count ends up getting obnoxious once you factor in all the struts required to give the wings reasonable structural integrity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMark 3 should be left for 1.25\u002Blegs size, and a new larger size created for 2.5m stuff, complete with larger wings and gear to support it properly.

Having two different spaceplane part sizes for carrying 1.25m payloads makes no sense. Everyone would just use Mk3 sizes and never use Mk2 if that were the case. Mk3 should be for 2.5m payloads, since Mk2 already works quite well for 1.25m payloads. Yes, you can\u0027t radially attach a lot of things to payloads in the current Mk2 cargo bays, but creating a whole new category of larger parts just to fix that problem is insane. The real solution would be to simply make Mk2 cargo bays a little bit larger.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn case you didn\u0027t know, other mods that have had 1.25m payloads in Mk2 parts have acted the same way as Spaceplane\u002B, without having much room for radially attachable parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T16:02:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought the same when i read that dev post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but I am not sure if it was meant that way.

Mark 2 provides a good cargo bay for 0.625m payloads and simple 1.25m payloads. Mark 3 is perfect to cope with general 1.25m payloads. A new mark 4 is where a 2.5m\u002Blegs size cargo bay should go. It doesn\u0027t matter if there\u0027s 2 choices which can be used for 1.25m, choice is a good thing, just as the cargo haulers of the world use a variety of different aircraft in similar roles. I\u0027d buy into mark 3 getting a very slight size increase, to make it the same extremely tight fit around 2.5m that mark 2 is around 1.25m, but that still leaves a need for a bay which supports 2.5\u002Blegs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@prophet, when I say \u0022\u002Blegs\u0022, that\u0027s just an illustrative example that most people will understand.

Really anything this big can be put in orbit by a reusable rocket. Landing legs or not. So regardless of wanting landing legs or not, you can send such stuff up into space ontop of an SRB and save just as much cash for almost no work with basically no upfront investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Devs already said the size of the MK3 isn\u0027t large enough. So they are pretty much the same size as the current mk3 parts(no reason for them to be smaller than the legacy parts) which already could carry 1.25 meter parts EASILY, but couldn\u0027t hold 2.5 meter parts what so ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo its almost a guarentee the new MK3 parts WILL be large enough to hold 2.5 meter parts, there are few reasons to not have them be able to hold such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel the Devs will just upscale all the MK3 parts to become near SLS size level(YES that big!). There are decent amounts of wing parts with SP\u002B integration so IDK about needing B9 level wing parts. The whole purpose i see for this is to bring two major building styles in the game for the \u0022end game\u0022 Simply put the SLS currently blows all the competition out of the water by being powerful, effecient, and simple. Except its expensive, comes the end of the Tech tree and is generally expendable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new MK3 parts should fill the niche of being Large enough to carry 2.5 meter parts to get all the major parts into space, and come back. Lacking the SLS thrust but keeping the functionality that currently just doesn\u0027t exist in the current game. Instead of currently relying on a bunch of cheap medium sized rockets to get a basic science lab into orbit, you can use the MK3 parts to make a shuttle to take these parts to orbit and fly back. Saving cash for other end game stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTO MK3 ships will then need to be considered, as having such large payloads will make a few new problems. But I feel this is something that might not need to exist in the stock game. SSTO ships fall off in usefulness once you start getting really large. There are plenty of good Rocket options to get MK3 size parts into space, where as there just would need to be a huge, super powerful, super effecient, jet engines and with them a large and effencient air intake. This definantly would take out the niche functionality of making an SSTO and rather make it just go big or go home. Yes you can still just spam Jet engines/Rapiers to get larger SSTO ships off the ground but doing such is extremely expensive in terms of part count and funds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i for one don\u0027t like the idea of making SSTOS as viable as other build types, so I\u0027m against large size jet engines and larger air intakes. As of right now SSTOS with SP\u002B can easily be built to do 90% of things rocket launches can do outside of drag large parts to orbit. That sort of stuff should be left to rockets. Which is where a MK3 semi-reusable Shuttle would come into play, it can balance the size/strength of a rocket build, with the reusability of an SSTO. But losing out to both in terms of effeciency (SSTO\u0027s save more money) or payload size (Rockets/SLS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding Stronger jets would make all lower end SSTO\u0027s childs play, throw on a super jet engine and a super air intake and get basically anything small sized into orbit and back for free, as its mainly off the Jet! So adding such things to the game would pretty much break the system. The rapier should be as far as we go in terms of SSTO oriented perpulsion, anything to strong could break the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes im totally bias for the MK3 parts becoming primarily shuttle parts. But it is one of the things this game really is missing. I didn\u0027t even know what an SSTO is until i played this game, but anyone who knows anything about recent space flight knows what a Space Shuttle is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T03:14:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T10:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree on the shuttle parts being upsized to just under 50% of the real thing like the SLS parts.
