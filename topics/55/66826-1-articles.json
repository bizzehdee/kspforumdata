I used Jebediah to land and get an EVA \u0026amp; crew reports and a sample. I then docked with my \u0027command module\u0027 and transferred Jeb to that vessel. Leaving the lander in orbit around the Mun I sent the crew home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut no science for reports or sample. I guess the dozy kerbal left his reports and the rocks on board the lander. sigh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to have to get back to the Mun and collect the lander with a portable lab to get the science (the lander is incapable of atmos landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the exception of unmanned probes etc, would it be better to keep the EVA reports and any samples collected with the crew that performed them?
