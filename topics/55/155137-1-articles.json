It has to be with the custom actions to read sensors like pressure, temperature, gravity, mistery goo etc.. all at once. Make a custom action to read that sensors its very helpfull, then store them on the experiments container, even read and store them at 1 action (its buggy with 2 actions or 1, it doesn\u0027t matter). The bug starts when you already have that experiment on the container and you fire the custom action, the sensors keep the old experiments instead of remove them for the new ones. So when you make the custom action again, it doesnt overwrite the new reads on the sensor and go on, so you finally need to make 1 by 1 by hand. It must overwrite an existing report or show an alert to tell you that you will overwrite data with that action. Otherwise its uselesss, you cannot remember if you already did that report on that zone, or spam the button, and finally you never trush on the custom action or you lost tons of science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond have to be with this mission for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NI7RxHW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NI7RxHW.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can go to the mun, get 3000 ore and come back to kerbin and never get the mission. When you are on the mun drilling and you finish, you have checked \u0022acquire 2750 units \u002B have 2750 units an stability\u0022. When you are on kervin orbit you have \u0022have 2750 units \u002B kerbin orbit an stability\u0022 cheked, when you land on kerbin you have \u0022have 2750 units an stability\u0022 checked, but you never get the 4 options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther problem has to be with how labs work. You can get old reports with 0 science points and store them on a new lab, and it gives you the boost for that data, that maybe you already has in another laboratory or finished. It makes that at start of the game with 2 or 3 labs at the mun without even try the solar system and you unlock all the tech tree just skipping the time. That\u0027s a bug for me, you can investigate 1 report on any lab 1 time, not 1 per lab. About how many boost points you get to do that i belive its too high, but thats an oppinion, you have 1 too probably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother \u0022bug\u0022 have to be with the EVA. You only can move yourself, even when you press SPACE in 2 axis. I understand that for a short flight in space its very usefull, but with big ships this usually ends with a very oblique angle difficult to move. I know you can \u0022control\u0022 \u002B \u0022shift\u0022 to anywhere, but if you looking directly to the target sometimes its better. I understand you pretend this to keep simple to break in some directions for short distances, but when you move around something it has less sense. So I suggest to place the Z and C key or ZX to move yourself on the vertical axis, or if you press SPACE to locate yourself in the 3 axis oriented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you could work on this, the game its awesome and this kind of little things make it a bit pain to play, and you can fix it very fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-17T18:47:49Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2017 06:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by OverCraft\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OverCraft","CreatedById":173888,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-18T14:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the bug on the mission.
