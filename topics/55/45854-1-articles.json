I care about challenging and balanced game-play, which is why i love KSP so much. If i wanted to abuse the system to get the best craft then I\u0027d just go modify the Mainsail to have 9999 ISP, but i don\u0027t because it feels wrong and would take a lot of the challenge out. What I\u0027m getting at is that the 48-7S feels like a mod part that got tacked on without the proper balancing in relation to the other engines, which in a sense it is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Don\u0027t get me wrong though, I\u0027d been hoping for an inline 24-77 for quite a while and would just like it to fit in the way it should\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T00:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, when drag gets implemented, it will be far more profitable to cluster mount them than it will be to use the radial engines. Also, based on it\u0027s size, it feels like it should be heavier. personally though, I think a stack mount engine will always be better than a radial equivalent. The reason i think people think it\u0027s too efficient and OP is that in the past, you had to use 2 radials to balance thrust, thus half the efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
