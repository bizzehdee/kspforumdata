It isn\u0027t exactly the same, but you can use it to observe topographical features and hunt for anomalies just like scan sat. All you need is a comm connection and a probe core on your craft and you have access to KerbNet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think a transfer window/alarm clock would be an excellent addition to the stock game and potentially encourage more players to venture to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
