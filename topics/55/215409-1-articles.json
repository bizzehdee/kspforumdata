The team have obviously demonstrated they can, as they added the partially uncovered Mun Arch, so it\u0027s not outside the realms of possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not talking about adding everything KSP2 has but adding some of the parts and changing/modifying some of the values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample changes:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Change \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 for rockets to \u0022CH4\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Change/Add \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 for jets to \u0022Methane\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Change/Add \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 for the NERV to \u0022Hydrogen\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Add the cylindrical Hydrogen tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Add the SWERV, or a \u0022SWERV-like\u0022 engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Add the larger solar panels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Change the ISRUs to be able to make CH4/Methane/Hydrogen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Add hints of the other anomalies in KSP2 to their KSP1 equivalents (partially uncovered/hidden versions).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile this may sound like a small update with very little effort (that\u0027s also kind of the point - just a little something to tide players over at no extra cost), it would give those who can\u0027t play KSP2 right now a taste of what they could once they can either upgrade, or when KSP2 matures enough for their PCs to handle it in some capacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome or all of this can be added with various mods, I know. But having these changes as \u0022stock\u0022 means that if support for the mods stops, KSP1 still has something that works. Or, potentially, bring these parts of those mods in as a free official DLC - provided the contributors agree, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-18T07:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224261515\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022215409\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221679115886\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212297\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cailean_556\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Cailean_556 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhy not bring a little update to KSP1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnswer: $$$\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour proposed changes are not small, unless they were going to put a few devs on task for bug hunting and fixing, its better to leave it be.
