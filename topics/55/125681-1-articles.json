Changing objects in like making a fairing but being able to move sideways too. Each part has like bones like blender does and you can move dots and set how many to move the part so you could make curved M-Beams by moving the top. You can choose which axes to move a part or grow it by. This would really help with rocket making. Parts like the Structural Panels have 8 starting change points which you can use to remove parts of them and make slopes. When a part being made reaches a certain size it becomes multiple breakable points so you can just have a whole ship made of Metal so a super long M-Beam could be broken into 3 small ones. In career mode it costs alot to make parts mainly twice the cost of the materials making it. The editor would be its own building that is small and men\u0026#39;t for forging it can be upgraded to allow more max custom parts and ends with unlimited.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nP.S. Squad can I be able to model cities for Kerben because you don\u0026#39;t want them but what if I make them for you? Would they be able to be added then I only know how to model and texture not code, but it would be nice not being on a planet with almost no life.\n"}]}
