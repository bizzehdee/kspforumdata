Cool sciency things happen at the sound barrier etc...) then prop planes can be upgraded to turbo fan/jet engine super sonic aircraft to perform more science to assist with unlocking the basics of rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I was confused by seeing planes near the end of the tech tree when it seems to make more practical sense to build a space program on aeronotical foundation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...

As for aeroplanes, I think that having \u003Cstrong\u003Etwo\u003C/strong\u003E start tech levels (one for rockets, and one for planes) should help. Of course, it brings a lot of problems with using plane technology in rockets...but then again, basic probe core, passive stabilisers and basic control surfaces should be in the first tech level.
