However, at times it becomes a bit fiddly and often frustrating. So instead of having to drag on the axes around the node, why not be able to click and drag on points on the orbital path?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you want to increase your apoapsis, select the maneuver node point as usual and then click and drag the apoapsis marker and drag it to the desired location. The same information you get when you hover over a marker would be displayed as you drag it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I envision is that when you create a maneuver node (MN), three markers are added to your craft\u0027s current orbit; a P/A (periapsis/apoapsis) marker on the opposite side of the MN and two I (inclination) markers on the two perpendicular sides of the orbit between the MN and P/A marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragging the P/A marker lets you set the desired periapsis or apopasis, which would be determined automatically based on whether the point was further or closer than the current apoapsis or periapsis. This action would only affect prograde or retrograde vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo change radial vectors, you would perhaps hold shift and drag the P/A marker, which similarly would restrict prograde and retrograde changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, to alter inclination, simply drag either of the two I markers, which also would restrict prograde, retrograde and radial vectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally finally (reminded by Kahusa), the MN itself would be able to be dragged along the orbital path like normal. Possibly you could hold Alt while dragging the P/A marker to adjust the MN position at the same time as the periapsis/apoapsis position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think from a usability standpoint this would be a much better system and it allows the user to choose where they want to go and let the game determine the necessary burn parameters rather than the other way around. Some of you may see this as \u0022easy mode\u0022, and perhaps you should be able to choose which system you want to use, but to me it just seems like the more logical approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, when planning real life missions (although they are infinitely more complex than KSP), they know where and when they need to be and then work out how they need to get there, they don\u0027t just enter values and see where it gets them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope all of that made sense, and if it doesn\u0027t I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t mock up something to illustrate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-11T13:33:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/11/2014 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bobe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T08:46:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDragging the markers directly results in a very frustrating situation.

For example, the P/A marker would only move towards or away from the the center of the orbit, it would remain in the same plane and on the same axis. Similarly, when dragging the I markers, they would only move along one axis on the same plane (ie. it would just tilt the orbital path).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, even if you move your mouse around wildly, the point will still remain in a sensible location with the other parameters of the orbit unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-11T11:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not clear where would you like to drag inclination markers.
