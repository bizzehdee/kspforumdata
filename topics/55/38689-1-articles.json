The plan is to add an option to \u0027Recover\u0027 a vessel whenever possible. Recovering a vessel would return you some of its value, giving an incentive to build reusable vessels. Of course, recovering would only be possible for vessels landed or splashed down on Kerbin, and the value of the recovered vessel would vary based on how far from KSC it actually is. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoldenShadowGS","CreatedById":59120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T00:46:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was about to post this same exact idea, but used the forum search to see if it had been brought up yet. To expand on the above ideas, I was going to suggest to have retrieval fee when the craft is landed too far from the space center or a designated landing zone. You could encourage people to visit more locations if there were multiple recovery zones. The zones could be different sizes and landing in the smaller ones could give some kind of bonus points. Maybe something to do with achievements like landing in each of the recovery zones from orbit at least once each.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
