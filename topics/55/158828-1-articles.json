My own experience with Kerbal Konstructs is that no matter how far away I was from the cities and other additional objects, I\u0027d always have terrible framerates, and it seemed they were always being rendered for some bizarre reason. Squad would account for this if they added something similar to the game, but they would still risk framerate issues when inside the cities, especially on weak computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, even if they solve those problems, this is still something that could drastically increase loading times, as they would by definition add a huge amount of extremely complex\u00A0models and possibly textures to the game. Not something you want on the potato computers some players use. Hence why KSP doesn\u0027t have cities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, Kerbal Konstructs does give multiple launch sites, which I\u0027d be happy to have in the stock game.
