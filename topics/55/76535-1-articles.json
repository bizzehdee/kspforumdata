I\u0027ve noticed that the costs of many parts seem inconsistent for their relative size or utility. If you look at fuel tanks, some of the smallest liquid tanks cost the same amount as the largest SRB\u0027s. One big orange tank costs more than double one the white half-tanks. I can\u0027t remember all of the examples I found, but there were a lot. I found myself making counter-intuitive and bizarre design choices to save on cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I\u0027m wondering, have the Dev\u0027s have addressed this, and are there plans to adjust these costs prior to 0.24?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T20:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll probably find out in the next week or so \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T21:04:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ve already done some adjustments, at one time, most of the rocket engines all had the same cost.
