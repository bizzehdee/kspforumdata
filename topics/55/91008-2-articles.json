I\u0027ve heard of a couple of engines with more than 400, but as far as I know there aren\u0027t any LfO engines with an isp of 500 or more (the lower isp in ksp is more an issue of balancing the 1/10 th size of kerbin anyway). And also I don\u0027t think that isp related changes are needed. The gap betwen the skipper and the poddle seems to offer enough room to make every engine unique. And regarding the poddles upper stage capability that were mentioned, I have to disagree. A 50 km apoapsis with the early stage(s) is arguably not the most efficient gravity turn profile (and with a more realistic atmosphere, the desired altitude for the start of the circulisation burn gets even lower). I can understand that people may do theire lifters and ascent progiles differrently. There is nothing wrong about that.

For Mun \u0026amp; Minimus, it\u0027s not too powerful, not too weak, pretty much just right for an 8 or 16 2.5m tank, 2.5m RCS tank, 2.5m lander can, legs and miscellaneous small extra bits. I suggest that the Poodle be kept more or less as-is, other than fairly small balancing as part of the final balancing pass running up to 1.0 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s clearly primarily intended for that 2.5m smallish lander role. What you need is a 2.5m engine that is between the Skipper and Poodle, a 4th Rockomax engine, although personally I think the Skipper is generally suitable for non-lander stuff that\u0027s heavier than the Poodle is suitable for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T03:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use the Poodle for a lot of my bigger landers, it is just useful mainly because of its low profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t meant to be a first stage engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T04:14:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI use the Poodle for a lot of my bigger landers, it is just useful mainly because of its low profile. \u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t meant to be a first stage engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever mind first stage, it\u0027s not really meant to be any stage of primary lift engine, although final stage to orbit for a larger satellite might be appropriate.

For the smallest lightest payloads, at 1 ton the lv-909 surpasses the 48-7s beyond ~4900 m/s delta-v for 2 tons the LV-909 is superior beyond ~2400 m/s delta-v as the landers get heavier the trend continues. The 48-7s may rule the probe world, but if you land anything other than the lightest lander anywhere except Gilly the LV-909s ISP will trump the superior TWR of the 48-7S.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor real missions, such as Apollo-style Duna missions, the delta-v figures are usually within 10% of each other for the same mass. The main difference is that we can have a higher TWR (and, as a result, faster and more accurate transfer burns, as well as more efficient landings) with the 48-7S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t want a 4th rockomax engine, I really, really, don\u0027t.
