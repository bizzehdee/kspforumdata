This is not top say that two parts would become one, but that they would be attached with the physics properties of two parts attached in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general idea would be that the two parts to be combined each have a \u0022weld port\u0022 attached, and once in orbit, they would be docked in the normal fashion. Once successfully docked, the player would have a right-click option to \u0022weld\u0022 the parts together. This joint then becomes a solid state, without the flex often seen in traditionally docked components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefit to this addition would be for more realistic assembly of components and decreased flex in orbital construction. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe costs of this addition would include: designing, programming, and testing a new part; a potential physics hazard and questionable ability of the game to modify the save file on a permanent basis to make the two parts one (I\u0027m not sure how the game handles docked parts currently); and the risk of regret in design/assembly for the player. One way to avoid at least some of the risk is top make the part separate from the current docking port so there is no accidental welding.
