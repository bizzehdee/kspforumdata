It\u0027s not fitting with any plane\u0027s image.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Thirdly, I can\u0027t find a nose-cone that is fitting with it. (the Aerodynamic Nose Cone in colour)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still, it is the best choice for big planes, looks better on planes than the Mk.1-2 Command Pod. I think a remake would help it to be much better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also made a draw of my idea for that how it could be made into the pod with the best view from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i3mVINY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i3mVINY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It was drawn onto the previous image, the represented kerbals are real-sized ( relatively to the fuelsage )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Because the pilot is close to the vindow wich is having a steeper angle, there is a very good view from IVA. Better than from the Mk.1 cockpit. Top windows are there because they would be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-As the original Mk.3 cockpit is seen from the front, there\u0027d be no window for the kerbal sitting in the middle, so he could be looking backwards, maybe with a window wich from he could see into a cargo bay behind the cockpit. Or he could be sitting in the lower floor, just like the mission specialist at the STS, or simply like the third passenger in the Mk.1-2 Command Pod. Or four of them at the top... Describe what you think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At a lower floor there could be the third passenger or you could go down there in the upcoming IVA version (As I know they\u0027re going to add it once), beds could be there, but because kerbals do not sleep, rather tables and funny things like in the PPD-10 Hittchhiker Storage Container, there could be the airlock, but most importantly, a window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-An addition could be an RCS nosecone right fitting to it. I\u0027ve copied the layer of the nosecone I\u0027ve drawed onto a Mk.2 cockpit, to show that it is fitting with other cockpits too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sPoljv2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sPoljv2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn RCS nose cone could have 100 RCS fuel in it, and the thrust of 3 RCS thrusters to all direction ( expect for backwards, where the connection is )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made a subassembly from how it could work, and if everything is fine, I\u0027ve uploaded it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://file///C:/Program%20Files%20%28x86%29/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/saves/TT/Subassemblies/RCS%20Nose%20cone.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://file:///C:/Program%20Files%20%28x86%29/Steam/SteamApps/common/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/saves/TT/Subassemblies/RCS%20Nose%20cone.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it looks like\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LM4IJOx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022LM4IJOx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe arranging of thusters and tanks under the nose cone\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z7usPOt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z7usPOt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 thrusters to all directions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/445J8eQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022445J8eQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you support a remake of this cockpit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Sorry for mistakes in my english)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-12T15:13:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2014 03:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T13:51:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to upload your images somewhere like imgur.com for us to be able to see them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-12T17:08:03Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2014 05:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMerged threads make me sound like I repeat myself.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T14:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou need to upload your images somewhere like imgur.com for us to be able to see them.\u003Cp\u003EI like the Mk3 cockpit, but its offset CoM and attachment nodes make it difficult to use in an aesthetically pleasing manner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you! now my images are working!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T14:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85535-Let-s-face-it-the-Mk3-part-system-is-useless\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85535-Let-s-face-it-the-Mk3-part-system-is-useless\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T14:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Random Tank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Random Tank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust edit the .cfgs if you want the fuselages to be useful.
