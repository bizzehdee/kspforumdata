What if we could jump time instead? How many times have you overshot something because of the timewarp system? What if you could select a point in orbit and jump time instead. The game will fade to black, and fade in immidately and you will have arrived at the destination. Of course time and the the game will have progressed, planets will have moved etc. But you are free from having to speed up time and slow it down at the correct time. \n\nWith a mechanic like this, it opens up for much larger solar systems. It opens up for the posibility of adding galaxies. Bodies that are decades away. And it wont change the difficulty of the game. You still have to plan your mission, bring enough fuel, equipment etc. and execute the proper manouvers at the correct time. But getting to the manourvre points and end destinations will be smoother, and the size of the game could expand where you have multiple star systems because you would be free of the time warp mechanic which can only go so fast. One of the reasons multiple star systems havent been added yet is because it would be hundreds of years away, and doing that kind of time even at maximum timewarp is going to take alot of time. I guess what im asking is, what are the benefit of a time warp system, rather than a jump to time system?"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:33:25Z","Content":"I liek this idea."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:50:24Z","Content":"How is this different from the warp-to feature?

Much as I dislike the phrase, pressing a button and skipping over most the actual flying-through-space part of spaceflight would be immersion breaking for me. Missing a maneuver node through over-zealous time-warping is annoying but no more so than crashing into the Mun, forgetting some small but essential piece of equipment, running out of fuel or power, or all the many things that can go wrong in KSP. Learn, move on, try again.\n\nSorry, this is something of a pet peeve and not directed at the OP specifically. It\u0027s just something I see far too much of on game forums in general.
