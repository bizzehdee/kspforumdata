Unfortunately it\u0027s look hasn\u0027t changed at all since it was introduced all the way back in .15, and it\u0027s starting to look pretty dated. In that time the game has come a long way, many more bodies were introduced, and most newer bodies have been given multiple art passes and revisions. Minmus however has been left in the dust and has the oldest surface still in the game, so at this point even a minor art pass would help, but a more drastic redesign would probably be for the best, just to keep it on par with the other bodies in the system, especially with the newly redesigned Mun and Kerbin right next door. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be great to see some cracks in the ice lakes like those on Eeloo, and some more varied terrain and possibly coloration all throughout. Maybe even a kilometer or so high tentative atmosphere made of sublimating gasses off the ice lakes, something like that of Pluto or something. Not really enough to affect much of anything I suppose but interesting for science reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, those are just my thoughts, I\u0027d love to hear any ideas anyone else might have on Minmus though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T08:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it should still look like a rounded ball of mint ice cream.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T10:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like Minmus\u0027s smooth surface.

I personally dont get the idea that looks is so important early on. I want optimization and functionality, two things KSP realy lacks. But instead time is spent on what should be finishing up touches as fare as I am concerned. Duna is for example almost impossible to land spaceplanes on now because looks is more important then game play, not thought was apparently put in to that. I hate that focus. As fare as I am concerned they might as well remove procedural terrain altogether until the game is in the final stage then add it and make sure not to mess the terrain up in ways that impedes game play. Makes little sens to add \u0022candy\u0022 to a game that already runs slow enough for most users and hammper the game play as a result. Just narrows the player base and potential consumers instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
