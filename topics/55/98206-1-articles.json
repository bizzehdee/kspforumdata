Apologies if this is already covered somewhere else or already on the suggestion list. At a casual look, I didn\u0027t see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I want to thank Squad for splitting out engines and fueltanks from each other, but I think this can go further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to suggest for the basic (not advanced) menu tabs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplit out separate category tabs for both Decouplers and Adapters from the Structural tab. They\u0027re sufficiently different in function that I feel they deserve their own tabs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESplit out separate category tabs for both electrical (batteries, solar panels, RTG), and landing gear (legs and wheels) from the Utility tab. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would add four more tabs in the menu, but they\u0027re all things that you usually end up having to hunt for in those categories, and when you\u0027re designing a rocket, you know that you need something of those specific types as you work your way down the stack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could also see adding one for parachutes, which I\u0027m getting spoiled on by using RealChutes now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, for the advanced menu, under the resource types, something that would be useful would be one that is \u0022liquid fuel \u003Cem\u003EAND NOT\u003C/em\u003E oxidizer\u0022. Right now, the \u0022oxidizer\u0022 button works great for quickly grabbing rocket fuel tanks. However, selecting \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 gets you both the rocket and splaceplane tanks all at once. There\u0027s no way to single out the spaceplane tanks this way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
