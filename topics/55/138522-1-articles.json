Since the purpose of the LES in real life it to drag the crew up and AWAY from the rocket in the event of a failure but right now all it does for me is drag my capsule slightly up and to the side\u00A0a few meters by the time the LES cuts out which leaves me 10m from the rocket a distance that in real life would be unacceptable, Granted this is KSP and not in real life so it\u0027s to be expected to be slightly less, but still I would expect it to be at least closer to 50m or at \u003Cstrong\u003Eleast \u003C/strong\u003E25m from the spacecraft as that would at least do the job effectively of getting your kerbals away from the rocket as it soars (or explodes) away. Due to it\u0027s poor thrust/burn time, it can neither get it away at an acceptable speed to let it coast far enough UP to get away and not enough burn time to get it AWAY from the rocket so it fails in multiple accounts for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would prefer the fix the current one before making another one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ozymandias_the_Goat","CreatedById":159377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T21:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would have saved Jeb sooo many times in the career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
