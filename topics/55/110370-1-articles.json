I would like to suggest that planet biomes be visible on the map screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch like the ctrl-F12 visible biomes toggle but add the support to legitimately add this information to the map with a toggle overlay button. You would be required to have a tech tree node and do a survey with a satellite of some kind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like this should be available in game without having to cheat. I was suprised not to come across it. I just do not like eye balling the normal visual map and making an educational guess where biomes are placed. It seems kind of unrealistic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are putting a probe on the surface of a planet then you will have all the topographic information availabel to you. I am sure NASA or the ESA scrutinise maps for days or weeks for landing locations and have a very good idea about the area they are putting their probe in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm... Interesting idea. However, I think that the big ol\u0027 M700 scanner has an option to show biomes, though don\u0027t take my word for it. Could\u0027ve sworn I had biome data, but perhaps it only shows the differences in biomes, not specific information like their name. I\u0027ll test it out when I get home \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish they\u0027d replace biome with another word, because \u0022bio.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T17:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad allowed \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ebiomes\u003C/span\u003E regions visible as part of regular game play, I wouldn\u0027t want to see the extreme colors used in the debug overlay.

I am sure there is a word that describes drasticly different areas of a planet that could potentially host different types of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I do not mind how the information is visualised as long as it is pretty friendly. The debug map looks like a radar topographic map that has been colour coded. Kind after they have altered the map to make it easier to interpret for public consumption and non specialised scientists. Some nice images of Venus here. It includes a few different types of image. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cseligman.com/text/planets/venus.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cseligman.com/text/planets/venus.htm\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
