It\u0027d be a minor addition, but one I\u0027d really like to see in the final game =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T09:36:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpacesuits are white in for a very good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you might not have noticed that the other Kerbals also wear different suits on IVA and EVA.

He was requesting that Bill Jeb and Bob have orange suits but the others be white. I think the orange suits were originally modeled after those worn by astronauts during launch which are orange because if the rocket were to break up and they survived (possibly happened during challenger until they hit the ocean) they could pull their chutes since orange is an unnatural color it stands out helping rescuers find them easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
