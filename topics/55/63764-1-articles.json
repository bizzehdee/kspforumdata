Now, how do we tell where to point? Select a target (and have a checkbox \u0022target SOI center\u0022, since you can\u0027t target that directly, IIRC).

And it should be possible to find out what the vessel can, worst case by a short blast of RCS/reaction wheels in each axis and watching the rotational change, if you can\u0027t simulate it without showing it on the screen.
