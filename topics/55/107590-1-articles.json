You go from having only 30 parts, which is not enough to land on the Mun with a crew, all the way to 255, which is enough to do just about anything, for the exorbitant fee of 450k roots, which is really hard to earn with only 30 parts! Why not have an upgrade to say 50 or 75 parts for only150k roots, which requires far less tedious grinding? Similarly the launch pad takes you from an extremely restrictive 18 tons to a very generous 140 tons in the first upgrade. Why not have more intermediate steps for cheaper? I really think this would make the general flow of the game far more enjoyable. As it is now, you have to grind away with very limited missions to get that first upgrade, and then you\u0027re basically done. I could go just about anywhere with 140 tons and 255 parts! I think the progression should be more like 30, 75/150k, 150/450k, 450/1M, unlimited/2M for parts and 18, 50/150K, 150/450K, 500/1M, and unlimited/2M for tonnage.

Mostly I just don\u0027t think that the steepness of going from only 30 parts to 255 in one step supports a good flow of gameplay. At 30 parts it\u0027s really hard to do anything, and at 255 you have to be going to Jool with multiple landers before it\u0027s even an issue. Making everything cost less money in the easier modes doesn\u0027t really alleviate this problem at all, it just makes the whole idea of needing to upgrade your buildings pretty much perfunctory. If, as tater commented upthread, it\u0027s trivial to upgrade everything, then well, this whole upgrading business is trivial! Is that how the devs want it to be? I don\u0027t think so! I think they want it to be a real factor in the strategy of career gameplay, and IMO the way they have it now it\u0027s \u0022one and done\u0022 for everything but the science facility and the tracking station, for which some essential functions cost (IMO) excessive amounts of money. I think to make it work as intended, the devs need to rebalance this aspect, and that the easiest thing they could implement to do that would be to introduce some smaller steps, especially for the VAB.

It should not mean getting stuck with very limited options regardless of how well you allocate your money or design your ships. The way they have it now, I believe the VAB is at first too limiting in that regard and then not limiting enough. Moreover I think that while the devs have done a fantastic job of implementing this awesome parts collection, play space, and physics system for spaceflight simulation, they have relatively speaking phoned in some other aspects of campaign-oriented game play. The good news is that fine-tuning these represents far less overall effort than getting the other parts to work right, but that does not make it less important to do so. Anyway, you may feel differently but having played this game for 1200\u002B hours, I really don\u0027t feel like I deserve to be treated with that degree of condescension for making this (I think quite valid) observation."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T14:57:54Z","Content":"I found the upgrade options to be severely limiting even in normal difficulty.

The OP is suggesting that the game is too CHOPPY.\n\nPrecisely. The best (i.e. least boring and repetitive) option I had for getting the money to upgrade the VAB was to take three different Munar survey contracts at the same time. On the plus side, designing a 30-part vessel that could make a low Munar orbit and return was challenging and satisfying, as was figuring out how to get it into the required near-polar Munar orbit directly from LKO without the benefit of patched conics or a maneuver node. On the minus side, grinding through all those temperature scans and crew reports, most of which had to be done from very low altitudes, going around and around and around and around the Mun on excruciatingly slow 10X time warp (or else constantly flipping back and forth between the tracking station and the mission), was really not any fun at all. Then, once I had the money to upgrade the VAB, I immediately got enough parts to do pretty much every other basic exploration mission in the whole game except maybe Eve Rocks, although that would be possible with multiple launches as well. Given that I had not yet even landed on the Mun, that seemed like way too much too fast. It would have been much more satisfying if completing just one of those grindy survey contracts had gotten me just enough of a VAB upgrade to build a Munar landing mission, which in turn would have given me enough funds to go to Duna, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:15:04Z","Content":"Yeah!\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that I not only had to save up 550 science for the ore drill, I also had to fully upgrade the R\u0026D center.

Not much point in having the base if it can\u0027t drill for fuel.\n\nI think it would make sense not only for there to be more upgrade tiers to the R\u0026D center, but also to either move the drill to a lower tech level or limit tech researched in a different way. Maybe there would be a science spending limit until you upgrade? I don\u0027t know, but the current tech tree doesn\u0027t feel like a tech tree so much as a tech wall you gradually climb from one end to the other.

Rather than having to spend one gigantic lump sum to unlock a whole tier of techs, it would be much more fun if you could pay for each node individually, with higher-tier nodes costing both more money and more science. The total cost of each tier could be more or less the same, but you\u0027d have way more options for how to advance your capabilities. You could even keep the building upgrade as a separate thing, but maybe have it be tied instead to how much science you can get to do different things, what sort of science missions you can do, or what capabilities your scientists have.

For instance, the R\u0026D building could have special boosts that reduce the cost of researching a given node as well as all nodes branching out forward from it, and these bonuses would stack up towards the end of the tree, bringing prohibitively expensive techs down to much more manageable rates. You could still spend less money and more science, or more money and less science, so it\u0027s flexible that way. But if there\u0027s one tech way up the tree you really want (like the drill for me), then you could save up and go for it specifically (and purchase a few early upgrades that cheapen it) without grabbing everything int he whole tech tree that occurs before it. Then you\u0027d be allowed to jump forward to any techs without researching the prerequisites--instead of being prevented from researching it, it would simply cost more science. The more you research along a specific path, the cheaper the tech get on that path, which makes you more likely to research more things on that path. This gives it more of a power of choice.\n\nBetween the science nodes would be efficiency nodes--these you pay a mix of money and science to unlock and it would point to the science nodes it affects, and would list on the node how much of a % reduction you get to all science nodes ahead of it.\n\nYou would have a limit to how many efficiency nodes you could unlock before you must upgrade the R\u0026D center."}]}
