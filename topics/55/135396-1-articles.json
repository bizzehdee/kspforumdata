Though it is a bit hidden.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would very much appreciate if I could change the type of a vessel (debris, probe, ship, station, etc.) from the tacking station, instead of just from a vessels control module.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem I encountered is that I sometimes get uncontrollable debris (decouplers and stuff) labeled as a probe (for some reason). I cannot re-label them as they don\u0027t have control modules, meaning that they will crowd up my map screen, unless I disable visibility of ALL probes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd I thought to myself: What\u0027s wrong with allowing renaming and re-labeling of vessels from the tracking station (or map screen for that matter)? Isn\u0027t it the guys at mission control, who decide, what a spacecraft is called and what it\u0027s classified as? Why does the craft itself need to have some specific part in order to allow them to call it by a different name?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-30T22:32:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2016 10:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MajorNr01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-30T19:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least in 1.0.5 is possible only totally unintuitive, so much I don\u0027t remember how it was done.
