With that in mind, I thought this might be an alternative model. It mainly uses bonuses to the three career resources (funds, rep and science), plus a couple of small tweaks to existing stock gameplay and a couple of miscallaneous bonuses.

Each Trait confers a number of bonuses, which increase with higher levels of skill in that Trait. Kerbals can acquire a maximum of five levels in each trait, each level requiring progressively more Experience to acquire. Kerbals are assigned a Title based on their current skill levels in each Trait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAbstracted model\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach kerbal is awarded a number of experience points for successfully completing a flight.

Players thus define through gameplay the skill levels that their kerbals acquire in each trait. Kerbals assigned to single seat craft automatically gain piloting experience (see below), multiseat craft will need to have pilot seat(s) defined, where the kerbal(s) assigned to those seats gain piloting experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETraits\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPayloads\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPayloads specialists focus on EVA activities and science.

I admit that probe core \u002B pilot is a combination I hadn\u0027t considered. Not sure how to get around that one to be honest, but at the same time I\u0027d like piloting to mean something, and yet not be linked to improving parts. Need to think about that. Building some aspects of RemoteTech into stock would fix it - pilots can be flown as they are now, with no communication delays. Probe cores are affected by such communication delays, and for really long distance missions you\u0027d probably need a RemoteTech style flight computer. Probably best to assume that KSC can track probes without requiring relay satellites though - forcing folks to go for the complete RemoteTech experience probably wouldnt be popular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might be overthinking things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWallygator - you can train all you like but there\u0027s no substitute for actually going out and flying.
