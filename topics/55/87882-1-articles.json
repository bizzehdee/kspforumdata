Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine that Kerbals are not smartest species in universe and they discovered space flights right before their resources ran out. On Kerbin they have just enough materials to build few large rockets and run small space program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain goal in this game mode wouldn\u0027t be making more funds by accomplishing more contracts, but simple discover more spots with resources and gather them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo spare Devs work we should be able to sell resources, on Kerbin\u0027s market, for funds and buy rocket parts, it would be simpler that inventing and balancing new values of resources for each part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor both single and multiplayer it should be fun to design crafts, space stations and send missions not only for science, but also for explorations, so we would know where to send ships for gathering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll resources should be finite or not, depends on options set by player, for hard mode should be finite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting amounts could be set in options by sliders like science starting points right now. Amounts of resources available in single spot could be set like science/rep/funds rewards also by sliders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could change a lot KSP gameplay, as part counts limit us greatly some would prefer to create fleet instead of single massive ship and in mid and late game they could wonder from planet to planet or try to gather everything they need from asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO it would be amazing for multiplayer sessions, for both cooperations between many people and for space run for resources for two or more opposite \u0022factions\u0022 created by players. Who gets first to Mun or Duna resources spots, who gets farther \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso Kerbals should be finite in this game mode, that means if all your Kerbals die you lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZLM-Master","CreatedById":185115,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T14:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be a \u0022funable\u0022 mod , but i don\u0027t think we see some kind of mod until KSP release V1.00 or V1.1 .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe work of our modders is closer to the Devs work for the moment .
