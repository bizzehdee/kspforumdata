This can be very annoying when I already have 5\u002B stages set up and put another pair of boosters on a rocket and it gets placed automatically into stage 2 and I have to hunt around and try to highlight the boosters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFix the weird issue where a symmetric set of items gets split into the group minus one, and the other one on its own, if you know what I mean. For example, I\u0027ll place 3 boosters as a symmetric group, and on the stages, 2 will be in their own group and 1 will be on its own. It gets confusing.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHotkey for struts - NEVER ENOUGH STRUTS\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eability to pick between mirrored symmetry from the VAB, or the normal from the SPH - Rovers seem to make more sense with the SPH mirrored symmetry, especially with the wheels, but I want to place them as payloads in the VAB. I know there\u0027s a mod for this, but I think there\u0027s no reason not to make it a part of the game. i work it out with sub-assemblies for rovers right now, built in the SPH\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow of course I have some features I\u0027d love to see too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003Erobotics parts like servos and pistons - I think I\u0027ve seen a mod, but I\u0027ve been wanting to build a ship where parts can fold out and have a bit of complex machinery.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emore incentive to return from a planet to bring the science - I spammed the hell out of transmitting and unlocked the full science tech tree way before my friend who was trying to return from the planets. Maybe split up the \u0022science\u0022 resource a bit more, so certain \u0022science resource\u0022 types HAVE to be brought back? \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eability to strut ships together more when in space, especially for docked ships so that they are more stable together. Maybe let the kerbals walk around and hook parts together?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKethane mod - seriously, that adds so much to the game. If it was well-thought out and balanced, something like that would be awesome in the base game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eability to build stations in space or on other planets, so you can launch from there. I\u0027ve always wanted a really good reason to make a base on Duna other than just to do it, or even an extra launching base on Kerbin\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Eon that note, base construction - ability to expand on your kerbin station and maybe that is part of career and unlock new stuff?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emissions - something where you have a set of available missions, like go to the Mun and back, or send a rover to Duna. Maybe you earn money from that and able to expand your base or do whatever?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ereasons to build jets - they\u0027re fun, but there\u0027s not much to explore on Kerbin. Something to add incentive maybe?
