By then, Squad knew that many players would like to have some options. I\u0027ve no clue if the fairing split option will come with 1.0.3."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:08:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Considering the quote is \u0022We\u0027ll add the option to divide them in two panels **after release**\u0022 (emphasis mine), I\u0027m a little curious about how anybody could think that meant it would be in 1.0.\n\nActually the quote I quoted someone quoting said nothing about \u0022after release.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s only one part, which is the fairing as a whole. Fairing *panels* aren\u0027t independent parts, they\u0027re sub-objects of the fairing until you deploy them. A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings. They aren\u0027t fully persistent (which is good if you like your framerates to be a two-digit number). That doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t solid objects, however. Point away from face.\n\u003E \n\u003E Cheers\n\nAnd amusingly this isn\u0027t even the quote I wanted it to be (though it implies some bit of control over number of pieces).

The evidence in code, exposed by Claw\u0027s mod patch show that his \u0022we\u0022 meant Squad, not the players. Squad chose to implement one particular method, but by 1.0 launch day had heard this feedback. \nI agree with / also find it a minor annoyance, that fairing shapes aren\u0027t very persistent if you need to move parts around.
