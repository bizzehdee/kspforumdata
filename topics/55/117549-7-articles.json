Those jets should be 1,875m in outer diameter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new Mk1 \u0022Learjet\u0022 cockpit is good for 0,625m engines but will be too small for 1,25m engines. You\u0027d ideally want a 1,875m fuselage system there that can carry 1,25m payloads (just like the Mk3 can carry 2,5m payloads). This is a great platform for smaller aircraft and SSTOs that are comparable in size to craft like the Avro ARJ, Embraer 145 or the CRJ-800. Essentially, the 1,875m fuselage would be a lot like the Mk3 fuselage, but scaled down to 50% size, with a more cramped two-man cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 would then become more of a wide-body version of the 1,875m round fuselage which can carry more fuel and auxilliary payloads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, 1,875m LFBs and SRBs complement a 2,5m orange tank very nicely for your stock shuttles, and it would work well on Gemini replicas or early Soyuzes. It would also fill the power gap which now exists between the Reliant and the (huge) Poodle, with an 1,875m engine more on par with an SSME or Soyuz RD-117. Bigger, powerful but a fuel guzzler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can really see the lack of a use case for a simple 2-Kerbal pod in current game play missions. Reason? Kerbals can do too much already and SAS-enabled probe cores are available quite early on in the mission, and gravity on other celestial bodies beside Kerbin early on in the game (M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Minmus) is relatively low. A 2-man pod and an Apollo-like mission profile would be more interesting if the masses of those bodies were buffed a bit so you can\u0027t drop your one-crew pod on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, take ALL the science and return with half a tank of fuel left.

And I would love to see a version of stock KSP where I could agree with your second paragraph. The problem is (as I\u0027ve posted elsewhere - can find a link if you wish) is that KSP Career mode at the moment doesn\u0027t do much of \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E. It\u0027s gameplay mechanics are simply too limited to allow for real meaningful tradeoffs. Building a bigger rocket is the answer to most questions and paying for that bigger rocket (which should be one of those tradeoffs) is a matter of grinding out a couple more contracts. Time isn\u0027t a factor so the only thing preventing the player from doing so is personal boredom threshold.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPessimistically, I don\u0027t think this is going to change much. We might get a couple of extra bells and whistles to play with but the core of the game is, I think, going to remain much the same. Therefore, rocket design in KSP* will remain a mostly aesthetic choice, whichever game mode you\u0027re playing in. And that being the case, I think more parts \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E a priority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack\u00A0to the two-kerbal pod - you\u0027re right that its not going to\u00A0change much. However, I\u0027d like one, so that I can fly mixed crews earlier in my game. (As it is, poor old Bill and Bob don\u0027t get to go to space until I\u0027ve unlocked a basic probe core or the Mk2 pod). \u00A0I\u0027d like\u00A0one for flying rescue missions with an actual pilot, again before I unlock the Mk2 pod.\u00A0I\u0027d like one for flying mini-Apollo missions - one crewmember stays in orbit whilst the other goes down to the Mun in\u00A0a Mk1 lander can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will cheerfully concede that none of those scenarios are remotely\u00A0required\u00A0in the current Career game and indeed they\u0027re all arguably sub-optimal over anything we can do with a simple\u00A0Mk1 pod with a probe core glued to the roof.
