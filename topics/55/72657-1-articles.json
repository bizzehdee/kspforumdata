I\u0027m sure that a mod will be produced (or already exists) that can allow us to edit parts but wouldn\u0027t it be nice if we were given a polished and reliably updated tool? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod makers, while wonderful, cannot update their mods forever.. I don\u0027t blame them, of course.

As with anything, practice makes the process easier and faster. But for newcomers, or those that never really delve into this type of thing, it would be nice to have a tool that makes the process simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance: Just to edit the Ion engine (to my desired use) I had to change the Xenon fuel weight (Resource file), the Xenon tank\u0027s fuel quantity (Tank part file), and the engine\u0027s thrust/electrical usage (Engine part file). With my very limited experience, the process took me about an hour of looking up information and game testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T00:23:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought you were going to suggest twerking kerbals!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
