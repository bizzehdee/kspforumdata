It doesn\u0027t have NO physics. it just isn\u0027t using UNITY\u0027s physics, and it has significantly LESS aspects of physics being taken into account. But it doesn\u0027t have \u0022no\u0022 physics at all being taken into account.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as that time-parameter ellipse formula that the on-rails movement is following was calculated based on the fact that position is the second integral of acceleration, and that the acceleration follows the inverse square law of gravitation, then the ellipse itself should still be referred to as at least SOME crude form of following physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is also why I don\u0027t buy the argument that going on rails requires killing all rotation. If you can calculate the linear position using a time parameter equation based on initial position and initial velocity when the object went on rails, then surely you can also calculate the angular position using a time parameter equation based on initial orientation and initial rotational velocity when the object went on rails. In fact the rotational position should be a simpler calculation than the linear position because the rotational velocity is staying constant. It\u0027s just angle at time T = initial angle \u002B T*(rotational velocity). Now granted, if you wanted to calculate tidal effects on rotation it gets more complex, but at least constant rotation is still a huge step up from no rotation, in terms of realism.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-11T05:10:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2013 05:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T05:26:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I completely understand your objection there, unless you are intimately familiar with KSP\u0027s source code, you have absolutely no way of making that kind of assertion with any level of accuracy, my friend \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T15:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile I completely understand your objection there, unless you are intimately familiar with KSP\u0027s source code, you have absolutely no way of making that kind of assertion with any level of accuracy, my friend \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is false.
