Not just purchasing the parts, but assembling them. Building a totally new rocket class would have a significantly higher cost than modifying an existing design, and there would be no developing costs for using an existing build without changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, lets say you you launch a rocket consisting of a single seat lander, fuel tank and an engine. You unlock the next size up fuel tank. You can rebuild a new rocket entirely and it costs for instance twice as much to build it as just adding the new fuel tank to the first rocket you launched. Later you unlock a new engine, you would have a higher cost to build a NEW rocket using that engine than replacing the engine on already designed rocket or adding it as a radial booster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to slow the progression of new rocket designs leading to innovation and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T23:27:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont know, this seems like a tax on creativity?

I don\u0027t think either is a particularly good idea for the exact reason Pthigrivi points out: It\u0027s not necessarily good for game-play. Based on what we do know about the economic system (which is almost nothing), it appears we\u0027re already going to be getting charged science to unlock the node, \u003Cem\u003Ethen funds to unlock individual parts\u003C/em\u003E, and then paying funds for each individual part placed on a vessel. I think paying development costs for subassemblies or vessels is just too much on top of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, if you can make an argument for \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E this kind of mechanic would improve gameplay, I think you\u0027d draw more attention to the suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"geb","CreatedById":5399,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-07T00:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have tried playing career by reusing a common design over and over again.

Using a Munar rocket would eat up the payment because of the fuel and part costs. So without design cost penalty, you slap together a super cheap launch system and bang, contract complete with no regard for the fact that your program has never before launched this type of vehicle.
