I have been thinking about the implications of changing them to make them more \u0022balanced\u0022 as well. Then i started thinking about the bigger picture and came to a simple conclusion that roots back to the name of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince Career mode was implemented in .22, every update has given focus and updates to it(even if it is only a few updates). Little has come in the way of Sandbox upgrades, beyond basic game play updates that help both. Such as the Patch conics updates that make manuver nodes more accurate. The last and most recent update, 23.5, has given us 2 major game play changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Asteroids and their science and game play implications\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. new 3.75 parts, designed after the NASA SLS system\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Asteroids themselves are interesting and add another dimension to the game entirely on their own. The new parts have come under some criticism for being much stronger than generally acceptable. Their high thrust and efficiency basically blow most original parts out of the water. So why would the Dev\u0027s make such strong parts in the first place? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey made the new parts with the future in mind. Not the past, where Sandbox and general game play was all based around flying around with the ships you made. The hard work put into efficient flying machines, and flying them to far off lands all using the older parts seem vulnerable to the newer, stronger more efficient SLS parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the masses call for balance, to counter this new power creep on the age old custom of niche engines, and balance parameters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe argument fits well with the sandbox idealism that KSP has been based around its whole life as a game. Don\u0027t implement something overpowered or the game loses some of its luster as a realistic, hard space sim. Where achieving orbit literally is half of the difficulty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is when the new idea must take place. Where KSP as a game is going to change and take a leap, in the same way I see players of the future KSP taking a leap when they handle a completely different issue we do not deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a simple, single word KSP will change from a sandbox build and launch game, to a more strategic, objective and semi structured game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFunding\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is the only currency career mode has, and it fuels more an unlock to sandbox mode driven career. The Dev\u0027s have already talked about reputation and contracts. This is another step toward what KSP is to become. There is a reason why Kerbal Space Program isn\u0027t Kerbal Space Simulator. You are going to have to run a Space Program, and what is a program without FUNDING. This is where these new parts exist, and their balance parameters come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ARM parts are not designed for sandbox, or should be viewed as a counterpart to the older parts. They represent a new age of Kerbal Space Program. Saying these parts aren\u0027t balanced is viewing things the old way, where all parts are balanced against each other. These parts are designed for the future, where funding, reputation and tech limitations all meet to require a single, massive, effective launch vehicle that needs to be good enough to get a full mission to a distance moon that hasn\u0027t been added yet. You could build multiple launches or a single big pricey one with these parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game has changed, these parts signal it. Living in the past of Kerbal Build Program is going to always have its days, sandbox will always be around. But it wont be the main attraction, it will be Career mode and its challenges that still have to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo give it time to see the new challenges come in career mode.

I find it ironic that people are calling for balanceing parts for sandbox mode in addition to balance for career. Career mode by its nature will need balancing and will have it once it is compleat. Right now its not complete so what balance there is tends to be slightly wacky. Even in its uncompleated state there is a power progression as you climb the tree that is a form of ballance in itself. Eventually we will have to balance costs and such when designing and launching rockets but that critical bit of balance does not exist yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox on the other hand is not ment to be balanced. Its meant to literally be your sandbox. You can build any ship you want, with any parts you want, with no restrictions. The restrictions that would exist in career mode are not pressent in sandbox so some parts will feel inferior to others. That does not mean the newer and stronger parts need to be nerfed, it just means you decided to play in the mode that lacks the restrictions that would make the smaller parts more attractive. Complaining about that is like complaining that the light bulb made the oil lamp obsolete. That oil lamp might be attractive if you have insufficient electricity to run the lightbulb (career mode) but is pointless when you have unlimited power (sandbox) aside from aesthetic reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T01:01:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing through career with ARM now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SLS 2 engine liquid booster is unlocked at the same time as the mainsail.

Career there are limitations preventing the use of the best engines from the beginning. As you climb the tech tree you have access to better and better stuff. Presumably in its final form cost will also play a role as a limiting factor but that is pure speculation at this stage. Sandbox has no gating, presumably cost wont be a factor either (otherwise that would be a significant divergence from the standard usage of sandbox game mode). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d pretty much need every engine to be virtually identical to not end up with a \u0022Best\u0022 engine and hence the on everybody uses in sandbox. Oh you can have some variation to a point such as Ion vs LV-N vs Mainsail where each is good at a specific task such as long range light probe vs long range general vs heavy launch. However within those categories you will always have a best option, the one someone would have to be stupid not to use unless outside limitations (selfimposed or otherwise) prevented you from doing so. The only way to avoid that is to have them all be exactly the same within category, bigger ones simply being scaled up versions of the smaller ones. On the flip side that level of uniformity prety much removes the point of a tech tree. Whats the point of advancing your engine tech if you dont get better engines? If there are better engines how do you not have a \u0022Best\u0022 one when you go into sandbox and remove all the game enforced limitations on what you can use?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T06:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@dodgey\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of changing the engines to \u0022balance\u0022 sandbox until the economics or further balance factors are implemented is sort of a waste of time. To balance the engines only for the dev\u0027s to later change them because of further changes of the game are highly unlikely. I personally do not like the idea of a restrictive sandbox at all. Any good sandbox game gives you everything, even if that means giving you the OP parts from the start. I do not really see any balancing factor that matters for parts not designed for sandbox in the first place. The shell shock of having OP parts in the first place is the main thing the community needs to get their heads around. I do not see a career working without some stronger parts at the end, it would be very much like career mode now. Boring and autonomous, a sandbox game where you need to unlock sandbox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never said the Rapier was OP, it was only advance tech. Its basis as the only two style engine makes it unique. I personally do not believe it to be OP, but it is unique very much like the LV-N. It created its own niche. You could easily call if op because of its ability though. Now a prime example of an actual OP part is the 48-7s. These should be nerfed, as they outperform most other engines when used in bunches. As far as balance in concerned making the best engine the smallest and most part intensive one doesn\u0027t make much practical or game play sense. (my cpu cries)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts just as valid to assume the end game will function as sandbox, as it would be a difficult space program or somewhere inbetween(what i assume is going to happen). The only issue with thinking the parts should be nerfed is why nerf them now if we might need to un-nerf them later? Sandbox isn\u0027t designed to be challenging, unless you make it challenging. So taking these parts effectiveness in sandbox (its good) does not imply they will be good in Career and need to be \u0022balanced\u0022 with sandbox balances, IE less thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the idea of being challenged by the universe is fine for a only sandbox based game.

Making the engines balanced to the curve of other engines is OK and all. It would make both sandbox and career balanced except one issue. Making them balanced would mean they aren\u0027t much better than the other parts. It would also limit the ways of playing the game in career. If the SLS parts are only marginal more effectient then they would only be marginally more expensive. Getting them would just be another step up in capabilities. Even currently having completely balanced options in career mode is somewhat boring. I have never used mainsails in career mainly because they are one of the last things, and all the other engines can more or less cover the heavy lifter engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a balanced engine in general isn\u0027t very rewarding as a goal. You can make it only slightly more balanced but it also means you will have to make it only slightly less financially expensive. If it were to stay overpowered it would give a career player two distinct ways to play career once they get at the end of the tech tree. Invest into something better, but more expensive or use less effective but cheaper launch methods. I do not see this working with only marginally better parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the thing about power creep, if it doesn\u0027t exist you limit gameplay options and make the game boring. If you implement it to hard it might make things to \u0022easy\u0022. But the creep in this game is only at the end of career, for end game and player efficiency if they have better funding. This is a basic concept that is common sense so having these engines this powerful would warranty much higher prices in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving to much attention so the sandbox aspect of the game isn\u0027t doing the game much justice.
