IRL, SpaceX has two variants of the basic Merlin engine in use: atmospheric (Stage 1) and vacuum (Stage 2). Their performances are naturally going to be different, but they are based off of the same Merlin engine series. I can see how this could be done now using the same modules as the RAPIER, but that allows modes to be switched in flight. I\u0027d like to see it work similarly to the Firespitter mesh switching, where the engine has two or more potential meshes, one for each engine variant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might not be totally useful to do this because there\u0027s already so many engines available, but it would at least be cool to see in action. If nothing else, this could be really useful if/when you have to take the number of parts you have in stock into account (e.g. you have 5 LV-Ts in stock and they can be either great in atmo or great in vacuum, which may in turn require a change to how ISP is handled by engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea is getting more complex as I keep going on, so I\u0027ll stop now.
