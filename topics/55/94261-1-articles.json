There\u0027s also the slight problem that PhysX isn\u0027t really designed for simulating physics at the quality you need for orbital mechanics - it\u0027s more for handling things like grenades in FPSs and so on where you don\u0027t really need the same level of accuracy, as long as it looks good. There might still be a decent improvement on the CPU side with unity 5 (perhaps this is what you\u0027re talking about - I don\u0027t keep up to date with unity or PhysX), but I don\u0027t think we can expect KSP to have GPU PhysX when unity 5 is integrated. There is also the not-so-small problem that GPU PhysX only works with nVidia cards - it is their technology.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
