Contracts should just reward their base, getting bonus science from them should be tacked onto the mission; possibly with extra experiments adding onto a \u0022bonus science\u0022 section of the contract(along with the science you gain from the experiment itself.) Science/rep/funds would not be converted automatically via a strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the Administration building should, well, function administratively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new admin building would have strategies for something like milestone research. The admin building would now denote contract prerequisites (along with milestones.)

The new strategies contain a subset of R\u0026amp;D technologies, which after you gain X amount of science while having the strategy active; allows you to spend your science points in technology of your choosing, that is in the activated Strategy subtype. Tying KSC building upgrade prerequisites into the R\u0026amp;D tree limited by how much progression you have in a specific strategy would be neat too (of course you need the funds to purchase the upgrade for your facility buildings themselves.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T01:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you give an example of how this would work?
