Using FAR, DRE, Procedural fairings, the fairing is a bit over the top with so many command pods inside it but I never let that stop me before! I have DRE set up with exponent 1.12 to make re-entry realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I have is detaching each craft so they can re-enter separately, once they drift 5km away from each other they get killed! I would really like the option of simulating all atmospheric interactions to their conclusion even if the craft was on the other side of the planet. My plan was to have a whole flock of capsules parachute down, would have looked cool if I could pull it off but instead I ended up killing a whole bunch of Kerbals because they drifted 5km away \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E (the parachutes were on auto deploy so would have done an unassisted landing otherwise).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T04:19:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile a great idea in concept since KSP is currently stuck being 32bit and single threaded an increase in load distance would massively increase lag and RAM usage.
