Its mostly my fault, but I figured it would be easier for newer players if portable glide scopes could be researched in career mode to help set people land space planes at bases just out of visual range. I also think it would help the idea of bases on planets, by helping locate bases without having to go into map or try to guess how to land at a certain area that might not be flat. Of course you can aim the glide scope, so you can aim it straight up or out, depending on what you want to land there. Aiming it up would be for landing rockets or landers, and it would guide them to an area, so you could equip it on a rover and stop the rover in one area to land a resupply mission. or other cool things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sevant","CreatedById":97597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T05:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting better at manually lining things up (with very flat approaches), but that\u0027s just because the alternative was to keep crashing into the ground or flying over the runway...or over the grass to the side of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-06T09:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI doubt SQUAD will go for it since they routinely avoid making dedicated tools for any kind of vehicle.

Of course, it would drain a lot of battery power and be unusable in space. Just so that would be used for resupplying rovers and finding bases or landing. It would most likely be a default part of the space center for space planes. But my problem was originally that I couldn\u0027t line up with the space center in a SSTO, and that a glide scope would help people line up with the space center from a further distance, but I wouldn\u0027t mind if they changed the maneuver nodes to account for drag caused by atmosphere. I\u0027m trying to create something that would help newer players, but could be used in different ways by people who are experienced.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-06T19:47:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2014 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nightwinds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
