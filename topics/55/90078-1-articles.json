Ive seen some screenshots from the educational version of KSP and wondered if the GUI that is used for it could be installed to regular KSP as an alternate interface? I really liked the look and feel of it and thought it would be great for people that are just new to the game as I noticed the information panel that shows you what parts are required and what you actually have set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not suggesting that the EDU version replace the current gui.. but offer it as an alternate.. I personally would really like to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
