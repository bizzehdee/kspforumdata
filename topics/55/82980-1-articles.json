It would make reading a lot clearer for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edots at thousands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor organising my space missions and to make all available information more comprehensible it would be helpfull to have the \u003Cstrong\u003Eoption to group active contracts\u003C/strong\u003E. I would use each group for each specific mission. It would also sort the active contracts more logically. It would also be my preference that the default state of the active contracts in the \u003Cstrong\u003Econtracts GUI in flight mode \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewould be\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E minimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the next subject was already being discussed, but for totallity: I would like the \u003Cstrong\u003Eoption to switch mods on/off for specific savegames\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel as though the \u003Cstrong\u003E(f3) results dialoge is an unfortunate omission to the mission summary dialoge\u003C/strong\u003E. Perhaps squad can \u003Cstrong\u003Einclude some more events\u003C/strong\u003E, like new science, reports, dockings, flag plantings, SOI changes, landings, splashdowns,etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, it would be my preference if the default state of the \u003Cstrong\u003Eflags buttons in the trackingstation/map view would be grayed out\u003C/strong\u003E. They are not active flights in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And really finally, i think it would be cool for \u003Cstrong\u003Esome kind of log\u003C/strong\u003E.

It would be nice to see funds recovered quietly (e.g. from launch clamps) and to have direct comparison between ship launch price and ship recovery value but so far I have not found it really necessary for further progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGroup separators in fund amounts would definitely help, sometimes it\u0027s uncertain if I\u0027m looking at millions or tens of millions.

In most cases I did not send another mission until the earlier mission was over. But yeah that\u0027s my playstyle and other players can have different preferences. On some occasions even I was thinking that it would be nice to have contracts assigned to a ship so I can see its own contracts at the top of list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a way how to have mods switched on/off for different saves: Make a copy of the whole KSP directory (or as many copies as is the number of different mod combinations you want to use) and have each with the set of mods you want to use there. It\u0027s not very comfortable, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present, mods are loaded when the game starts and stay loaded the whole time.
