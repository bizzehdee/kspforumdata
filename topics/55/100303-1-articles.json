(for auto opening solar panels after fairing release. or auto deploy landing legs after abort)\n- Adding time delays to parts in staging list \u0026 action groups. (you could theoretically automate your entire launch with this)\n\nI think these would be fairly easy to implement, at least for the UI. Add a option when you right click a staging icon or part. something like this = Delay:[000] (\u002B)(-)\n\nI know if squad are not already planning this then its unlikely to make it in to the final release, but hey, you cant blame a guy for trying. ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:44:57Z","Content":"Small details make a better enjoyment of a thing. \n\nI already wrote this reply to other threads asking nearly the same. \n\nIt is a big yes especialy for the ability to add autodoing for pre set things. \n\nI am not lazy but these are forgotten as always type \u0022errors\u0022 or fasten up the ordinarily manualy doable things. So it makes more inportant aspects to get more attention."}]}
