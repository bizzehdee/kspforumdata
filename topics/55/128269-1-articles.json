I often have everything set up on the launch pad and screw something up in the ascent. I can revert to \u0022launch\u0022 but that is REALLY reverting to vehicle rollout. The actual launch may have come hours later after careful planning to set everything up to launch into the plane of a target. Can we PLEASE get a true revert to launch that would bring us back to the state everything was in at ignition? The existing \u0022revert to launch\u0022 could be renamed something like \u0022revert to rollout\u0022 and the revert to assembly would be left alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s WAY aggravating to have to set everything up for launch again when I know that it\u0027s a flight problem I\u0027m having and the pre-launch setup was fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-20T17:24:51Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2015 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jeb was a good Kerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T18:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get all this set up and then quicksave before firing up.
