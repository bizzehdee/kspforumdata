Not sure if it\u0027s still a bug as I\u0027ve been building mods mostly since 0.23, but in 0.22 at very least, there were many incidents in vehicle assembly which would remove some green hard points from displaying and functioning when adding a new \u0027first part\u0027 after removing the last one. Resuming construction on that assembly then became very difficult. I have no suggestion for this other than it should be smoothed out a bit if it wasn\u0027t in 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

I don\u0027t think this is a function of weather, so I\u0027ll suggest it. Mun and Minmus should be brighter in the night sky, and while in space.

I know a flexible material is not currently in the game plan, but it would assist Modders a lot if there was a framework for it - in much the same way there\u0027s a framework for struts based on end-points. My current thoughts are that a series of joints, with a procedural coating spanning the space between the joints to form a length of umbilical would work - joint number and rigidity could be defined by the part.cfg and you have yourself another cheap thing to do in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.

Visually, Arora is a big part of LEO if you have a window and aren\u0027t orbiting equatorially. It seems like it could be a weather effect so I put it \u0022below the line\u0022, but this one seems like a no-brainer. Then again so does (taboo)lagrange(/taboo), but that has better reasons to be exempt from the game. Perhaps look to the methods implemented by games like World of Warcraft, which does half-decent arora rendering on the extreme-cheap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When the (taboo)Multiplayer(/taboo) is created for 1.0 (or whenever) you could address the problem of launch platform occupation by utilizing Different Countries with thier own efforts, and facilities. After all, there is almost nothing that embodies our own Space Trips like multi-national collaboration - ie NASA rides the Soyuz from the snow now instead of just Russian engines from sunny Florida, why? Because working together gets you places. Countries, it\u0027s amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Considering Kerbals are little green men, inhabiting a different stellarsystem, they would do some things differently to Humanity. Where Kerbals live is a much hated issue it seems, since the processing cost of rendering anything is enormous. However I came up with a cheap and exciting solution! Mexico-city based architectural firm BNKR Arquitectura made a big fuss a while back about the concept of what was coined \u0022Earthscraper\u0022. The way I see it, there is a very small amount of triangles in what is effectively a lid - which due to it\u0027s form-factor can easily be rendered as very low-res 2D sprite graphics at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chainchomp","CreatedById":101055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T13:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, Marco (Samsonart) and Miguel (Maxmaps) mentioned (in the recent Devnotes thread about the NASA Mission Pack unveiling) they\u0027ll be giving the rapidly aging tutorials an overhaul.

Example being the way some old RTS games had a booming industry of user-generated content involving maps and campaign design. Considering you already host mod content upload/download from servers, surely resources for holding a mission portal for a community focused collaboration aren\u0027t so much of a problem, but I wouldn\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Build a UI function which can deliver mission directives to the HUD as a mission is selected from a window (pre-launch? post-launch?). The window acting as a download interface for a xx-kilobyte mission file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Build a tool for designing lightweight/superficial mission files (ie, doesn\u0027t require downloading new hard content, just directives, time-frames, etcetera). \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003EThe cheap version is a part to tag flights to record, but would be a bit clumsy to use, and frustrating if a cool mission hasn\u0027t got the part, and thus misses out. With this I\u0027m thinking that Supreme Commander does a good job of game recording, as it stores all certain variables of a previous match in volatile memory in case after a match you suddenly feel like you wanted it to be recorded - in KSP however, if all flights were stored in a similar way to this, it would limit mission recording to isolated blocks of \u0022while computer is on\u0022, which I suppose could be fairly easily sewn back together if they were all recorded, checking to see if end and begin positions of a flight are the same for authentication purposes... this recording could be augmented with the tool initially mentioned in this suggestion (10). Alternatively, you could allow the engaging of a mission recording within the same session as launch occurred. Alternatively again you could allow for a mission to determine whether it starts from launch or from being docked in whichever altitude situation the station is in around the planet its orbiting. THAT is a good idea, anyway, enough thinking \u0027aloud\u0027.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11-a. Build a lightweight, local executable which KSP feeds any mission files created by the user, which talks with a mission file server and acts as an upload interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11-b. Build and have hosted a portal which can find and list mission files without browsing, in order to upload them using a web-based interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11-ideal. Have KSP talk with a mission file server and have a UI window element act as an upload interface, as well as the browse/filter/download interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. Pardon my reality but this would definitely create a lot of unreasonable content, so as I said to start with, this would require some quality control. Even if it was just a user-generated ranking function for mission listings with any negative listings that don\u0027t appear to be returning to a positive rank after x-timeframe being removed from mission file servers perhaps to save on space. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003EThis would ensure that there would be a similar sense of aiming high to that which exists in the Modding Community, because I mean... nobody wants to be the author of a terrible mod, but it happens, and their rank feedback is visible enough that avoiding or engaging with that content is easy pancakes instead of hours of tedious trial and error sifting.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, these are just suggestions and I\u0027m sure we all know that here, but the more I think about this, the more I can\u0027t find anything wrong with it.

Venus analogue, is, unbelievably enough, a tremendously boring place. When I got into orbit there, I was hoping for dense atmosphere that posed all sorts of challenges, I had not looked too closely, again, this was early in my experience. (spoilers) I was disappointed to find a vague visual atmosphere. I wasn\u0027t depressed by this, I was still simply Jebediah to be there, in orbit around Eve. However, the story goes on, and to more relevant places. (spoilers) I land, after a very exciting trip down (not sarcasm, I was nearly dying of excitement), I roved the terrain for a while, and decided it was a tragic waste of time outside of the cold hard science points (going to another planet for a numerical score IS depressing though). I decided it would be far more interesting with biomes to attempt to reach, and something, anything (except long boring distances) standing in your roving way. Now... (spoilers) I had solar panels, which as we all know = infinite energy to travel infinte distances by wheels. This killed my enjoyment of Eve to the point where I\u0027m very unlikely to ever go back, even for the numerical score.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there are a small few things that could create a wriggling serpent out of Eve. Thus, suggestions (Warning! Harshness incoming):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. Obscuring atmosphere which requires the use of scanning technology to determine at very least a safe place to land. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003EWhich may well already be contained within mods for satellite tech and clouds, respectively, but that doesn\u0027t mean \u0022any place is fine - it doesn\u0027t matter\u0022 is a good motto for interplanetary landing (not that anyone has said that to my knowledge, but that\u0027s what the game is currently saying).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14. Atmospheric heat affecting parts. Ok, so maybe degrading parts is expressly condemned, but I mean wear and tear aren\u0027t necessary in a game like this, I completely agree! (spoilers) But you can land on the surface of the local star, get out, and walk around, warp time to 100,000. And everything is fine. (spoilers) So what happens after \u0022Everything is melting, including the electronicsssss...\u0022? You have a picnic on the sun, of course. What would cause Eve to pose a challenge? If your rover melted in the insane atmospheric conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15. \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003EFinite energy. Unlike fuel, there is infinite energy out there as well as on Kerbin. Maybe it\u0027s unimportant, because for example, the Mars rovers\u0027 power supplies all last and have lasted far longer than any of my MET durations. This is also something worth discussing heavily. Rovers have, literally, no reason to be resupplied, and outside of both removing any science from them for transport back home and exploring biomes which are \u0026gt;50km apart, no reason to be followed if they contain enough experiments, have wheels, and solar panels.
