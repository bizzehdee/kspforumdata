Although you could have a camera that display a shot of terrain \u0022below\u0022 the craft (relative to your point of control) with wireframes shown, or indeed with a relative height-map. Wireframes would give you shape, the heighmapt would tell you where the terrain is most flat (less tone change=more flat).
