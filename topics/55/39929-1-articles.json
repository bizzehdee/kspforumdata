However, if they have the older tail gear arrangement like the cessna, then it is the tail gear that turns. What I would really like to see is more landing gears. There would be a landing gear that can rotate, but has a lower impact tolerance, a small landing gear with a very high impact tolerance to help prevent tailstrikes and destroyed engines, and maybe some landing skids like on the original Wright Flyer. There\u0027s a lot of stuff that needs to be updated as far as aircraft parts go, probably more than they realize.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T23:57:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear probably won\u0027t be motorised because that would make the wheels sort of redundant.
