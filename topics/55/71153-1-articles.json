I\u0027d like to suggest some slight re-ordering of those values so that the primary values we most often look for are in the mouseover view instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, things like max temperature, crash tolerance and drag should be in the extended panel, not the main mouseover view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-01T19:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the thrust value is hidden there, at least I can see it pretty well in the box at the upper right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BDfXRS5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BDfXRS5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETorque values are hidden but I don\u0027t think they\u0027re as important. Besides, right-click changes the mode, so all subsequent windows open in full mode if you move the mouse over parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate if the main view had both dry and wet mass. As it is, there\u0027s only wet mass there, i.e. including all resources. But dry mass is pretty important as well and it needs to be calculated by subtracting mass of contained resources from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, parts should not \u0022lie\u0022. For instance parachutes say their drag is 0.1 in main window, and in RMB window they say their stowed drag is 0.22. But the worst situation is in crash tolerance because that value is completely wrong for many parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there should be units next to all values. Even if they\u0027re arbitrary, there should be a marker that they\u0027re arbitrary.
