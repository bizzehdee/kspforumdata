I\u0027ll leave aside the argument as to what the volume unit is but simply put that cannot possibly match the stats of a LANTR which uses liquid hydrogen \u002B liquid oxygen as its propellants. The problem here is that liquid hydrogen in a typical NTR has an Isp of 850-910. Somewhat higher Isp is possible. Thrust of 60 kN is on the low end for a smaller NTR but within range \u003Cem\u003Eif we\u0027re only talking about hydrogen as the propellant\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a LANTR, liquid oxygen is injected into the nozzle into the supersonic exhaust stream right after it exits the throat. This has the effect of lowering Isp and raising thrust. The exact amounts depends on ratio of LOX/H2. Ratios of 1.0 to 7.0 have been calculated which drops Isp to the low 700s for a ratio of 1.0 (LOX to H2 by mass, not by volume) and into the low 500s up to a ratio of 7.0. Thrust would be increased into the mid to high 500s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe numbers just aren\u0027t even really close to convince me that the LVN is actually operating in LANTR mode. Isp is too high and thrust is too low. (Edit: and propellant is too dense. Low density exhaust = higher Isp. Higher density exhaust = lower Isp. Thrust tends to be higher for high density propellant because it\u0027s based on exhaust velocity x mass flow)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis page here has some decent information the data table has been floating around for years in various proposals for NTR usage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nss.org/settlement/moon/LANTR.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nss.org/settlement/moon/LANTR.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-22T01:33:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2014 01:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T11:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou missed my point.
