That said, this is a discussion so let\u0027s discuss it. Here are my thoughts on the matter:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not true that \u0022other star systems\u0022 == \u0022random star systems\u0022, and likewise it is also not true that \u0022procedurally generated star systems\u0022 == \u0022random star systems,\u0022 since as many others have said (including former dev NovaSilisko), even if they were to procedurally generate other star systems, the seed they use would be the same so even then it would be \u0022random\u0022 only in the sense that it\u0027s only one of a literally infinite number of possibilities that could have existed for the game. Between players it would in fact be the same game, so I don\u0027t see how HarvesteR\u0027s comment stands up to any scrutiny here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as arguments for other star systems go, I think that rather than adding new planets to the Kerbin system (which is already bursting at the seams with plenty of content to explore) the devs should welcome the opportunity to appease the loads of \u0022moar planets plz\u0022 people out there, while still providing a natural evolution to the challenge curve. As it stands now, once you\u0027ve visited all of Jool\u0027s moons you\u0027ve pretty much exhausted as much of the challenge as there is (whether visiting Eeloo with its highly eccentric orbit is more of a challenge than visiting Jool still doesn\u0027t defeat my point). Not only would other star systems provide a logical next level of challenge and exploration, but it would allow players the opportunity to experience first hand one of the greatest adventures in science fiction. Consider that there aren\u0027t any other games out there on the market that offer the player a chance to reproduce any of their favorite missions from Science Fiction. If I want to reproduce of the flight of the Ad Astra from Starbound, KSP might very well be the only game in the world that allows me to do that in full 3D space, with complete flight controls and all of the associated engineering challenges. That has the potential to draw new players on its own merits!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as interstellar flight in the game introducing non-realistic technologies such as warp drive, I have two main things to address on that front:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) 60 years ago the space shuttle and the ISS would probably have been written off as a pipe dream in the unrealistic minds of science fiction writers. Who can say what technologies will be possible in another 60 years of diligent research and development, and why does KSP have to be grounded in the here and now? The game already has the NERVA engine, with its ridiculous vacuum ISP an obvious niche as an interplanetary engine. Last I checked the space agencies of the world as they exist today aren\u0027t exactly brimming with nuclear engines (the same argument also applies to the new RAPIER by the way). My point: just because a technology doesn\u0027t exist today doesn\u0027t mean that as a concept it doesn\u0027t have merits that may render it possible at some point in the future, and if there exists the possibility that an engine might work then why can\u0027t KSP explore that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Why should KSP only be grounded in what is possible? This is a game about building the impossible and accomplishing things that have not / are not/ will not / can not be accomplished by real life space agencies. The forums are brimming with people who build SSTO spacecraft, extraterrestrial mining operations, plan and execute massive grand tour missions, and create the wildest of contraptions on a whim just because the game allows them to. This makes KSP one of the greatest pieces of science fiction around, because it\u0027s the fiction that enables people to free their mind and make the impossible possible. By adding tools that are not 100% realistic (and lets be honest, until now almost every decision the devs have made has (rightly) gone in the favor of gameplay over realism anyway so it\u0027s not like this is unprecedented), they\u0027d be giving the game and its players an opportunity to take their creations to the next logical conclusion of freedom and difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd don\u0027t tell me \u0022it breaks gameplay because then players would only exclusively use that new technology\u0022 because you\u0027ve already put into place a system to ensure that that doesn\u0027t happen: either a player is in sandbox mode in which case it\u0027s their right to use whichever technology they want for whatever purpose they want to use it for, or they are in career mode in which case they must already navigate the tech tree and science system (which is game-breaking already, and needs massive improvements anyway) in order to unlock it. Currently the tech tree does nothing but delay the player from getting the technology they need to explore what\u0027s already been given to them, so this would give them exactly the opportunity they\u0027d need to turn it into an engine that drives the development of player abilities, instead of restricting us until we collect enough extraterrestrial dirt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s all I have to say about that...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T07:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 07:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tntristan12\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
