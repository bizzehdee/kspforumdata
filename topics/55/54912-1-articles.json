One for the part that gets dropped and one for the part that carries on so I would change the name of the part that dropped to \u0060bigrocket stage 1\u0060 and the part that carries on could be changed to \u0060mediumrocket\u0060. When the second decoupler fires it could call the dropped part \u0060bigrocket stage 2\u0060 and rename the part that carries on as \u0060smallrocket\u0060. When the last decoupler fires the part that drops could be called \u0060bigrocket stage 3\u0060 and the part that carries on could be \u0060payload\u0060\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the main craft being flown by the player would change name like bigrocket, mediumrocket, smallrocket, payload but the debris that falls would be called bigrocket stage 1, bigrocket stage 2, bigrocket stage 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be very handy for landers and multipart craft.

I see far more uses for the payload side of things. On my current KerPollo mission for example, I would like the lander to be called such when staged as well as the ALSEP and the rover. The system I propose would apply to all these situations and the names would be attributes which could be set in the VAB instead of auto generated names which are FAR too long for the space allocated for them. Then staged parts with no option to rename would also have the correct names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has many benefits and no deficits as far as I can see as if the user does nothing they get the current system so would not notice any change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike action groups. Some users do not use them at all and they notice no deficit. To those who do use them they are very very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
