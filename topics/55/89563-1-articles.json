I\u0027m aware of squad dropping the \u0022experience will not affect part\u0022 statement.

And only for a few that make sense. Extending a solar panel is ok, but increasing trust on the fly is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejeb can change the focus lens on hubble to a bigger one, not magically make the old one see better if jeb is looking in the visor (might not be the best illustration ..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eis it clearer ?
