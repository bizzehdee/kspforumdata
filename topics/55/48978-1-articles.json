It seems clear that the only way to do this is with a full-on kerbalization of the the process. If you lack decouplers use a bunch of SRBs configured to overheat at just the right moment. Landing legs optional, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile its an interesting challenge I think it does constitute abuse of the system and shouldn\u0027t be possible in the final release. I also think it is evidence that the current system whereby power consumption is the major limiting factor on the amount of science that can be gained is deeply flawed. I would suggest dramatically reducing the power consumption of transmitters and instead implementing any combination of the following approaches:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Transmitters are not initially available, everything must be recovered from landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Limit the number of components that can be placed on a launch vehicle by the tech level. The initial launch vehicle might have to be made of as few as 4 parts (essentially mandating a suborbital flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Limit currency/science is converted to currency (presumably by the government).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

I think the current \u0022electrical power is the limiting factor\u0022 does make it downright possible for new ones. Yes an experienced player can deal the complex interactions and trade-offs involved in managing power consumption through transmission vs. power generation from timed burns vs. power needed to keep the reaction wheels going, and generate 400 science on their first launch. A novice is going to feel that they did well to get 30 science on their first launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe novice are going to struggle just to keep the craft pointed up, to add to that a demand they must properly time their experiments and transmissions to have the power needed to complete their experiments just seems like too much to ask. The limitations I am suggesting would actually make the game easier for the novice. Everyone\u0027s first flight is a simple suborbital launch and splashdown. Yes its more scripted but it gives that novice player some time to ramp up to the real game. Think of the first 5 flights as the introductory level you see in other games. After those first few flights then maybe take the kid-gloves off and allow people to really go crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen someone says they complete the tech tree in two flights, I think that can be really damaging to the player experience of others. Imagine if the first time you sat down to play Mario you were next to some guy took advantage of a bug used by speed-runners to complete the entire game in 2 minutes. I realize the game isn\u0027t a competition, but people are by nature competitive and if there is nothing to compete for that\u0027s going to hurt the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firefueled","CreatedById":72026,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T22:30:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was going to create a thread but you are touching on the two main things I wanted to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is frustrating to not know what I have to do to gain science and there is no explanation on when I should transmit the data.

One thing I think is ridiculous about the current system is that a good player will know that while his rocket is throttled up and flying in the atmosphere he needs to be actively clicking to generate and transmit crew reports. When he is 30,000m above the ground on a sub-orbital flight he is supposed to get out and perform an EVA. If this is supposed to be something like a tutorial... then that is just insane!! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the brand new player on his very first flight THE ONLY thing that player should be doing is keeping his rocket pointed up. Nothing else. As it stands the game is this really confusing and weird mini game that doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy do I generate science for going on an EVA on Kerbal? WTF? Why do I get science for rocks from the home planet? A novice player will never thing to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get extra science for different areas where I take samples... It makes logical sense, but the current game graphics don\u0027t do enough to really distinguish the planets so its hard to know how to configure your orbits in order to get those benefits. What is high vs low mun orbit? I don\u0027t know where the cut-off is so I have to play the mini game where I check the crew-report every 10000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it currently stands I find the science gathering to be harder than the real game (partly because I refuse to cheat and won\u0027t go Scott Manley style and build a rocket that intentionally explodes), and I am not a novice. I can only imagine how confusing this will be to a brand-new player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some really good ideas but they need to be isolated. First flight being and SRB supported sub-orbital launch makes excellent sense. Getting science for flying over different areas of Kerbal or the Mun make sense, but it needs to be clear to the player what those areas are. Something like the Kethane map might be useful. Perhaps even better get rid of the whole manual crew report nonsense and have it automatically trigger for each area. Store the crew report that gives the most science benefit and automatically dump the others. If there is some desire to keep the transmission parts then automatically transmit provided there will be sufficient power afterwards/reduce the transmission power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently playing the modded tree: \u0022KSP-TV\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 Yargnit\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Tree\u0022 and its actually an enjoyable process to build up to something like a real mun landing. A big part of that comes from transmission not entering the game until after the first few launches. It means you don\u0027t have to spam transmissions in low Kerbal orbit, and you have the batteries you need to support some real scientific research. Its much more enjoyable than losing kerbonauts to dead spaceships in munar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T05:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe criticism is absolutely legitimate if we make the assumption that the tech tree is intended to represent \u0022post-sandbox\u0022 content.

Stock equals boredom if you are around long enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAVIDESCOTT","CreatedById":77876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T23:08:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is no downside in doing stuff like high atmosphere EVAs much later.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there is. Its not a downside in that you don\u0027t get the points, its a downside in the feeling that you aren\u0027t progressing. The feeling of progression in the game is going to come from flying to or landing on the next moon or planet. It feels annoying to me to know that you can get to Jool and perform experiments there but still have points to accumulate upon landing back on Kerbol. Where is the progression? Why did we go there when there was still stuff to do here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HaDeZs","CreatedById":88363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T02:37:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the end its not about a timeline progression. Its about adding an achievable value in the game for people to acquire and give the same sandbox mentality where people can acquire it the way they want to. I don\u0027t think the game should put more constraints on people, the tree is constraining already but its a great tool to get people into the game and learn to build. If I want to get science by building a jet and flying around kerbal one day and the next morning I wake up and want to practice flyby\u0027s on the moons for science then I should be free to do so. I think this update is excellent in its execution and it gives the devs at kerbal a GREAT base of idea\u0027s to grow the \u0022endgame\u0022 out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027m on the same spaceboat as Polaris. I played with the game a while back but there was no real goal for the game aside from a rocket physics engine. This update changed that for a lot of people that play games like I do and have the same view. Like, I can sit and play for hours on some minecraft servers building and playing around on the server but if I go on my own private server I won\u0027t build or do anything. I loved the idea of kerbal, just got bored with the lack of goals in the game. Plus the plethora of parts available at the start is very daunting and hard for a newbie to jump into without spending hours on youtube watching scott videos =)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
