It would be ideal for testing-part contracts, so that you could use any left-over test parts you may have for a real mission. I think SQUAD considered doing something like this once, but decided instead to just make the experimental parts cost part of the contract advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-31T21:12:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t have to buy a part you\u0027re going to test.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamShanky","CreatedById":127299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T00:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t have to buy a part you\u0027re going to test.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be a \u0022Break it, you buy it\u0022 system for first time buying it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T03:08:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Javster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Javster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t have to buy a part you\u0027re going to test.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure when nasa tests they pay for everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaLVin-K","CreatedById":118452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T02:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDooz this is only correct if say NASA wants Lockheed to build them an engine and then NASA tests it.
