But I am simply only playing the game the way I like to play the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer ballistic approaches to other bodies in space. I never learned how to do maneuvers. I don\u0027t use them. Every rocket so far has always been manually controlled for the entire flight by my keyboard. This is how I began teaching myself to play the game because the launch base is on the equator. This is how I like to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found that flying tourists to 70,000 m and landing safely with parachutes is a quick way to build a mountain of money. So that is all I did until all my facilities were fully upgraded and I had all the money I wanted. If I ever went into orbit around Kerbin, then the tourists would want to orbit. Instead I used the same 30 passenger vehicle repeatedly. Each flight only costs me the fuel. And the money is jackpot money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt gets boring. So I wanted to take tourists to the Mun and back without orbiting Mun and without orbiting Kerbin because then tourists would want the orbits. I landed on the Mun and returned safely never entering any orbit. But then the tourists wanted orbits anyway.\u00A0 Now my jackpotting the game is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy go into orbit to land on the Mun when the Mun is already orbiting me? On the equator with my launch pad, no less! Well, because the game has no clock to set the time of day for your launch time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo problem. I straight up\u00A0launched my six identical 80 million meter relays one hour intervals after the first launch. As long as they get past everything without entering other spheres of gravity, then they arrive in order they were launched.\u00A0I sent them into orbit one at a time in order as each ran out of acceleration and began\u00A0descent. At that distance it happens so slowly that it easy to catch then all. Hard to screw up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know what I will hear if I explain why. I\u0027ve seen reactions on other forums asking if it is possible to target the sun. Many responses are aggressively attacking the premise of why you would want to target the sun. Many responses I have read are angry people who write as if they are furious at the poster for even thinking to target the sun. LOL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I won\u0027t explain why I want to target the sun. And I won\u0027t explain the easy cheat I built with relays that works just as good as a clock. But no clock means no launches at midnight and no launches at noon and no launches at sunrise or sunset. I think you can\u0027t target the sun because that would give you a clock that you can use to time launches. And it seems to me the intent could be deliberately cornering the players into not using clocks. Why do I have to build my own clock for a game that calls \u0022Mystery Goo\u0022 science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think clocks would be very\u00A0interesting in this game.\u00A0 At the very least, Kerbal time would be useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-29T00:20:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/29/2020 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 29, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Techclerk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-29T01:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a clock in the upper left.
