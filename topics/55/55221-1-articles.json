Well, it stops eating FPS tracking (for the most part) the location of an object that will probably never move again. Let\u0027s say that unless you get within 200,000 meters of the object, you\u0027ll just be told that it\u0027s \u0022somewhere on Mun\u0022 or whatever. If you get close, then real-time tracking begins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, you can always uncheck the box whenever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasoning: I\u0027ve landed 4 craft on the Mun and planted three or four flags around some planets.
