I suggest adding five new spheres of influence per (bigger) celestial object in the game, one for each Lagrange point of the body. At least for Kerbin, Eve, Jool, and Mun. Some new SOIs should be near trivial to implement?\n\nIt would open up nice possibilities for new contract types, space stations, refueling stations, asteroid parking areas, and what nots.\n\nObviously, the Duna-Ike system is not a good candidate, and both the Dres and Eeloo are too close to Jool to have any stable Lagrange points. And perhaps Kerbin is too close to Eve for stable L4/L5 as well?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T11:10:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 11:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ftunk70**"},{"CreatedByName":"Unheld","CreatedById":74707,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T11:43:30Z","Content":"Although Lagrange points or adding \u0022planets\u0022 (SOIs) are in the \u0022not to suggest\u0022-list, I find this idea somewhat intriguing.\n\nSo before anybody closes this thread, maybe it could be moved into the \u0022mod request\u0022 section?\n\nMaybe this idea is worth trying out?\n\nUsing SOI, a Lagrange point could maybe realised as a rather small SOI with a weak gravitational pull. I think one would need this weak pull for orbits guaranteeing that an object stays inside this SOI and doesn\u0027t drift outside.\n\nThose Lagrange point SOIs should maybe be visible in the tracking station.\n\nI don\u0027t know however if it is possible for modders to prescribe the orbit for these SOIs or if they are computed from the orbital mechanics of the game?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T11:45:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Unheld**"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:03:02Z","Content":"This suggestion gets brought up pretty much every time Lagrange points get mentioned.
