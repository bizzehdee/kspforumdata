This game has been out for WELL over a year and progress is incredibly slow, I remember staying up all day waiting for the space stations update to be released because everyone was so stoked about it. We haven\u0027t even gotten to 1.00 we\u0027re still at .25 and what did we get from waiting for so long? Contracts that don\u0027t make sense, a COUPLE of new parts, and a destructible space center? I mean, I understand that this stuff takes a long time but it\u0027s gotten to the point that I\u0027ve not regretted purchasing the game before it even became very popular. If what you guys need is funding then you guys should be more transparent about what\u0027s going on with the game/company and start releasing dlc. Also it seems as if you\u0027ve guys have off loaded like 80% of the games production to people developing mods which to be quite frank is horrible. A lot of the mods need like 5 other mods to work, then those mods need mods. It seems as if I want to put a mod here, I\u0027ve got to spend an hour downloading, reading the read me\u0027s, and doing what it said only to have issues pop up. All in all everything seems to be a mess right now and I think there needs to be a change of things. Just my 2 cents on it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T17:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThen don\u0027t play it.

SIX! Squad had listened to what the players want and they have delivered, at the same time creating unthought-of additions that almost everyone agrees is awesome.
