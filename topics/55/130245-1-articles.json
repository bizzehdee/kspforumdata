I haven\u0027t played it in a while, but if I remember correctly, you press a button and then you see a replay of what happened in the last game session. You can move the camera, pause it and take a screenshot, and save the recording. Other games have similar systems as well. As I would LOVE to see this in KSP, I doubt the devs would want to work on it over things like bugfixes and part balancing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T19:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would quite like this feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn option to turn it off would be sensible, and a\u00A0toggle for showing/hiding the UI on playback.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely not a priority for the devs, but probably a\u00A0candidate for integrating an existing mod though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T19:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSearch the forums.
