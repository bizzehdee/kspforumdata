The difference between the deflated version and the inflated version is the height, diameter is uneffected. In order to inflate an inflatable cabin, you need to fill them with compressed air(A new recource). Compressed air is what you put in tanks. Inflatable Cabins are able to contain crew, some are even able to function as labs. When there are kerbals inside an Inflatable Cabin, you would not be able to fold it up until the kerbals are out of the Cabin again. When a part is deflated, air is put in the tank again. Inflatable cabins don\u0027t contain a hatch so the only way in is crew transfer.

These are usually filled when you are launching these modules into space, but you are able to use a compressor(new part) to convert intake air into compressed air and store it in tanks, in order to do so, the air must be breathable.
