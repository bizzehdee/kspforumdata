F2 turns it off as it is now, with the addition of being able to use right click on various parts to still bring up their information, IE:right clicking decouplers with the HUD off. And then F3, which completely removes all indication that the game has an interface, IE: green part highlighting, words when hovering over parts (crew hatch), Time Warp indicator, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is mostly because when I\u0027m making a KSP video, I much prefer having it be cinematic, as in, no interface to speak of, just simply the mission happening. Various things, like the \u0022Time Warp X1\u0022 in the middle of the screen when switching to other vessels, or the green highlighting of parts under the mouse, make it difficult to always have a cinematic video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
