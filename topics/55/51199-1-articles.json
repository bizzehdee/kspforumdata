Why ever bring along kerbals?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer: Money!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe career mode needs a mechanic to provide income. My suggestion is that we should be able to bring along kerbals that pay us in one of three ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: They pay depending on where we take them, like how science works now, except the pay would not deminish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Taxi service, they tell us where to go, and we fly them back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Hotel service.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E a) -We decide where to put them, and they pay us depending on where it is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E -They request a destination, we get them there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hotel service would provide cash in one of three ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They pay regularly as long as they are in the hotel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Same as before, but diminished pay as time passes (to give us a reason to relocate them/bring them back)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- They pay for staying a finite amount of time. When the time expires, they need to be transported back and new tourists needs to be transported up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETourists would pay when they are dropped off at the space center (location of the drop off might effect the amount of money payed), and loosing tourists would cost money as a penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T18:05:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease!
