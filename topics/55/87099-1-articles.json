They will keep being generated with a higher altitude than your highest flight until you reach space. I think they are there for more novice players who are just starting with KSP. For that reason, I do not think they should be changed. Most experienced players will just complete the 5km one and the reach space contract and never see any of the other altitude record contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T11:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TaranisElsu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TaranisElsu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are actually a near infinite number of Altitude Record contracts.
