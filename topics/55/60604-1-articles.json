After landing, nothing (except pod, batteries and solar panels) is needed for survival. So, player (using EVA controls) takes Instruments out of the pod and starts dissasembling useless parts from the lander. Every part has a certain known volume. So, Jebediah will bs able to carry only a limited amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen player started cutting part into pieces - this part is no longer usable (maybe it should brake onto debris, so Jebediah will be carrying single piece at once)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForge needs electicity to function. And more power it get - better it works. Forge takes time to convert material (need conversion menu here). It can be used to create construction parts, but useless for creating complex parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaterials obtained from Forge can be used by Kerbanauts for basic construction (bases, launchpads, runways, domes, highways).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EForge can be used in space to create space stations basis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter completing base construction (wall, roof, floor) - such building might be used to store resources (according to inner volume limit) as a Warehouse\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkshop (hi-tech module) can be researched and used to produce parts out of resources. In order to operate it needs to be placed near Warehouse and needs power (more power it get - better it works). Every production unit type must be researched first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther small things (like cables, refuelling hoses, instruments) must be researched first. More powerful versions of Forge and Workshop can be researched, but if installed -they cannot be upgraded (only disassebled and converted into materials)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my bad english, but I\u0060m sure it\u0060s way better than your russian)))\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
