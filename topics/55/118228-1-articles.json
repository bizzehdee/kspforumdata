Floating bases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a base that can easily be moved and redeployed no matter the terrain, airships are the key. Airship bases are especially important for Jool. To avoid calamity, time warping or shifting focus to another vessel would put any floating bases in locked geostationary positions. The airship would have to be stationary before you could do these things, though. Special SAS systems could help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mobile high-altitude launch platforms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarry a rocket up to the edge of the atmosphere to launch to orbit. This way, rockets could be a bit smaller, and you could save money on large rocket stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Slow but easy cargo transportation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMove bulky cargo without the need for aerodynamic cargo bays. You don\u0027t even need to land. Just grab and go.

Floating bases\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a base that can easily be moved and redeployed no matter the terrain, airships are the key. Airship bases are especially important for Jool. To avoid calamity, time warping or shifting focus to another vessel would put any floating bases in locked geostationary positions. The airship would have to be stationary before you could do these things, though. Special SAS systems could help with this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Mobile high-altitude launch platforms\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarry a rocket up to the edge of the atmosphere to launch to orbit.
