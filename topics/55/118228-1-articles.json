These, at least for me, are a must-have. I\u0027ll be discussing why airship parts (including electric propellers and lifting cables) are so important for the game.\n\n1. Floating bases\n\nIf you want a base that can easily be moved and redeployed no matter the terrain, airships are the key. Airship bases are especially important for Jool. To avoid calamity, time warping or shifting focus to another vessel would put any floating bases in locked geostationary positions. The airship would have to be stationary before you could do these things, though. Special SAS systems could help with this.\n\n2. Mobile high-altitude launch platforms\n\nCarry a rocket up to the edge of the atmosphere to launch to orbit. This way, rockets could be a bit smaller, and you could save money on large rocket stages.\n\n3. Slow but easy cargo transportation\n\nMove bulky cargo without the need for aerodynamic cargo bays. You don\u0027t even need to land. Just grab and go. It may take longer, but it\u0027s much simpler and doesn\u0027t use any precious fuel or oxidizer.\n\n4. Construction\n\nPutting together a tall structure or rocket and don\u0027t have the ground equipment to get the pieces high enough? Some precision flying with an airship can get the job done.\n\n5. Science!\n\nStudy the atmospheres of planets without the need for fuel-guzzling spaceplanes. Collect surface samples from normally inaccessible areas.\n\nYes, I\u0027m aware that there are airship mods, but I\u0027ve always preferred stock parts. The addition of stock airship parts would be the best thing that ever happened in KSP for me."},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T19:57:04Z","Content":"I\u0027m all for it, but a form of KAS would have to come beforehand or along with it.
