Its not like you are going to be basing a fullon space agency off of KSP. it does incorporate SOME real life sciences (to the point it could nearly be classed as educational), but just take a look at the drag model in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP drag modelling is way from real life, and even FAR isn\u0027t a replica. The truth is, there is barely anything from real life that can be made a simulator. If it is made into a simulator, than people have spent TONS of hours not only researching the principles behind their simulator so that the simulation is accurate, but than they have to code it. Personally, I don\u0027t care about the ion engines thrust. In fact, I wish it was HIGHER so I didn\u0027t have to spend ages waiting for burns to other places, or so I could even whack it onto larger ships as auxiliary thrusters\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T12:43:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t get the fun in having to wait for a month real time for a burn. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Each to their own though....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad about the ion buff as my time in KSP is quite limited atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T13:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving used the new ion engines on an SSTE (single stage to Eve) I don\u0027t mind them, that being said as a personal gripe I really don\u0027t like that you can use them to launch a capsule off the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.
