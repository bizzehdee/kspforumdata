(magnetic docking ports drew them together, tho I could have used the IR jacks to align things if need be)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that \u0022lock suspension\u0022 on the landing legs pushes the legs out to full extension and locks them there. It would be nice if that could be done with the wheels as well, rendering the changes in compression due to differing gravity on different bodies moot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T17:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree! but id also like it if there was an \u0022adjust ride height\u0022 tweakable option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis would be very very useful for aircraft but also rovers and trucks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T18:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERover wheels need to be redone.
