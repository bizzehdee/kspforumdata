For example, when a spaceplane is racing down the runway, perhaps the wheels can generate some rumbling noise, like those heard from a car or some vehicle. The sound will go softer , the slower the spaceplane is on the runway, or on the ground. Also, another example is footsteps. When a kerbal is derping around moons, stepping on dust and creating a mess, perhaps there could be soft footprint sounds. I know that sound waves cannot travel through vacuum, but it would be a nice ambient touch if it were possible in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example is when the landing legs stretch or contract, there is a soft piston sound generated. Although it may sound insignificant, it is very simple to implement, and it would really cause me to lose a year of my sleep playing KSP .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nicer to improve the engine sounds, such as jets, as when they are activated they have a whirring sound, instead of an explosing sound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne such example is in the video found below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5TvK4zd23o?start=82\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkip to 1:22 for the engine startup\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the jet engines in KSP sound like an orchestra singing in monotone. Perhaps they can be improved to the sound of real life jets. However, the jet\u0027s noise will change to a soft drone when in IVA view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure many would love for this implementation in the game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your precious time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : I understand that the engine noise part is planned for official release, but i didn\u0027t remove it for the sake of including everything in the environmental sounds suggestion thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-28T14:09:29Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2014 02:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rdivine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T08:12:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds great.
