I\u0027ve always thought of Eeloo as a visual and physical analogue to Europa, and only a position analogue to Pluto."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:12:07Z","Content":"Actually, I think Eeloo most resembles Saturn\u0027s moon [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus). Also, the outer planets mod actually makes it a moon of the Saturn equivalent, so I can\u0027t be the only one who thinks that."},{"CreatedByName":"Frizzon","CreatedById":147049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:26:35Z","Content":"I see no reason, nowhere it\u0027s said that the Kerbol System is a recreation of the real solar system. Jupiter isn\u0027t green and Venus isn\u0027t purple.\n\nAnd I\u0027m pretty sure I read somewhere that, at least at some point, there were plans on adding a second gas giant and Eeloo would change to be a moon to that planet."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T06:32:18Z","Content":"I like Eeloo as it is. I wouldn\u0027t be against someone coming up with a mod for making it into Pluto, however, just to give it a whirl."},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T18:46:56Z","Content":"Give it moons, like Charon, and mutually tidally lock them. They should improve Dres and Moho too, seeing as they\u0027re just balls of rock floating in space without anything exciting, like moons or anomalies (the Mohole aside)."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T01:15:08Z","Content":"I think it should be given a Charon analog. Obviously it couldn\u0027t be in a binary orbit, but it could be called a binary planet in the tracking station description.\n\nOoby, as in Goodbye. Hello Eeloo, Goodbye Ooby. Yeah. That\u0027s the name of the Charon analog. I like that name."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T11:06:22Z","Content":"The atmospheric tail isn\u0027t anything new. Every time there\u0027s an atmosphere and a star, tail will be made.\n\nEeloo should\u0027ve been made into second gas giant\u0027s satellite long time ago, but it seems Squad has abandoned the development of the planetary system. That\u0027s where Outer Planets Mod steps in: resembling the real Solar system, but kerbalized."},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T11:48:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Give it moons, like Charon, and mutually tidally lock them.
