I\u0027m running a PC with an AMD Phenom II X6 processor and 16 GB of RAM, KSP runs rather well once I take into account that there are issues with my specific processor and Unity. I just have to run the game with a single launch option enabled. You wouldn\u0027t happen to be trying to play the 64-bit version of the game, would you? Unity only recently got their engine working with 64-bit, so KSP is understandably a bit behind in that area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the matter at hand, there WAS a barn already.

These problems were seen in a development state and were NOT released to the public, only shown during (I believe) SQUADCast. People complained, a LOT. The barn was pulled from development, never finished, and now we have a series of rather bland buildings in our career games when we could have had a funny little barn. Because a vocal group got it pulled while the rest of us were not paying attention, we are here to add our voices to the call to bring it back (finished, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe discussion to bring back the barn in no way detracts from the discussions to improve other aspects of the game. KSp has been in an Alpha state for a number of years now, and has only just reached the Beta stage where it will be for an unknowable amount of time. Squad is not in a hurry to \u0027finish\u0027 the game, so there is no call to worry about them dropping the ball now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T13:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re probably right, maybe implying that this suggestion is fickle at best isn\u0027t really the go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Baythan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Baythan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBack to the matter at hand, there WAS a barn already.

I just think it\u0027s an amusing bit that helps tell the story of who the Kerbals are and what they are like. I have my own ideas of what they are like as a species, as I\u0027m sure many people do. I\u0027m also certain there are people that don\u0027t give a crap who the Kerbals are, they want modern looking buildings and a realistic Spaceflight sim. I choose to believe that Harvester has an idea of who they are and what they are like and the barn plays into that. KSP is about rockets and orbital physics and all of that, but it\u0027s supposed to be FUN and often funny as well. If I didn\u0027t like Jeb, Bob and Bill as much as I do, more of my rockets would be crazy designs that are as likely to destroy KSC as they are to reach orbit.
