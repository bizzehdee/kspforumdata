What I\u0027m trying to say is... you know when you have the navball showing your speed toward the target? This is very useful when docking, but it\u0027s still just a number. I don\u0027t actually know if I\u0027m moving \u003Cem\u003Etoward\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003Eaway from\u003C/em\u003E the target. Of course, I could check where the prograde or retrograde marker is, but sometimes I still have to rotate the navball around to do this. I think it would be a lot more convenient to just add a positive or negative sign to the Target Speed, that way we can tell which direction we\u0027re going.

Yeah, the icons on the navball show it, but the navball is hardly the clearest indicator (you\u0027ll have the target indicator and target velocity indicator hopefully in roughly the same position and if you\u0027re facing towards or away from it, then they\u0027ll be in the middle of the navball along with the -v-.
