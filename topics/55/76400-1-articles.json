However, it has occurred to me that despite having a lot of fun along the way, KSP doesn\u0027t feel like it\u0027s made much progress in the year I\u0027ve been here. I\u0027ve seen the introduction of flags, a reskinned Mun and the science aspect, which currently remains underwhelming without a full system to utilize it. I don\u0027t want it seem that I have any problem with the devs methods, I understand they are a small team, but they\u0027re also not the only ones. Out of the many Early Access games I have played KSP is one of the slowest progressing, even for a small studio. Eeloo still stands alone, features that excited me have been signed off for other features which are still so far on the horizon nobody can see them. I guess my point is the further development goes the further I have lost sight of what KSP aims to be or do. As of right now the coming features will evolve it into KSP with tycoon elements, but outside of money and challenges, what new stuff will there be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve hit the point personally where it\u0027s not even a matter of having grown bored of the game, I still love it, I just don\u0027t know where the game is even going at this point. If simply adding money and missions along with a few tweaks to things like aerodynamics will be the end of the road then I think that my time to part ways with the game is coming unfortunately. The roadmap for the future seems bleak and empty, outside of finance and multiplayer, there is little to look forward to for the backers who do not see interest in the career path. I\u0027m aware this update is clearly not for me, and I will probably be skipping it and waiting for the christmas update (they\u0027re becoming spread thin recently too) but my question is, do I have anything to look forward to anymore? What\u0027s next for KSP? My time spent in the forums is dwindling as it is in game, the broadcasters who do KSP shows I watch are beginning to wind down on the KSP focus and my plans to build a massive infrastructure have gone out the window as I just don\u0027t feel I know where the game is going from here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo does anyone who does still frequent the forum have any idea what\u0027s next? I don\u0027t want to \u0027burn out\u0027 on KSP, but recently I can\u0027t force myself to play it as all my saves get wiped, wondering whether they fit with the future focus of the game. I still get excited thinking about playing it, but my excitement stems from thinking about what I may be playing one day. I don\u0027t even know if that\u0027s coming. Personally I don\u0027t even know whether to expect a second gas planet to fit into Eeloo\u0027s spot anymore, I kinda get the feeling it will be the way it is now come launch. If you can give me some hope, please do, because I\u0027m a huge fan struggling to retain interest in these past few weeks. I don\u0027t want to be done with this game before it\u0027s even finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T10:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s no sin in taking a break from the game.

Last update that added planets was .18 with Eeloo and even it wasn\u0027t supposed to be permanent. The devs were just testing out the 3:2 resonance between Jool and a plutoid object. Eeloo was meant to be put around GP2 when it was first put in game yet its still there. Devs, I think its time for a change even if we only get one moon an update. If you\u0027re impatient like me, there are lots of custom (user-made) planet packs that add cool planets to go to, though if you\u0027re leaning more towards realism (again like me), unfortunately you should ignore most of them since they are just impossible. A second star closer in than Eeloo? A gas planet with moons orbiting moons orbiting moons? A black hole the size of Minmus with 2 stars orbiting it just 4 times the distance of Jool? A Tylo sized moon that barely skims the atmosphere of Jool? If you don\u0027t want to wait for many of the features you want to appear in stock game, mods, mods, mods are the way to go. Especially with 64-bit coming out in the next update, you can use as many mods as your computer itself can handle:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T12:38:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s OK to burn out.

One of those games (FTL) I still play almost daily (along with KSP) and another (Minecraft) I just picked up again. The others are old enough that I\u0027m not willing to pick them up again for fear of them ruining my rose-colored glasses view of them (though when Elite Dangerous isn\u0027t $stupid for the right to beta test, I\u0027ll be reliving THOSE glory days). No matter how engaging a game is, though, I have always eventually stopped. I walked away from Minecraft for about a year and my return may be temporary. I took about 2 months off from FTL. KSP has lost me for a few weeks at a time here and there, though it\u0027s kept me interested for a pretty solid 6\u002B months now.

I do hope that the .24 update will fill the gaps for me and give me enough reason to clock up at least another 100 hours. I also am a big fan of many of the mods on here and certainly do look forward to seeing how much further I can take that with 64-bit support. I\u0027m not entirely sure of how the support will work yet, and whether it just opens up more RAM or will open up access to multi-threading of my processor. Unfortunately without multi-threading support I can\u0027t really push it much further as I\u0027m being held back by visuals at this point rather than RAM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily I\u0027ve been away from the game for at least a month as I\u0027ve been spending some time with other games, alpha\u0027s and cleaning up on some of those games picked up on the steam sale (congrats to KSP for being in the featured list again by the way, hopefully it provided a similar boost as last years sale) so I have a bit of time between my last session and the updates which might be enough to bring me back in for a while with .24. However the idea of adding one small bit of revamped/new content in with each update is fantastic I think. I know some planets etc will be reworked and if they were trickling down in the updates I\u0027d definitely feel inclined to come back just to explore them! I appreciate the work the devs are putting in and know that a focus is incredibly good for keeping your schedule tight. But perhaps if small changes to the locations, or even additions from previous plans were already being added step by step maybe the teams who tested .24 before wouldn\u0027t have felt the content was lacking and in need of delaying the update to add contracts. It would certainly give the impression of there being more content per update even if it wasn\u0027t strictly true beneath the surface. Of course I have no idea how awkward it could be on the team, but I imagine dividing the teams and their work further than needed would complicate things too. After all there has to be a reason Squad are following the current pattern since we have had updates in the past that added visual flare to the Mun etc while focusing on other aspects.
