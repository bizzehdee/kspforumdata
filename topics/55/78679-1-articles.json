The variety is nice, the goals are interesting and can actually require a bit of thought. However, it does little to actually affect how the game is played by any measurable standard. We have reputation, funds and science now, and yet science is still the only currency that matters. Let me clarify, when science was added it became the \u003Cstrong\u003Ething to do\u003C/strong\u003E because it was necessary. You need to gather science to unlock new technology in the pursuit of more science and technology. That had an immediate and appreciable impact on the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because science is something you always need and are always in pursuit of\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u003Cem\u003Euntil you unlock your last node\u003C/em\u003E. Funds should then ideally be a limitation on what you can do with the technology you currently have, limiting your access, so when the importance of science tapers off, the importance of funds is maintained. Funding as it exists should limit what you can \u003Cem\u003Epresently\u003C/em\u003E do with your technology, and be the \u003Cstrong\u003Ereason\u003C/strong\u003E you do contracts. If I want to build a space station, or take an anomaly-finding trip to the Mun, sweet. That comes out of pocket. So, I\u0027ll need capital that I raise by doing contracts. To some extent this system is in place, except advances and rewards are large enough to make it quickly redundant. The advances are usually enough to pay for the mission itself, so some major mismanagement is needed to drain your funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be fairly easy to write off the issue with funds being reverting. Something go awry? Didn\u0027t have enough fuel? Ship built badly? Revert. Mind you, Squad may address this\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACif each rocket you send up costs money, you might find the funding a bit tighter after a few pancakes (my favorite is staging issues). So for now, it is just something you can consciously decide on. However, the biggest issue here is that this would only benefit veterans and punish new players. Even a \u0027balanced\u0027 system has two ends: too easy and no one benefits; too hard and new players are disadvantaged. No matter which you choose, in both an experienced player will have a more successful and cost effective program. This is why funds don\u0027t quite work out\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACsuccessful players will always amass funds, treat it like a high score and quickly forget they even exist. This isn\u0027t exactly helped when contracts are almost impossible to fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, currently you get \u003Cem\u003Eso much time\u003C/em\u003E and I almost understand the generosity. \u003Cem\u003EThe game has no idea what you are doing\u003C/em\u003E, is that rocket for a mission or just an experiment? Who knows? So it just checks if you\u0027ve accomplished something. That might work, if not for \u003Cstrong\u003Etests on the launchpad\u003C/strong\u003E that allow \u003Cstrong\u003Eyears\u003C/strong\u003E to do, pay advances \u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E supply the parts you haven\u0027t unlocked. So by now I hope to have painted a fairly clear picture\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACit isn\u0027t the systems do nothing, just that they don\u0027t actively engage the player, or they do so very passively. Heck, we can literally \u003Cstrong\u003Eignore\u003C/strong\u003E reputation. It has a meter that no one really knows what it does or cares. It really ties up this criticism with a neat little bow: science does something, funds barely do anything, and reputation might do nothing at all, and to top it off there is one overlooked resource that is never even used\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u003Cstrong\u003Etime\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBelieve me, it isn\u0027t \u0027broke\u0027\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need to understand the foundation of my opinion\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACsandbox already exists and no reason can encourage career mode to duplicate it. These systems aren\u0027t bad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACjust currently underused. We have all the pieces, these systems can be stitched together into quite a game. As it stands they don\u0027t because career is just a gated sandbox, with science as the only gate key. We have no failure conditions, can do whatever we want with little restrictive progression and no enforceable goals. Plainly written\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthere are no \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E mechanics; despite having funds, reputation, science and time to play with. So, it couldn\u0027t hurt to examine some changes, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mentioned funding: we amass it and quickly ignore it. We could tune it out but, like I explained, the veteran player will always get ahead of the system. As long as money in is greater than money out, there is no solution to the problem. Well if the goal is to keep engaging the player, you must ensure they are rewarded and curb the ability to defeat the system. A simple solution would be a yearly funding budget, based on reputation and divided into quarters. Every quarter you lose unspent funds, and receive your quarterly budget. We eliminate hoarding funds, there is no exponential growth curve or micromanagement, and it uses low frequency punishment and rewards. In fact, it has all the problems of the current system minus two, you are encouraged to spend rather than hoard, and you don\u0027t punish new players. It also creates a positive feedback loop as each month you essentially \u0027reset\u0027, keeping you engaged with the game and your funds since if tuned right, you shouldn\u0027t be able to just get ahead of them. They limit you while also driving you to act with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFunds are inseparable from contracts so we\u0027ll also discuss them. Assume reputation is used to calculate your yearly budget, we get nowhere without snipping the cash flow from contracts. Once again, a simple solution is not to generate new contracts daily, instead each quarter could bring funding and a new round of contracts. But, since they aren\u0027t mandatory anyways, what about more interesting rewards? Reputation is obvious, bonus science perhaps, but augments to a quarterly budget, or access to parts you haven\u0027t unlocked could work too. Well, that wouldn\u0027t make sense right now I suppose. A major imbalance in KSP is really just the use, or lack thereof, of \u003Cstrong\u003Etime\u003C/strong\u003E. \u003Cem\u003EEverything is instant\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACrecovery, launching, building, researching. Contracts really are hard to fail, some can be completed in a literal in-game minute! Time is a resource that is just not utilized. Why not? It\u0027s limitations could easily be adapted for gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking assembly, what passes while you are in the VAB is fine. But, you may remember when every part told you how many you had. So, at one time you might have had to purchase parts to build your rockets. Let\u0027s pretend then that you did buy your parts, just for a moment, and add time. If research and manufacturing took time, contract failure dates might work. After research, manufacturing and assembly you might actually eat up a few months. This could also allow for new types of rewards: give me cash and everything instantly, cash is the only thing I need or want. But if parts take time to build, and I still need cash to fuel, launch and recover craft; I want both. So, a contract for parts might be just what I\u0027m looking for, and recovery suddenly serves another important purpose. Instead of getting cash back, those parts go back on the shelf. This is just a rudimentary idea, it has plenty of unanswered questions about timing and infrastructure but the point is simple: time could easily be used to augment gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might notice I don\u0027t address failure. I just don\u0027t personally think KSP requires an explicit \u0027game over\u0027. \u003Cem\u003EMissions fail\u003C/em\u003E, and what each person considers failure is different. My suggestions are merely for structuring gameplay to engage the player between rocket launches. The point of all this is in career mode you should be \u003Cstrong\u003Eplaying a game\u003C/strong\u003E. You need goals, restrictions, successes and failures. I once again \u003Cstrong\u003Estress\u003C/strong\u003E that sandbox is all about launching rockets without restrictions or penalties, and as it stands science and contracts don\u0027t restrict that. So I really don\u0027t understand the desire for a career mode that doesn\u0027t add structure, features the player can actively ignore don\u0027t warrant a dedicated mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a bit of a \u0027living post\u0027, so I\u0027ll update it as time goes on.

That\u0027s what the science is for, so new players have fewer parts to choose from and can learn the basics of rocket design a lot quicker do to far fewer variables in part combinations.
