I also try to include simple tweaks/fixes to make the game more symmetric, intuitive and easier to play, rather than drastically changing the gameplay, or changing inconsequential aspects of the game that a simple MOD could implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout further ado, here is my list so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Just like X cuts engine power, Z should floor it (like the FloorIt mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) When in \u0022surface\u0022 mode on the NAVball, the altimeter should display altitude above surface, not above sea level (i think this makes intuitive sense). There is no mod i am aware of that currently does this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Even without part-pack mods, there are too many redundant items to choose from in the VAB/SPH, and requires scrolling through sheets and sheets of parts. Instead, each part should really be a catagory, and the specifics can be changed later via tweakables. For instance, the number of tank parts can be reduced to one by making diameter and aspect ratio \u0022tweakable\u0022 parameters (the available options of which are unlocked with the tech tree). Thus, you only have one fuel tank, and you can use tweakables to make the aspect ratio and diameter that you want. Similar things can happen for decouplers (just diameter) and landing gear (just \u0022size\u0022), so you only see one part in the part list, but can change its size with a tweakable. Solar panels and batteries as well. Thus, each part in the part list is more like a \u0022category\u0022 rather than an exact part itself. This feature will also make it easier to modify existing designs without having to detach and delete parts since you can simply change the tweakable on the existing part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) All wings should include tweakables for fuel, solar panel covered area, and heat shields (the tweakable list might depend on if the relevant mods are installed). All fuel tanks should include tweakable for solar panels and heat shields (heat shields in particular). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(5) by default, the game should not let you warp past a maneuver node; it should automatically cancel time warp (similar to what Kerbal Alarm Clock does, but without having to set an alarm or download a mod; if you think about it, adding a maneuver node should mean you automatically dont want to time warp past it). Similarly, the game should not let you warp past SOI changes (since they mess up accuracy; alternatively, they should fix the root cause of the inaccuracy upon warping through SOI changes).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-17T19:57:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2014 07:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T17:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Echatterer. and whatever mod gives clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T17:56:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about NEAR?

I definitely support KER more than mechjeb, since i am a fan of giving players the info they need to perform complex maneuvers rather than doing the maneuvers for them. The only problem with KER, is i dont know how they will integrate it into the current GUI in a way that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can also see how Kerbal Alarm Clock is also very useful (though im not sure how they can integrate it into the game GUI any better than the mod currently does). However, I usually only use it to prevent myself from skipping through maneuver nodes (and im often too lazy to even set the alarm for it), since i usually like to focus on one mission at a time, and not have a bunch of missions running at once. Thus, i would prefer if maneuver nodes automatically killed time warp, since, after all, it makes sense... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the game should also know that since warping through SOI changes messes with accuracy, the game should stop warm upon SOI change.

Procedural parts, like long SRB\u0027s, would be less realistic since they wouldnt wobble. However, this can be accounted for by making the mass of the SRB increase in order to make the SRB structurally sound, and this effect would not have to be linear. This can be implemented into procedural parts in order to balance it. Nevertheless, i think the overall game should encourage using fewer, bigger parts, rather than attaching 100\u0027s of smaller parts together for \u0022realism\u0022 in order to simulate wobbling, since 100\u0027s of parts will always be inherently bad for fps/cpu usage. In my opinion, simulating wobbling is kinda pointless, since, all you have to do is add more struts, and struts are mass-less anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think that procedural wings are necessary, since wings, unlike other parts, are customized to exact specifications even in the real world...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps one way to compromise is something like tweakscale, which will improve the intuition and symmetry of the game by reducing the number of parts you see in the partlist (which i am a big fan of-- already there are too many sheets, and i have to scroll through them even without any part pack mods!); instead of needing to select a short 1m, 2m, 3m, or 5m part, you simply select a short fuel tank, and can tweak it to be 1m, 2m, 3m, or 5m later. Thus, the part is variable diameter, but constant aspect ratio, and as you move through the tech tree, you get better aspect ratios, and unlock new tweakable options for larger diameter tanks). This can be applied to every part in the game, especially if you use TAC life support-- instead of having pages and pages of different life support canisters, just have one for each type, and allow tweakables to resize the items. I am going to revise my first post to include this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T19:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thereaverofdarkness\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal Attachment System - it\u0027s only buggy because it\u0027s a mod that doesn\u0027t have enough support.
