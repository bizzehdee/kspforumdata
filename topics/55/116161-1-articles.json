As counter-intuitive as it may seem, a pointy surface forward will heat up more than a flat surface forward. From what I\u0027ve read, it has to do with flat surfaces causing the shock layer to be pushed out farther ahead of the vehicle.\n\nEDIT: I\u0027ve got a bit more time, so I\u0027ll go into more detail now. The first and most important thing to understand is that reentry heat doesn\u0027t come from friction, it comes from the atmosphere compressing into a shockwave because the craft is moving faster than the atmosphere can get out of the way from just atmospheric pressure. \n\nIn the case of an aerodynamic shape, the atmosphere can escape to the sides/rear after it\u0027s been compressed, so that the recently compressed atmosphere (the hottest part of the shockwave) winds up almost in contact with the craft. In the case of a flat or nearly flat surface, since the atmosphere can\u0027t easily escape, it winds up trapped there, which means that the point where the shockwave is occurring is farther ahead of the craft, insulated from the craft by the atmosphere that hasn\u0027t gotten away yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T21:41:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S**"},{"CreatedByName":"MadMan43","CreatedById":148218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T02:14:48Z","Content":"its for exiting the atmosphere the aerodynamic heat shield"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T03:39:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E its for exiting the atmosphere the aerodynamic heat shield\n\nTo be clear, you want dedicated heatshields....for the ascent?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T04:40:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E To be clear, you want dedicated heatshields....for the ascent?\n\nI assume he\u0027s building a Nike Sprint"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T05:33:34Z","Content":"I can\u0027t say I have an use for Aerodynamic heatshield but I would like inline Drogue-chute, or anything that let me stack a drogue-chute then a parachute on a capsule to compensate for the news aerodynamics."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T07:02:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E its for exiting the atmosphere the aerodynamic heat shield\n\nJust how much TWR are you planning on using...
