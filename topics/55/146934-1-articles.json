This initially sounds like it has minimal impact, but that can mean hills have much sharper and steeper edges as well as (and where it\u0027s best seen) valleys and flat lands being one straight polygon vs curving for detail on the higher settings. So in those valleys you see the biggest change of altitudes as the curves in the higher detail can place it above or below what it would be on the low setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to the suggestion, yeah heck no.
