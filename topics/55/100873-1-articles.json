Like in real life, with the science advance, newer and better ones could be available.\n\n- With the help of telescopes or with the help of some probes orbiting planets, some \u0022anomalies\u0022 could be detected, for instance, an unusual flow of methane inland (mars? :-) ). Some contract should appear to go and investigate the site with a lander probe (manned or robotic, could vary from one contract to another). The mission should be quite accurate in the landing or not, and might require the use of different science devices (existing or new).\n\n- Ideas for those anomalies could include: volcanic events, geysers (ice and liquid ones), gas flow, even some organic life... That could lead to gain information about the planet and \u0022understand\u0022 the kerbal system and gain a lot of science!\n\nWhat do you think?"}]}
