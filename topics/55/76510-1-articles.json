Not nearly as big as Earth, or even the moon, but still very big. You can\u0027t just make every city manually. You also need some way of connecting cities, such as roads, trains, and probably airports. You also need to have Kerbals walking around the cities and cars moving, being busy and whatnot, or else Kerbin\u0027s a planet-wide ghost town.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps procedural generation of cities is in order. There would be a few building props and things, and they would be procedurally generated when you get near them. (and they\u0027d be the same cities in each game you play, so save files are compatible with other players)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERural areas would also need simulation, and I suppose procedural generation could be used there as well. Cities would be their own biome, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would probably be a few pre-built cities, like the one near KSC, to be similar the city of Cape Canaveral.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-02T16:57:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see several cities, maybe 10 scattered around Kerbin, but not too many.

I\u0027m also thinking that the Kerbals\u0027 models would simplify and get less-defines the further from the camera they are, to the point of them being simple sprites when view from the skies. Cars would be similar.

Granted extra launchpads might not be all that useful considering it doesn\u0027t matter that much where you start (especially because the one we have is at the equator already). Extra runways would be great though, because coming in from orbit to land on the only runway in the entire world is actually quite difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe they could put in a way to unlock them too. Like they belong to the companies that give you contracts, and if they like you then they let you use their runways. And if they don\u0027t like you then they kick you out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more thing: as much as I wanna see cities, I also wonder what other Kerbal society do they have? Wouldn\u0027t it be great to land on someone\u0027s farm and then the farmer thinks you\u0027re an alien or something? Wouldn\u0027t add much to the game, but it would be really funny and totally in character for Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T03:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECities I fell should be added in some way or form in the game.
