If there\u0027s debris, then we will probably switch to the debris rather than the spacecraft we want to. This isn\u0027t a major problem unless, by the time you would switch back to the main ship, the debris was out of the physics bubble, and you can only switch to the debris around it. It is immensely annoying. Could be please have a setting in the menu that would make it such that you could not switch to debris with the [ and ] keys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a previous thread along similar lines \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114441-Skip-debris-when-using-or\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
