Let\u0027s also imagine that over a dozen of new parts are now added on top of the existing ones, arguably replacing currently existing ones in function. Now we have a situation where we\u0027re running at a significantly increased memory load, which could cause some people to have serious performance issues running the game. To solve such a situation, one would expect the logical decision to be to remove the parts that have pretty much exact replacements.
