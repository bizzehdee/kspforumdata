Part testing. As many others have pointed out already, the flight parameters for each test are often silly and arbitrary. I want contracts that encourage me to explore the solar system. These feel immersion breaking because you are asked to \u0027test\u0027 something that noone in their right mind would need to know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to fix this- Make the test one that finds out something useful. And returns actual data, not just success/fail. Examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeasure the maximum impact speed of the landing gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck whether parachutes can be deployed in Jool\u0027s atmosphere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetermine the maximum mass that a Mainsail will lift\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFind out the temperature at which the LV-N overheats\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Rescue\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, immersion breaking. How did a kerbal get there? I didn\u0027t launch him. Is someone else running a more advanced space program than me? Why aren\u0027t they doing the rescue?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to fix this- Rescue contracts should choose a target from vessels that YOU put in orbit. Accepting the contract disables some function on the ship and the rescue mission must then launch to save them. If you don\u0027t want your precious craft to be affected, you can just refuse that mission, or possibly there could be an option to disable rescue missions entirely. Examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue the crew from this ship because they have a slow air leak\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBring more fuel to resupply this ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis astronaut has developed apendicitis, bring him back for emmergency treatment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis satellite needs to be returned for repair\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Data Collection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game doesn\u0027t seem to care what data you collect; it\u0027s just \u0022transmit science from place x\u0022. This is really just the same as \u0022go to x\u0022 and doesn\u0027t feel very engaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to fix this- Make the collection requirements specific. The contract adds EXTRA parameters to the regular science missions to make them more challenging and interesting, in return for extra science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeasure the temperature of the Northwest crater on the Mun during an eclipse\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeasure the atmospheric pressure at sea level on Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee what the goo does at the top of Duna\u0027s highest mountain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Exploration\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExploration missions are actually the least bad of the current templates. I don\u0027t think the requirement to transmit or collect data adds much though. These missions should simply state what kind of encounter you should have with the planet/moon and whether the mission is manned or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly within 500km of Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly an astronaut around Mun and return him\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on Bop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand an astronaut on Moho and return him\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Flag planting\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is functionally the same as an exploration mission and whether you need to do science or plant a flag changes nothing, since on virtually all landings you would do both anyway. How about a template that encourages you to establish permanent bases?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand 4 astronauts, plus the Hitchhiker pod on Mun\u0027s far side\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand 2 scientists plus the science lab on the shores of Laythe\u0027s ocean\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand 4 kerbals at the site of this previous landing of yours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAND FINALLY...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe procedurally generated contract flavour text sounds like someone having a stroke.

I would say that these should be reserved to only two scenarios: as ground testing - clamped down at the launchpad, and vacuum testing - in orbit. They could for example return mainly science points, and not be as profitable as other contracts, especially when testing experimental engines. It would make for a way to generate a little bit of science in exchange for funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither scrap it completely or make the game select only kerbals in EVA on my missions ( which would still be none). I have pretty much ignored this one completely, since it is quite silly to have a solitary kerbal in orbit for no reason. I would prefer a satellite deployment instead of this one, where you have to deploy a robot core \u002B solar panels \u002B random scientific instrument into a orbit X, Y. It could be the most profitable contract to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EData collection:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This one sort of makes sense.

At the moment its very easy to leave a kerbal permanently on the Mun to plant a forest of flags for a ton of cash. To combat this I would award mainly prestige for this type of contract. There is only so much of it you would want, so it would discourage grinding the contract for funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efinal point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, what you said.

The solar system is there. You\u0027re given rockets. Go explore.
