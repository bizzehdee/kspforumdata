It\u0027s generally how I play the game anyway. I still get the fun design challenge, it\u0027s just shifted from the booster to what goes inside the fairing at the top of it. I was amazed at how much mass I could shave off my geostationary satellites for Remote Tech 2 when I needed to. Very satisfying (for me as an engineer at least)!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
