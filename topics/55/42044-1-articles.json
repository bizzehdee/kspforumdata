If they don\u0027t end up making this option stock, I absolutely love the \u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock\u0022. If you configure it just right, it will add NOTHING to the game except the ability to stop a warp at a predefined time (you set it) before a waypoint, so not much of a change from the stock game. Absolutely perfect.
