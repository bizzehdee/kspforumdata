No interesting geological active events can be seen. We might say all the bodies are geologically dead. And that is very sad\u00A0and depressing for kerbalkind!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nResembling our solar system, where many interesting active geological activity can be seen, maybe some simple items could be implemented: Lava lakes seem easy to do (just water with orange color\u00A0and terrible heat if landed there), Volcanos (not necessary erupting lava, could be inactive or just have a lava river flowing) and cryvolcanos like the ones found in Enceladus, Titan and other icy moons. The eruptions could be just smokes \u00A0of different colors (the smoke of the rocket with different color could do) depending of the volcano type and the planet itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis geological activity wouldn\u0027t change the surface (so i think maybe it is not so difficult to implement) but would add a lot of flavor and interesting places to see to the celestial bodies.

There\u0027s a balance there\u00A0between giving some fun sciency feeling background but also just building game mechanics that are fun and engaging. It can\u0027t just be flavor text. These features really should offer high enough rewards to make finding them worth it.\u00A0This is why I think stock biome mapping would be so important. Say you had a geyser or\u00A0rock formations or ice crystals, the models themselves\u00A0would be really\u00A0small on the scale of a planet. If a new or existing part could produce a biome overlay there could be several very small biomes on each world that would look like blips from orbit but once you got down to the surface you might still have to search a few square kilometers to find what you were looking for. This might mean scouting with a probe or driving a rover up to some high ground to have a look around. So long as the map provided information that was specific enough to get you close but not so specific as to eliminate the need for scouting you could really open up a whole new layer of gameplay.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022table-layout:fixed;width:923px;line-height:1.6;color:rgb(39,42,52);font-size:14px;margin-bottom:20px;margin-top:0px;font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;\u0022\u003E\nSo, not to diminish from what would Im sure be months of work, I think you could make this kind of thing happen\u00A0with just a few models:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Volcano model, resized and retextured to match the planet its on with the volumetric\u00A0effect of the plume changed for cryovolcanoes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Geyser model,\u00A0retextured by planet, could have the water\u00A0effect redone\u00A0to produce black smokers down the road.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Crystal\u00A0formation model, could be retextured with different colors to represent ice or mineral outcroppings with different science values\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Pool model, could be retextured\u00A0represent a hot spring or primordial ooze\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Fossil Bed model, rare, and retextured by planet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-bottom:0px;\u0022\u003E\n- Coral/Stromatolite model, rare, and retextured by planet\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese could be scattered across the surfaces of each planet, maybe 4 to 10 each,\u00A0and given a small biome that immediately surrounds them.
