It certainly looks nice and works okay, BUT... When you\u0027ve created your satellite and placed a fairing, all non-occupied attachment nodes remain, floating around. Now when I want to add a new part to my satellite, it\u0027s very difficult to attach something to the actual satellite instead of to one of these attachment nodes. Sometimes they\u0027re nearly indistinguishable and I only notice I did it wrong when I\u0027m 60km off the ground and try to open the fairing - and half my satellite blows off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it would be possible to have all remaining floating nodes of the fairing disappear when you attach something to one of them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T12:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what if you want to use more than one of them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I think there is a toggle in the tweakables menu to hide the other nodes, though I don\u0027t recall if you need advanced tweakables turned on to use it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T12:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI frequently make use of more than one of the payload nodes.\u00A0 In fact, that\u0027s why there is more than one node... so you can \u003Cem\u003Euse \u003C/em\u003Emore than one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter you finish attaching things to the payload nodes, just right-click the fairing base and turn off the payload nodes.\u00A0 The previously attached items will still be attached, but all the unused nodes disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-31T12:30:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2016 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T20:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time I noticed the attachment nodes was when I decoupled a satellite with a resource scanner on top and the satellite got stuck between the rocket body and the scanner.
