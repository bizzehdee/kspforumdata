When that docking port is undocked, whatever undocks gets \u0022back\u0022 the original name. This also explains why only one of the two docking ports in the pair offers the \u0022undock\u0022 option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this approach is, it introduces chaos in case docking is used for ship constructions in space. When modular system is used, the name of the ship constructed has nothing to do with the station that serves as basis for the construction, or names of lifters which bring individual parts into place. When such ship is then undocked from the base, when a part is undocked from it, long forgotten or simply wrong names for these parts pop up. Sometimes a part is assigned a wrong name and as long as it has no control module, there\u0027s nothing that can be done about its name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is, instead of docking port, the name should be stored in the control module (apart of the ship\u0027s general attribute). When a part containing control module(s) is undocked, name stored in one of control modules is used for the ship. If the part has no control module, it automatically becomes \u0022debris\u0022 of whatever it was undocked from. Separators can function exactly the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you rename the ship through the control module, that name is also stored in that control module (but not in other available control modules in the ship). This means that if your ship has two control modules and you rename the ship using one of them, then rename it again using the other, and then decouple/undock the two control modules from each other, the separated parts will use the two names you used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially (when deploying from VAB/SPH) in each ship all control modules hold the ship\u0027s name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding assigning names like \u0022...lander\u0022 \u0022...probe\u0022 etc could be done on level of control modules. The control module which is chosen as \u0022main\u0022 holds the unchanged name. Other control modules may get names assigned according to their type.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-01T19:39:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2013 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-11T03:16:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDANG.
