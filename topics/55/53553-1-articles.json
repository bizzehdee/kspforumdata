The magnets are pulling the spacecraft together and they often misalign by just a fraction. This isn\u0027t such a problem on a quick docking, but when construction a spacestation... 1 degree becomes 5 degrees when a few parts are linked together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd thus it would be nice to be able to \u0022lock\u0022 the rotation on two docking ports. So that it will automatically correct a few degrees offset on the X (roll) axis by 90 degrees. Or maybe by just 45 degrees to keep it challenging/free enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are roll indicators (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/docking_with_ISS.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/docking_with_ISS.pdf\u003C/a\u003E page 4) but I don\u0027t see them in KSP (are there?), so it would be nice to correct this if possible. Maybe an option that behaves like the \u0022lock gimbal\u0022? So that you can manually turn it on/off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommunity, let\u0027s hear what you think about this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
