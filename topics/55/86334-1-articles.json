The part of a numpad you\u0027d use for translation doesn\u0027t really leave room for a forward/back control under the index finger (7 and 1 are close enough to other keys that fat fingering is sure to occur).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about not using the numpad because some computers don\u0027t have it is a bit odd since they likely also don\u0027t have middle mouse buttons or scroll wheels or Page Up/Page Down or num \u002B/-, all of which are KSP controls.
