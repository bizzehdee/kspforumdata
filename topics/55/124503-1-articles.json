Probably it would be much shorter time, if it is programmed well. It depends on what things would be precalculated, what kind of details there were etc. Precalculating time is needed only when you begin the new world. Game can save tings and it is not needed every time. Default world could be precalculated by Squad and those who do not want to wait could start as fast as now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut programming would need quite much knowhow and interest which I think Squad does not currently have. It is certainly not an easy task to make a good and believable planet generator. It seems that procedurally generated worlds will not be KSP\u0027s thing even they are technically possible. I think that it may be a good decision even I personally would very much like to see procedurally generated planets where I could make real exploration in every save. It makes things boring if I remember interesting places (for example anomalies) from previous games.
