You have to click the command core and pick \u0022rename vessel\u0022. If the command core is disabled for lack of electricity you can\u0027t do it. Or if it\u0027s a piece of debris without a command core you can\u0027t do it. This doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense since giving things in orbit handy names to refer to them is useful mostly for the people in the space program on the ground tracking them. Surely they\u0027re capable of naming objects themselves for their own purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ever since that space station disaster we\u0027ve had 5 bits of debris in orbit we\u0027ve been tracking.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We should take care of that. What have you named them? We\u0027ll send a junk detail mission up to get them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, I can\u0027t name them sir. They don\u0027t have control modules. They\u0027re called Space Station Debris, Space Station Debris, Space Station Debris, Space Station Debris, and Space Station Debris.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But those are all the same name! How do you keep track of which is which?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027I don\u0027t, sir. We here at Kerbal Control Center are incapable of using language. We don\u0027t know how to name things.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Can\u0027t you number them at least?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nope, we can\u0027t count either.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tracking Station would be a logical place to do this from to stop this rather absurd scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T12:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, but this has been suggested several times before.
