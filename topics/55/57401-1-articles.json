AKA: I want to be able to manually tell my control surfaces to exert a constant pitch/yaw/roll without user interface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know SAS is the current solution to this, but the fact is that it tends to react slowly and often has trouble finding a steady configuration for moderately imbalanced craft (i.e. it just overcompensates from side to side so the ship is constantly rocking back and forth). The only way I can correct for this is to \u0022help\u0022 the SAS by manually imputing corrections...it works, but it\u0027s tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion for incorporating this into the user interface would be to have 3 slider bars show up when you press the trim activation key--one each for pitch, yaw, and roll. OPTION 1: The sliders could then be adjusted all the way down or up using the mouse or OPTION 2: while holding the trim key, pressing the pitch, yaw and roll controls would slowly move the corresponding trim sliders. Also, the trim setting would definitely need a \u0022reset to default\u0022 key, and because I\u0027m a wishful thinker, it would be nice to be able to change the trim in the construction bay and see the center of lift change as you did it (for space planes).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T05:26:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know its already exist?
