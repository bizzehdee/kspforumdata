There are like 4000 gadgets and machines we use here to do experiments, some of which are small, some of which are large. I was thinking that these could be attachable parts, or labs. Maybe even take a \u0022science array\u0022 up to space, like an external lab, and you can attach certain science devices to it. These science parts, like real ones, could get upgraded with a small cost and prior research. They are also geared more towards the microscopic scale. Also, you should probably have to designate one kerbal as a scientist, who gets better at not breaking things, because untrained kerbals might break equipment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese should also have an intuitive component: as in, when doing some science experiment, the results lead you to carry out another experiment (maybe even on a sample, or to compare samples), and doing so will give you more science than doing either/or, or even doing them in a separate order. One experiment should lead logically to another to get max science, otherwise the results are somewhat meaningless. Also, the results don\u0027t necessarily tell you what experiment to do next, but lead you to pick a proper one either by trial and error (90% of the time IRL), or intuition (90% of what we believe we do IRL). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmarter play = more science though (if TL;DR)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, I\u0027ll compile a list these sciencing devices that would be kinda cool to have in the game.
