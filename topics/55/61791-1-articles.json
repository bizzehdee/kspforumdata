It would be greatly benefitial to you if you would make it accessible so that we the Blind can enjoy this game. There are quite a few Blind people, like myself, who enjoy computer games, and frankly, there are not enough good games at this point. You can do this by either self voicing the game, by this coming up with your own speech that will make the game accessible, or you can make it accessible by allowing Microsoft Sapi, Jaws, Window Eyes, and system Access be used to play the game. Which ever way you find best to make it work without majorly changing the program would be great for all of us who are Blind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minerman30","CreatedById":63054,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T19:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough this would seem like a good idea, the type of game that this is would not seem like something that could be done realistically. The game updates itself 20-30 times a second, and it is a 3D game as well. This would also seem like a waste of time for the 99.99% of us players that are sighted and don\u0027t need this, like the 3D mouse support (which almost none of us have) and it would take away from time spent developing the game for a system that couldn\u0027t really work anyway. Sorry, but I don\u0027t think this is the game for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T20:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be a heck of a challenge to make KSP screen-reader compatible. Not impossible mission-wise, but I really don\u0027t know how you\u0027d make the VAB or SPH work. Mission-wise, well as long as your fingers are nimble enough, you could be reading off velocity, altitude and orientation values. Probably not a priority until the game is more complete though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, Scott Manley managed to get into orbit while flying blind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-6JGNiMMU0c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then this is Manley we\u0027re talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-02T21:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s most likely not going to happen because many things in this game don\u0027t translate into words (maybe you could have some luck with the Mechjeb autopilot mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the old saying goes, \u0022A picture is a thousand words.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
