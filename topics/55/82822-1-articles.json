Would it be a good idea for fuel tanks, command modules, and docking ports to have point light sources that would not increase the polygon count. That would give a general level of visibility to the craft without having to add obstructive looking light fixtures to the edges of hatches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to tear into my idea...and...GO!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
