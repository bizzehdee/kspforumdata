I posted in that thread and may have blown off the question a little (and if I did, I apologize because it was important). The gist of it is that the implementation of resources is really easy, and we can thank Roverdude for that - but knowing how much to take is most certainly not, because we don\u0027t have any in-game tools for it.\n\nWhat I see is: Current Mission Control contract functionality is moved to Admin Building, freeing Mission Control for mission planning activities. It has a simplified version of Tracking Center interface, with a 2-D display of planets and user-selected target objects. You can add \u0022legs\u0022 of a trip, each with a starting and ending orbit (within altitude and inclination ranges), and will best-guess a trajectory starting at a user-defined time in the future, and give DV and duration estimates, assuming competent flying.\n\nBuilding upgrades would allow warnings of SOI interferences or reccomendations to wait for least-time or least-dV.\n\nTL;DR: The actual resource implementation side of life support is actually pretty easy - trivial, I\u0027d argue, especially if it uses a GLSR.

Rescues in particular. The clock needs to be ticking on any such contract. Now that they have pods, in USILS, that should mean 15 days. Note that the time limit should be included in the time to decline. Ie: any rescue should have 15 days to accept, and 15 days to failure. If you wait 10 days to accept, you then have 5 days to failure. Of course they need to fix the issue with you being spammed with rescues for places you have not been with kerbals by predicating them on a flag placement or something. Maybe even a check to see if you have a manned craft in the world\u0027s SoI. Alternately, any rescue past Kerbin SoI could be for a reasonable looking craft (and actual craft, not a pod).
