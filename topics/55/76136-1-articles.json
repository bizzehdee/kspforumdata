So I imagine at some point, a part-purchasing or supply scheme will be coming into effect (maybe with Budgets, maybe later).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to see, quite simply, is a system for purchasing rocket engines (by far the most important part) in batches, instead of individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reasoning for this is that it would create realistic and interesting in-game incentives to stick with older technologies, rather than switch to newer engineering (from 1.25 meter engine clusters to 2.5 meter engines, for instance), and would also create benefits to doing things like re-using the same engine type for upper and lower stages when neither would otherwise have a cost-advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBulk-purchasing would reflect real-life economies of scale and mass-production, and real choices rocket designers face, in a simplified (and fun) format- rather than implementing a more complex part-cost mechanic. It would also reduce the tedium of purchasing rocket engines a bit, if this ever becomes a mechanic (one click buys 20 copies of a part rather than just 1, with a bulk discount).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would simplify gameplay and ease the burden on players if only rocket engines were limited in any meaningful sense- which is why I limit this suggestion specifically to engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
