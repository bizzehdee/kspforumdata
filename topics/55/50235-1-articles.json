A simple solution would be to have a key bound to returning the warp speed to normal, similar to the way x works with thrust. Excactly which key this is has little significance, although it should either be close to the default warp keys, or easily reachable from WASD. As such, both the key to the right of . and the z-key are good alternatives without any use in-game as of now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The same goes for parking brakes. Generally, I think every function that it is likely that you will need during flight/control of a craft, should be bindable, if not bound by default.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-23T17:12:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2013 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lagostra\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T16:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been suggested several time: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50055-one-button-that-kills-ALL-time-acceleration?highlight=kill\u002Btimewarp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50055-one-button-that-kills-ALL-time-acceleration?highlight=kill\u002Btimewarp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing it will greatly increase the chance for the rocket to explose or disassemble, because it will go from high speed to lower speed in no time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lagostra","CreatedById":70395,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T17:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry that I did not see this suggestion; I did search for it, and also looked through the sticky, but I can\u0027t have been thorough enough...
