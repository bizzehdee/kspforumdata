Also what order do you want to see these features introduced or even do you only consider them important post release?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious to see everyone\u0027s differing opinions are on how the game should progress in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I\u0027d like to see things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.24-25: Career mode continued with the budgets and contracts system. Simply because that is what is being worked on now. Also see the biomes finished. Continue with the science development as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.25-0.30: Improved aerodynamics, spaceplane overhaul, fairings and cargo bays and finally a mild form of re-entry heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.30-0.35: Space station and probe overhauls. Simply some more specialised parts and more reason to use satellites and stations. Optimisation. Mild life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.35-0.40: More things to do on a planets surface. Mainly focusing on EVA activities though some more tools for rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.40-0.45: 3.75m parts. Just to make more realistic and larger rockets. Optimisation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.45-0.50: Additions to the planets and hopefully movable asteroids and comets. I\u0027d really like to see asteroid capture!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.50-0.55: Guess its got to come somewhere... Multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0.55-0.60: 5m parts so making a Saturn V or SLS system will no longer be a chore of sticking many many smaller tanks together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPost Release / Optional\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources: I\u0027d like to see this appear in a form somewhat like the original resources tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther planetary systems\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBase update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuture parts pack\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-17T22:09:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2014 10:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Comrade Jenkens\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T21:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis\u0027ll be rich...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027d like to see the following, in no particular order (because it doesn\u0027t matter):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Money, Reputation, Science triad, already announced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Contracts that focus more on the player\u0027s activity rather than some arbitrary story or progression (I want to be the star of the show).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Refined/more parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Life support and atmospheric damage effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Additional planets to round out the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Two or three more solar systems to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- UT changed to use an actual double instead of this 63 year integer casting they\u0027re using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- More things to do on planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A non-grindy resource system that puts resources in intelligent places and doesn\u0027t require waiting of any sort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I\u0027m perfectly happy waiting to see what the devs come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
