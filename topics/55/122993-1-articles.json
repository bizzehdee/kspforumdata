Care Packages (Food, Water \u0026amp; Oxygen) These would be considered Care Packages that would be delivered to Space Stations, Mun Bases and Colonies. My idea how this would work. Modules, Capsules...etc would have a set amount of F.W.O. aboard that in time will deplete if not replenished, they could be individual and combined items. Each item would have a determined amount of weight. Food could be a Crate, Water and Oxygen would be in Containers and weighted as well. Deliveries would then have to be made in order to maintain life. This would be a way of adding maintenance to the game giving Kerbals a purpose not only to discover but also the means of survival. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always appreciate good criticism so please feel free to comment with any ideas you may have.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T04:06:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, this is a pretty nice idea for a mod, although I don\u0027t know about it being in stock -- Squad themselves have said they will most likely not implement Life Support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, it\u0027s an awesome concept, instead of just the entire life support thing relying on the capsule\u0027s supply.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T04:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe risk would be that it might be become repetitive and grinding, but for sure, I\u0027ve chosen \u003Cem\u003ENeeds to get to the Squads attention! \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I hope you agree, first the performance issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T04:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELife Support is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not to Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, although the mods tend to ignore that these days there is also a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109883-Can-we-talk-about-Life-Support\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efull discussion on it already\u003C/a\u003E and plenty of mods to choose from.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T11:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELife Support is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat Not to Suggest list\u003C/a\u003E, although the mods tend to ignore that these days there is also a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109883-Can-we-talk-about-Life-Support\u0022\u003Efull discussion on it.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109883-Can-we-talk-about-Life-Support\u0022\u003E*guilty look*\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109883-Can-we-talk-about-Life-Support\u0022\u003EJust for reference, that thread was started shortly after the devs had mentioned they we\u0027re considering it.
