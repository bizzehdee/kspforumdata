This must have been suggested before but I failed to find relevant threads. The claw is a poor option because connection is temperamental and requires multiple ramming attempts to get it to connect with each impact a risk of breaking something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to see a docking option that doesn\u0027t require physical connection by using an engineer to connect a tube between two vessels but I\u0027d also accept a way in the VAB/SPH to ensure that docking ports are the same distance from the ground. The problem with that is that weight affects the compression of the suspension of landing gear/wheels and transferring fuel changes weights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFixing the claw to connect more reliably would also work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-03T23:57:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2016 11:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by THX1138\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
