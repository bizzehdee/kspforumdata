I\u0027m going to reply here with my thinking on these, although I\u0027m not very defensive at all about any of them. My thinking is generally based on a combination of \u003Cstrong\u003Egameplay\u003C/strong\u003E and what I\u0027ll call \u003Cstrong\u003Estorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E (ie. in-game realism) reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E: Although I like the idea of having the stability enhancer much earlier in the game, I thought it would be good to have it at least not in that set of first-column parts (which again, I might even consider to be starting freebies). \u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: I figured that R\u0026amp;D would apply radial decoupler technology to the stability enhancer\u0027s breakaway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYeah, I struggled with that and you\u0027ll see that I applied a similar chain to a variety of parts (nose cones, rover wheels, docking ports, fuel tanks, liquid/solid engines...) for the following reasons: \u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E: The medium version is the one that the player is really going to need to use first, and so I considered the smaller and larger ones to be variations on that. I didn\u0027t want to start them with a smaller part that could be confusing by not being immediately useful. \u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: I head-canon\u0027d my gameplay choice by saying that both miniaturization and up-sizing the nominal medium part would take R\u0026amp;D work, with the medium being the nominal case on which other versions would be based (since it would be needed first practically).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESee #2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESee #2\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHm, I just sort of found it in that category and didn\u0027t give it much thought (beyond adding that input line from the OKTO on the idea of it requiring some control tech). But yeah, it doesn\u0027t seem very connected. Perhaps I\u0027ll just make that a prerequisiteless level 2 part?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHoldover from an earlier version that I forgot to delete. Oops. Early on I thought that there might be a requirement of developing the cockpit to prove \u0022Mk2 technology\u0022 before any other Mk2 parts, but I did away with that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnless I\u0027m failing to understand something (\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E possible), I thought that was the most advanced intake part, looking at the specs. It\u0027s quite small, strong, radial mounted, and sucks as much air as the whole Mk1 fuselage intake. The intakes kind of confused me though to be honest. You\u0027ll notice I didn\u0027t even include the XM-G50 because it makes no sense to me. But I\u0027m very open to guidance on a better way of structuring the intake tree overall.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHm, in retrospect, no really good reason. Maybe I\u0027ll pull the Stratus-V parts back into level 1 as branches off the FL-R25 or even the FL-T200?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMostly \u003Cstrong\u003Estorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: They\u0027re similar-looking radial tanks. But especially with #8, maybe those are just prerequisiteless level 3 parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E: I wanted to avoid having the RCS thrusters in the first column since they won\u0027t be useful to a new player immediately (but I did want them available quickly). \u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: The Rockomax 24-77 serves as a proof-of principle for smaller thrusters not based on big LV-style motors with big bells, but quickly gets spun off into a separate chain of monopropellant and LF/O thrusters.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay\u003C/strong\u003E: The Vernor is pricier and uniquely provides LF/O RCS functionality. \u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: Actually I didn\u0027t pay attention to this -- really I should have the Vernor follow from the LV-1R (ie. compact radial LF/O engine), not the O-10 (monoprop based). The O-10 feels like it should follow only from the LV-1R as well, as a monoprop-based derivative. I\u0027ll change that.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI went back and forth on that. \u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: It seemed \u0022cute\u0022 to have it dependent on advanced electrical technology, given how ion engines work. But yeah, I could have it be a prerequisiteless level 3 part if it seemed onerous to force the player to plunge through battery tech to get there. I still sort of like it as is to make it feel more unique, but I could be convinced.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStorytelling\u003C/strong\u003E: I vaguely was classifying the science instruments into \u0022direct measurement\u0022 and \u0022sample observation\u0022 and in my head canon the gravioli detector was using some kind of substance as a detection intermediate, sort of like those huge underground water pools for neutrino detection. But my feeling on this (and the science tree organization in general) is super super weak.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all that said, honestly if you disagree with my reasoning on any of these, I\u0027d tend to defer to your judgment as I\u0027m not yet as deep a KSP player as you or many others.

You\u0027ll see that I\u0027m using the icons as sort of indicators of different development \u0022lines\u0022. Everything seems to be working well.

I think I actually like it, especially given the very different paths you can take with this tree.

Unfortunately this type of tree will generally have \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E lower node costs in general, and so these thresholds won\u0027t work well at all. I\u0027m really not sure how to get around this right now -- it might require a real mod to go in and tweak the effect of the R\u0026amp;D facility level? If anybody here has any ideas on this, I\u0027m very interested.
