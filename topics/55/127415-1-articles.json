Radiators are nice and all but I propose a more active cooling method: the Regenerative Cooler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially a regenerative cooler is the same idea as the regenerative cooling system built into rocket engines - cryogenic liquids as pumped through lots of thin pipes that are built into the part need to be cooled and take away the heat. In a rocket engine the heated gas is then piped into the engine to be fired, but in a stand alone regenerative cooler they would be simply dumped overboard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo implement it in the game you basically have a small radial attached part similar to the fuel cell. Turn it on and it starts consuming liquid fuel using the standard fuel flow logic and give a dramatic cooling effect to the part it attaches to as well as sucking away fuel from a few part away, similar to a radiator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea being that generally, only a few part on a craft experience huge heat loads - nose cone and leading edge during reentry, ISRU converters, engines during long burns etc. A small, powerful and togglable cooler specifically designed to cool these hottest parts at the expensive of fuel would give people more options on thermal control without all the fiddling around with max heat. You want to make a mark 1 sized SSTO? Now you can by actively cooling the cockpit during reentry so it doesn\u0027t melt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would also open the way for special science parts such as IR telescopes that must be actively cooled to very low temperature before they would work, thus simulating things such as Spitzer space telescope with its limited coolant load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-10T00:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/10/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
