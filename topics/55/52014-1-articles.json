Personally I\u0027d really like to see some science that requires real kerbals to be present beyond the basic EVA/sample reports you get at the very beginning of the game. A big, heavy science lab that must be \u0027deployed\u0027 (think about those NASA station and mars base designs that use inflatable or rubber connected expanding sections). Once deployed science can be done but like solar panels it is too fragile to go through the atmosphere in a deployed state. For extra kick it could be like the antenna used to be, deploy once and no retraction. If it could only be deployed once I think it would help make a case for space stations and permanent surface bases - you deploy a space station with a big heavy lab in Jool orbit, then bring up samples from its moons to be examined and the data transmitted back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
