If it does *not* have a radiator, where does the heat go? Does it stay in the part until said part overheats and explodes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adelaar","CreatedById":150794,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T12:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way heat is managed now means that some skill is required when de-orbiting SSTO\u0027s. This means that you\u0027ll have to be careful when de-orbiting, and place your PE on a manageble altitude, instead of aiming for the runway and hope for the best. Other than piloting skills, heat issues can also be a design issue, if you cannot create a lot of drag whilst de-orbiting you may not be able to shave off enough speed before entering lower parts of the atmosphere. I usually try to keep the angle of attack of the craft at \u002B10 degrees pitch from current heading, that way the wings and body help aerobraking. So to conclude, heat management systems would be neat, but would perhaps make de-orbiting too easy...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T13:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is craft explodes because skin temp reaches max. \u00A0Thermal control system would work off the parts internal temp which has no effect on the skin temp. \u00A0Skin temp is based off radiative flux coming in and out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
