It\u0027s a common way of thinking both in everyday life and science; it helped us to understand that stick hits hard; that different sticks hit differently, and that the force of the hit depends on the size of the stick. It does not require science; it does not require even language, I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarise: not all gathering of knowledge can be called science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you know, it\u0027s just a technical thing; you words about people obtaining knowledge and applying it in practice from the very begining of our existence are essentially true, because it\u0027s how our brains work.

Second problem is that its not in the spirit of KSP warp drives are way too easy to use ksp ussualy makes you cry when you fail something forget to save and have todo it again. However thats what makes it enjoyable a simple burn with a warp drive to a star seems way too easy for my liking. Never liked the idea of timewarp but i dont think they should make it too much longer if going into interstellar travel part of the challenge is to wait and also to make ways to get there quickly and to keep our kerbals alive(when some kind of life support system gets added into the game.)
