There are many trivially easy fixes/workarounds to this problem that should have been implemented ages ago (for example a hotkey to create a maneuver ~1 minute ahead of you which could then be dragged as needed wouldn\u0027t solve the problem, but it would mitigate it.) Precise node isn\u0027t a great solution considering the fuss involved in inputting the correct time. But this issue has to go sooner rather than later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe really obvious but very non-optimal (but still preferable) solution would probably be to prioritize the current trajectory.

Another possibly related problem is when two or more vessels are close to each other, you are unable to pick which ship you meant to target on the map view. It keeps redirecting your click to the wrong one of them. This might be related because both that complaint and this complaint in this thread seem to be a case of being a bit weird about how it handles \u0022near\u0022 clicks. It seems that a mouse click has a certain radius around it and if a thing is in that radius then the click is near enough to be counted as clicked on that thing. The problem is when there\u0027s more than one thing within that radius, it doesn\u0027t seem to select the one that\u0027s closest to the click. It just selects the first thing it finds it its data structure that fits the nearness criteria even when there\u0027s aother thing that would be even nearer. Thus when two objects are both within the click-radius of each other, it\u0027s nigh impossible to get the game to realize you meant the \u0022second\u0022 one it finds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least that\u0027s my guess about what\u0027s happening because that\u0027s what it looks like from the user\u0027s point of view. If that\u0027s what\u0027s happening then the fix would be to find ALL hits within the click zone and select the one of them with the least distance from the click, rather than just stopping on whichever hit is discovered first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T07:09:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem is that the click radius is measured in game distance, not screen distance.
