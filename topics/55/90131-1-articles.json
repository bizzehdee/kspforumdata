The best example of a plugin that integrates perfectly into KSP GUI environment is a mod called \u0022landing height.\u0022 When landing, you obviously are more concerned with height above ground than height above sea level. However, in stock KSP, altimeter always shows height above sea level (in IVA mode, altimeter shows height above surface, but this view is less helpful when landing). You could use Kerbal Engineer (or numerous other plugins), which would display height above ground (in addition to height above sea level); however, a better approach to integrate better into the game is that when navball is in \u0022surface mode\u0022 altitude displayed on altimeter is height above ground, whereas when navball is in \u0022orbital\u0022 mode, altitude is above sea level, and the \u0022landing height\u0022 plugin does this exactly ( \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76320\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76320\u003C/a\u003E ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in keeping with the theme of \u0022intelligently integrating features into KSP GUI/Environment, I have two suggestions for integrating transfer windows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor players who just want to be told the information (possibly enabled/disabled via difficulty settings):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer window should be shown in map view as a (purple?) dotted line. This functionality should be activated only when an applicable object is targeted using KSP targeting feature. Only showing one transfer window prevents clutter in map view and integrates nicely into existing KSP functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor players who prefer to have the tools needed to easily find the transfer window on their own: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn automatic toggle in map view to switch the reference body used to draw the orbital trajectory should be created. For instance, if you are orbiting Kerbin, it shows you trajectory around Kerbin (and you can click on it to add maneuver nodes). When you zoom out far enough such that this trajectory is no longer visible, it automatically toggles to show your trajectory around Kerbol instead, and you can click on this trajectory and add maneuver nodes. You can then use maneuver nodes showing trajectory around Kerbol to find optimum transfer window on your own, since you can slide maneuver node along the orbit around kerbol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I am aware that when displaying trajectory around Kerbol whilst orbiting Kerbin, the trajectory would technically be helical; however, for the purposes of the drawing and simplicity, it can just take the trajectory of the body it is orbiting i.e. Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThought?
