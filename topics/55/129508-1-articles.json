We still can take out the Kerbals and walk them somewhere to celebrate the return. But there\u0027s actually nowhere we can walk them to. It will still be that \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 button which ends the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be great if the doors of the KSC buildings had a trigger on them with an \u0022End mission\u0022 function. So we could walk Kerbonauts to the doors of administration or Kerbal ground engineers to the doors of VAB or SHP and the doors acted like a hatch but would end in Kerbal recovery instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSC buildings already have those climbable\u00A0ladders on them. I think it\u0027s not that hard to add a trigger to the doors with \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 functionality for Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-08T05:16:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2016 05:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Enceos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andem","CreatedById":155578,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-08T11:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0the Kerbals could walk to the recruitment Center, and instead of the ship just *poof* gone, you would have to take some engineers who would go and show a little cutscene or whatever and then boom! mission success!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
