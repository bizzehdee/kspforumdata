Just have them not even accepted by the administration team for review by Gene.\n\nExamples:\n\nAnything regarding being in Kerbin Atmosphere.\n\nAnything under 75k in Funds.\n\nAnything in Duna SOI.\n\n(More complex) Any parts test outside Kerbin LKO worth less than 100k in Funds.\n\n2) Sorting/Grouping\n\nIt\u0027d be great if I could simply sort the contracts. Say, group all satellite contracts together, or everything in Duna SOI together. Would save me a lot of random scrolling around when I\u0027m trying to figure out what to group up together for a mission profile.\n\nEven grouping under a header in the lists would be helpful, though that\u0027s the next step after sorting.\n\n3) Permanent Decline\n\nIt\u0027d be nice if there was a third option to permanently decline a mission type. I am never going to test some of these parts, ever, I\u0027m not rescuing Kerbals anymore in Kerbin SOI, and I really have no intention on sending a manned mission back to Mun to plant a flag.\n\nA permanent declination of these types of contracts (Ex: No more MK16 parachute tests in Kerbin Atmo) would be just lovely. It would remove my need to continuously decline the same mission which repeatedly pops up (Save kerbal, no. Save kerbal, no. Save Kerbal, no. Test Mk16 parachute, No. Save Kerbal, No. click click click click)\n\n4) Explore contracts no longer take up 3\\* spaces.\n\nContracts appear to be limited at 15 in number, total. 4 1\\*, 4 2\\*, and 7 3\\*. Having Explore missions take up those slots seems counterproductive, especially when launch windows are part of the concern and you\u0027re trying to build up funds (read: 3\\* are your best choice) to send said mission.\n\n5) Remove contracts that cost more than they pay/impossible contracts\n\nThis has been brought up elsewhere, but removing parts tests that return less than the part purchase seems an obvious no brainer removal. As does impossible contracts, like scans on Gilly that are too high.\n\n6) Have contracts more in line with their \\* requests.\n\nAn example: I\u0027m staring at a contract to test a Mk16 parachute in flight on Kerbin, and this particular game has been in solar orbit. This being a 1\\* contract I\u0027d expect, but it\u0027s 2\\*s, coughs up a whopping 800 funds, and is simply not in line with what I\u0027d expect at that level, considering right next to it is Minmus Temperature Scans.\n\nThe entire contract matrix would need to be reviewed for #6 though."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T23:03:49Z","Content":"Sounds good to me. I like the contract system overall but it gets really tedious clicking \u0022no, I don\u0027t want that contract; show me another\u0022 over and over and over again. It would also be nice if there were a \u0022decline all currently displayed contracts and refresh the list\u0022 button."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:37:21Z","Content":"Contracts, particularly parts testing, are good ways to earn science. I know there\u0027s a thread concerned about science from contracts swamping science from experiments - not something I\u0027m concerned about but a reasonable discussion to have - but just because a contract doesn\u0027t pay back as many funds as it costs doesn\u0027t automatically make it worthless.\n\nI had a contract to put up a 10 person space station with a lab around Kerbin for ~60k funds. Maybe someone could do that for less funds, but I couldn\u0027t. I took the contract anyway because I wanted a station in Kerbin orbit (plus whatever science it was worth).\n\nSorting and filtering would be great features though. I think those two features would also reduce the need for \u0022permanent decline\u0022 and without being so permanent."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T21:40:13Z","Content":"All of these suggestions are awesome. Additionally, I would suggest creating contracts per celestial body and having each celestial body comprise a \u0022tab\u0022 of contracts for easy filtering. \u0022Hrm... What\u0027s available for Duna today?\u0022 would be a much better way to play this game."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T23:45:35Z","Content":"1) Filters\n\nYes, please. I NEVER do in-flight contracts, they\u0027re just annoying.\n\n2) Sorting/Grouping\n\nSounds good.\n\n3) Permanent Decline\n\nIsn\u0027t this part of filters?\n\n4) Explore contracts no longer take up 3\\* spaces.\n\nNot sure if I understand what you\u0027re trying to say, but it sounds good to me.\n\n5) Remove contracts that cost more than they pay/impossible contracts\n\nYes. Just yes\n\n6) Have contracts more in line with their \\* requests.\n\nI agree- the \u0022prestige\u0022 makes zero sense sometimes."}]}
