First I would like to state that the parts menu has come a LONG way since the beginning of the game. Subassemblies, sorting by function, name, use, and even an actual search function makes it a million times easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut sometimes, mod creators tend to do weird things with their naming conventions. They will make them from a million separate manufacturers, or not tag them right, or so on and so forth. I wonder if it is possible to get a \u0027group\u0027 option (like manufacturer, function, etc) that sorts mods by their hierarchical name in the folder structure. Or whatever the name of the mod is. So whatever the folder is that contains \u0022\u0026lt;mod\u0026gt;/game data/\u0026lt;mod name again, possibly more than one\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;parts\u0026gt;\u0022 the very top with the mod name is something that we can sort by to see the pieces of the mod in its entirety. I would absolutely love this and it would make looking for mod parts that much easier!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hupf","CreatedById":152424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T07:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother useful scenario, depending on the implementation, would be a way to check/list which mods a vessel uses (e.g. when trying to compete in Challenges).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-22T14:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a bad idea!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an even simpler idea that wouldn\u0027t require any new UI at all:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe now have \u0022keyword search\u0022 for parts.\u00A0 The keywords that a part responds to are determined by what the author chose to specify for that part.\u00A0 Well, why not make it so that every part implicitly includes a keyword which is the name of its top-level folder inside GameData?\u00A0 (e.g. all stock parts would receive the keyword \u0022Squad\u0022, since that\u0027s the folder they live in-- even though each part doesn\u0027t say \u0022Squad\u0022 in its .cfg file.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would give you an easy way to see all the parts from a particular mod, regardless of what the mod author may have thought to add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother feature that would be nice:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022config-only custom parts tabs\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s possible for mods to add additional (custom) tabs to the parts menu in the vehicle editor.\u00A0 Some mod authors use that to great effect-- for example, look at RoverDude\u0027s UKS/MKS mod, it has \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etons\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of parts, and he makes a custom tab available for them, IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I believe that you have to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewrite code\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to make that happen.\u00A0 Which can be a barrier to entry for parts-pack authors.\u00A0 It would be great if the game had a way that mod authors of parts packs could add custom tabs for their parts, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewithout\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E requiring plug-in code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn more detail:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBroadly speaking, KSP mods tend to fit into two categories:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eplugins\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (which add new code to the game to make it behave differently, e.g. MechJeb) and \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eparts packs\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (which add new parts/models with new config, but don\u0027t add new code;
