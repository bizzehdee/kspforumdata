Here is what I would like to see added/changed in the future:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Adjusted physics for rovers. I know this might not be realistic but most of the time driving rovers sucks for me. They flip too easily, start moving sideways and are really hard to manage. Granted it might just be me but I have tried really big ones and really small ones and after a few minutes I usually end up leaving them in place and doing something else. Maybe a pair of idiot wheel that are less realistic for guys like me. This seems like it could be a very fun aspect of the game but I have been staying away due to rovers being so hard to control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Teather lines. If I had a nickle for every time in a science mission I tried to EVA to grad a bit more points and then ended up falling off the ship and being lost in space I could buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. More to do. I understand the game is still being developed and science was a great add but here are a few of my suggestions for the future\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea. Planetary Missions - require you to establish some kind of base on the planet which includes habitat, radio and rover. Then you use the radio and a mission comes over for you to drive to some point and take a core sample or scan something or pick a plant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eb. space missions - you get a radio call and some random ship is generated out in space that needs refueled or is running out of oxygen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec. Capture alien lifeforms - nuff said\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed. Auto-pilot feature for things you have done many times - Getting to orbit Kerbin was a big step for me but now that I have done it 100 times, it would be nice to see some auto-feature that would do it for me besides mechjeb. Maybe if I use the same ship to orbit 3 times it will enable an auto-orbit feature the next time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee. Rescue missions on Kerbin - Maybe you get a radio call at a forrest is on fire and you need to design some kind of vtol to carry water and put the fire out. Maybe you have explorers trapped in the arctic and the Kerbin gov needs you to get there fast before they freeze.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. More parts - some of these mod packs like B9 and Novapunch have some awesome parts. I really like the big white shield covers that are from the anvil pack I think. Cant some of these make it into the stock game?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Make customization easier - Making custom flags is awesome but designing custom flight suits and colored parts would really take it to the next level. I know it can be done to an extent right now but it sure isnt easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. More use of the radio and sounds. I am using the chatter mod and simply love it. Maybe weird alien music and sounds when you are on different planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. More deployable parts - I love activating lights and solar panels and landing gear and radio antennas. Would love to see even more added so I am not spending as much time just staring at the screen and more time hitting buttons and doing things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Sharable scenarios - Someone creates a scenario for beginners to reach a 100k orbit on Kerbin and then you can download it and it gives you some kind of achievement or something when you complete it. In other words, there is some way to verify someone did it and some way you can show others you did it. Can you imagine the scenarios that Scott Manley would make? Holy Mackeral!!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m not complaining. I\u0027m just sharing some ideas I would love to see in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for a great game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T20:47:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like your 8th suggestion a lot. While KSP does support scenarios right now there is no easy way of creating them. So implementing some scenario creation mechanism into game would be awsome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut for now do check out the Challenges section of the forum if you haven\u0027t done so already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T20:57:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou should check WNS before posting: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1/ have you tried driving your rovers in docking mode? It switches off pitch/yaw controls and generally makes rovers more stable. Or you can remap rover control keys somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2/ there is that thing called jetpack. Press R and navigate your Kerbal back to the capsule...?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the rest.... I think there are many much more important things to add to the game than these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8/ is already in the game actually.
