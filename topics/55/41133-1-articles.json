I had the idea to include a building where all players can upload and accept challenges from other players, but also where all available kerbals will also give you challenges. so for example you are in the building and jeb will bet you cant fire him into an orbit and return him safely only using SRB\u0027s, you accept the challenge and after doing so you can collect the reward. other people might give you other challenges depending on their character. Additionaly all kerbals in flight and on other planets could also give you challenges. For example bob on the kerbal space station might request or challenge you to dock something to the station or bring up some supply\u0027s, after doing so you would be rewarded. Like this the normal career mode would be more interesting and challenging and the player can do more things. The player challenges could be on a whiteboard you would be given a budget, primary and secondary targets and also optional things like fly to duna without using any nuclear engines. upon completing the target you would be given the reward according to how many targets you completed. For example the primary challenge is fly to the moon, land and return. the secondary challenge is to land and return 3 kerbals, and the optional challenge to do it al in less than 3 days. you have a budget of 30,000,000. So initialy you would receive 30,000,000 to build the rocket. After completing the primary challenge you receive the main reward of 5,000,000, you also manage to complete the secondary challenge so you receive an extra 1,000,000 but you fail the optional one, so you receive nothing for that and you final reward would be 6,000,000. Before being able to upload a challenge the player has to complete it himself this would prevent impossible challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrKicker","CreatedById":77424,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T19:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA built in comunity challenge page?
