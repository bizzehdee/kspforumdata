Right now my Gamedata folder is 1.34 gb. Apperantly KSP can handle up to 2gb of memory but I guess that isn\u0027t true when it crashes at only 1.3 gb. I was wondering if there isn\u0027t a temporary solution for this problem because KSP is so much more awesome with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that when Unity some time in the future (hopefully) switches to 64 bit this problem will be resolved. But with the ever expanding list of mods to choose from isn\u0027t there some temporary solution squad can implement to crank up the memory?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T18:25:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E64-bit version is available for Linux.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CyclonicTuna","CreatedById":21888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T18:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E64-bit version is available for Linux.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah that\u0027s great...
