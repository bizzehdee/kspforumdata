So my perspective on that is somewhat different. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat one could so in the game is to have different sensors (e.g. temperature-, pressure-, vibration-sensors etc.), \u0022modifiers\u0022 (amplifiers, filters etc.), and data recorders that can be combined to create different experiments. E.g. a vibration-sensor \u002B amplifier \u002B long-term recorder can measure the natural earthquakes on a planet, but vibration-sensor \u002B amplifier \u002B peak recorder can measure the shock-waves from impacts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm... Maybe that would be an idea for the processing lab. Give the MPL a number of different equipment slots, that allows it to analyze different kinds of input data. E.g. an exercise machine, EKG monitor etc. allows it to process crew reports (study the effects of the environment on Kerbals). A mass spectrometer, IR spectrometer, and microscope allows it to process surface samples. Etc. It could also be simplified to be a \u0022study Kerbals module\u0022, \u0022study surface samples module\u0022, etc. You could also have storage for more equipment, so that the scientists can swap out the modules and reconfigure the lab in place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it is an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T09:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big problem (for me) about this idea is that this isn\u0027t a game about gathering science. It\u0027s about flying rockets. The science is really just the macguffin of a reason you have to fly those rockets to different places. That\u0027s why I tend to like mods (and ideas for the stock game) that streamline the science gathering.
