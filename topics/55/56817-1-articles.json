This is especially bad in Career mode when you lose a gillion points of science in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest a system wherein pressing Quickload (F9) either loads the most recent save overall (quick or auto), or gives the option to load between the two (last two most recent saves, just in case an autosave comes right before, say, a mun impact). Or at the VERY LEAST only allows a load as far back as the start of the currently active mission, thus reverting to the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would certainly save quite a bit of malcontent in dealing with botched quicksaves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Michael Kim","CreatedById":38782,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T12:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe add a save/load system that allows multiple saves instead of just one \u0022persistent\u0022 and one \u0022quicksave\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T12:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these suggestion would make QUICKsave completly useless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt randomly loading an autosave instead of the save I made myself would make it useless for obvious reasons, if I hit F9 I want it to go back to the point that I know I made the save, not a point where some random autosave was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you have a menu to select, it\u0027s not a quicksave anymore.
