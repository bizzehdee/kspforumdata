The circumstances we\u0027re talking about are so vastly beyond the strength and heat capacity of the parachute material, that I believe it would almost instantly shred or vaporise, before it could transmit much shock load. I\u0027m speaking from some experience here, having shredded very large sails made from parachute material, they just go instantly when you exceed max load (but you do get recoil shock in that situation, as it was typically under sustained max load before it shredded). Subject normal modern parachute cloth to extreme heat, and it will just vaporise rapidly. The only way I see the capsule experiencing shock is if it was under significant load for some time before being destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for that piece of information, Murph, but, uh...
