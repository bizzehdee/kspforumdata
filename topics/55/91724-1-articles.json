Mun). Player unable to edit these probes. With these probes player \u003Cstrong\u003Eshould not!\u003C/strong\u003E be able to gain science points. It is contract mission! Player use its money to gain more money, prestige. There should be longer missions which generate money for longer period(eg. landing probes on celestial bodies) same as science in Space program missions, see below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech tree:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor developing items player have to use money. Later money and science points. After the item is developed(single click on the tech tree) player have to do tests with that item(same tests as are available in contract in current version). Player can perform test only when the conditions are met(to avoid use of items without production). After X tests the item will be available for production. Player could choose how many want to produce(packages 1,10,50,100). If he choose more, the cost/item should be smaller. If player recovering the items he don\u0027t have to produce them! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpace program missions:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are long term missions for collecting science \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly\u003C/strong\u003E. (Eg. Put probe around the Mun at xy and collect data. Scientist required: 5, Duration: 3 month) Each mission require scientists at the space center. Player can hire scientists and assign them to missions in the mission building. Player should pay wage(weekly) for the scientists. Player gain science during the mission based on: count of scientists, mission duration(after the mission deadline the science gain reduce). The probes or astronauts should stay on the orbit or at biome for the mission time. Player could gain extra science points when returning the samples to Kerbin after the mission deadline(manned mission).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor manned missions i would also add some stuffs, that Kerbals have to deploy after landing and competing the mission. After placing these items around the lander player could switch back to space center and start another mission while this mission is in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith mods like TAC we have to care about the crew healthy as well during the mission time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese missions eats lot of money during it\u0027s lifetime and player get only science for it!
