However I\u0027ve always been more of a fan of sandbox mode. I feel like the tech tree just limits me. With 0.24 I decided to try editing a career save file to unlock the full tech tree and allow me to essentially play sandbox with budgets and contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis didn\u0027t work. The generation of random contracts is all wonky, and simply doesn\u0027t work right. As such I am suggesting \u0027Budget\u0027 Mode. A mode in which the entire tech tree is available from the start, but you still have to worry about your budget, and you can take on contracts to earn funds and reputation!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have Science mode, so why not Budget mode?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
