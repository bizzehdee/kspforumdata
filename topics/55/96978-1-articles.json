You can\u0027t discover the top-notch solid booster if you\u0027ve only studied parachutes now, can you? \u003Cp\u003EAlso, the plan is to include tech tree info in the cfg for each part, so mod makers can make parts that must be researched. This way mod parts can be integrated with the gameplay, and not just add volume to the content. I think Total Annihilation was a game that did this. Modders could make new units, and decide in which construction facility that unit would be built, essentially integrating it with the game\u0027s tech tree (there was no research in TA).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, about how things are going today, I\u0027ve managed to add pages to the parts list this morning. So now whenever a category has more parts than the list can hold, buttons to flip through pages pop up. The limit is set at 18 parts per page ( 6 rows ), so it\u0027s unlikely this feature will be used right now, since we only have 11 parts so far \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since people are already making mods, I thought it\u0027d be a good idea to put this in now, before the amount of user-made parts can overflow the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m about to start on the fuel tank code... I plan to restructure it all, to make it simpler to keep coding, and also make them stackable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, If there\u0027s time, I\u0027d like to create a module for an Oxidizer tank... You may have realized that those engines will burn without oxygen now... with the oxy tank, you\u0027ll need them too if you expect to reach space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, comes more bug fixes, like getting the Undo/Redo actions back in the game (it used to exist, but there was a bug with them and I disabled it because there was o time to fix it), fixing the part-poke-through problem in the VAB, and finishing up the indicators on the parts...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully all this can be done before the end of this week, so we can start working on the bonus features, which I\u0027m itching to get to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: double ninja\u0027d!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t put in any random failures yet... It seemed flying was already chaotic enough to have to deal with parts all of a sudden deciding they want to not work anymore or just explode ...I think your problem might be that your decoupler isn\u0027t actually a decoupler (the tricoupler is an adaptor, it won\u0027t separate the craft), or the ship might be crumbling under it\u0027s own weight (or g-forces), and the control linkage is severed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, this is a good point... I should make the parts indicate if they become disconnected from the control feed for any reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship works like this: The command pod is the only part that receives input from the Input gathering systems in the game. It then sends a control update to every part that\u0027s connected, and they do the same, and so on recursively. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if a part becomes disconnected from the ship (by decoupling or by, erm, accident ), it will be cutoff from the control feed and becomes stuck at the last control setting it received. (that\u0027s why SRBs and engines will keep burning if you don\u0027t throttle down before separation)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, there\u0027s no visual indication that a part is connected or not to the control feed... Maybe the icons should change color to indicate that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the planet, yeah, it\u0027s totally made up. Although there are many parts of it that resemble earthly geographic features (I guess that\u0027s a good thing )\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was from July 2011, so yeah, there really was a plan for these things really early on. The funny thing is that originally, there was going to be separate oxidizer and fuel tanks, and liquid fueled rocket engines would use the atmosphere for air. So basically, originally, all engines would have been SABREs (RAPIERs). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbiter-forum.com/showthread.php?t=22998\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to the Orbiter Forum thread for KSP.\u003C/a\u003E The OP is weird, because HarvesteR updates it for some major releases so yeah, but everything below it is basically like the history of dev/player interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for a rather long time, people just called Kerbin \u0022Kearth\u0022.
