I like the community presented features mods bring. But I\u0027m also a vanilla guy. And I\u0027d like to use different sets of mods in different games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently this requires multiple installations of KSP. It also keeps save-loading times to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not aware exactly how hard it is to change the moment mods are loaded in... But personally, I would love to pick which of the installed mods I use for each save separately. Would this even be possible? Or is KSP too far along in development to change this? I\u0027d personally welcome this feature with open arms!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T00:17:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLOL...
