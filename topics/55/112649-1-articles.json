Oh good lord I can\u0027t even imagine how difficult that would be to program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only would you need to save the craft every few game ticks with snapshots; you would also need to run the physics, orbital, and aerodynamic calculations backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn-rails craft shouldn\u0027t have a problem, unless you are messing around within their physics range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of things are easy when warped; you just need to extrapolate and interpolate events.

Because right now, the quicksave saves a whole KSP universe persistence file. And this saving process is slow, because it needs to save the entire universe as a whole. The all-or-nothing saving requirement is too intensive for short interval quicksaves, like MET -10s, -20s, -30s, -60s, -300s, -600s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022arkie87\u0022 data-cite=\u0022arkie87\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you are over simplifying. \u003Cp\u003EConsider this example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are in LKO and finish your orbital insertion stage.

This makes sense, both from an intuition perspective since you never would want to warp past a maneuver node, but more importantly, because then you could use maneuver nodes to automatically stop time warp (like a built in KAC).
