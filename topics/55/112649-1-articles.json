In fact I just discovered my batteries dead after a long time warp... And yes the problem could be solved already by quick saving often... at least mostly. \n\nBut what if instead of having to reload my save from a year of Kerbal time ago... I could just timewarp backwards to a point before my batteries were completely dead? \n\nThere would have to be limits. like if you interacted with the craft in such a way as to change its trajectory... or any atmospheric forces on it... I\u0027d like for it to operate across SOI changes though. (Just like regular time warp... but backwards) So the last time you changed things... would be the limit for how far you could go back. \n\nIf you didn\u0027t have those limits cheating the system to get places you physically couldn\u0027t would occur unless you recorded every input or every frame of physics calculations... and that would just be untenable. \n\nI think a limited reverse time warp could be added... if the game can flag and save the last point at which the trajectory got changed."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T14:33:57Z","Content":"I think this could be done by changing the warp speed to a negative value, reversing the rail system.

Never mind.\n\nAnyways, I agree, it could also be confusing, it could reverse on-rails time, but not \u0022after you crashed into the Mun\u0022 time, which could be obscure if people didn\u0027t make the connection. And in fact, if you, say, decoupled a stage you wanted to collide into Kerbin, while on a collision course, you could do that, timewarp back to the Apoapsis, and after you burn, continue on your merry way.\n\nAlso, i\u0027m not sure what other twilight zone-esque effects would happen..

Oh good lord I can\u0027t even imagine how difficult that would be to program.\n\nNot only would you need to save the craft every few game ticks with snapshots; you would also need to run the physics, orbital, and aerodynamic calculations backwards.\n\nOn-rails craft shouldn\u0027t have a problem, unless you are messing around within their physics range.\n\nLots of things are easy when warped; you just need to extrapolate and interpolate events. But running events backwards; you would need to somehow make the craft fly forward while moving backwards; while physics forces somehow get reversed.\n\nAn easier option; would be to somehow implement a \u0022light\u0022 craft saver. Because right now, the quicksave saves a whole KSP universe persistence file. And this saving process is slow, because it needs to save the entire universe as a whole. The all-or-nothing saving requirement is too intensive for short interval quicksaves, like MET -10s, -20s, -30s, -60s, -300s, -600s."},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T16:45:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think you are over simplifying. \n\u003E Consider this example:\n\u003E \n\u003E You are in LKO and finish your orbital insertion stage.

Then I could rewind just enough to stop the warp at the right time."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:48:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Good point.i guess decoupling something could be a point of no return just like if you perform a maneuver.

This makes sense, both from an intuition perspective since you never would want to warp past a maneuver node, but more importantly, because then you could use maneuver nodes to automatically stop time warp (like a built in KAC). That is an EASY fix and should be stock...."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:20:55Z","Content":"F5 for safety."},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T18:30:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E F5 for safety.\n\nf5 doesnt always work.\n\nCase in point: i once f9\u0027d after messing up, not realizing i havent f5\u0027d for hours before i even started the current mission i was on.
