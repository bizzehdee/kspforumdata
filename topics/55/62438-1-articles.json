When this happens the game opens a popup message warning you that the vessel had to be deleted from the game because of the missing part. This could occur for several vessels. What I would like to see is an option in the UI at that point to say \u0022NO! Please don\u0027t load this campaign - go back! Abort! Abort!\u0022. When this has happened in the past I\u0027ve found that the only way I have to save the state of the saved game and not delete ships from it is to kill KSP externally. Once it gets to the point where it is showing you the Space Center screen it has already saved a checkpoint of the persistence file, with those vessels gone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T11:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh totally.
