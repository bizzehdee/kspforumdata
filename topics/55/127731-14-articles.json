It all depends on how you play, for us a proper multiplayer would be the best thing that could be added to the game as it would be considerably less buggy and more stable than DMP which we are using at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that it is not for everyone and I certainly agree that any multiplayer should not be in an MMO style but rather P2P (Player To Player) allowing\u00A0small groups to play together. Having the ability to host your own server would also be preferable. I should\u00A0also say here that some kind of search for open games may be of benefit\u00A0to those who\u0027s friends don\u0027t play KSP so that they may search out people to play with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also have to disagree with your statement that multiplayer \u0022doesn\u0027t mesh will with KSP\u0027s core gameplay\u0022 as I consider flying crafts and building planetary bases and orbital stations as very much core aspects of the game; All of these are things that my friends and I regularly do together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all Squad has done an amazing job so far and I can\u0027t wait to see where they go next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EBOSHI","CreatedById":165938,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-03T01:47:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117647-devnote-tuesday-hello-world/\u0026amp;page=1\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been waiting over a year for next\u00A0sign of multiplayer since\u00A0I\u0027d seen this Devnote\u00A0that\u00A0Felipe(HarvesteR) had said \u0022the underlying framework for the next big things, like Multiplayer\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wish some sign of it come out after releasing v1.2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...don\u0027t you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
