The initial tests worked good on Kerbin but it always failed on Eve. Every test mission of such magnitude took around 3-4 days of real time only to end up in a failure on eve ascends. I almost abandoned the whole idea of Eve return mission but then I used Hyperedit and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s teleport feature to test the parachute assisted decent and ascend stage in real Eve environment and finished sea level capable ascend stage in just 3-4 hours. Looks like many other players use hyperedit for such \u0022simulations\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my point is, that the game should have simulation mode that will be unlocked for each planet after it will be visited by the probe (landed by the probe in case of the planet with the atmosphere). In this simulation mode you basically do the same thing you do with the hyperedit, place your craft anywhere on the surface of the planet or anywhere on the planets orbit. Simulation could be used not only to test landers\\assends but also import real life mission into the simulation in order to try some danger maneuvers\\rescue missions before attempting something in reality. Textures or visual style of simulated environment could be simplified so you can always tell if you are doing real flight or the simulation. It will make the whole idea of landing the probe as preparation for the manned missions more reasonable. Simulation mode can be used for testing early designs of lifters without doing actual launch. I think it is must have feature for carrier mode where you have to pay for all the parts in the game and doing hugely expensive Eve missions that ends in failures will ruin your space agency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:22:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe existing \u0022Revert Flight\u0022 feature pretty much allows you to regard any failed flights as a \u0022simulation\u0022 - you can already either go back to the time of launch (if failure was due to piloting error) or the VAB/SPH (if failure was due to design faults).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJoab","CreatedById":78834,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T04:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might complicate the implementation, but I think it would be cool if this Simulation\u0027s parameters could be provided by your probe\u0027s returned science data...

I had the same thought the other day after spending hours repeatedly modifying, launching, testing, and reverting, ... a vessel I plan to send on my first Duna mission. I have FAR installed and the blasted thing kept coming apart on Kerbin reentry which I felt would be a bit too exciting for the brave and probably tired Kerbals after a year long mission, they will deserve some rest and not explosions. I think everything I thought of has already been touched on in this thread: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Simplifying the graphics, wire-frame etc.. so that you don\u0027t get any of the excitement of the real mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Being able to enter parameters such as I want a gravity well that is x deep, with an atmosphere y density and put me at an altitude or Pe/Ap of z,z1 and maybe having the ability to select a biome from a list of biomes you\u0027ve already explored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only things I might throw are :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Maybe each simulation could cost a very small amount of money/time to just slightly encourage a little risk taking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* The ability to save simulations. Be able to create a simulation called Mun and then have sub items under that such as Mun landing, roving, take off etc.. so that any new craft you build you can immediately load it into an appropriate simulation.

Of course you would also have the option to just have the ship created w/o testing. Though thinking about it now that\u0027s is too much of a pain.

I think it should be done with cheap retro graphics or wireframes for fun. I like the suggestion that it still costs money. Some players can use it just to practice docking. Also the idea that you can only simulate Kerbin or empty space to start, then adding more planets as you gather data on them. Return atmospheric science from Duna? You can simulate that now so you know how many of what kind of chutes you need to land something. Same with gravity and so forth. Will there be a difference with actually landing? sure, the terrain itself could be different where the simulation would be flat. the first moon landing had to pick a new landing zone right at the last minute because there was a rock in the way. the simulation would be very sterile compared to the real thing. the simulation gets more accurate the more science you return, being perfectly accurate when you return 100% of the science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
