Clearly there are camps that want both and I think there is room within KSP for both. Neither should be required, but at least one approach has to be used to reach your goals. This allows people like me to go out and explore, do our thing, and maybe run a mission every now and then for some extra cash to be happy with the game, and people like you to have a more structured experience with clearly defined goals, but also have the ability to do \u0022whim\u0022 missions. The great thing about that approach, IMO, is that it provides a lot of choice in how to approach your KSP career while maintaining the sandbox feel that makes KSP so awesome. I\u0027m not opposed to missions overall, I\u0027m opposed to them being the only way to advance in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T00:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really can\u0027t understand that fear of \u0022railroading\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the point of a \u0022non-sandbox\u0022 gamemode if you refuse anything but a sandbox without objective nor constraint ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox will stay and if career mode is going realistic it would follow both :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The law of market, you can build a rocket and people pay you to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Government founded program, you get a budget, and objectives so vague you are basically free to do whatever you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s win-win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you fear ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHorror !

It\u0027s just that part design isn\u0027t done by the player, your Kerbal engineers are building launcher parts in that R\u0026amp;D building when you unlock things. They are clearly limited in intelligence though, what comes out is fairly standard.\u003Cp\u003EI said before that I could see a use for procedural design of parts if tied into a much larger economics system. You could design a specific length of tank or some wings or a fairings with juuuust the right dimensions, but it would take TIME and it would be EXPENSIVE,\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you aren\u0027t penalized for the FIRST time you build a thing to your own dimensions I\u0027d be okay with this. The problem is that you were implying that somehow MY space program had already designed everything to the specs listed when that\u0027s not true. The game was handed to me that way. At no point had my space program ever asked the engineers to use those specs. So implying that by specifying my own diameter for parts I\u0027m somehow deviating from the previous design is simply false. There *was no* previous design yet if I\u0027ve just started the game. So only charge a redesign fee if it truly is a redesign. It\u0027s not a redesign just because it differs from the game\u0027s presets. To give an idea of how silly it is to presume I had predesigned the part sizes - consider that in career mode you have zero availible part designs that are the large diameter at the start. Then all of a sudden without my asking, they suddenly appear at that exact fixed size when I had no input into that decision. Therefore if I ask for them to be a bit smaller or a bit bigger, I am in fact NOT asking for a redesign of an existing part. Those parts don\u0027t even exist yet at the start of the game. So, yes, sure, penalize me with money for redesign if I keep changing the diameter again and again. But not for the very first one. The very first one isn\u0027t a redesign. It\u0027s the first design. Just because it\u0027s different than SQUAD\u0027s settings doesn\u0027t make it different from my first design. That first time I build a rockomax tank, the tweaked size I specified for it IS its first prototype initial designed size. Now at this point that\u0027s the lowest cost, least-redesigned size and your suggested cost for redesign should be calculating how much I deviate from THAT size, not SQUAD\u0027s preset size.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T12:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel pretty much the same, the shape of a wing is a complex thing, and it wouldn\u0027t be a thing to just change on a whim.

I personally feel that the career mode should be built around the \u0022tree\u0022 system. So we have the tech tree. Done. But what about money? And missions? Well then, we have an OPTIONAL mission system, where you can take on contracts from the government and other organizations to build up your money, then you get to use that money to fund your next missions and personal projects. So it will pretty much be real life. NASA / SpaceX / Copenhagen Sub-orbitals / who-ever, gets a contract, sends up the payload, gets money and uses that to fund development and their own personal projects. The only difference is that kerbals are a little more loose with their cash, and are willing to pay more than their real life counterparts for the same thing. Then you get more money, and you can do what you want for a while, until you need more money.
