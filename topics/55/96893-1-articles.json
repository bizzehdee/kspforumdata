This has caused me to reconsider my perspective on Career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... a suggestion - primarily from the perspective that subcontractors should not drive the space program but vice versa...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems (to me) to be more sensible if the player\u0027s space program was the driver for the various agencies to build and test components, establish a kerbalnaut cadre, and creating missions. The player would be provided with an annual budget (increased or decreased based on reputation). The annual funds available would be spent in a several ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003Cstrong\u003EResearch\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpending science to unlock \u0022the possibility\u0022 of specific components (putting items onto the tech tree)\u003C/span\u003E - unlocking a component puts it onto the development tree \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ein the order that a player researched it\u003C/span\u003E. The specific subcontractor which the player chooses to do the research will affect the place and the cost as to where the component will appear in the tech tree. This would enable a creative and non-deterministic tech tree based on how the player spends science points and which subcontractor they invest in. Subcontractors (the existing agencies) would need to configured with specialities, efficiency ratings, etc. The intention would be that a player spends points to achieve a research result. Spending a small amount might result in a component which shows up much later in the tree or is perhaps a failed research effort causing the player to invest again. Obviously at the beginning of a career a player would be required to run a few missions to get enough science to conduct initial research. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: I think there could be incredible synergy here if combined with the new tech tree suggestions seen upstairs in the sticky...) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-A-more-intuitive-tech-tree\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-A-more-intuitive-tech-tree\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u003Cstrong\u003EDevelopment\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpending funds to develop a specific component on the tech tree\u003C/span\u003E - once a component has been researched it is now necessary to develop it into a usable item. The player would be required to spend funds with agencies to create the item and make it available in the VAB. How much is spent and which agency is selected would determine how long it would take to appear in the VAB menu and how much it would cost. It might be that additional science and funds could be spent to influence this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow... It would be necessary for \u0022Fine Print\u0022 to slightly modified. It would not generate testing contracts until the player had conducted the necessary research and commissioned a company (vie development funds) to manufacture a specific part. Once these were done, then a testing contract would be presented to the player. They player would need to complete the test successfully for the part to appear in the VAB on a permanent basis. A failed test would require more development funds to release another part for test. Depending on the \u0022level\u0022 of a part there might be more that one testing contract required. For example, a Nerva engine might need to short testing in orbit and in long tested in deep space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u003Cstrong\u003EMissions\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpecific funds are reserved to conduct missions\u003C/span\u003E - the idea here is that the player would be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Erequired\u003C/span\u003E to undertake the missions which the player selects. These missions would be planned in the \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eprior\u003C/span\u003E annual cycle. If they are not undertaken it would have an negative effect on the next annual budget. if you succeed in achieving your planned missions you gain rep and therefore more funding for the next cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere \u0022Fine Print\u0022 could continue to operate nearly the same way. Except instead of the missions giving funds, the player would need to spend funds from whatever budget cycle in which they want the mission to occur. The only science provided would be what they player recovers. Rep should continue to operate as designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) \u003Cstrong\u003ETraining\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAn annual training budget gradually increases the level of kerbals\u003C/span\u003E - the player could choose how much funding is applied to pilot, engineer or science training. Kerbals who are hired would automatically be enrolled. Each annual cycle yields improvement. If you lose a Kerbal who has had 5 years of training then you lose that training investment along with a huge chunk of reputation (based on how manny missions he/her had undertaken). It will take time and money to get another kerbal to the same level. The current way kerbels gain experience points would go away. Also,if you time warped just to get kerbals trained up, then you would not be running missions - so your rep will be gently falling along with your annual funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) \u003Cstrong\u003EProgram capability (Building) upgrades\u003C/strong\u003E - \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESpending funds to upgrade buildings represents improving ground based programs and capabilities.\u003C/span\u003E This dynamic would remain very similar (if not exactly the same) as it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to point where the tech tree it completed, and your building upgrades (ground programs) are complete, then you are then spending funds to complete planned missions each year and to keep your kerbels trained. If you can continue to meet your mission plans without losing kerbals you can likely continue on with even wilder mission plans. If you start failing to meet mission objectives then your program will gradually be starved of funding. When the kerbal government sets your funding at Zero then \u0022game over\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation would need to change also. Launches should generate rep but it might need more of a half-life. Your rep level drives funding so it need to go up and down based on the programs plans, activities and achievements. I would require a more dynamic model than what currently exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a thought. A proposal. I expect many of you might think its too far off from the current paradigm and reject it. Others might see it as a fresh take on the current system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, please discuss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-17T09:35:47Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2015 09:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wallygator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded a 5th topic and a few corrections and comments on fine print\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheShadow1138","CreatedById":53694,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T04:17:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think these are all good ideas.
