When transfering the monopropellant, I ended up with one side of the ship with the containers full of monopropellant and the other side of the ship with half empty containers. That\u0027s when this idea came to my mind: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not have a new option to balance fuel between 2 tanks?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you need to transfer fuel from one side to another, but you also need to keep the spacecraft\u0027s balance, otherwise SAS can\u0027t stabilize it. It gets even worse when transfering big ammounts of fuel, as it is harder to get it balanced. This should be pretty simple to do, just run an algorithm to compare which tank has more fuel, add the value of fuel from the 2 tanks, divide it by 2, round it and apply the value to each tank... or something like that.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and here is a screenshot of the DUNA-X with only one extra tank docked:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi41.tinypic.com/2cek9y.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222cek9y.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I can get this thing to Duna and come back in one piece \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"masiboss","CreatedById":63787,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T17:25:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1\u002B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(10 chars)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CapnMorgan18","CreatedById":75721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T20:29:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a 3rd option. balance across Center of Mass.
