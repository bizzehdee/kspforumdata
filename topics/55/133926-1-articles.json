I\u0027m not even sure this is an issue of keybinding so much as the camera is just intentionally locked to the craft during construction. Panning works fine when just idling at the KSC menu, and it works when controlling a vessel although it isn\u0027t so much a pan as an offset in that instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m gonna recommend you try out the WSAD editor camera mod, I think you\u0027ll like it better than the standard editor camera.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless SQUAD decides to change this I don\u0027t think there is much else we can do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T14:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have long wanted to be able to remap every key binding.
