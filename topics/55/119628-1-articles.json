If I start just any random task (like compressing random data), it\u0027s switching cores perhaps two or three times a minute.

So, if there aren\u0027t many other running tasks that demand lots of processor time, your compression task is probably rescheduled only if the core it runs on starts to heat up. Hence the switching two or three times a minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERendering and physics threads usually run in cycles (for examples 60 cycles per second) with somekind of \u003Cem\u003Esleep\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003Eyield\u003C/em\u003E (or somekind of synchronization) between the cycles. So, they are rescheduled after every cycle anyway. Depending on how much other stuff currently runs on the processor, how many cores there are and how hot each core is, rescheduling will most likely also cause core switching.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T08:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SAI Peregrinus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid some testing....\u003Cp\u003EAffinity limited to a single core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience KSP really does not like running on only one core.
