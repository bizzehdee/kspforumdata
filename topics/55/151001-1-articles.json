As soon as you deselect a node it seems practically impossible to get hold of it again unless zooming all the way back in. Mousing over Kerbin seems to bring up every line of text in its\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Also moving a node around your current orbit when zoomed out\u00A0seems far to jumpy. Could we get something like a node selector button added to the right of the nav ball once a node is created, and when it\u0027s selected a blown up orbit representation if zoomed out beyond a certain point, so it\u0027s easier to move around when playing with intercepts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr is there a trick to this that I just don\u0027t know yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrGeekArt","CreatedById":159531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T12:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn easy answer to this is mods :\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can grab \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/44129-120-precise-node-124-precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPrecise node\u003C/a\u003E,\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe node editing windows won\u0027t go away as you zoom out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlternatively \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/111978-113-anatid-robotics-mumech-mechjeb-autopilot-258-22-jun-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EMechJeb\u003C/a\u003E as this kind of feature but will also provide many many more ; This may not suit you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you wish to stick to a stock game, then you\u0027ll have to wait for squad to do something in a future release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Long Finger","CreatedById":169468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-29T17:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrecise node looks like it will make life much easier.
