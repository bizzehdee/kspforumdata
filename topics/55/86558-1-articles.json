It\u0027s a far more effective way of educating people about spaceflight to get them hooked into the explosion-simulator reputation that the game has than it is to try and give them a realistic space simulator.

My argument might begin to break down somewhat with these parts. I do not see it that way. \u0022The exception that proves the rule\u0022 is a stupid phrase, but I think Plane parts are forced to be the exception due to how much more effort and research is needed to develop these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there is a trend that parts look less and less junk-y as they advance in tech. The Kerbodyne parts are much more precisely engineered than the Rockomax parts, and they are less scrap-heaped than Jeb\u0027s Junkyard parts. The plane parts logically would be the very top line of Kerbal Engineering. In real life you \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E strap together some fireworks and find them flying off into the sky. You \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E use found parts to build a rocket engine. (Copenhagen Suborbitals, for instance). But engineering a plane is far more difficult.

It is apparent that some of the KSP models and textures were created with less skill than those in, for example, SP\u002B. Back in \u002706-07, I was a modeler for some FPS mods, so I can appreciate the \u0022craft\u0022 of modeling (and texturing to some extent, though I didn\u0027t do it much). And really, it\u0027s okay that some of the art assets aren\u0027t great at the moment -- the people making them can and likely will get better as they go along.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-09T20:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EChad became a much better modeler and texturer with experience and practice; C7 stuff was very much \u0022programmer art\u0022 at the start, but his late stuff is great.
