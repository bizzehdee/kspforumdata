Everything went to plan including the landing. The part the really made me mad as I thought it would work is that the Kerbal, which was in a Crew Cabin, hit the water with the rest of my ship and exploded instead of float like the Crew Cabin that was attached to my vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt makes no sense that the crew cabin I put on my ship would survive landing in water while the OTHER one for the mission would blow up instead. Is this a design flaw or have I missed something? Cause if it\u0027s a flaw, I highly recommend getting it set that all Crew Cabins can float in the water. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-24T21:54:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2015 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited thread title for clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T23:38:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure what you are asking.

Basically three small capsules with parachutes and heat shields on an inverted tri-coupler on the top of the rocket, each sat on its own de-coupler, the idea being to separate all three at just prior to re-entry. First time I tried it: separate at 65Km, by the time they splashed down they were about 2km apart. All but the active capsule exploded on contact. Second try: separate at 35km, splash down 1.5km apart (ish), same outcome. Third time: Ride re-entry down to overheat, separate at 15km, splash down 500m apart, all survive..... interesting. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting side note - slight off centre weights make capsules somewhat steerable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-25T11:23:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2015 11:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by XrayLima\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T11:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually impact tolerance of parts landing in water should be taken x 1.5 or 2 or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@XrayLima\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad a weird experience with a detached lab that landed near me on gras.
