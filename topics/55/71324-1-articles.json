So that way more realistic fuel pipes are necessary, or least a larger number of fuel pipes in order to increase the volume that can be transferred per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of fuel that can be transferred per second is ridiculous atm. Fuel pipes could be more varied, could be larger in diameter, stronger, or thicker to account for larger pressure given by bigger tanks. And of course, using science, they could be upgraded to allow for larger tanks to give faster/higher pressure fuel transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, if you want to asparagus, you need to give a little more thought than JUST staging order.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:36:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is NO reason to make it more \u0027realistic\u0027, other than \u0027hur dur it\u0027s realistic\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS IS A GAME.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a simulator\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-03T19:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is a game\u0022 is not a good argument for anything.

Do you need a link to a dictionary?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a reason to make it more realistic - nearly everyone who plays it focuses on realism at some point in time.
