I don\u0027t mean the type that makes you improve your\u00A0vehicle designs, but the type that means you have do an\u00A0aerobrake\u00A0three different times to find out which trajectory doesn\u0027t result in your craft exploding. Forcing the player to rely on reverting to figure this out\u00A0reduces the immersion of the game, and the repetition quickly becomes annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution to this, IMO, is to \u003Cstrong\u003Eprovide more information in game\u003C/strong\u003E to allow the player to do what they want without having to guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecially, I would suggest having an overlay over the trajectory line that shows \u0022failure points\u0022 like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n-time of EC loss\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n-time of signal loss\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-left:40px;\u0022\u003E\n-destruction in atmosphere\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022FHvyrv8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002274.39\u0022 height=\u0022427\u0022 width=\u0022574\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/FHvyrv8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the concept image above, red represents a permanent failure\u00A0(e.g. batteries run out with no solar panels), while orange represents when the craft is temporarily uncontrollable (e.g. signal blocked by Minmus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, you\u0027d be reminded to deploy your antenna and solar panels\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0its too late.
