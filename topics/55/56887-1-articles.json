Physical Fitness - As current, may allow Kerbalnaut to run/climb faster or hold on to ladders better (can resist more changes in acceleration). In future, if Kerbalnaut can \u0022blackout\u0022 due to excessive Gs, can improve the amount of Gs a Kerbalnaut can withstand (so you can go for a faster re-entry into atmosphere without worrying about your Kerbalnaut passing out and you losing control of the spacecraft).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T20:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELong ago the devs said something about training them to pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo their ability could be things like \u0022prepare a rendezvous\u0022 or \u0022docking the ship\u0022, or more basically \u0022Burn through that maneuver node\u0022 (which they would do with mechjeb\u0027s precision)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore crazy and supposing it\u0027s even possible, we could have them drive rover for us over long distance (while we do experiment or else), to bad it certainly wouldn\u0027t be possible to do without player-focus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T03:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just thought of one.
