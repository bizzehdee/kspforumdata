But as I said, I don\u0027t know for sure. Might also be that the devs themselves don\u0027t keep copies of old versions, but I think that unlikely, to be honest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one version back is, as far as I know, only there to help the community, in case someone wants the last stable version again. (Might be that a bug slipped through the nets that made the game unplayable, might be they don\u0027t like playing mod free and want the old version to play with until their favourite mods are updated, etc.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach version of KSP is in the realm of ~300mb or so, and it gets a little bigger with every update. Keeping all the old versions? Well... if we just go by major releases, even, since 0.13.3, we\u0027ve got 0.14, 0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.23.5. 11 separate builds, at least. That\u0027s a good several GB that\u0027d just be sitting there for the most part, generally just wasting server space... I suppose they could set up an \u0027official repository\u0027 on a public file host somewhere, but since the versions since 0.13.3 are the ones you had to pay for, I doubt they\u0027d publicly release any of them for free like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut remember, I am just speculating; the only way to know the official reason would be to go pester Rowsdower about it.
