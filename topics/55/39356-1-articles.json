Thing is, the developers are against forms of random damage, that\u0027s is likely unpredictable and could or could not happen for no reason during the flight and hinder your progress, they really want your success to only be based on did you crash onto something: Y/N? For this reason, the parts are in a boolean state right now, nominal (working) or broken (exploded). Now your proposition if far from being random, and I guess this would be based on impact velocity, but I\u0027m just wondering how this would affect gameplay. I most definitely agree this would be fun, as long as the damage can be repaired, like rover wheels, but I\u0027m worried it might nerf unmanned missions to an extent.

It\u0027s not like the current parts can take a whole lot of punishment - a lightweight unmanned rover turning over can already break solar panels - both folding and normal ones, housing or no. Rovers can already break their wheels just driving around. I think that getting rid of the \u0022spontaneous mass existence failure\u0022 principle would be a great move, not least because it would give you warning without completely breaking whatever you\u0027re flying. If the stress of the engine block pushing up against a heavy rocket is too great for a fuel tank to handle, right now it\u0027ll just take the punishment, and then suddenly explode. If it could get damaged, you could get advance warning - if the tank starts to crumple, you have barely seconds left to throttle down before something breaks completely. This could be very useful in career mode, where you likely won\u0027t have the option of just rolling back bad launches.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"oggylt","CreatedById":57214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T12:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell i would love bent engine or wing instead of tremendous detonation of delta wing, or landing gear, i mean not all things has to explode, they could go puff only when the speed is ridiculous, and repair skill should not be involved at all, if you exploded the wing then the same effect should be just by bending it over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mozzarellaman","CreatedById":76003,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T16:13:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t get your point. sorry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
