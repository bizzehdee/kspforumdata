In addition to TWR and delta-v, you also have to worry about the center of pressure and the center of mass. (The game also gives very little advice with any of these.) Many people advise beginners to use fins, which basically means adding more complexity to the rocket, having more things to remember, and having more things that can go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a simple trick to keep the center of mass roughly in place during the ascent. It\u0027s so simple that many (most?) beginners use it without thinking, because that\u0027s how real rockets are built. The trick is staging. If you have two vertical stages and a payload, the lower stage starts draining fuel from near the center of mass. As a result, the center of mass moves very little during the ascent, until the engines start draining the final tank and the center of mass starts moving upward. This trick works well in KSP, because the upper stage and the payload take up a large fraction of the launch mass due to high payload fractions, heavy payload parts, heavy engines, and heavy fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP rockets actually don\u0027t have that much control authority. The difference to real rockets is that KSP rockets can use the control authority to maintain stability with a high angle of attack. If you tried the same with a real rocket, aerodynamic forces would just rip the rocket apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stoney3K\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stoney3K\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe essence of a \u0027gravity turn\u0027 is that you let GRAVITY do the turning for you, instead of having to actively control it.

Gravity turns the trajectory of the rocket, but it has nothing to do with the attitude of the rocket. The attitude can be adjusted both by active and passive guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal rockets typically use active guidance, because passive guidance is rather imprecise and because not having fins saves mass. Some real rockets only follow a gravity turn during the initial phase of the ascent in order to minimize aerodynamic stress. After leaving the dense lower atmosphere behind, the rocket may switch to a higher angle of attack e.g. to compensate for the low TWR of the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T21:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain it\u0027s more than the advice it\u0027s the parts to and it\u0027s the parts design flaws that are leading to this bad advice therefore the parts are the core of the problem.
