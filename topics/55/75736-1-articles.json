The program does a fairly good job of showing encounters and the position of vehicles and the target at closest approach. It\u0027s cool but some times it isn\u0027t quite enough. The biggest problem I have is when the orbits are inclined. Some times I\u0027d like to be able to do a burn to elongate my orbit before I correct the inclination. The current system really only works if both orbits are already planer. So some times it just won\u0027t show the encounters because the orbits are still out of plane. Like when going to... the Pluto planet. It would be nice if I have a target selected to be able to hover my mouse over a point on my orbit or the planed trajectory and have a marker appear on the targets path at the relative location it will be at, at that time. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m explaining this well. I\u0027m planning one of these blind fishing burns. Looking at the planed orbit. Point to a spot on the orbit. I\u0027ll be here. Show me a marker for where the target will be at that time. I don\u0027t think it would be that hard to do but it would sure help me to understand what is happening with these relative orbits some times. It would be particular nice if you could zoom it on the intersection and watch how the two bodies pass relative to each other in the larger world view. Some times I still have trouble under standing how they interact at that encounter point. Why does it want to sling shot it off into space some times and why does it lose all of it\u0027s energy others. Mostly I just fish around blindly with a burn till it looks good but I\u0027d like to under stand what is going on better. If I could mouse along the orbit and see the relative position it would really help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T07:09:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be quite useful, not least for planning rendezvous-es.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
