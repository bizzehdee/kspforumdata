This is hands down the best game/simulation/education tool I have ever used! Despite the awesomeness of the game however, there is still a lot to wish for (such as weather). Imagine the weather on a has giant! The graphics and simulation could be vastly improved with the right funding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know KSP is getting increasingly popular, but the growth rate is just not fast enough. In order for SQUAD (you guys are my heroes) to do the next best thing, we need to have a massive funding campaign. I think once more people know how AWESOME KSP is, there will definitely be more sales and more funding. The best approach today to cheaply become the \u0022next best thing\u0022 is Kickstarter. It has a relatively low entry fee, and look what Chris Roberts did with Star Citizen! I think the guys at SQUAD can definitely pull this off?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think? If you agree, please, let\u0027s rally together, bring this to SQUAD\u0027s attention and go from there!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spectrhz","CreatedById":69106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T07:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t speak on behalf of Squad, but if I were to hazard a guess, I highly doubt they would consider this. I think the rate at which KSP is developed and sold is plenty fast enough, and the game is incredible as-is. Money isn\u0027t always the answer, its the time and the effort of development put into the game. From what I can tell, this game is updated and worked on diligently and is not needing anything quite as large as a kickstarter, since it\u0027s already had so much success. I also feel like if people were just throwing money at Squad for more updates and overhauls, the development would be a much larger item on the table.

Compared to those, this small handful of people working on KSP are really powering through updates and making major progress every update. Granted, it takes anywhere from one to three months per update, but as an example, MWO puts out one, maybe two mechs per month and it took them over a year to get things like ranked matchmaking and 12v12 matches stable enough to play. Compared to that game alone, KSP is kicking butt XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust relax and take it easy. KSP has already made lots of money for SQUAD and the developers and will continue to do so. There\u0027s no need for a kickstarter campaign...and I think people would react negatively to it at this stage of development anyways.

The vast vast vast majority of games take between 2-4 years to build from the ground up (and KSP has been under development for 2.5 years), so I have no idea where you came up with the idea it would take that long to switch engines. Mind you all the art work transfers, and all the game systems have been worked out... so its really just a matter of re-coding everything to function inside a different engine. At most, it would take a few months. That\u0027s not to say I agree with the idea of switching engines. Unity has limitations that probably hold parts of KSP back, but other engines have limitations of their own... and its not likely that there would be enough benefit to switch at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CyclonicTuna","CreatedById":21888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T21:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EvilotionCR2\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EvilotionCR2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr rework it to the engine called Terra or something like that.That engine can simulate whole planet at once and also can do Dynamic craters,and graphics...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt least try dude.

KSP didn\u0027t start out after a group of CEO\u0027s and directors sat down and decided to make the 7th sequel, it began as the brainchild of one man who had very little recources. There wasn\u0027t a budget of 100 million and a big team of 400 artists, programmers and designers to start with. So the fact that KSP has become what it is in 2 years is rather remarkible instead of slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The amount of stuff in a game does not define how far it is in the development cycle. About 80% percent of the work goes into creating an engine, establishing a framework for gamemechanics, and fixing and tweaking all of this. KSP\u0027s framework is finished, the dev\u0027s have confirmed that themselves at last years Kerbalkon. All that remains now is adding all of the content and placing all of the gamemechanics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. KSP is a project with a large active community that (unlike you I assume) provides constant feedback and suggestions. All developers of a game like for instance, The Sims have to worry about, is that they have a trailer ready every 5 weeks or so, and that they publish a couple of patches every now and again. KSP evolves, it grows, and if you have to release a playable update very 2 months its just gonna take longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo don\u0027t make these stupid claims, you\u0027re just impatient and not very passionate about this game. What sets KSP aside from other games is that demands your attention and envolvement to some degree. Which I really like because it doesn\u0027t make me feel like I\u0027m another mindless consumer in the eyes of the people that make this. And its a damn shame that that\u0027s such a rere sight these days because I slowly feel like more and more gamers are becoming mindless consumers. Which in my respect isn\u0027t very fair towards the intellectual property we demand. You are after all a gamer because you want to do more than just sit back and watch right? Then don\u0027t behave like that\u0027s what you want but you still want to be treated like you\u0027re building the game yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T03:31:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HeadHunter67\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HeadHunter67\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJee sounds like i hit a nerve on some of you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0060\u0022So go ahead and \u003Cem\u003Edo it\u003C/em\u003E then.
