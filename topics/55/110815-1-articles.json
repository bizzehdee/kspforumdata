Awesome game !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purchased the game recently and got to play a lot with it, visited some planets and moons, and became a pro at rendezvous (Back when using the early access alpha, i didn\u0027t understand rendezvous that much).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, i don\u0027t like mods, so my experience is limited to the stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new vector i\u0027m proposing has to do with rendezvous, but has ulterior utilisations wich i may go into later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen doing a rendez-vous, on the final approach, corrections must be continually made by using RCS translation, to keep your prograde vector on top of the target vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, sometimes you forget to put RCS on your ship and you\u0027re dead in the water, mostly unable to dock (or rather, having great difficulty to do it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhenever docking with no RCS, i imagine a point that is in a position such that the target vector is in the middle between the prograde and the new (imaginary) vector, when navball is set to \u0022target\u0022.When firing at that imaginary vector, the prograde vector is moved on top of the target vector and velocity to target increases, but i\u0027m headed directly for the target ship without drifting to the side.Then, i turn around retrograde and match velocities on the last stretch, switch to the target evssel to rotate it facing a docking port towards my RCS-less ship and Voila - i\u0027m docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, there\u0027s a lot of guess work and my imaginary vector isn\u0027t actually shown on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is the implementation of this vector, and make it trackable by probe cores / \u0022Fly-by-wire\u0022 hubs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on to Alternative uses : STOCK PARTS HOMING MISSILES !! \u0026lt;- I rest my case \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust... just use RCS ?
