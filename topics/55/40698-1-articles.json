The idea is that when a kerbal goes out on a mission, if he enters the SOI of a planet or moon, he automatically gets that ribbon. Attachments like the ones in my sig would be cool too, or maybe even just a star to signify that they\u0027ve returned. Ribbons could accrue and be examinable in the astronaut complex, by clicking on the Kerbal\u0027s name and getting more information about them (a separate feature that I would like to see implemented as well). Perhaps there might even be other awards you can give manually that boost the Kerbal\u0027s courage or automatically add the \u0022badass\u0022 flag (badass ribbon anybody?). Of course you may only have a certain number of awards you can bestow each in-game year so you have to pick wisely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the spirit behind this idea is that it allows players to groom their kerbals into the astronaut heroes they want them to be. We all know Jebediah is awesome, but wouldn\u0027t having a list of awards and citations as long as he is tall solidify that? It may not add much in terms of core gameplay mechanics, but anything that more fully immerses the player into the Kerbal\u0027s world is a good thing in my book.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
