Often players use Mechjeb to get two crafts docked. With such an indicator there is no (longer) a need to use Mechjeb for docking. The indicator makes docking possible, even for players just starting with KSP. As such i consider it to be an essential element in the game and highly reccommend adding this feature to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-25T19:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t mind seeing such a thing implemented.
