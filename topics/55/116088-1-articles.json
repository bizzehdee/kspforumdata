Will it maybe be ported for the 1.1 update? Do you think the visuals will be a little better in terms of shaders and lighting, or will it be the same? Will the physics be more efficient since it will use a newer version of PhysX? Any other thoughts or comments?"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:08:45Z","Content":"I can\u0027t answer on the subject of shaders and lighting. There are visual improvements in U5, but I\u0027m pretty sure Squad would have to do some work to implement the improvements.\n\nSquad is reimplementing the UI with the intent of being identical to the user, but consolidating three UI subsystems into a single subsystem to improve efficiency.\n\nSince U5 uses a more recent version of PhysX, we should see some improvements there. Most likely, we\u0027ll be able to handle craft with more parts, though how much of an increase isn\u0027t certain. This breaks down into two factors. First, the PhysX code is more optimized. Microbenchmarks indicate that the connected rigid body simulation code can run up to 50% faster. I doubt we\u0027ll see that translate into 50% more parts for the same FPS, but we\u0027ll see.\n\nSecond, PhysX 3.3 allows multiple concurrent threads to run the physics simulation, so multi-core machines will have some performance gains under certain circumstances. This isn\u0027t as big a win as you might think at first as PhysX 3.3 doesn\u0027t allow for more than one thread to process a given set of connected rigid parts at the same time, which is to say that the physics of a single craft can\u0027t get split up between multiple CPU cores. \n\nThis isn\u0027t just a limitation of PhysX, despite claims otherwise, there\u0027s not a general purpose physics engine that does this. Most modern physics engines can use multiple CPU cores to simulate unconnected bodies, even if those bodies are bouncing off of each other, but actual connected rigid bodies have only been split across multiple CPU cores in research work more constrained than what currently happens in general purpose physics engines.\n\nSo there should be some improvements in framerate with the switch, but we probably won\u0027t know how noticeable the improvements will be until someone that has gotten their hands on 1.1 is allowed to report their impression."},{"CreatedByName":"SessoSaidSo","CreatedById":111600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T05:06:44Z","Content":"Ah yea! I hope they fix the stutter issue!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuansenhama","CreatedById":114023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T15:38:39Z","Content":"I certainly hope there is some increase in the amount of parts we can get away with before lag becomes a problem. I know on my machine I begin to notice lag at around 250 parts, and at about 500 parts, things become basically unplayable. The problem of course being that a space station, where each module needs radial RCS ports and multiple docking ports, solar panels, probe cores, etc, the part count gets high fast. I know I have a friend who can manage 800-1000 parts in the physics bubble. Granted, he has a powerful computer and I\u0027m stuck playing on a laptop.\n\nIn other words I want/would like to think that they will better optimize the game. Even if that comes at the expense of graphical quality.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T15:45:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kuansenhama**"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:44:16Z","Content":"Here\u0027s hoping that unconnected rigidbody chains are at least multithreadable for physics calculations (And any craft packed for non-physical time warp.)

Investigations ni another thread showed clearly that the current performance is not a PhysX problem but seems to be located in 2 subsystems: Heat distribution and - extremely - resssource allocation.

Yes, the rigid-body microbenchmarks run 50% faster, but I don\u0027t expect us to see that much of a performance boost since that\u0027s only part of what\u0027s happening. I\u0027d love to see this particular issue optimized in 1.1. Between the faster PhysX and this optimization, we\u0027d get to more accurately see what the next bottleneck will be.\n\nWorse, even a 50% improvement across the board doesn\u0027t mean 50% more parts would have the same performance as now. Since the resource issue mentioned in that thread describes an O(n^2) algorithm, performance dropoff from additional parts isn\u0027t linear. Even with optimization, I don\u0027t think that issue will reach O(n), but really O(n\\*log(n)) would still be better than O(n^2)."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T00:51:14Z","Content":"It *better* fix the random Linux crashing whenever you change a scene.
