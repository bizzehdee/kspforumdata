I talked about radiation, micro meteorites that could complicate a mission if you don\u0027t take them into account before starting your journey. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now with the R\u0026amp;D protion of the game along with the tech tree and the science portion of the game being realized, I think I found a better way to implement this. Instead of random accidents and errors that the player can\u0027t really prevent, how about this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTEP 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine that the first few missions in your career (at least I imagine so) would be to launch up into orbit sattalites and scientific equipment to get a picture of your place in the solar system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with these sattalites you can scan the skies for, well anything I imagine. Moons, planets, asteroids (if they ever get implemented). But also for instance clouds of high radiation of high density of micro meteroids. Now with this information you could map out the solar system into area\u0027s of high risk and low risk. Meaning that if you for instance are planning to travel to Jool one day you might encounter one of these \u0022clouds\u0022 or area\u0027s of high risk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTEP 2: Now you have three choices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do I go balls to the walls kerbal style and just go for it? (Jeb playstyle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do I wait for an oppertunity to bypass this area, a launch window so to speak. (Bill playstyle)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do I buy expensive new protective technology which will allow me to wander savely into this area but is a greater fiinancial risk. (Bob playstyle) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there is a chance that you make it relitively unharmed if you go Jeb, you could make this assumption on the data you have gathered. But if you go Bill or Bob you know for sure you won\u0027t be harmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESTEP 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that you\u0027ve got three diffrent playstyles, you can devide unlocks on the tech tree (and other rewardsystems to come) based on those playstyles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Jeb will get you better engines and more boosters, and newer cockpits etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bill will get you better scanning and scientific equipment, which will in term increase revenue because you are also laying an infrastructure for communications. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bob will get you other technologies like lifesupport and protective systems and structural parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOfcourse these dangers of space shouldn\u0027t bug you right from the beginning, you should get a chance to at least get some kerbals and some sattalites in orbit. But maybe it could be dynamic. Meaning that no two savegames will likely ever have the same map, and these clouds could be influenced by all the planets over time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just an idea to make interplanetairy travel a bit more exciting and part of the game, rather than just a tedious wait. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could add a difficulty factor to the game for people who want a real challange, and for the people who want less of a challange mayb and option to turn it off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-05T09:29:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very well thought out idea.

But I don\u0027t think that the player will abuse the quicksave function like you discribed. The reason for this is because when you choose a certain playstyle you know you\u0027re gonna miss out on certain things till a certain degree, so you deliberately make the choice to take a risk. And like bommerdog said. Its not really as random when the player knows exactly how to avoid it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I think that this could also be easily resovled by disabeling the quicksave feature for the Jeb playstyle. After all, you are taking a risk, and if you try to avoid that it really isn\u0027t taking a risk. Now as long as that risk is rewarded properly it could be a succesfull gameplay mechanic. That is one option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut besides that, it should never be a completely mindless risk in my opinion. It should be part of the gameplay in every way possible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean by that is that this whole mechanic could fit into the R\u0026amp;D portion of the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ive scanned region R with equipment B. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Equipment B has a 45% accuracy rate meaning that region X has a dangerfactor of 8:10.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My craft can handle a dangerfactor of 7:10 so I won\u0027t choose to traverse that terrain quite yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HOWEVER, I can choose to unlock equipment C on the tech tree to get a more accutrate reading (because you will have more knowledge of that area that way).
