The plane handles about the same, the ocean looks the same, the ground is a plain color that can be seen on some beaches on Kerbin. Landings are slightly different but almost the same, the terrain has some interesting shapes, and the surface is mostly ocean. The sky is blue. Really, the most alien thing about Laythe is seeing Jool in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just curious if there\u0027s some reasoning behind making Laythe so similar to Kerbin? Does it become difficult to fly planes in the atmosphere when the gravity is changed significantly? Are there plans in the works to change the ocean and ground texturing eventually?

But that doesn\u0027t mean that Laythe COULDN\u0027T have a different colored sky. But the rest of my point remains anyway. And I was wondering how changing the gravity affects flight. Like, say the next gas giant in the Kerbol system gets a Titan analogue with an atmosphere much thicker than Kerbin at surface, but with much lower gravity--but say the analogue has oxygen in the air. What would it be like to fly a plane in that? Alternatively, what would it be like to fly a plane over a very-low-gravity planet with a thin atmosphere, say, reduced in thickness to make the lift-to-weight ratio similar to Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Felsmak","CreatedById":27187,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-30T00:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like Laythe.
