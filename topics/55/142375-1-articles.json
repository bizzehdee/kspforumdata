To discover the closer terrestrial planets there could be a new building in the KSP that acts as an observatory and can be upgraded and planets can be discovered in time if funds are spent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T01:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like this is already in development\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139473-112-researchbodies-v172-1st-june-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EResearch Bodies\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T15:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think most of the solar system should already be known since humanity was able to view them long before they started space programs.

There should be a rare chance of discovering a giant KBO, and it would always be different for each game, so you could have a unique planet to show off to the rest of the KSP community!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-09T10:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222644800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022142375\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221466731845\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129659\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022icedown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/24/2016 at 3:30 AM, icedown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething like this is already in development\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/139473-112-researchbodies-v172-1st-june-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EResearch Bodies\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel that Research Bodies is a bit overkilling and adds too much complexity.
