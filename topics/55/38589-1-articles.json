Sometimes the highlighting of stages is just not enough as I may have something within something else or similar parts that have been rearranged due to modifying a structure. If there was a way to go into a ghost mode/wire-frame/x-ray mode or something this would be awesome. I know it is somewhat possible now when certain items or groups are selected, but think it would be a very useful feature if I could manually select this option with say a toggle switch for the whole build, Then I could go through my stage groups and verify things look correct or re manipulate them as needed much easier and with better assurance that I have it right. Also being able to re-name these stages would also be a big plus and very helpful in complicated builds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like this idea enough to implement it. I think it would be a totally cool upgrade to the program, and make craft building much more user friendly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogueHydra","CreatedById":75994,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T20:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was considering making a new thread but found this to be a good place to add on my suggestion. I think it\u0027d be helpful (in certain situations) if the highlight/glow effect were at the lowest z-buffer level so it is visible regardless of anything covering it (just like the 3 orbs for displaying the center of mass, lift, and thrust. I occasionally have a difficult time aligning certain parts up (because I think I\u0027m OCD about positioning). It\u0027d probably be helpful even in the previously suggested ghost/x-ray/wire-frame modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
