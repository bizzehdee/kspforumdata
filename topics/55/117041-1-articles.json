You could upgrade engines for higher thrust, or better fuel efficiency, or wider gimbal range; upgrade the mobile processing lab for higher data storage capacity or faster research; upgrade solar panels and RTG\u0027s for higher electrical output.

Maybe you could only upgrade the engine or part on one craft, which would also make people want to reuse the same rocket like in rl."},{"CreatedByName":"carneyvich","CreatedById":147880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T11:43:06Z","Content":"maybe if it made a new part."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T11:47:41Z","Content":"Somebody really should return the [Already Suggested](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/44952-Already-Suggested-List) list to its former glory.

A large number of people play with mods, and they manage to get support troubleshooting, and the changes would be small for the sake of balance.\n\nA choice of options for an upgrade path system, combined with precursors required more than the stock tree (a wider tree, with more attention to precursors required for a given new node) would make research paths more critical. If the current system were not so awful, then it would not be so attractive."},{"CreatedByName":"Tweeker","CreatedById":101796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T20:07:45Z","Content":"QUOTE] I like that the specs of parts don\u0027t change.
