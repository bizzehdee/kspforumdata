For normal SCUBA, the pressure is only a major concern in terms of rate of pressure change, due to decompression issues. The human body can withstand far more than Earth\u0027s sea level atmospheric pressure (1 bar). A fully qualified advanced recreational SCUBA diver can go to 50m, which is 6 bar, on just air. With mixed gases, they can go to 80\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100m, 9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015311 bar pressure (over 10x normal surface pressure). That\u0027s all without any form of pressure compensation suit, just a normal wet or dry suit, so the body is fully exposed to the increased ambient pressure. Lack of pressure is a huge problem, but excess pressure is something that the human body copes with remarkably well, as long as it\u0027s uniform pressure and matched to the pressure of the gas available to breathe. The breathing gas mixture also has to be appropriate, obviously, as oxygen is toxic at high pressure (compressed normal surface air with 20% O2 is toxic to humans at a bit more than 50m depth, which is why 50m is the traditional normal SCUBA safety limit).\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, it\u0027s an odd feeling, having 4\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u01535x normal pressure acting in on you, but not at all unpleasant, as long as you manage the pressure changes properly. Throw in feeling weightless, effectively being in an alien environment, and being confident in your training and equipment and dive buddy, and it\u0027s a fun activity.\n\nCommercial saturation divers spend weeks on end living at 10x\u002B atmospheric pressure, when there\u0027s a job which calls for it. I\u0027d need to check to be certain, but pretty sure that they can operate down to at least 250m (26 bar / 26x surface pressure) without any form of pressure suit, just a suitable mothership with saturation diving facilities.\n\nIf you have seen normal diving dry suits with an air line leading to a valve on the suit, that has nothing to do with pressure compensation, in terms of pressure acting in on the body. It\u0027s there for buoyancy control, allowing you to add air to the suit to achieve and maintain neutral buoyancy, with another dump valve to let some air out."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:12:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E we are. temperature is being ignored, but radiation shouldn\u0027t be a big problem if you have an atmosphere.\n\nThe point is, you can\u0027t ignore temperature.\n\nAssuming Duna is the Mars analogue of KSP, I\u0027ll point out that at night, temperatures on Mars can get as cold as -73~125**\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0**C, while the warmest summer\u0027s day on Mars is barely 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C - this is partially due to the distance Mars is from the Sun compared to Earth (Duna is also further from Kerbol than Kerbin). A Kerbal wearing the proposed lightweight scuba suit will freeze to death rather quickly, whereas a proper EVA spacesuit would keep them warm.\n\nThe atmosphere on Duna/Mars is very thin, and so does not provide adequate protection against cosmic radiation.\n\nFinally, Martian/Duna regolith may be abrasive enough to wear down / puncture the lightweight scuba suit."}]}
