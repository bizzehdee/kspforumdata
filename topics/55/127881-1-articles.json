With the upcoming release of 1.1 and 64 bit KSP, people will be able to use many more mods than before, especially mods containing many, many parts. But even in the stock game, some part placements make no sense and are confusing, such as the location of crew cabins in the Utilities tab. My suggestion aims to fix that, without adding dozens of extra menus; it instead adds subcategories for each tab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you selected a tab like \u0022Utilities,\u0022 a drop down menu would appear under the Utilities menu with the subcategories\u0027 tabs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how my idea of the perfect part menu would be organized:\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe \u0022^\u0022 symbol designates a tab as a subcategory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommand\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Crewed Control - Crewed parts with command capability like the Mk 3 cockpit or the Mk 1-2 pod\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Crew Storage - Crewed parts without command capability like the science lab, crew cabins and the Hitchhiker\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Probes - Various probe cores, as well as the avionics nosecone\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Remote Communication - Transmitters, antennae, and resource scanners\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPropulsion\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Aircraft Tanks - Aircraft fuel tanks (Aircraft adapters not included)\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ General Fuel Tanks - General rocket fuel tanks\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Monopropellent Tanks - Various monopropellent tanks\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Rocket Engines - Rocket engines (duh)\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Solid Rockets - SRBs (duh)\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Nuclear Engines - The only one in this category is the LV-N (This is mostly here for the mods that add several nuclear engines)\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Electric Engines - Just the Dawn (This is again mostly here for mods that add a ton electrical engines [Nertea, I\u0027m looking at you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E] )\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Jet Engines and Intakes - Jet engines and air intakes (duh)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStructural\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Adapters - Stack adapters, as well as aircraft adapters\u003Cbr\u003E\n^ Construction - Struts, girder segments, docking ports, the launch stability enhancer and other structural bits.
