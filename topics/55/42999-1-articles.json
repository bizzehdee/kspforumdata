Apparently(and I\u0027m no expert here), if you add more fuel to the top of a solid rocket booster, it increases the thrust, but not the thrust time. If you increase the diameter, however, THAT increases thrust time. The reason is because solid fuel burns all the way up the booster, like a flaming tube in the middle. It burns outward so wider tanks=more burn time and taller tanks=more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, why would you capitalize every word? I\u0027ve seen people do that and never understand why. Just boggles my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
