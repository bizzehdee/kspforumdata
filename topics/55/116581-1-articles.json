The contract payouts are set to cover the full cost of a new launch, and the contracts are restricted in ways that require new builds. Lots of people have found work-arounds that \u0022cheat\u0022 the system by attempting to circumvent these limitations. The classic example is leaving a thermometer satellite in orbit of Kerbin or Mun so that when a \u0022science from orbit of ...\u0022 contract comes round, you can just spam it for free money. I\u0027d like to see contracts in the game that are designed around the idea of the player building out infrastructure and then using it. For example:\n\n- science from [location] that doesn\u0027t cover the cost of getting there, on the assumption that you will either already have something there or use it as an add-on to another mission\n\n- science from [location] that has a completion time that won\u0027t cover the flight time to get there, expecting you to have already left something behind from a previous mission\n\n- space station contracts that don\u0027t require a new launch, but only pay for what would be an incremental expansion of an existing station\n\n- tourist contracts that specify the tourists have to be in a vehicle that is *not* new, for example \u0022Orbit Kerbin in a craft already in orbit\u0022, effectively a \u0022visit the space station\u0022 contract.\n\n- satellite contracts that *don\u0027t* require a new launch, but won\u0027t pay enough for a new launch, allowing you to re-position an existing satellite\n\nBasically, I\u0027d like to see the game rewarding the player for just going to new places, but for actually establishing a permanent presence in space."},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:47:32Z","Content":"Me too! In the meantime, [Contract Configurator](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604) and various contract packs fill some of the void; Field Research, and Kerbin Space Station speak to some of your specific requests."},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T17:59:43Z","Content":"I feel that saving time and money in itself is a great incentive to have infrastructure in orbit. I often do waypoint contracts using hardware that\u0027s already in space.\n\nYour two first suggestions (not covering the launch cost/time) seem redundant in that sense. I would rather just do the normal contract for more money.\n\nBut I do agree that there should be space station expansion contracts for adding new modules, station tourist contracts, and also satellite contracts which don\u0027t *require* a new launch. It\u0027s something the game is definitely missing."}]}
