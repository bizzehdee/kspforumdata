And I think it is something of an alternative to generic \u0027upgrades\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, there would be a new gizmo in the editor, which would allow you to edit the \u0027sub-modules\u0027 of certain parts, namely stuff like engines and fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For engines, you would be able to choose things like nozzle type, maybe with a slider for different altitude efficiencies or something like that. You would be able to tweak the fuel flow, and the power the engine outputs, but this would have the effect of making it heat up faster. Extra things could be added, like an engine heat radiator so that it cools down quicker and heats up slower- but this would increase the drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks would have options such as the ratio of LF to O, and the wall thickness. Wall thickness would trade impact tolerance for fuel capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a little suggestion I have thought of, oddly enough based on some of the ideas in other games.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T11:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENozzle type swapping is highly unrealistic, if it was to profoundly change the characteristic of the engine. Rocket engines are a complete integrated and matched system, with fuel flow passing through pipes integrated into the nozzle, as a coolant, and limited by the size of that integrated pipework, before flowing to turbo pumps and pre-combusion chambers which need to be closely matched to the nozzle. They are not mix and match from a parts catalogue, but extreme precision and high durability engineering. Small variations might be possible, but would not really be worth the effort to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can re-engineer them, to produce a new derivative engine, such as the SSMEs (RS-25s) being re-engineered from re-usable to disposable (NASA\u0027s work to turn Shuttle tech into SLS tech, with a deep engineering design refresh of all components), with ultimately a significant reduction in cost, but that\u0027s really just a completely new engine which builds on the previous design and lessons learnt from it (i.e. it\u0027s not just swap out a few components ad-hoc, like fitting better carbs to a petrol engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiator on a rocket engine?

Yes, they are similar and related engines. No, they are not fully parts compatible (although they have some common parts), and you don\u0027t just swap the bell to convert from one version to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Oh yeah, a thought on small radiators. I\u0027m not saying that Squad\u0027s current model is perfect, but small radiators don\u0027t work in space (i.e. you can\u0027t reduce the size of your radiator), as they rely entirely on surface area pointed outwards, away from the vessel and any of its components. There is no air flow as used to enable heat transfer on inward facing surface area on terrestrial engine radiators. Or, let me put it another way, I think the LV-N is badly wrong, and it seems like it\u0027s the only engine which really needs a radiator right now. Its current behaviour in-game is totally at odds with the Los Alamos / NASA design, which was cooled by the fuel and did not require vast amounts of external thermal management. They need to fix the LV-N\u0027s configuration, not add radiators to the game \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC.it shouldn\u0027t have any major thermal issues at all, as long as it\u0027s not pointing its exhaust at something or burning up in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T10:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T15:17:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suppose with the LV-N, isn\u0027t all the heat meant to be going into the fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T16:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vectura\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vectura\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI suppose with the LV-N, isn\u0027t all the heat meant to be going into the fuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, that\u0027s a fundamental part of the NERVA design.
