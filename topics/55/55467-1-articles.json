Is there any technical reason why we couldn\u0027t have a \u0022Freeze\u0022 button that pauses the game but still keeps the camera controls active? Like time warp only with warp factor 0? Not only would it help diagnose failures, but I\u0027m sure it would allow for capturing some really epic screenshots too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T17:07:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be nice.

However, I think you\u0027re confusing the idea of \u0022rendering\u0022 with actual animation, which is what camera movement is, in a sense, and which itself requires additional rendering work. I know at least this much is true based on experiments with frame buffer captures that result in geometry that includes not only the local stuff, but also a huge slice of whatever else is within view range of the camera at the time (such as a wide swath of Kerbin\u0027s surface).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the geometry is present at the time of capture, that geometry obviously needs to be calculated and introduced as the camera changes its angle, and I definitely see the geometry changing between captures at different view angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECaptured while looking at the nose of a plane on the runway, immediately after launch\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SaWSgCq67BQ/Up4NZphVqKI/AAAAAAAAYI8/Hd_jfHmpgkA/s800/Dev-2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Dev-2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis tells me that the pause function really is a total pause, where the engine won\u0027t render anything different from what was visible in the camera at the moment the pause was enabled, because changing the camera angle means doing additional rendering work to include the \u0022new\u0022 geometry in the view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne element that backs this theory is the fact that while the game is running, say on a basic ship on the runway, the fan on my video card is ramped up slightly to the point where I can hear it. If I hit pause, the fan spools back down to about the level it\u0027s normally at, sitting at the desktop. Yes, I know that\u0027s really only a reliable indicator that \u003Cem\u003Ephysics \u003C/em\u003Ecalculations have been paused, but given that the fan speed goes up the more I move the view around on the ground, I think it\u0027s a fairly logical connection to say that the camera view is locked because the pause function halts ALL new processing, not just physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust based on what I\u0027ve discovered so far, I would imagine that if there were a way to bypass the frame freeze at pause and move the camera, you\u0027d see nothing but black beyond the edges of what was in view the moment you hit pause.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T21:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadweasel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esnip\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like the Unity camera works a lot differently than I thought, I stand corrected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mahparson","CreatedById":77919,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T02:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this would be really cool\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T03:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Deadweasel: slowing down the time is even a possibility?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T03:35:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tetryds\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tetryds\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E@Deadweasel: slowing down the time is even a possibility?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, there\u0027s no reason why that couldn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I suddenly just remembered...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbcam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbcam/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T03:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be a very great idea, not only for watching your ship but also for toggling multiple engines if you forgot action groups, allowing you to toggle them all without unbalancing your thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T09:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep,a button that\u0027s easy to press and takes a short time to press,like tab (near wasd!).It would be awesome to have a 3D look of a ship that\u0027s just about to crash\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimMartland","CreatedById":68334,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T11:41:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou coul have a little \u0027pause\u0027 button as the leftmost button in the timewarp tab.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T19:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_sleep.png\u0022 alt=\u0022-_-\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight help to actually try to look around a little bit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57324-0-22-Dynamic-Warp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57324-0-22-Dynamic-Warp\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
