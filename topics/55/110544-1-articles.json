Those sort of problems should be far easier to reliably deal with when it is Squad doing the work, with the ability to provide proper support throughout the framework. For example, someone else\u0027s active ship would never get deleted as debris because it would have a flag set marking it as an active player ship, which would short-circuit the normal debris handler.

Reentry heat is mainly dependent on the 2 things - ship\u0027s drag coefficient and its velocity at reentry. If we want to simulate it further, we should take atmosphere density into account (and it varies depending on the altitude). I think the simplified formula would fit here nicely.
