For example, a science experiment can be set up to collect science in orbit high and or in orbit low. They can also be set to count passing over each biome as a separate science opportunity so for example \u0022in orbit high over the polar biome\u0022 is already supported by the game. Extreme high space is really \u0022Solar orbit\u0022 and that\u0027s covered as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as 45 degree or equatorial, I don\u0027t quite see how science collection would differ depending on nothing more than your orbital path. There may be edge cases, but in general I feel like the ability to collect science from High/Low over each Biome kind of does the trick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be interested in seeing a couple more biomes the sun\u0027s sphere of influence as you go further out.

You just gave us a recommendation to expand that grind in other areas. This is not a very popular thing to recommend because of that reason. Rather a whole career makeover would suffice IMHO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEventually biomes are just a imaginative line.
