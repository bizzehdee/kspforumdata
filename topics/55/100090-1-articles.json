Part-locking should be tied to your game difficulty chosen. But you should always lose rep for failed launches, and even more rep for failed launches causing nuclear fallout. An impactresistance buff to the RTG and LV-N would probably be a wise idea too.\n\nAn **RTG** runs off of the heat of the decaying uranium though, there is no actual nuclear reaction; and iirc, it\u0027s mostly (easily shielded) alpha and beta decay. RTGs are honestly not that radioactive.\n\nA **nuclear reactor** isn\u0027t that radioactive until run, lots of the radioactivity from nuclear reactors comes from fission products from, and after, the reaction itself.\n\nA note in-game about a reputation loss if those parts destruct in a sub-orbital trajectory less than 60km or 1,000 m/sec. (Arbatrary numbers I just made up.) And an increased rep loss for a *used* LV-N destructing under those conditions. The launch itself has a reputation loss, a nuclear payload could add \u0022bonus -rep\u0022.\n\nYou could even add a \u0022[radioactive trefoil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol#Radioactive_trefoil_symbol)\u0022 next to the LV-N overheat gauge in the staging tree; and only shows after the engine has been fired at least once, and is meeting the requirements of massive reputation loss. Of course, the hazard indicator has a tooltip stating \u0022massive reputation loss due to radioactive fallout if this part explodes.\u0022\n\nThis isn\u0027t about adding nothing to gameplay in my opinion. It\u0027s about making reputation more meaningful in the game.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-19T20:50:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2015 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KrazyKrl**"}]}
