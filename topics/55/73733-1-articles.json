One throttle for each type. That would give us more options in creating our own engine clusters with good efficiency. Lots of more options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEx. The project I am currently working on. Engine cluster of two KR-2L and six LV-N. In this case it would be more efficient to throttle down the KR-2L and run maximum on the LV-N.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/e97avce.png\u0022 alt=\u0022e97avce.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-31T12:24:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2014 12:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Umami\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T12:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod for it, I just don\u0027t remember the name.
