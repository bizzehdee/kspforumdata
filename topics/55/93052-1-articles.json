You may ask \u0022Hey bio, why is it so important?\u0022 Because 32-bit versions of Windows cannot address more than 2 Gb RAM for a single 32-bit process (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMemory limits for Windows releases\u003C/a\u003E) without manual editing of the boot options.
