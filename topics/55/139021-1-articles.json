Select a tech you want to research and 2 years later you can prototype the first part. Cost for program down-payment and yearly costs. Allow the player to speed up development via the admin options or on a per-program basis with increased fees. Allow access to all basic tech at the start... batteries, small wings, etc. Some techs are given to you for nothing but prototype costs, because you\u0027ve used a part enough to gain experience with the system. Use the Reliant enough and Wernher von Kerman proposes prototyping a Swivel (you still have to pay for the prototype). Research program costs can be kept under control by setting a cap on research allocation, example: a 2 year program costing \u003Cspan\u003E\u221A\u003C/span\u003E15k total (\u003Cspan\u003E\u221A\u003C/span\u003E7.5k per year) takes 3 years because you have set the max yearly research expenditure at \u003Cspan\u003E\u221A\u003C/span\u003E5k.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFix Kerbal hiring so that Kerbals of different experiences are offered. The more experienced they are, the more they cost. The better your rep, the more likely you will attact experienced Kerbals. Greatly reduce the cost of Kerbals relative to parts (they are far too expensive, needs to be balanced). Recruit a Kerbal by paying a small signing bonus and then pay a yearly salary for a 10-year contract. Some will say they don\u0027t want to be Kerbal KR, fine I appreciate the sentiment, but what is Career mode for if you don\u0027t have to manage a space program? The costs would be easy to manage, have all committed yearly costs summed up to display next to your funds. The admin building could have a place where you see KR contract costs, and forecasted costs for the next 2, 5, and 10 years. Add a continuous fund stream (financed by Kerbal Government) that will help mitigate any real impact from HR costs. If you kill a bunch of Kerbals, your rep is hit, and you lose a portion of the funding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, now we have a functioning tech and hiring process, we can talk about making the game \u0022harder\u0022. Because Squad has gone through all of the above effort to finish Career mode, I propose a very simple solution. We all know they love slider bars, and fine, not really my style but it works. I therefore propose a slider that will scale up the Kerbol system (at the same time reducing density). It could go from 10% (current game configuration) to 100%. Maybe the truly insane would want more, but I\u0027m fine with 10x lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-05T15:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think \u0022time\u0022 mechanics will make the game harder.

A first time player choosing Easy would do a series of flyby missions across the solar system and probably feel pretty good about that. Then they\u0027d start a new game at Medium (or maybe there could be an upgrade-difficulty\u00A0button to keep the same save)\u00A0and figure out how to get into orbit and return, potentially adding\u00A0\u0394v to previous crafts for the additional\u00A0burns. Then they\u0027d do a Hard campaign and learn to design and fly landers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see a few issues with that approach, but it might be better than having all the same kinds of contracts in all difficulty modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-09T17:14:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222570902\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022139021\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462804942\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161340\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John JACK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, John JACK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like kerbals themselves.
