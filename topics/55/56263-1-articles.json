When a poll asks \u0022would you rather have [impossible thing] or [possible thing]\u0022 a lot of people are going to answer with [possible thing] NOT because they like it more, but because they\u0027re trying to set more achievable goals. If it turns out that SQUAD has recently found a way to make multiplayer practical, and has changed their stance on that, then that should also invalidate any poll taken back when their official word was still that it was impossible.
