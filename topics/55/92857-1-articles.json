Inside the TS menu is a timer for each stage after the launching stage, for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0: 10,00s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: 4,00s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: 10,00s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: space\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis menu would be very similar to the animation menu from microsoft powerpoint, but a little bit more kerbal style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo note that this is quite far from autopilot, as you stil have to point your spacecraft and throttle down/up, but it will help when you need a perfect timing where a human falls short or you just want to optimize your lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
