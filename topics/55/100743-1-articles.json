The current system is a wee bit... well, submissive.

For RCS based rotations this wastes **huge** amounts of monopropellent, and you can watch the engine gimballing just vibrate.\n\nMy impression is that the orientations to specific vectors aren\u0027t being handled with the same PID approach and controller values as simple orientation lock, and in fact act like all-on/all-off corrections *(bang-bang)* with associated overshooting. Might I suggest that specific vector orientations use the same PID *(proportional/integral/derivative)* approach as simple orientation maintenance?\n\nThis is especially important if the reaction wheels are going to be nerfed in some fashion, as RCS *(and required monopropellent)* becomes far more important to the missions."}]}
