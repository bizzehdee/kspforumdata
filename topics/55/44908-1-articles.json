The Russian Kerbals, if you will. Piloted by a sort of mech-jeb and difficulty-adjustable, there will be a list of goals which will award points based on difficulty but also bonus points for beating your opponent, as well as recruits with better stats etc. Since there\u0027s the problem of getting stuck in a ten-year mission around the Sun and losing the game while in 100,000x warp, these goals will pretty much just be activated in order based on the mission plans that you set up in the control room before hand, and this will start the clock. This will provide incentive to use the control room and more points are awarded when you complete a mission within the parameters you have set yourself. When you create a mission your Mech opponent will have a launch date to try and make the same goal (difficulty adjustable). You will not get all the details except maybe its basics. Also, nothing stopping you from sabotaging their missions, which I imagine could be a lot of fun (if you like killing Kerbalnauts). However, there could also be a couple easter-egg missions where you actually have to come to their aid and help them with a rescue mission*, which will make them an ally and give you an R\u0026amp;D multiplier and maybe a couple secret parts. You might even be able to pay them to conduct missions alongside you, if you need them to help you with a station build, and maybe co-operative play could get you a little bonus as well. Just dont expect them to be able to lift your Orange-tank-array with any success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an idea that really interests me. The game can get a bit lonely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I imagine you could have a text feed that updates you on your opponent\u0027s progress, and once in a while you\u0027ll see rockets that blew up on the launchpad, but sometimes you\u0027ll see \u0022kerbalnauts trapped in space, running out of air\u0022 If you go to the mission control center you can plan a \u0022rescue mission\u0022, which will then give you full disclosure on the specs of the craft, including available docking ports and you can see it on the map, interact with it if necessary.

This could be in whatever order you want. If your space program goes on a 50-year hiatus your opponent wont just continue colonizing the solar system. All it is is just a little storyline that kind of gives you a nudge. Because you might see that your opponent planned a launch the same day that you launch, but then maybe they blow up. The game would only register you as \u0022losing\u0022 if you really ****ed up and aborted several missions, maybe. Then suddenly your see that a red flag is already on the Mun. You could still do it and get points, just not the glory. Or you fail the mission twice and you are afraid that your opponent will skunk you, so you go to mission control and create a sabotage mission, the game will pick from a few stock parts, like a Mun orbiter, and just PUT it there, for you to crash in to within a certain time frame before it simply disappears. If you do this, you will set your opponent back a few stages, and you can still win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this makes it more feasible without also taking away the interest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-04T09:56:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2013 09:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Insomn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
