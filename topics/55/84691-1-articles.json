And then with out making an entirely new part, place that information into the ship file. This way the parts can have the benefits of being welded with out the clutter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR...(this just popped in my head) Could a mod alter how joints function. So instead of being a breaking point, they instead become a node in a spline. That way the ship does not come apart at the node but instead flexes across the model.

Since KSP treats parts as rigid bodies and the joints are the flex points. The thought was to take those nodes that each get a calculation and merge them to make a single spline. The spline then gets the calculation based on node an part values. That way your only messing with one larger value instead of numerous smaller ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T22:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom my understanding the physics-part of welding would pretty much the same as a non-physics joint. Then I guess it could be replaced by storing physics significance for each (instance of a) part in the craft file and fixing the way insignificant parts are calculated (i.e. applying the collective mass and CoM to their root part). In any case colliders stay the same so you\u0027ll keep any lag from collision checking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother part of welding is the merging of part modules, especially RESOURCE nodes. I used welding a lot for joining tanks, so that there is only one tank to refuel, which is easy to find, and the CoM of the fuel is constant without need for any fuel-flow or -balancing voodoo. It would be quite convenient to have this happen in the craft file instead of creating clutter in the part catalog each time you use it. Nice to have, though probably not a priority feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: flexing joints would be the same as thre \u0027unbreakable joint\u0027 cheat option. But as soon as the joint is allowed any flex, you probably need the full physics calculation. I doubt that you can find a simple spline-like model that handles any sort of weld. What is more important, this probably is something that would need to happen inside unity and not ksp or a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-15T23:01:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2014 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by pellinor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
