For example, say you sent a space station to orbit Minmus. If you make a gravioli/gravity reading while over the lowlands, sending it\u00A0to\u00A0the lab (pressing the science beaker-shaped button) while over that biome, earns more science than if it had moved to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, if the science lab were a base station on the surface, let\u0027s say on Minmus Greater Flats, an astronaut returning from an EVA with a surface sample from Greater Flats will earn more science than a surface sample from Lowlands, all else being equal (ie you\u0027ve not already processed one, or returned one to Kerbin). This makes things a bit awkward to maximise science, you\u0027d need to move your base station around onto the eg Lowlands to process the science to the max there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout a science lab on it, a space station is limited use, but if it has crew on it (for \u0022crew reports\u0022 - which count as science) or instruments eg thermometer, pressure, then it is useful for the contracts \u0022gather science from space around xxxxx\u0022. Also if it has fuel, or you\u0027re lucky with its position; or put it in an orbit which covers all of the surface over time;\u00A0it can do \u0022crew report from space above Sector xxxx\u0022 contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I\u0027ve not docked to or expanded any of mine.
