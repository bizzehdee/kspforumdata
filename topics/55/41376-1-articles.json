So while screwing around with asparagus staging I thought of something that might be good for new ideas. The part in theory would be a ring similar to a decoupler except that it would be a part of the main rocket body that decouples anything attached to it instead of putting on radial decouplers. This would either be a ring that attaches the same way as a radial decoupler except that it covers an entire flat cross section (z,x) of the rocket while not disturbing anything that its on. I\u0027ve been doing this already by attaching things ON normal decouplers so that they\u0027ll fall off with it when staged, the only problem is that parts \u0027snap\u0027 to their CoG instead of where the mouse is when you try to attach them in the VAB from my experience so for example orange fuel tanks will screw some of my designs over so I have to use smaller tanks radially and put orange ones underneath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr I want a part like a normal decoupler that makes anything attached radially to it fall off when staged.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-06T22:51:54Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2013 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nalin_Airheart\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
