The control axis of the landers is upwards, which works fine until you go to \u0022yaw\u0022 (roll on its axis) from IVA and find that the rudder is reversed. Almost every time I try to do an IVA landing in one I end up crashing because at some point I forget that my twist-stick is backwards and I panic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl directions need to be more configurable in general. Not just the navball direction, but which axis counts as roll or yaw and in which direction. Changing the lander control axis to forwards would solve the IVA controls issue, but then the navball wouldn\u0027t be very useful as a landing aid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Plane Mode mod helps a lot with aircraft (it swaps roll and yaw for anything built in the spaceplane hangar), but it only solves a narrow range of problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
