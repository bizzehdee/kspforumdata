Especially with mods installed. I got the impression that loading 3d models of parts is the main problem. Other games seem to load 3d data much more efficiently, so I thought I\u0027d look into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems 3d data in mods comes in .dae (COLLADA) files. That\u0027s a slow interchange format, but it\u0027s apparently converted to .mu files when KSP is run, to improve loading times later. But loading times are still quite slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.mu is Squad\u0027s format, and they asked people not to create a .mu decompiler/converter. Why?
