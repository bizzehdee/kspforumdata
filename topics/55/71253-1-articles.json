I\u0027ve got to say, I\u0027ve never seen this either. It may be to do with your settings. If you have them rather low, the chances are that the texture and collision model are out of alignment for one reason or another. If this is the case, the structure is not embedded in the actual surface. This is a likely possibility, as if any part is under the surface at all it causes the whole thing to fall through due to the way that the game loads parts and planet models. You see, the planet\u0027s surface is only a \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E thin layer of stuff you can actually touch. Above and beneath this is just a load of space. If anything clips through, it falls. It\u0027s the same for parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lower gravity of the Mun means that your suspension is keeping the little rover higher than on Kerbin. The gravity of Kerbin means that the rover\u0027s weight (not to be mistaken for mass) increases, which means that the suspension bears more weight, which in turn means that it sinks further. On the Mun, this effect is reduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, it may be that the part is somehow on a different level to the rover. If this is the case, it\u0027s a bug. This post is in the wrong place either way, for future reference you should put things like this in the \u0022Support and Bugs\u0022 section. This part of the forum is reserved for suggestions and discussion regarding potential game features. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t help you here, but it should be reported to Squad so that they can fix it or explain why it is happening if it is not a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T21:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emay i ask a mod to move this topic to \u0022Support and Bugs\u0022 pls? thanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esadly anything other than wheels i land on a planet (even kerbin) they get stuck in the surface and sometimes even falling through it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T22:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the same issue with the ground vibrating like this, on both stock and modded installs at highest settings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
