Heres the thing: you can build early game bullet (costs 2k$) with: thermometer\u002Bantenna\u002Bprobe\u002B2solid fuel boost engines\u002Bseparator. By going directly up, you reach a speed of 2800m/s at 50km altitude, also you can time warp to do it faster. It takes about 15-20 seconds to complete this mission from launch! Including measuring temperature and sending a report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you complete this contract, it\u0027s possible to \u0022respawn\u0022 this mission again (endlessly). To do that you need 1) go to contract center 2) map 3) contract center again. (no need any time warping)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have science boosting from money enabled, you can earn 70 science per launch. Or somewhere 5000 science points in an hour.
