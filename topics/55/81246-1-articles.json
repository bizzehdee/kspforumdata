I\u0027m not sure if even add-ons can pull it off, at least with the shuttle design.

Drive spaceplane under launch clamps and lower into bay and hook it onto a docking port in the cargo bay. send in a kerbal to connect a few struts, refuel and go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could actualy just skip IR and do it only with KAS. Have the payload ship be a line of girders between launchclamps with a winch hanging from the middle with the true payload attached and just lower it into the cargo bay till the magnets dock it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akinesis","CreatedById":71042,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T19:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s what I do.
