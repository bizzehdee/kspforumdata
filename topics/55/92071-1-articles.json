Early in the technology tree, your production methods are not the best, so maybe you only get 80-85% purity (so less then the expected ISP out of the fuel). Maybe you spend Tech points to try and research improvements in a particular fuel type so you slowly approach 100% purity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engine designs when initially unlocked are only 85% efficient.

The community surrounding KSP, despite there being no official multiplayer component, is a big part of the game for a lot of people. I feel like this idea would perhaps detract from the shareability of many craft, which I think could end up being a rather bad thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-06T09:26:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2014 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
