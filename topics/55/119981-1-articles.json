In a gist, it is a extremely complex voxel-based sandbox in which you build submarines, planes, ships, spaceships, etc. When I started playing in the creative mode, there was one feature that I had never seen before- in the inventory screen where it allowed you to choose what block to place, about 3/4 of them are grayed out. The only blocks/parts that I had access to were the ones that I needed to make the most basic ship. Then, when I wanted to play with more advanced blocks/parts, all I had to do was click the \u0022more\u0022 button on the top of the inventory GUI and several parts were appear out of the greyness. Clicking it again made even more parts appear(If at any time I felt like that was too complex, I could hit the \u0022less\u0022 button to grey out the more advanced blocks that had appeared when I pressed the \u0022more\u0022 button).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, Adding a mechanic such as this into the game would really help new players not get discouraged by the wall of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T18:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6this is what Science Mode is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-02T19:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, when I first got KSP I went immediately into Sandbox mode and encountered the problem you described.
