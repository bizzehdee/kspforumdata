You can just collect a bunch of science from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the surface biomes should be dropped, since realistically by the time a civilization starts space travel, they should be past the time when a surface sample or temperature measurement at the surface of their own planet could yield any useful info.

I will grab a few points off the launch pad and atomosphere to get me into the next research node, and will use up any unused science devices when I return but I never actively go after more than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my research points come initially off the biomes on Minmus (it\u0027s farther but lower dV to land so I find it easier) and then the Mun. So basically I\u0027m perfectly happy with the biomes the way they are at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with JiWint that the low/high altitude bands would be better off going. Maybe simply have an \u0027in atmosphere\u0027 and \u0027in vaccuum\u0027 selection instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think once career mode has developed further it will hopefully be more balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T00:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally like all the Kerbin biomes.
