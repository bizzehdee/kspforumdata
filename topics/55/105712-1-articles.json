Two reasons, one subjective, one objective:\n\nSubjectively, it\u0027s a little too chunky for me. Mouse pointers shouldn\u0027t be too intrusive, IMO.\n\nObjectively, the current in-game mouse cursor does not honour \u0022ease of access\u0022 options in Windows OS, such as colour inversion. I assume allowing a native OS option would do so."},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:54:54Z","Content":"I\u0027d just be glad if we got resize cursors on the edges of windows where you can drag to make them larger.\n\nIt took me the *longest* time to discover you could make the contracts window larger by dragging the bottom (if in flight/map) or top (in VAB) edge of that window, simply because the cursor doesn\u0027t change there and I\u0027m so used to that piece of feedback I didn\u0027t think to *try* to do the drag anyway."}]}
