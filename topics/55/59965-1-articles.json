In the VAB we should be able to see which resource parts will automatically feed the part you are hovering over, then maybe also show which parts can perform resource transfer to/from any other resource part you hover over. In larger crafts i find it is a nasty surprise when you have to manually transfer just to keep your engines running during a critical burn. Knowing before hand would have allowed me to place the right fuel lines to connect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
