There have been mods in the past to help manage gamesaves, but I don\u0027t know if they work in the current release or not. I use the alt-f5 and the alt-f9 to save and load exclusively. This along with the alt-f4, which shuts the game down immediately, can be used to avoid future problems. Also consider changing the autosave settings in the settings.cfg file to give yourself more time to alt-f4 in the event of a mistake. Regardless, you now know that bad things can happen.

It basically enables you to restore ANY previous autosave or quicksave (and you can restore autosaves (persistent) as quicksaves). It also tracks the full history of your craft, so you can revert a craft to any of its previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt uses the git version control system (something many coders use) so you do need to install that for it to work.
