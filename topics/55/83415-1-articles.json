(Aside from Laythe, make it volcanic like Io, and give it a new name. Perhaps \u0022Replance\u0022 Due to the Laplace resonance and the fact that it replaces Laythe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Rebalance rocket parts for full/64% scale, in size and mass-ratios. Also Engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: One larger scale of rocket parts. (would be 5 meter diameter if there\u0027s no re-scaling of tank sizes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Maybe rescale Kerbals if you rescale command modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiving the mod to the community with no extra bulk-purchasing deals would increase purchases by a little bit as some parents won\u0027t let their kids play anything but educational games. Now, granted most of KSP\u0027s community aren\u0027t kids, they still make up at least 4% of it (uneducated estimate, don\u0027t take that number seriously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make regex happy, for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022But daaaad!
