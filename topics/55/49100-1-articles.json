Like any system being prototyped, however, while there are solid basic concepts behind the system, in execution certain particulars prove not to be as effective as they seem on paper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience as a function over time vs. as an instant action\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn its current form, science is accumulated by performing experiments with a particular tool in a particular set of condition: as mentioned before, this is a solid basic concept. What becomes problematic, however, is the particulars of the methodology used - first that, in this case, experiments are performed as specific and instant actions and, secondly, that in order to maximize one\u0027s scientific accumulation, one must repeat experiments over and over until the diminishing returns completily prevents any scientific accumulation. This creates, in effect, a system where the best way to perform experiments is simply to spam them, either by attaching several experiment systems to a single craft, activate them all in the desired zone and then return to Kerbin, or to perform said experiment, transmit the data, and repeat such until all of the particular experiment\u0027s science has been accumulated. In essence, experiments and science are farmed, not conducted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than as an instant one-off action, a better method of conducting experiments would be to require players to initiate them in a given condition and then maintain said condition over time while recording the results until all viable information has been gleamed from the experiment. Much in the current way that antennas transmit data, experiments are conducted and updated over specific intervals which vary between science systems (and could thus invite the development of system varients with specific characteristics in mind, like conducting research more slowly but also being more energy-efficient or being quicker but also larger and heavier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, suppose you can gain a total of 30 science from using the goo canister in flight in Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere: you activate the canister while in flight and the experiment begins, and as long as you remain within Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere with the canister activated the experiment will continue, and every 6 seconds or so you gain one science point. Staying within the specific conditions for a full 3 minutes will net you the full 30 points in the report at the end; leave said conditions, or the canister loses power prematurely, and the experiment will end early and give you so many science points based on how long you maintained experiment conditions. You can then do another round of that experiment after delivering the resulting and the research will pick up where it left off until you finally get the full 30 points from that experiment type, after which you\u0027re told doing the experiment is pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shifts the natre of research from merely gathering science to actually performing experiments, as players will have to make a conscious effort to keep the experiment as viable as possible. While in some situations this can seem rather trivial, such as orbital research, other types are much more finicky and thus require more player attention and care, such as specific biome flyover surveys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003ECondition-dependent vs. resource-dependent experiments, or transmitting vs. delivering\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf debate within the current science framework is the merits of hand-delivering the results of experiments back to Kerbin versus just transmitting the data - more specifically, that delivery becomes obsolete once solar cells and other free-energy generators become available for use. Indeed, in the current system of diminishing returns in which experiments are conducted it\u0027s far more useful to transmit, since one need not worry then about ensuring that the research system has a way of being recovered. Therefore, one needs to find a balance in which these two methods can operate, the best means of which would be to look at the nature of each experiment, specifically in whether they are centered around reporting results under specific conditions or if they are centered around studying specific resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain types of conditions are difficult, if not impossible, to replicate in a lab: specific gravities with specific temperatures with specific atmospheric compositions and conditions, just to name a few. It thus becomes necessary to conduct experiments based on those conditions remotely in those genuine conditions and to report the findings from such remote locations - indeed, it would be impossible to do anthing but, as the specimins used as the catalyst of the experiment loses whatever effect the conditions had upon them. In those condition-dependent experiments, then, transmitting is just as viable a means of conveying the results, and in some situations is the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E way - one cannot feasably hope to send a probe with sensors into the depths of space and then have it return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other experiments, however, the subject in question is inert and remains relatively unaffected wherever it\u0027s studied, be it at the very site of its procurement or in a modern laboratory on a completily different planet. In these conditions, the scientific knowledge to be gleamed from such is limited only by the sheer variety of tests that can be conducted upon the sample, and an interplanetary apacecraft cannot hope to have anywhere near the capability to perform such tests owing to weight and space and other factors. One can perform a few tests on site and send the relevent information back to command, and said test data will gleam a little information on the resource\u0027s nature, but ultimetily the resource can only be fully understood by returning it to Kerbin and its capable researchers and facilities: here, transmitting the data only provides a sliver of the resource\u0027s full scientific data, while returning it to Kerbin would unlock it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach method of recovering data thus has its own realm of usefulness: transmission in the case of pure data regarding experiments that cannot be replicated on Kerbin, direct recovery in cases where the subject is inert, such as soil samples.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
