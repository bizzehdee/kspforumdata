Similar in function to the FASA escape towers\n\nBased on my examination of the stock and the FASA escape towers:\n\n - The stock LES is essentially a solid fuel rocket booster, which is fired by staging\n\n - The FASA LES combines the solid fuel rocket booster with a built-in decoupler; the booster has to be fired manually by Action Groups, while the decoupler is fired by staging\n\nIf I understand you correctly, Sampa, you want a LES with a booster and a decoupler in the same part, but ***both*** activated by staging at ***different*** times, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T22:21:50Z","Content":"pretty much, right!

I always include the LES and has saved many Kerbals on various occasions. I wonder how you\u0027re using it; the LES has more than enough power to pull a Mk1-2 clear from its rocket and get it at a sufficient height.\n\nJettisoning it is usually part of ditching the first stage; again, no problem here. I have a suspision that those who claim it\u0027s entirely useless don\u0027t use it the right way:\n\n- In emergency, fire the LES through the abort command group (by default bound to the backspace key but I\u0027m not going to assume you\u0027ve kept it like that)\n- Obviously, you don\u0027t want to fire *just* the LES in an abort event. It makes sense to fire the decoupler under the capsule as well; don\u0027t expect the LES to pull a 500 ton rocket into the atmosphere to parachute-deployment height! I also throw in \u0022turn off all engines\u0022 for good measure although events that warrant an abort usually mean you\u0027ve lost control over your rocket in the first place.\n\nOf course it\u0027s perfectly possible to design some kind of integrated capsule/space craft design that cannot be carried by the humble LES. But ask yourself: would *you* step in such a vehicle for launch? Especially with the Kerbal design mindset? I design my manned spacecraft specifically for being able to survive launch mishaps. Yes, that can be a considerable design limitation.
