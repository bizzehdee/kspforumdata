This would only be used in one place, the science building when viewing the tech tree. The costs shown would be multiplied by that amount and when the button was pressed the value subtracted would be the same. So for example if you changed the value to 2.5 then the most expensive items in the tech tree would now cost 1375 instead of 550. This wouldn\u0027t affect items already unlocked, it would just be a few lines of logic added to the tech buy button and the display label.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einsty","CreatedById":64874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T01:06:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd the same thing for budgets, later on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
