That way i can pick anything from small to large, and just fill it up with whatever fuel percentages i want. I can shove a jumbo-64 full of xenon (not that id do that as its crazy), or make the super tiny xenon tank LF storage. Its let us use whatever tanks look the best, and then fill them with whatever resource happens to be the most beneficial to us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot something i expect in 1.0, but perhaps 1.1 or some future update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, until then, ill just do what ive started doing fairly recently, if i want to use a round-8 for xenon storage under .90, i just edit the .craft and assign the tank to use a equivalent mass of xenon as there was LFO in it. Same with LF, if i only want LF, and no oxy, ill just edit the tank\u0027s properties (this is cfg independent, can be saved on each individual craft) to be all LF. I dont consider this a cheat or exploit as im keeping equivalent fuel mass in it, im just making that fuel be the specific type i want it to be, instead of a predetermined option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei personally never used the tank, and the 1.0 change to xenon may make it actually useful for my style, but i still think a lfo version should be availeable as many many players use it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T00:11:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey does anyone know the actual volume of the round 8 and the volume of the PB-X150 Tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPB-X150 - is 0.092m^3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if i got this right the Round 8 should be - 1.406m^3\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T00:22:56Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 12:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Jebidiah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T00:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see why it can\u0027t be used for both.
