Yes I read \u0022What not to suggest\u0022 and saw multiplayer there, but both linked multiplayer mods had everyone off doing their own thing with little in terms of interacting with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I humbly put forth my suggestion of KSP co-op mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell this would obviously be a bit tough at the beginning of the game what with a single capsule to ride in. However I think if the max amount of co-op players was limited to three players, the other two could spectate with little to wait for due to the short flights most player experience early on within the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next problem would then be the delicate design process. Certainly three people can\u0027t build a rocket together, so I suggest each player builds his own design, and selects a ready button when finished. After all players are finished building and all three crafts are saved, the players are shown all three rockets and decide which to fly. (Which shouldn\u0027t be a problem early game unless you\u0027re Scott Manly and build something designed to go to Minmus while the other crafts are tiny 5 part rockets.) If the players can\u0027t decide, maybe a random pick button could be added?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly the problem of choosing who flies the ship is pretty simple in my opinion. While all three Kerbals sit in chairs with their own controls, it should be possible to switch primary control around during flight with a simple UI. However the process of picking the pilot before launch could be decided from methods such as; A vote, flight test results(would probably require making tests), or a simple random pick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this addition to KSP would be fun for those wishing to explore the solar system as a group and hope my suggestion is considered seriously.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaserTheGamer","CreatedById":65375,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T12:44:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like your idea, i hope squad takes in your suggestion.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T13:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be awesome to control a Kerbal on the ground and watch your friend landing down couple of hundreds of metres away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-31T15:28:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an interesting thought, but personally I feel this seems more like competitive multiplayer rather than co-operative, with the \u0022victor\u0022 forcing the other players to watch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, it could still be a fun way to experience the game with other players, especially if some are more inexperienced.
