Of course, this would require the ability to land on liquid planetary surfaces, so could parts allowing amphibious rovers or aquatic landing gear for aircraft potentially be added?"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T11:48:37Z","Content":"... in whenever ... if whenever ... if whatever ... if no if ... etc. ,\u0027\u0027)"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T12:23:15Z","Content":"Laythe is already the most interesting place in the game, so adding two more biome types - underwater and on the sea bed - and a few parts for sea planes and for fillable ballast tanks would be very cool to have."},{"CreatedByName":"Meep777","CreatedById":149664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T17:44:15Z","Content":"Very good point.
