I\u0027m betting the dev team has thought of it, but I\u0027m going to suggest it just in case/to remind them. I can\u0027t imagine it would take a whole lot to implement, which may be why we don\u0027t have it yet. The littlest things always seem to fall by the wayside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who have no clue what I\u0027m talking about, it\u0027s folders for craft storage and an interface for creating and organizing them. I now have 4 different saves, just because my crafts were getting too out of hand and I needed to separate mod crafts from general stock crafts from stock replicas from my mission controller mod powered space race crafts. Seems a little ridiculous that I have to exit to the menu and wait for the game to reload the space center and VAB just to get to a slightly differently oriented set of builds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T09:27:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, kinda like the sub assembly mod does.
