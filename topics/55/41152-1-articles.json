Everything you did gets rolled back, deleted like it never happened and you get another go at it. Why is this a problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis game will play with a budget when it\u0027s finished. This means you have to buy every part of the ship you build. Now of course many would say reverting flights is good precisely because it saves you from losing large amounts of money at a single mistake. I see it the other way around. It will take the challenge and fun out of the game, since you can just undo any mistake you made and lose nothing but the playtime you put into flying the mission. If you think about it, with this mechanic losing anything at all will be entirely optional. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew member died? Revert and go again. Tried to dock and crashed into the space station? Revert and not only will you have a new go at it, but the station will also be reverted to an unharmed state. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only reason to take the hit is if the lost gametime would be too much. For example, a long term Jool mission fails, but you already started two other flights since you launched it and all would have to be reverted because you screwed up that Jool aerobrake. That doesn\u0027t sound fun so you just write that Jool probe off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you revert you can just salvage the ship instead of flying the mission again. You won\u0027t lose a dime. Unless a long mission has been going on forever and you would wreck half your space program by reverting it, reverting is an absolute \u0022get out of jail free card\u0022 that you can play over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much more awesome would it be if you had to send a rescue ship to that space station to get the survivors home safely, then send up a repair crew to fix and salvage what they can?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that reverting should only be an option in the first few minutes of the flight, so you could test new designs and see if they can be launched in one piece. But after the first 5-6 minutes, reverting would not be possible anymore.
