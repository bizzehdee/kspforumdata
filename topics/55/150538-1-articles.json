Why in the world are basic fins 25kerbucks and the next fin up, which still has NO control surfaces, is like 500 kerbucks?!?! And why are all the control surface wings insanely expensive!?

Why is the mk2 lander can so much heaver than 2 mark 1 lander cans? 2 mk 1 lander cans would weigh like 1.3 tons, whereas the mark 2, which holds 2 kerbals as well, weighs 2.66 tons!

The other two big pods are meant to be command pods, though, and they\u0027re not exactly efficient--the Mk2 can weighs more than 3 Mk1 pods but only seats 2 kerbals, and has a lower crash tolerance. The Mk1-2 weighs nearly as much as 5 Mk1s, but in terms of crew, torque, monoprop, and electric charge it\u0027s the same as 3 basic pods; it does have a much higher crash tolerance, but you\u0027re unlikely to crash at between 15 and 45 m/s so this rarely matters (maybe in a very rapid disassembly seconds after launch, but most people just revert when that happens anyway).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe price of those pods is also crazy-unbalanced; Mk1 is 600 kredits per kerbal, Mk1-2 is 1267, and Mk2 is 1625.
