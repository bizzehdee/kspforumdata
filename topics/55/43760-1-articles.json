I wanted to add fairings but to my great dismay I couldn\u0027t, the truss was too darn big. So, my suggestion is this, a small truss, which, when right clicked on, has the option to be extended. This way, it is small in the atmosphere, which is useful, and Large in space; also useful. I feel that currently it should be only cosmetic, and serve no real purpose than the one I stated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T03:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently stock KSP does not permit animated parts to move other parts that are placed on them, I\u0027d love to see that option but it doesn\u0027t really place highly on my list of stock wants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod wise, Damned Robotics and the fork, Infernal Robotics by Magic Smoke Industries do permit this, and MSI has a linear actuator available, though by the sound of it this doesn\u0027t quite fit your desires in form.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CapnMorgan18","CreatedById":75721,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T20:42:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, this can be implemented similar to the communotron 16 animation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
