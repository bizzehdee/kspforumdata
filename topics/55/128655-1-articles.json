I fixed the clipping issue by translating the part outward a bit, now there\u0027s a visible gap between parts, but at least it doesn\u0027t break the rocket anymore. Finally, I Landed a small probe on EVE with the intention of collecting science, except when I opened the service bay, all of the equipment was missing; when I pressed F3, it looks like everything just randomly exploded during launch and I didn\u0027t even notice it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m never using the stock service bays again until they\u0027re fixed.
