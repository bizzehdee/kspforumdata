When you do this, your ship will appear somewhere in the space, and other players and ship can interact with you. There are some limitations to help KSP\u0027s physics to do it: you cann\u0027t stop warp near then 10km of some-one\u0027s ship, asteroid, or deny-warp zone of a planet and so you can\u0027t appear in the middle of someones ship or asteroid or planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to implement this in your current branch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the first of all: make multiplayer without warp on network code similar to Factorio\u0027s network code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen add warp-denied zones and disappearing ships, then do sync when warp-ends into the multiverse users space and recreate object, synced to others. The new warp-end user\u0027s time should be the same as the other players time is. Planets, during the warp should not move like, there is no warp for them, because of other players travelling points and they places.

Oh NVM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not have multiplery alow people to help with both their planes and the other guys vessel. Then you unwarp on the first vessel needed and do what is needed. Then start up warp till the next item auto stops warning you need to work on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would create a game as KSP should have already worked for single player. If you get an item that needs attention you can\u0027t warp and have to do it. It creates a working que. anything in a non warp area or slow warp area or crosses a trigger point or some sort can\u0027t allow normal warp. The mutliplayer then simply adds a person to work on a second craft at the same time if multiple craft pop up in que together or help give a second hand to a single craft. Then you have a NASA/realworld que system where you work on each project as they hit their important points. And with multiplayer help doing so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means KSP just needs stuff to show when and where a craft needs help over warping a little better so stuff doesn\u0027t auto die. and then the ability to put a craft in a setup where it\u0027s marked as not caring. Although that system may need timers added to it or something so you can temp ignore it. Like 1 year or 1month timers until it triggers stuff again on top of an infinite ignore where you just let it go or die etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I think the game just needs a que system that simply utilizes the existing game to make single player more completely and make multiplayer doable. I think that would simply take some logic added to the existing path logic showing where it is going. some invisible or visible things showing when it may need attention. Even the ability for the player to custom make them. It could be added with the add waypoint option when you click on it. You would simply add different markers like in a video/audio editor program to say what it should do. And maybe the ability to design default ones or have a few default ones in the game if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make multiplayer singleplayer with multiple people. And simply let them work on mutliple craft at the same time if needed. But only one warp system. Then everyone is always on the same time. obviously you would need a chat system to coordinate or they would want some other form like mic system. Which could be fun if you did an ingame mic and chat system and added things to the relay system related to it. Although obviously this could be bypassed with out of game stuff. But it\u0027s a player choice then like other in game options. this is assuming though or only viable while in kerbal control possibly though. So maybe for IVA control specifically then work out other modes as you are changing perspective in game..... I think the obviously solution is maintain in game limitation and let free change of base perspective Kerbal/ship/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E/Satelite/etc. and the coms are always from that perspective as it should be as you change. so if you want free comms you have to back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E as your perspective or maintain a ship with proper coms etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in summary, I think you can absolutely do time warp as the game holds it currently and multiplayer. Just not multiplayer warping separately. One single player with multiple people in it like now. Then multiplayer is pure cooperative gameplay which is good for KSP. But it would also have the ability to change ships or control mutliple ships when not in warp simultaneously. Then let the coms and other in game systems be the limiters where and when needed as fits the game design/reasonability/necessity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAKA, again, the game just needs a mission que using the current in game system to trigger it. And the ability for players to add/control the que system by, at minimum, mouse and the pathing system via adding a few new simple options and timed triggers etc. the game is completely compatible with mutliplayer if you look at it from those perspectives. Just needs some light coding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s ironically one of those things real space agencies have to deal with but is not represented in KSP. And it solves all the problems with multiplayer potentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe cool think about timers is that it is already repsresented physically. Meaning you can also give it the function of point and click. AKA you click where you want the trigger on the existing pathing and select it as one of the new option. Timer here! When you reach there the timer goes off and warp stops and something tells you what is in need of work. You change to craft etc. Ohhhh, look! The game has these most features like it was meant to be done this way!!! \u0026gt;\u0026lt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could even have a mission control rank that can be shifted around to different people that gets to control the warp along with multiple ranks with adjustable abilities(like an MMORPG) including potentially warp control. then let people save the game and pause to come back later if desired. It could be an option to have pausable games or continuous games as a challenge level. Then, again, Multiplayer is a big multiplayer mission control simulator with more control features to deal with multiple mission but is literally the same a singleplayer. If done that way you could even in essence go back and forth between single and multiplayer as it\u0027s just a matter of other people being in your game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-21T22:37:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2017 10:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T22:07:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222929791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485029921\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome problems are inherent and can\u0027t be fixed, no matter how devoted the programmer.

Player 1 quickly plots a modestly fast intercept, burns, and cranks up the warp. Player 2 more carefully plots a faster intercept, burns, but warps less aggressively. In game time terms, Player 2\u0027s intercept happens sooner, but Player 1 arrives sooner in real time due to more aggressive timewarping, then claws\u00A0and moves the asteroid. Under DMP\u0027s timewarp scheme, the asteroid will not be there when Player 2\u00A0gets there, because Player 1\u00A0has already interacted with it and Player 2\u00A0will need to sync up with that subspace. So, even though Player 2\u00A0plotted the better intercept and would have gotten there faster in game time terms, Player 1\u00A0wins the race through more aggressive timewarping which allowed him to get there faster in real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t have to be an explicit race, either. Imagine this scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer 1 and Player 2 are playing with spaceplanes supported by an orbiting fuel depot. Player 1 quickly ascends to orbit and decides to do a Mun flyby (using timewarp), and when returning to Kerbin docks with the depot and drains the fuel from it. Player 2 plays around sightseeing in the atmosphere before ascending to orbit, taking more real time but less game time than Player 1\u0027s flyby and docking. He then attempts to dock to the propellant depot. Is fuel available for Player 2 there? Should there\u00A0be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese sorts of issues are inherent to asynchronous warp, there\u0027s not a technical solution for it. Synchronous warp means waiting, most of the time. So we\u0027re back to my statement: Sync issues or waiting, pick one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T22:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think my que system idea fixes that(coorperative design with the ability to be uncooperative like). You just unwarp on who is first as you hit areas needed to make changes. Make it simply single player with mutliple people. then add some logic to unwarp on certain things and let players designate unwarp points as added options to the current mouse system on the pathing system. You can physically add waypoint but it is an unwarp waypoint. There could also be some logical ways for it to auto do this without adding waypoints manually. It makes multiplayer a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E mission control cooperative thing. You can still do non cooperative things with the system though. But whoever gets to destination unwarps first and does stuff then sets warp back on etc. The race would be latticed naturally as it progresses. Could add some drama to it actually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would allow control of seperate craft while unwarped so people can do more than one thing at once. Should cover most of what is needed for multiplayer. And anything else can be added most likely simply to the existing game fucntions like add \u0022stopwarpwaypoint\u0022 on the trajectory and whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhen both people are done it warps if they are both going. Or you give one guy control for cooperative. Those are both simple things to add and can be done via a sytem like in MMORPGs where you have ranks. You only need two things. The system for one person(mission control leader) and an option for multiple people to need to check in to continue. both of which may need to be working simultaneously for complex missions so people can go afk for long periods of time and mark their mission as done for the time being. Pause would be needed if one person is away and the other person doesnt\u0027 ake over their mission stuff. and of course they should both be able to work on the same craft at the same time if desired so it\u0027s true cooperative play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCooperative play design should make the whole multiplayer work out nearly effortlessly in concept. Make it so single player can be turned into multiplayer also. Make them the same thing but the only difference is do you have marked for more than one person. And let people change that if they want to go to multiplayer from single or vice versa. the only problem I can see is making sure you can block off single player completely if desired so no openings in network security occur in single player or something odd like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf needed let the mission control guy give temp warp control to a player or change over the the vehicle or kerbal on the mission and control the warp together to finish a long ground mission or something. Multiple options would help there. Then wether they are working together, if everyone else is done with their mission stuff and checked as done at the time the other guys can warp as needed to finish and others can come help if they want to to enjoy the mission per say. with the mission warp stops in place it will auto unwarp and warn another mission needs attention and someone can go do it. No issues. And you get a more real world que system to do multiple and complex missions. You cuold also add more waypoints for takeoff times and stuff too so you can catch your ride back etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could also have a screen somehwhere like the one to pick a vehicle to change to but it shows the time listing of when the next warp stop will occur so you know what mission is next and see the ETA\u0027s to those mission needs etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recommend being able to change how many people can join in the game and not before. Then a single game can go from single to multi and back and all multiplayer options changeable in game for maximum flexability. When you open it to multiplayer it can go up on a KSP game finder(or other things of your choice) There could be hosted server space if desired or player hosted only. Hopefully not an issue as it should nto take up more processing power in multiplayer than single as one person could/should only process what they are doing in full. Could be wrong on that though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-21T23:10:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2017 11:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-21T22:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222929931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221485038399\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002212858\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n35 minutes ago, Red Iron Crown said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll recycle a couple of example scenarios from the last time I was discussing this topic:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh yes those would be problematic situations.

Having one warp there would be zero differences in how you play the game from having separate warp besides it working. you have to warp regardless. the only thing you need to do is maintain proper controls over who/how warps are controlled(this already exist in every MMORPG in existance let alone other software.) and kick people if they become annoying and won\u0027t let warp go. Or go play together and enjoy finishing the mission. There is no end to how you can set that up. It will be exactly the same as multiwarp in practice. the control layout like in MMORPGs can be made to allow any desired playstyle easily. Including being 99% like the multiwarp concept. And it wouldn\u0027t even take that many options to basically let it do everything. You would already want that kind of versatility anyway regardless of mission type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, it is already a missing part of the current game. Mission ques!!

Cooperative base game system with the ability to give permissions!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless there is some problem with people being in different ships simultaneously there should be no issue. The warp is the easiest part to manage. The game already has the infrastructure for it. Just need some minor conveniences like a visible warp/mission que and a new type of waypoint or two(Maybe some auto features for stopping warp and ignore flags with optional timers) minimum for making the game tell you when stuff needs to be done and stopping warps. Anything else is just extra nice features. Which would be nice obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as warp control giving a NASA headquarters style mission control structure is a beginning point. One guy has lead and can give out roles/permissions. But a simple full layout of options/permitions also is needed for other playstyles(likely looser ones). This can be done with the normal guild permission system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be fun to be able too switch around different vehicles/kerbals and help each other on missions. You could get alot more done that way. One guys can get his lander going to refuel and whatnot and the other guys could be driving the rover/aircraft to destinations. When the base work in done the free warp to speed it up. Or wait for everyone else to be done to do missions while warping a little. that or generally make vehicles that go fast to destination.

Likely it would end up with the helicopter/airplane people being made to leave or\u00A0change over to flying rockets\u00A0so the\u00A0others can get on with their flights. Or maybe the other way around, but more likely the former, considering it\u0027s called Kerbal Space Program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour multiplayer idea has here worked well at avoiding paradoxes. It has however herded players towards doing activities that require or at least allow significant amounts of warp. It\u0027s cooperative, but not necessarily by choice. \u003Cem\u003EIn my opinion\u003C/em\u003E, this means it has not worked great overall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit DMP\u0027s system is not fantastic. There are paradoxes that can occur as mentioned before. However, it allows players to do whatever they want, whenever they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: Sure it\u0027s a \u0022NASA simulator.\u0022 That hasn\u0027t stopped people from making helicopters, propeller planes, boats, submarines,\u00A0blenders, fighter jets, cars, cannons... the list goes on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I guess we just have different ideas of how things should work if it becomes an official thing.
