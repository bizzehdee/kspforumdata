That doesn\u0027t change the situation. What we have is a great game running on a limited engine upon which the developers can only do so much with. So until that engine is more refined as Squad just said we must find a way to work around the memory limit. Win64 would be nice, but it \u003Cem\u003Eshouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be needed. But as the stock KSP memory footprint grows with each update ( im sure 1.0 will give us the largest inflation yet ) the more and more people are going to be clamoring for their sixty four bits. This is where Squad comes in. The solution to that and 90% of the people who load their game up with mods lies in their hands. And its not Win64. Its this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I think the answer here is, rather than try to fix something they do not control (Unity) Squad should fix something they do control, the loading system.\u003Cp\u003E Right now, KSP loads every single texture, sound, etc in GameData during startup--regardless of when, or even whether it will ever be used by the game. That is the real source of the problem. If, instead, KSP switched to loading only those assets actually used in any given scene--during the Loading screen, it\u0027s not like this would somehow add loading screens, we already have them--then the memory problem would go a large way towards being solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Load on Demand--back when it worked, before KSP updates broke it--was a demonstration of this, and it worked wonderfully well. If modders can do it, I\u0027m sure Squad can too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just, we, as fans, need to convince them that it\u0027s something we need. They\u0027ve already said they\u0027ll focus on features relevant to all builds, and here\u0027s one of them. Let\u0027s persuade them to focus on this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is from Squads recent article on the subject. NathanKell hit the nail right on the head. That last sentence, \u0022Let\u0027s persuade them to focus on this\u0022 inspired me to make this thread and get that ball rolling. Because in my opinion that is hands down the best solution we could all hope for and it\u0027d be good for Squad in the long run. They can take their time and chip away at the x64 version with Unity until its ready and at the same time get most of the community off their backs about the memory limit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm one of the people that has to mod my game to the point of being unrecognizable from the stock version. So I am one of those people on Squads back , lol. Don\u0027t get me wrong. Ive spent countless hours performing my own optimization to cram as much as I can into GameData with that 3gb limit. You\u0027d be surprised how much you can fit with a fair amount of work and subtlety. However if Squad were to work on such a thing I dare say I may not have to do that anymore. To an extent. Even with such a feature people will no doubt find ways to go over even \u003Cem\u003Ethose\u003C/em\u003E limits. RSS/RVE with a lot of big textures may still be exclusive to Linux, but as far as everything else goes you\u0027d be hard pressed to hit the limits of a load on demand system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd theres more. Pair that solution with OpenGL and that right there is all you\u0027d need. The game im playing right now only runs in openGL. Ive got it modded to my upmost intent and its a stable beast. But no AA and a large performance hit is the trade off. Ive yet to try Directx11. Ive heard too many mixed comments. I would love for that to work instead of openGL. Dx11 would give you your performance \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E your memory savings. So instead of hoping for better x64 support from Unity. Would it not be better to hope for Dx11 support?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does everyone think? Is it time for Squad to begin this process? Is this the ultimate solution until x64 is straightened out? And what else can a player or.... Squad do to save memory? I say its time. 1.0 is five months out easy. Good. The longer the better. So now is the time to have these discussions. There is no way the game can release with an even larger vanilla memory footprint and not receive a significant amount of optimization. And in my opinion a load on demand system needs to be implemented by atleast the version after 1.0. Because once the masses start flooding the add-on release forum... its.. oh god...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T19:46:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-06T21:25:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.

If dissatisfaction occurs frequently or with enough severity, it will become public knowledge that will impact sales.

This is not in fact wholly correct. 32-bit Windows can\u0027t get at the full 4GB of RAM. Just as in the ancient days of MSDOS, you need address space for such as the video RAM. Using 64-bit Windows can make a big difference in the memory available, giving both the OS and the program enough memory space without paging to virtual memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: One program I use can use up to 10GB of disk cache for data such as textures, which in that case would need to be downloaded over the internet. Most games have the texture data on a CD or DVD, but they\u0027re still slower than the hard drive. Something like load-on-demand that supports a disk cache which can be placed on any disk would open up the options, from slow hard drive via SSD to RAMdisk. And a cache system might be made more efficient than files on a disk. Again, experience elsewhere (and there is already a Mod which downsizes textures) suggests the cache might hold several versions of a texture, and only load the higher-res form of a planet if it is selected as a target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: A good starting default, which can be tuned by such people as heavy-Mod-users to suite what is on their PC, is tempting.

No one should be using a 32 bit computer by now, when 64-bit computers are ubiquitous. Obviously, don\u0027t just stop having a 32-bit version, but if we can get huge amounts of extra memory from 64-bit, so we could have awesome new parts or features and even new planets, then this is progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if loading textures as required can also do this with no major downsides, do that.
