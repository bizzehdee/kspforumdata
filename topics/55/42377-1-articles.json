Then, as incentive to do this aside from bragging rights, give the artist a portion of each shirt\u0027s sale. Something like ten percent, maybe? Might not amount to much for some shirts, but it\u0027s better than nothin\u0027 and would really motivate the non-3D artists out there to get some KSP artwork goin\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VerdammteSeele","CreatedById":77390,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T06:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehaha yes yes yes!
