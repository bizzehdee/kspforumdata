While i personally am not one to give a crap about 100% realism, i feel itd look better splitting into 2-4 whole pieces and not alot of small junk.\n\u003E Now id very much love to be able to configure how many petals there are when they split, as almost all of my designs use 3 or 6 way symmetry, and id very much like to have the fairings split into 3 or 6 parts as well. Not that im gonna complain if i dont get that option, but itd be nice to keep them with the trend of my sci-fi designs.\n\nWhy? Why do people keep assuming this? AFAIK since day one HarvisteR has said that the fairings split off where you choose."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T11:39:04Z","Content":"Alot better option would be for them to add more procedural parts.

Why do people keep assuming this? AFAIK since day one HarvisteR has said that the fairings split off where you choose.\n\nMy read on the situation is that we know we can set the number of longitudinal segments a fairing splits into, but we don\u0027t necessarily know how much control we will have over the number of lattitudinal segments. Obviously we should be able to control both.\n\nFrom the info and images we have, it seems like the fairings split along each point placed on the curve. So every place where the fairing surface changes angle comes apart. This might simply be the easiest way to do it based on how fairings are programmed right now. It needn\u0027t be that way though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-19T13:56:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/19/2015 01:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GusTurbo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T14:00:22Z","Content":"Well, Squad isn\u0027t answering back as of day two.."},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T14:20:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alot better option would be for them to add more procedural parts.

But Squad has decided to push 1.0 out the door in what some of us think is a rather short timeframe, with possibly insufficient feedback on some of their choices. So when we see something announced that looks like it should be improved, we need to speak fast and loud and hope we get heeded in time."}]}
