This way there would be no way for parts to be much hotter than bay walls at outer space temperature (unlike it seems to be now - appearing like when you close the bay it also becomes stuffed with magical mineral wool).\n\nUpdate: it seems to be worst during physics warp - I can confirm that warp of 4x causes payload temperature skyrocket during burn if bay is closed (and if warp is disabled, temperature actually starts dropping). Something weird is going on here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T10:48:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 10:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidingTheFlow**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:00:40Z","Content":"Warp x4 is causing lots of weird things like additional aero forces or part connections are stronger during warp, but if you would try same flight path without warp your craft would be destroyed just by hitting air."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T11:01:26Z","Content":"Afaict this is a simplification, necessary because parts don\u0027t radiate heat to each other. If radiation in bays was enabled the parts would radiate as if they were out in space even when the bay was closed. It is certainly true that parts inside could be much hotter than the bay walls IRL, vacuum is an extremely effective insulator so the only mechanisms for transfer of heat to the walls are conduction and radiation.

Whut? How can a part in the cargo bay get hotter than the bay itself, with no internal sources of heat?\n\nParts in a cargo bay should both conduct and radiate heat to the cargo bay walls, and thence into space. A bay is either an insulator or it\u0027s not, at the moment cargo bays operate like magical heat pumps.

The point of a cargo bay is, after all, to protect the cargo... not roast it.\n\nI have already had more than one payload explode because I forgot to open the bay doors, and the probe core sucked all the heat from the main engines. This is IMO a bug, and one that need fixing ASAP.\n\nAdmittedly, I tend to physics warp during the coast to apo on ascent, so it may well be related to warp.
