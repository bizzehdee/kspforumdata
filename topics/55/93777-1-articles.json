This is for 3 reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) Realistic fuels aren\u0027t all the same density, and aren\u0027t required in equal or nearly-equal proportions (like stock LF/O). \u003Cstrong\u003EThis means that you can adjust the Center of Mass of a spacecraft or (especially useful) spaceplane by changing the relative distribution of fuels.\u003C/strong\u003E Craft too tail-heavy? Move the Liquid Oxygen up to the nose and the Liquid Hydrogen down towards the tail (LOX is 16 times denser than Liquid Hydrogen). Mass-distribution EXTREMELY important for aerodynamic stability with an aerodynamic system realistic enough that a full fuel tank falls faster than an empty fuel tank (and as the devs have already confirmed, the stock aerodynamics system *will* be getting an overhaul). Of course, to really take advantage of this, you need fuel tanks that hold just one fuel component of a bipropellant mix (like LH2/LOX, Kerosene/LOX, any hypergolic-pair, or yes even LF/O), either through tweakable tank configurations (so you can say this tank up here just holds LOX, and this identical tank down here just holds Liquid Hydrogen...) or dedicated parts. I suggest the tweakable fuel tank configurations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) \u003Cstrong\u003ESome realistic fuels are capable of higher Specific Impulse (ISP) than the stock LF/O mix.\u003C/strong\u003E Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) plus Liquid Oxygen (LOX), in particular (which can reach ISP values of 480 of greater with the right engine in vacuum). Sure, LH2/LOX is less dense than Kerosene/LOX, hypergolics, or the current LF/O- but you can always add BIGGER fuel tanks (especially if they\u0027re much lighter due to the reduced fuel density), and bigger rockets just look cooler anyways. Bigger rockets also have better ballistic coefficients (an aerodynamic feature measuring relative drag- that will necessarily show up in even the most basic aerodynamics overhaul- it\u0027s 100% of the reason a bowling ball falls faster than a feather in real life, but its absence is why that doesn\u0027t hold true in KSP...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) \u003Cstrong\u003ERealistic fuels open up more interesting/intuitive In Situ Resource Utilization possibilities.\u003C/strong\u003E Not only will it be more IMMERSIVE if you are mining ice from an asteroid to refuel your LH2/LOX fuel tanks than if you are harvesting some generic, imaginary resource- realistic fuels also open up types of ISRU that would be INCONCEIVABLE or INEFFICIENT with the stock LF/O system. In particular, any ISRU system that produces Oxidizer but not fuel in real life is EXTREMELY INEFFICIENT in stock, because LF/O burn in a nearly 1:1 mass ratio- whereas in *any* real fuel mixture, the Oxidizer component (LOX or N2O4 being the most common, and the only ones worth representing in KSP) is the MUCH more massive of the two (at an extreme, with LH2/LOX, Oxygen comprises roughly 8/9\u0027ths of the total fuel mass)- meaning it becomes worthwhile to set up an ISRU system that can only harvest one. If you can set up a system that skims Oxygen off the upper edge of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, for instance (via a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propulsive_fluid_accumulator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPropulsive Fluid Accumulator\u003C/a\u003E system), or electrolyzes it from Munar regolith (most Lunar regolith is comprised of Aluminum Oxides in real life...), it won\u0027t really be worthwhile unless you have a realistic mass burn-ration between your fuel and oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also worth mentioning, though not strictly a part of having realistic fuels (although DEFINITELY part of a propulsion overhaul) that having a more realistic relationship between rocket TWR/ISP and atmospheric pressure (such that \u003Cstrong\u003EThrust\u003C/strong\u003E increases with decreasing atmospheric pressure, and \u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Flow\u003C/strong\u003E remains fixed, like in real life) actually makes efficient ascents to orbit easier, since you can build a craft with low TWR in the thickest part of the atmosphere, and have its TWR increase much more quickly as you ascend and get to the point where a higher TWR is ideal due to decreasing drag from the atmosphere (technically, a TWR of 2 would always be ideal over an infinitely-long ascent, but with any kind of a realistic climb-rate your TWR has to go higher and higher to keep up with terminal velocity as you ascend into thinner atmosphere...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is to discuss these concepts, NOT to suggest an overhaul of the current fuel-system to something more realistic (which I believe has been suggested many times before, even though I didn\u0027t immediately spot it on the \u0022Already Suggested\u0022 list...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E The topic of boil-off of realistic fuels, which actually makes the game a *little* harder (it\u0027s not that hard to assume the fuel tanks are all insulated- their mass rations are already terrible even for insulated fuel tanks, and a simple active-cooling part could eliminate boil-off entirely at the cost of ElectricCharge), is also a slightly separate topic- as it\u0027s entirely possible to imagine a set of 3 realistic fuels in KSP (LH2/LOX, Kero/LOX, and one hypergolic pair) without the inclusion of boil-off. Of course doing so would eliminate the main advantage of hypergolics- that they experience ZERO boil-off at most normal operating temperatures...

As Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer are generalized terms, we don\u0027t know WHAT kind of liquid fuel is being used and what sort of oxidizer either, but a more realistic ratio is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like airplanes to have their fuel flow from the top of the plane to the bottom rather than the front to the back, but that should be another discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, I\u0027ve started using the RCS Build Aid mod to see my Full CoM, Dry CoM, and Average CoM so I can better determine where to place wings and how to angle engines to create shuttles and spaceplanes. Having more control over these points by moving the heavier fuels forward or backward inside their tanks (or with two tanks attached, splitting the ratios up so one tank ends up heavier) would help with flight balance over the entire mission. I would guess that the ability to move two separate fuels around inside the entire vessel would be difficult, as would splitting the fuels unevenly across multiple tanks, so the best option then is your separate fuel tanks idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficulty with separate fuel tanks that I see is in teaching players how to place the two types of tanks in the proper ratios, because you DO need to make sure you have the right amount of both so that you don\u0027t run out of one while still having some of the other. A stock version of something like Kerbal Engineer windows in the VAB and SPH would help by highlighting which fuel you are short on. The tanks would, or should, be designed in pairs so that if you use one of the LF tanks, you place one of the corresponding O tanks. If the tanks larger versions are also designed to hold exactly double (or some other simple ratio) the amount, you could place one larger tank(LF or O) and two of the smaller tanks(O or LF) in other locations to keep balance and fuel ratios.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I like your ideas... provided the implementation remains as simple as possible in order to be fun while still being close to rocket science.

What they do is add additional options for players who want to play around with alternatives to the default, so as to squeeze higher performance out of their rockets- thus making the game easier for curious players who take the time to learn about the advantages of the more complex alternatives (uneven fuel distribution being used to improve arodynamic stability).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo play devil\u0027s advocate on my own comments, I would say I don\u0027t mind the idea of a more realistic fuel component/mass ratio, even if switching were not added. We can assume KSP liquid fuel is RP-1 kerosene since thats the only fuel I know which burns nicely in both turbofan and rocket engines. Since there is no boiloff (not that this is any sound basis), I think another safe assumption is that stock oxidizer is N2O4. That, however, complicates the resource mining side you talked about considerably. What kinds of readily available sources of those are there? (I ask because none come to mind.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock ISP values are currently centered around Kero/LOX, but as has been repeatedly pointed out, the current values might be OP\u0027d with a more realistic aerodynamics system (which would mean only 3.5 km/s to LKO).

As Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer are generalized terms, we don\u0027t know WHAT kind of liquid fuel is being used and what sort of oxidizer either, but a more realistic ratio is a good idea.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like airplanes to have their fuel flow from the top of the plane to the bottom rather than the front to the back, but that should be another discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands, I\u0027ve started using the RCS Build Aid mod to see my Full CoM, Dry CoM, and Average CoM so I can better determine where to place wings and how to angle engines to create shuttles and spaceplanes. Having more control over these points by moving the heavier fuels forward or backward inside their tanks (or with two tanks attached, splitting the ratios up so one tank ends up heavier) would help with flight balance over the entire mission. I would guess that the ability to move two separate fuels around inside the entire vessel would be difficult, as would splitting the fuels unevenly across multiple tanks, so the best option then is your separate fuel tanks idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad you see the value in being able to divide the duel mass unevenly. Note that I think the SIMPLEST and BEST option is to simply have the existing fuel tanks be tweakable as to whether they hold ONLY Liquidfuel (which should be re-named to MMH, UDMH, or Aerosize for the default fuel mixture), ONLY Oxidizer (N2O4 for the default- which should be hypergolics for their simplicity and lower ISP), or any arbitrary ratio of the two (assume the fuel tank is actually just an aero-shell with mutliple smaller tanks inside). Basically, something equivalent to the Modular Fuel Tanks mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers would start off with both fuels present in the burn-ratio as the default (like in current stock KSP), and be able to change it with right-click tweaking in the VAB/SPH...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Baythan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Baythan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe difficulty with separate fuel tanks that I see is in teaching players how to place the two types of tanks in the proper ratios, because you DO need to make sure you have the right amount of both so that you don\u0027t run out of one while still having some of the other. A stock version of something like Kerbal Engineer windows in the VAB and SPH would help by highlighting which fuel you are short on. The tanks would, or should, be designed in pairs so that if you use one of the LF tanks, you place one of the corresponding O tanks. If the tanks larger versions are also designed to hold exactly double (or some other simple ratio) the amount, you could place one larger tank(LF or O) and two of the smaller tanks(O or LF) in other locations to keep balance and fuel ratios.\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I like your ideas... provided the implementation remains as simple as possible in order to be fun while still being close to rocket science.

Real aircraft engines may be a large chunk of the weight of the whole plane, but they extend throughout its whole body (in small aircraft) or are at least pretty long. In KSP the engines are just little exhaust nozzles you attach to the back of your plane which drag the center of mass way back and make it difficult to put the wings far enough back to actually fly the plane. You have to start loading up the nose with multiple tons of weight just to make the plane stable, whereas in real life planes with that much weight on the nose would fall flat, and probably couldn\u0027t carry the weight even if it were distributed evenly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T20:38:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould someone please start writing bullet point summaries of all points?
