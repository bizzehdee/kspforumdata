I actually didnt need thrust on some locomotives but rather electricity and I didnt like the idea of coating something in them ugly spikey radioactive things or solar panels\n\nso I went into the config files to edit.. most jet and or rocket engines have a line that says\n\nAlternator\n\nthe figure around that is the amount of power they they generate while running.. its suprisingly weak I found I think something like .5 or 500w as I understand it\n\nI changed that and over the course of much experimentation built myself viable diesel electric generators out of sam hall\u0027s micro turbine parts.. painted black and inverted they look just like an exhaust pipe on my 44 class\n\nyou can alter the thrust in the configuration file so they dont produce any but instead dedicate everythng to electricity.. adjust the thermal limit so overstressing them will lead to explosions and all them fun things\n\nits the simplest thing to do.. make a backup of any engine your fiddling with or make a copy and just rename it at the top of the configuration file and fiddle with the info bit.. then you\u0027ll have 2 of them\n\nive ventured deep into this electrcity generation stuff.. I no longer use batteries for any reason other than to keep headlights lit while stationary..\n\nKSP has a very interesting electricity resource simulation.. as lights will dim.. wheels will go slower etc if your low on charge..\n\nas a bit of inspiration.. ive been able to build a crude yet effective diesel electric system this way, the rovers wheels are mostly stock but modded to require 12 units of power vs 0.5 originally each.. the alternators on the jet turbines output 150 units of power.. and a typical locomotive has 10 wheels currently with the train being unpowered..\n\nwith the rover wheels modded to be 1.2 ton each.. and requiring so much power.. I increased the torque.. and use my joystick throttle as rover wheel control.. simply jamming it all the way forward or back\n\nthe rover wheels wont do anything without power.. so once I start up the engines.. any throttle control relates to the power generation.. slow RPM makes the train creep away slowly. high RPM and she\u0027ll have full power\n\nit is a bit odd though.. sometimes she wont have power to the front wheels randomly causing drift in one direction.. even under full throttle warcry..\n\nit shows the underpowered tag in the dialog box..\n\nat this point I simply ignite the secondary engine giving the loco around 300 units of power.. she tracks straight. lights burn bright etc\n\nbut please be aware that there also seems to be some kind of amp simulation thats crude.. but there somehow.. \n\ndespite having so much power at the ready.. ive had lights dim and go dark on steep hills.. despite having both generators screaming\n\nas if somehow they do use more power if climbing a hill.. its a very interesting thing..\n\nbut certainly nothing to wait for 1.0 for.. try to make your own by modding stock things.. it wont be long until your happily modding things for your own needs which leads to bigger things\n\nI wish you luck ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT - I did make this for another thread but since im too busy to make a dedicate video.. this shows what I mean I hope\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZaCVzJeV0s?start=60\u0026feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nStart at 0:50 or so\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-25T09:25:47Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2015 09:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overland**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaver","CreatedById":46640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T09:43:53Z","Content":"I would like to see some sort of generators, seriously.\n\nbecause the night on the mun is 3 days long.
