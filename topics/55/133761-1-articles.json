1.1:\u00A0 you know how when you are reviewing science results, and you have a science lab present, some of the results will have the yellow \u0022research\u0022 button present and others won\u0027t?\u00A0 The button-there-or-not causes the vertical size of the dialog to bounce up and down, so a user who\u0027s just automatically click-click-clicking through the list could end up accidentally \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Etransmitting\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a hard-won science result \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E(AAAAAAARRRGHHH!)\u003C/span\u003E because the \u0022transmit\u0022 button jumped under his mouse due to a dialog resize.\u00A0 I seem to recall reading somewhere that Squad\u0027s fixing that, so that the dialog will stay the same size regardless of whether you can research the result or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a great improvement, glad to see that they\u0027re doing it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022
