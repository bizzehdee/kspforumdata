It uses a super heat resistant fabric that does not break down on the exterior like its cousins, but its max core temp is less then that can be held with the standard ablating heat shield. It can take on more heat, but must spend less time in it,\u00A0\u00A0Therefore, looking through the lens of the game and how things are implemented, it makes sense that as long as the inflatable heat shield is not destroyed, it is reusable for reentry and not useless. The only reason it is currently useless for reentry is because it can\u0027t be deflated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd actually since it does have favorable conditions going high speed high altitude, it fits the bill for advanced, large\u00A0interplanetary SSTO\u0027s (and Multiple stage ones too) when coming in from Jool or Eloo\u00A0so they can save DV by aerobreaking at Kerbin rather then having to slow down with your engines\u00A0or do an Eve gravity assist first which takes a long time and is difficult to do without KAC or Mechjebs porkchop plots. The only reason they cant\u00A0be used now in this way its because they can\u0027t be deflated once you reach low altitude and will turn your plane into a rock, and good luck trying to jettison it while flying into it also.
