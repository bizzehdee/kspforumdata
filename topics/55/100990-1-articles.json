(In other words, please don\u0027t simply suggest a complete overhaul.) Consider ideas on what (in existing contracts) you think is too rewarding or too unrewarding. Also, strategy and contract balance are intimately linked. What about the strategy system is good? And what could do with some adjusting?\n\n*Reminder:*\n\n*I will reiterate again, this thread is about brainstorming. Attacking people or blatantly shooting down ideas will not be tolerated and those posts will be removed with reckless abandon. Please keep it civil and on topic, but not too far out of the solar system. I also recommend keeping posts specific and succinct, so that your point doesn\u0027t get lost in a great wall of text.*\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T03:25:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 03:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T04:44:02Z","Content":"Well, the elephant in the room is Outsourced R\u0026D.\n\nI\u0027d much rather see that increase science returns as a *percentage* rather than increasing them based on funds returned, as the two scales aren\u0027t really compatible.\n\nAs it stands right now, a 25% commitment in my 10% science save results in 1 science coming from 33.889 funds. That\u0027s like 7,377 science for a million-funds contract (and those aren\u0027t too hard come by), which would finish the whole tree in a contract and a half. Or like 553 science for a flag planting on Minmus.\n\nIf instead it was a percentage boost to science - for instance, 25% commitment gives 20% extra science or somesuch, it wouldn\u0027t matter how many funds I brought in (millions, billions, who cares?), as the 20% extra science would only apply to science returns. Thus if a Minmus landing gives me 30-ish science, with a 20% bonus that would be 30\\*1.2 = 36 science, vs the crazy flag-planting example of 553-ish science.\n\n(Also contracts shouldn\u0027t have any significant science returns at all.

I think the \u0022contracts\u0022 should help drive science.\n\nAnyway, here are ideas I posted in other threads about contracts:\n\nGenerally, I\u0027d like to see the contract system change into a two-tier system. The \u0022Explore\u0022 and other \u0022pure science\u0022 contracts would be considered \u0022missions/programs\u0022 that your space center dreams up vs \u0022contracts,\u0022 which are launching satellites, testing parts for subcontractors, etc. All ideas below assume that **Mission** is created by your employees, and **Contract** is a 3d party.\n\nRight now, you get those \u0022milestone\u0022 contracts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 launch a rocket, achieve an altitude of X, etc. Many new players likely don\u0027t realize that if your first launch is overly successful, you miss out on the various altitude records contracts, etc. \n\nSo how about the game has those early missions replaced with \u0022Missions\u0022 akin to the \u0022Explore the Mun/Minmus/Duna/etc\u0022 contracts (many would have small science rewards).:\n\n**\u0022Achieve Spaceflight!\u0022**\n\nThis would be like the \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract, but the end goal would be leaving Kerbin atmosphere.\n\nInternal milestones might be:\n\n1. Launch a rocket (same as contract now)\n\n2. Reach 5000m (same as now)\n\n3-5(?) Same altitude records already in game, but they are sub-requirements, so if you do 2 or more in one mission, you get credit.\n\n6. (whatever 2d to last number is) Take a crew report, or science from space.\n\n7. Achieve orbit\n\nNext would be:\n\n**\u0022Suborbital Science\u0022**\n\n(note that these contracts need not be taken, this set is really a cash farm for noobs, IMO. If they really screw up, they can do some of these to get back on their feet)\n\nMilestones here would be various science from points in the atmosphere, and perhaps sensible parts testing (use a parachute, etc.)\n\nExamples (add more!)\n\n1. Take crew reports from various altitudes.\n\n2. Safely land craft in various kerbin biomes (not too many, but water, plains, etc).\n\n3. Stage a rocket\n\n4. ?\n\nNext:\n\n**\u0022Orbital Spaceflight\u0022**\n\nThe mission requirements here would be to put spacecraft in different orbits, some defined as satellite contracts are now, perhaps. Other missions might include rendezvous. The goal is teaching new players, so the milestones should have this in mind. I\u0027d like the clamp-o-tron-jr to be available early for this. Perhaps very low-thrust attitude control jets very early, and only the mono in the pod? The might include, for example:\n\n1. Place spacecraft in an inclined orbit.\n\n2. Create a highly elliptical orbit.\n\n3. Take science/crew reports from a couple distances.\n\n4. Do an EVA.\n\n5. Do an EVA where you let go of the craft.\n\n6. (assuming a docking port and attitude control) Successfully dock. (This could be a single rocket with 2 docking ports)\n\n7. Successfully use a maneuver node to do X. (assuming a contract can check for this---it would look for the node as \u0022green/complete\u0022)\n\n8. Rendezvous and dock two craft launched at least XX minutes apart. (Forcing a real rendezvous as a teaching aid)\n\nThese mostly use existing mechanisms to flesh out the early game experience for new players, as well as providing guidance as to what needs to be learned.\n\n**New rescue missions ideas:**\n\n**1. Stranded kerbal in Kerbin orbit.** Like current contract, but there is a nearby spacecraft if he is EVA. He may be in the ship that cannot reenter/return to Kerbin. The craft can be a ship, or even a station. All would have reasonable time limits, guys don\u0027t float around for years un-rescued. Longer limit if he is aboard a ship. Orbits far more varied than the current missions (polar, retrograde, eccentric, etc).\n\na. Kerbal EVA has no EVA propellant, but is close by his fully functional spacecraft. Rescue him (move your hatch til you can hit F with him), then return him to his own craft.\n\nb. Kerbal has EVA propellant (0-10% at random), but has drifted too far to return. Rescue him and return to his functional craft.\n\n**2. Stranded kerbal in orbit around another world.** Same as 1, above, but around another world. If he has a functional craft there, then return him to it. Orbits far more varied than the current missions (polar, retrograde, eccentric, etc).\n\na. Kerbal EVA has no EVA propellant, but is close by his fully functional spacecraft. Rescue him (move your hatch til you can hit F with him), then return him to his own craft.\n\nb. Kerbal has EVA propellant (0-10% at random), but has drifted too far to return. Rescue him and return to his functional craft.\n\n**3. Stranded spacecraft in Kerbin orbit.** The spacecraft is without enough fuel to return (a), or has had a serious malfunction (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png). Orbits far more varied than the current missions (polar, retrograde, eccentric, etc).\n\na. Spacecraft is without necessary fuel to complete mission. The ship has a clampotron, and you refuel it to complete mission (amount of fuel required is in the mission request).\n\nb. Spacecraft as suffered a serious mishap. Engine doesn\u0027t work, no attitude control, etc. Dock, and return craft to a station in LKO if it exists (within EVA distance). If not, put it in a reentry trajectory, and reenter with the capsule.\n\n**4. Stranded spacecraft in orbit around another world.** The spacecraft is without enough fuel to return (a), or has had a serious malfunction (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png). (if they add life support, then that is another missing item that would be ( c) ) Orbits far more varied than the current missions (polar, retrograde, eccentric, etc).\n\na. Spacecraft is without necessary fuel to complete mission. The ship has a clampotron, and you refuel it to complete mission (this data would be in the mission request). Refuel is not to full, but enough to return set by mission (amount specified in contract).\n\nb. Spacecraft as suffered a serious mishap. Engine doesn\u0027t work, no attitude control, etc. Dock, and return craft to a station in LKO if it exists (within EVA distance). If not, put it in a reentry trajectory, and reenter with the capsule.\n\nc. Spacecraft needs life support delivered due to a mishap (or bad planning). Dock and resupply (amount specified in contract).\n\n**5. Stranded lander.** The lander is without enough fuel to return to orbit (a), or has had a serious malfunction (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png). Mishaps would include cool wreck sites (like the opening screen, lol)\n\na. Lander is without necessary fuel to reach orbit. IN this case it will be a lander with a CM in orbit. Return crew (or craft if you can) to the CM.\n\nb. Lander as suffered a serious mishap. Engine doesn\u0027t work, no attitude control, etc. Return crew (or craft if you are capable) to the CM.\n\nRewards would scale to difficulty. They would include science rewards, as the player might be rescuing science collected by the competing astronauts.\n\n**Satellite and station/base contract variants:**\n\n**1. Place satellite/stations/bases.** Satellite contracts are COMMERCIAL. As soon as the orbit is fulfilled, you lose ownership of it. The same is true for bases built by contract (offer some as missions/programs from within KSC that you would own).\n\n**2. Add to station/base.** A 3d party station or base (that YOU already delivered as per #1 above) wants another component added (docked). Ideally for planetary bases, we\u0027d have a way to merely place them within some range, not have to \u0022dock\u0022 everything.\n\n**3. Resupply or man station/base.** Player is contracted to deliver or return a 3d party kerbal or kerbals to a station or base (commercial crew ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ). Player might be required to deliver fuel/mono to station, or merely \u0022dock\u0022 with a craft that includes a hitchhiker or something (a supply pod).\n\n**4. Repair satellite/station/base.** A 3d party satellite, station or base (as per #1) has sustained damage and requires an engineer of level X to repair it. An appropriate, repairable part s broken in the craft you launched for that level engineer to fix on EVA.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T17:30:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T18:04:02Z","Content":"First of all, I think some contracts should come from The Space Program itself. Specifically, all explore contracts or contracts that would directly benefit the space program. Maybe The Space Program\u0027s ingame name would be that of the save file\u0027s title, and thus instead of saves being labeled \u0022Player Name\u0022, they should be labeled \u0022Space Program Name.\u0022\n\n*I use the word overhaul, but I\u0027m only talking about a specific contract type, not the whole system.*\n\nStation and Base Building is a tricky thing. It seems to suggest that you should be building many stations and bases throughout the system, even 5 in LKO. This isn\u0027t what station contracts should be. Station contracts need an overhaul.\n\nHere\u0027s how the process should go:\n\n\u0022Build a new Station Core around Planet X\u0022 This would be simple. Just have a satellite that can support at least one Kerbal and have Y amount of docking ports, and have power and an antenna. This would be a basic core for further expansion. This type of contract would only be given by The Space Program (or the World First Society, as long as it\u0027s not a company). Your station core is now ready for expansion.\n\n\u0022Attach X module to Y station\u0022 This would be more complex. This contract could be a corporation, such as Rockomax wanting you to put up a fuel module, or the Space Program wanting to put up a habitation module, or either the Space Program or Zaltronic Electronics might want a large solar array for the station that generates Z power. These modules wouldn\u0027t have to have their own power (unless they are solar arrays or generators) or antenna, all they would need is to dock to Station Y, and be able to be docked to.\n\n\u0022Send crew to a space station.\u0022 The Space Program wants you to bring crew to a space station if it\u0027s not already full. Of course, you could decline it if you think that even if it does have more seats, it\u0027s \u0022full\u0022 in a maximum-crew sense.\n\n*What about Bases?*\n\nBases are very similar. Almost exactly the same. The difference is that you don\u0027t have to dock modules, you just have to land them within 1 kilometer of another part of the base. Bases would also have contracts for modules that can mine fuel. This would open up a whole bunch of contracts about replenishing station fuel. If you have empty or nearly-empty fuel tanks in orbit, a company might want you to fix that. Rockomax, Jeb\u0027s Junkyard, [Roverdude\u0027s Mining Company], or The Space Program would have you refuel the station, maybe with a specific modifier to specify if it comes from a base, another station, or if it can be anywhere (launched from Kerbin)."},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T18:09:12Z","Content":"Tater, go join the dev team, now.

Useless. In 1.0, we will have our first useful science, presumably, scanning for resources. That mechanism needs to be really worked on, and made into tiers of science that depend on completing other science tasks, not just for resources, but simply for science!\n\nIf we had something like that, the contract nature of science in career would be moot.\n\nFirst and foremost science should be USEFUL.\n\nMake the map view as vague as it should be for given worlds based upon telescope observation from Kerbin. The only way to be able to zoom in on map view would be tied to gaining orbital science (mapping). Want to unlock habitat parts? Have some total manned orbital science collected as a requirement (a totally new paradigm for science to tech would be required there).\n\nScience from surface collection in various regions? You need to map them, first, to put the geology in context. Make the planetary science *interconnected*, not just land, click, \u0022Science!\u0022 Make things that egenrate data on the spot be 100% transmittable, and stuff like surface samples 0% transmittable (a later part can be a sampler for a probe that generates some amount of science for broadcast).\n\nIn a perfect world, the kerbol system would have some random elements. Even if it is minor, like the exact mass, atmospheric height and density, etc being all that varies.

Having a single piece of junk nearby doesn\u0027t cut it, IMO. It\u0027s exactly the same mission (except on a planet, which is good), but with a prop. Hopefully it is coded so that any craft file can be used for the rescued craft.\n\nOne, such missions need a sensible way to apply them. If the player has not gone to Duna, and there is no competing program that we can pace ourselves with, I don\u0027t want to see a Duna rescue mission appear months before I am ready for Duna. Even if I was ready, I don\u0027t see a lone kerbal surviving alone in that cupola for the length of time it will take for my rescue mission to arrive. A stranded verbal on Duna should have at least a reasonable habitat, with power, etc. Otherwise they look as goofy as testing a jet engine on the mun.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T19:55:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T20:01:08Z","Content":"**Strategies:**\n\nIf the current style of conversion remains (converting from one currency to another), I would like to see one change in function and a good smacking around of the numbers\n\n**Change in function:**\n\nMake the conversion factor constant **or** decreasing with increasing commitment. The current system you increase your commitment and so get more output **and** the conversion increases in efficiency. This is somewhat backwards IMO.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\nThe numbers I used for Sane Strategies are 400 funds : 5 reputation : 1 science. On top of that, there is 20% of the conversion that is lost (so converting 1k funds would give: 1000 \\* 5/400 \\* 0.8 = 10 rep). 5% commitment on a 100k contract gives you just under 50 rep (before it gets screwed over by the exponential decay that is).\n\nFor decaying returns I set the 100% commitment factor to be 70% of the base factor. This gives a nice curve that continues to increase output while still creating a notable loss of efficiency.\n\n\u003E ![dtHZTQA.png](http://i.imgur.com/dtHZTQA.png)\n\nAll numbers and equations used to generate the conversion factors for Sane Strategies can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jVr5wCV_KWnYok4Av5rnfx3YP4Wo5GLmMhUZ1YmqLa8/edit#gid=1661336833).\n\n* * *\nIf we don\u0027t have to stick to the same conversion style, I much prefer the alternate strategies I made which trade on collection efficiency. Instead of converting \u0027x\u0027 science or rep to funds, you lose x% of the science/rep you collected and gain y% on your funds income. This means that if you don\u0027t collect any science, you still don\u0027t get any science (which strategies and contracts broke well and truly...).\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**Contracts**\n\n- Testing while landed on Kerbin should be scrapped entirely. It\u0027s free currency, and thats all it is. Lets just assume that the various companies can manage this themselves.\n- Testing while splashed down on Kerbin is only very slightly harder, would like to see it scrapped for reasons stated above\n- Testing parts should require having them running for a short period where applicable\n\n\\* No testing an engine with no fuel source, no antenna testing without Ec, etc. (outright declares jet engine in an un-oxygenated situation contracts to be a bug)\n\n\\* Makes next point a bit less ezmode with engines and the like\n\n\\* Allows Engines to be tested with fuel tanks (which currently have no tests). Eg. run x engine with y fuel tank in z flight conditions (obviously needs some thought as to how the fuel flow from multiple tanks is dealt with. Maybe just a volume of fuel needs to be used instead of a specific tank part)\n- Tests should complete when the part is running or activated in any way. Having to screw around with staging and/or right click is awkward. I should be able to use action groups, right click activation, staging, or any other activation method (engines also need a minimum output thrust to prevent throttle limiting to zero and the like)\n- Rescue contracts should require the player achieving atleast one step past the rescue location (eg. to get the kerbin orbit ones, you should have atleast entered an SOI other than Kerbins)\n- Kerbin atmosphere part test rewards need to be atleast somewhat rewarding. Being spammed with contracts that give you less than 1000 funds total is just a waste of time (even if the vehicle is small and single stage, the recovery factor and occasional accident blows any chance of profit)\n- Rewards for contracts involving parts should have an exponentially decaying or logarithmic scaling with part value. This would allow the more expensive parts to not give absolutely insane rewards for tests in Kerbin orbit while still getting enough for cheaper parts to make sense (eg. reward \u002B= k1 \\* part value \u002B k2 \\* log(part value); NOTE: k1 should be lower for tests close to kerbin where recovery is more likely, and maybe higher for parts with a low impact tolerance)\n- Solar orbits could do with a lot more specific zoning based on deviation from Kerbin\u0027s orbit rather than just using the two science areas for multipliers (as far as I can tell anyway).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-01T22:42:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2015 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"}]}
