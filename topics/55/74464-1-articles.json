Its been a long time since I posted something here. I have a suggestion. Since some people have Windows 8 and 8.1, KSP should add a touchscreen mode so they wont need keyboard and mouse to play. If this suggestion is bunk, close it! I dont care if you close it! Happy playing! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T11:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWindows 8 is not required to use a touchscreen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an option though, I can\u0027t see a touchscreen-friendly UI being too bad. I\u0027ve already played KSP via a streaming app on a tablet. Add a few on-screen button widgets (which the streaming app allowed me to do), and flying vehicles is very possible. It\u0027s probably better to work on other parts of the game first though.
