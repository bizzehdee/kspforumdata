An asparagus staged design with 6x symmetry and one \u0022large\u0022 xenon gas container above each engine takes about 10 hours to burn through.

At four times the thrust, that\u0027s a substantial improvement already-- but the more recent versions of the game also seem to work reliably at 4x physics warp for me-- meaning your \u0022real world\u0022 burn times with ion engines are 1/16th as long as they used to be. The thrust is probably unrealistically high for the ions, but it\u0027s a good compromise to make the engines \u0022playable\u0022 for exactly the reasons you outline. Using them before 23.5 was a ticket to dullsville.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part count thing remains an issue, though.
