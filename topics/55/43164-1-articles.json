I love this idea, especially because It adds the element of care to where you fly/release stagings. I think it would be a really good idea if you could select the cities from the tracking station view and zoom in on them, so you could see the little Kerbals living there. There wouldn\u0027t be much if at all in the way of city interaction (you\u0027re a space program, not a government), but I do know something that should be there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA newspaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you selected a city from the tracking station, you would be able to open a window which would show you the front page of the week\u0027s newspaper.
