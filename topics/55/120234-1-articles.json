I can easily think of these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. A tourist visit. Just the same as regular tourist contract, except the destination is player made one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A player assigned crew to be placed onto station. The requirements are to get them there not later the date X, to keep them not less than Y and no more than Z days and return them back safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An automatically assigned crew (or just one Kerbal). The same as above, but kerbanauts are generated for mission with their stats and experience that can vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A \u0022foreign specialists\u0022. The mix of the above - a tourist Kerbals to be placed onto station or base, provided with MPL, kept there for amount of time and returned back - and there is a science reward for this type of mission even though the passengers themself do not provide Kerbanaut scientists effects. There also can be additional profession (like \u0022foreign specialist\u0022) to distinguish them from tourists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. A resupply mission - launch and dock a craft that has crew capacity (but can be unmanned itself) to the station without any specifications on which part that should be and without requirement to keep it docked afterwards. It is a compromise between having full stock life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be perfect if larger stations (think ISS, not Skylab/Salyut) have these contracts overlapping - i.e. you can bring new crew to replace the one that is ready to return home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T00:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea.
