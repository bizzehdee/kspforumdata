In the building of a language\u0027s vocabulary, commonly the \u003Cem\u003Eproper noun\u003C/em\u003E for the first specific example of a thing the culture encounters *also* ends up being the \u003Cem\u003Egeneric noun\u003C/em\u003E for other examples of the same thing that the culture encounters later. Once we discovered that the other stars were the same type of thing that our own Sun was, we started referring to them as \u0022other suns\u0022, and \u0022sun\u0022 took on a new meaning that it could also generically refer to any star, even though when it was originally coined it only referred to our own sun because we thought that was the only example of such a thing that exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example of a word like this is \u0022Earth\u0022. When someone says they are planting a flower in \u0022earth\u0022, they are using the term to just mean \u0022the ground\u0022 rather than \u0022our planet\u0022. The reason our planet\u0027s proper name is the same word as the word for just any ole sort of ground is because originally we only knew of ONE example of a thing like the ground and that was OUR ground. We didn\u0027t know the other planets in the night sky were the same kind of thing as our own ground beneath our feet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften in a language the word for \u0022our tribe\u0022 and the word for just \u0022the people\u0022 ends up being the same word, for exactly the same reason. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat these examples all share in common is that once upon a time earlier in the language\u0027s history there was zero distinction between \u0022this is the word for our one example of this thing\u0022 and \u0022this is the word for this generic type of thing\u0022. For the distinction to matter there has to exist more than one example of that kind of thing. When your culture was forming a language while it was only aware that one such thing exists yet, the two meanings got conflated together long before people realized there was a need to make them differ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo \u0022Sun\u0022 is a perfectly valid term for Kerbin\u0027s sun because the primary meaning of the word in English is NOT \u0022OUR Sun\u0022. That meaning came about later after we realized there was more than one. The original meaning was just \u0022the one and only big bright thing in the sky\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you translate \u0022the one and only big bright thing in the sky\u0022 from its Kerbalese word, whatever that word is, into English, the word you get is \u0022Sun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Minarkhaios","CreatedById":58867,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T08:40:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cem\u003ESNIP\u003C/em\u003E....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is very interesting and well said, but we can also draw the opposite conclusion with it (kerbol being the first word for \u0022our sun belonging to us kerbals\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut lets take another view and inspect kerbal and kerbin words.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Both are created with the same prefix \u0022kerb\u0022 meaning \u0022us\u0022, \u0022the people\u0022, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In one case we have the \u0022al\u0022 suffix that I personally translate into \u0022all\u0022. Kerbal meaning \u0022all the kerbs\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In the other case we have the \u0027in\u0027 suffix. Kerbin meaning \u0022The stuff that Kerbs are in\u0022. In fact they are on, but they tend to violently and frequently try to be in the ground, so that will do. Or they are some sort of underground living creature, which explains why there is no cities on kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using kerbol instead of sun, we can add a new word with the same construction :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill the same prefix \u0022kerb\u0022. The new \u0022ol\u0022 suffix can be translated into \u0022old\u0022. Which gives the \u0022kerbol\u0022 word the meaning of \u0022The old Kerb\u0022. We can then add a full mythology around it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With kerbol meaning \u0022the old Kerb\u0022 being the name of a god. Which make sense as old cultures tend to make the sun a god of some sort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With kerbol meaning \u0022the old Kerbs\u0022 being a way to describe an afterlife place.
