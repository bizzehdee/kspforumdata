(from 61-99 percent) basically, the texture (or maybe even a different model) would make it look like you just put it in a tumble dryer for an hour, then run over by a pickup truck. Large holes, big enough for a kerbal, MASSIVE gashes in the sides. and possible high amounts of fuel loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow this system would basically be a setting you can turn on, or off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow if this should be implemented, another way to improve it would be, the more damage a part takes. the more likely the part is going to fall off when impacting something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T05:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, parts don\u0027t get damaged.
