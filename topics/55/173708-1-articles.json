They should be optimized for the air from 20km and up (so vacuum and near vacuum). Likewise the \u0022real-ish\u0022 SABRE would be very competetive in a vacuum, and it would make sense - since it will be using turbines and atmospheric air lower in the atmosphere, and\u00A0it\u00A0 would actually deliver most of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E needed to get to orbit in closed cycle mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the rapier would be better situated to fill its gameplay purpose (being a dual mode engine, not just a super-turbo-ramjet, and being an analogue of a real engine concept) if it was given the Isp curve of the Rhino, or perhaps the Skiff. It would thus have relatively good vacuum Isp, but still less than dedicated vacuum engines (terrier, cheetah, poodle, and... ughh.... the OPD wolfhound)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd it would still be a terrible option to use as just a rocket engine, because an aerospike would generate the same thrust at the same or better Isp (or just outright better if the Skiff Isp curve is used), for half the mass and it would include an alternator. The new cheetah engine can also be used as a 1.25m engine, giving better vac Isp and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E while keeping vectoring AND adding an alternator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-10T01:40:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the RAPIER the way it is.
