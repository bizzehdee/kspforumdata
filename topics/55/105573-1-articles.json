But this was because I didn\u0027t do the training scenario\u0027s. As a first time player you just \u0022start career\u0022 and see what happens (with kind of a depressing end result). \n\nI am a strong believer that tutorials should not exist and complex game mechanics should be explained in game so no tutorial is needed. \n\nI do think that version 1.0 in not as noob friendly as it could be. \n\nI should\u0027t have to watch youtube movies to know what I should do in career mode. Am I the only one?\n\nPs: Love the game after doing some research to know how it works.\n\nKind regards,"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T11:58:19Z","Content":"Honestly I think they\u0027d work better implemented in ANY gamemode. Truly, I think that Career mode is not good for new players. The Tech Tree is a good place to start, allowing you to figure out what parts do at your own pace, rather than all at once, so use Science mode instead."},{"CreatedByName":"Master_Evar","CreatedById":98074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:05:24Z","Content":"The problem is that rocket science is just to complex for an in-game explanation. Tutorials show better what a good rocket looks like, fuel-wise etc. Explanation is good for purpose of single items, but it is easier to use a tutorial to see how it should all be balanced. The game COULD have better tutorial-scenarios, that better shows AND explains KSP rocket science.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe in-game tutorial windows do refer to the training scenarios for better learning."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T12:43:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem is that rocket science is just to complex for an in-game explanation.\n\nCompletely, utterly, wholeheartedly disagree.\n\nI\u0027ve been saying since their inclusion that contracts are the perfect method to teach new players the game."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:50:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem is that rocket science is just to complex for an in-game explanation.\n\nI also disagree. However I take a different approach than klgraham1013 on how to address this.\n\nThe real issue, for me, when I think about the Newbie Experience is that the Kerbal Space Center is way too busy to start off with. You load up a new Career - now what? Where do you go first? There are 12 buildings in front of you...\n\nThe core game is about building and successfully launching Rockets. Instead, Career Mode has all these buildings around, most of which are pretty useless to start. It\u0027s confusing to immediately start with Manage Strategies, Hire Crew, Accept Contracts, Tack Satellites, Build Space Planes, in addition to Build Rockets / Launch Rockets\n\nThe very first newbie launch should be along the lines of - here is the VAB, here is the Launch Pad - and that\u0027s it! Build Rocket / Launch Rocket / Don\u0027t Die (or die spectacularly and laugh so hard it\u0027s worth trying again)! The other buildings shouldn\u0027t be in the picture at all until certain milestones are reached whereby they become useful.\n\nMission Control - unlock only after the first successful recovery.\n\nR\u0026D - unlock only after 5 Science has been earned.\n\nSpace Plane and Runway - unlock only after the first \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 node is unlocked.\n\nTracking Station - unlock only after Orbit has been achieved.\n\nAstronaut Complex - unlock only after you buy it.\n\nAdministration - unlock only after you buy it.\n\nRocket Science is Hard! Trying to Manage a Space Program with all these buildings while also learning Rocket Science is really really hard!"},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:20:39Z","Content":"I hadn\u0027t really thought about it, but removing all buildings from the space center scene except for VAB and Launchpad makes a lot of sense for a new career game. Requires a little more thought, but it\u0027s a really good idea.\n\nOn an aside... I understand it\u0027s almost always better to blend tutorial into gameplay but if a game *doesn\u0027t* do that, and you see a clearly marked \u0022Tutorial\u0022 button on the main menu... Why not click it???"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:30:32Z","Content":"There is a problem with locking out the sph at the start, some players mod the techtree so they start the game with planes rather than rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:25:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I understand it\u0027s almost always better to blend tutorial into gameplay but if a game *doesn\u0027t* do that, and you see a clearly marked \u0022Tutorial\u0022 button on the main menu...

Game designers have had to work around this issue by integrating tutorials into the flow of the game.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E snip\n\nI like your ideas! ...but let the people choose: Planes or Rockets?"},{"CreatedByName":"Master_Evar","CreatedById":98074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T19:50:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Completely, utterly, wholeheartedly disagree.\n\u003E I\u0027ve been saying since their inclusion that contracts are the perfect method to teach new players the game.\n\nI was very unclear about what i meant, sorry. I meant that the simple texts we have now are not detailed enough, and need to show better how a rocket generally should be built; you need fuel, a rocket engine in direct connection to the tank, symmetrical layout, aerodynamical layout, what is needed to control the rocket (reaction wheels/aerodynamic control surfaces), and maybe how to reach orbit (Get out of atmosphere and burn sideways until you somehow achieve orbit). If you are new to the game and have no general education about rocketry or astronomy etc. it is sometimes hard to get this. Maybe some simple pics showing easy-to-understand models of rockets that work or does not work.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nLots of \u0022normal\u0022(no astronomy/rocketry education) people thinks it\u0027s enough to get out of the atmosphere to achieve orbit."}]}
