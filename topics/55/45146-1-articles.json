Then the only things you see are the orbital paths and the planet/ship/etc. A bit like when a planet is too far away and you see the round icon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krakerstaker","CreatedById":18345,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T05:20:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is good idea. Just because it would look cool.But your problem with not being able to see your maneuver node is part of a much larger problem regarding the whole maneuver node experience.Things like being able to focus on the node itself, the target body you selected, or the encounter node (so you can actually see your encounter periapse easily), are some things on my wishlist for maneuver nodes.Wire-frame is not going to fix those issues, but I feel that those fixes are coming soon.
