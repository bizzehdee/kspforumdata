I think it would be cool if it had a more functional value. If you started off with very little knowledge about your solar system. By discovering and learning about the system and planets you could unlock functionality in the game. I\u0027ll give you some examples.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now you automatically have almost god like knowledge about the planets and their orbits and spheres of influence. What if you started out with out that knowledge? Right now you can see into the future two or three gravity assist and sling shots ahead. What if as you planed your orbit you could not predict any thing beyond an encounter until you had gravity scan data from high over that planet. What if you could not predict a local orbit, elliptical, till you had low altitude gravity data? So sling shot predictions don\u0027t work till you have high data and capture and elliptical orbit predictions don\u0027t work till you have low data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the engineering plug in a lot. I think it should be stock but what if it was unable to give you predictions on performance for thrust to weight ratio and atmospheric performance loss till you had gravity scans from the ground and pressure readings from the ground on that planet? Atmospheric reading could tell you whether or not your jet engines would function. Some thing I\u0027d wished I\u0027d known before trying to land on Eve. Pressure and temperature readings could allow you to build survivable probes and capsules. Probes that would not be crushed by the pressure on the surface of Eve so that you could get those gravity readings. but you can\u0027t do that till you\u0027ve dropped an atmospheric probe into the air and had it send back data till it was crushed or impacted. It could also give you rate of decent predictions for your parachutes to take some of the guess work out of landing at low or high altitude on Duna but only if you have the science, the data. Like the Path Finder probe made it possible for the Voyager probes to survive the high radiation environment of Jupiter. What if Jool was a probe killer till you had the knowledge to build shielded probes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey must have some really good telescopes to know exactly what these planets looked like. What if it was blank till mapped it. A mapping probe photographing a planet or moon from orbit should be able to make a map for me so that I can see some kind of image if I should land on the dark side or be able to see map of what terrain is coming. So the back side would be a gray map but you could see what terrain is coming up. But only if a probe had mapped it and not just a flyby. That might get you a narrow string of pictures but the rest would be blank. It would reward you for being able to put a probe into a stable low polar orbit around that planet. And equatorial probe would only unlock the area it covers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about a radar altimeters? It\u0027s in the Engineer plug in but what if it was something that had to be earned? How about Topo data? ground scan radar for a probe so you could toggle to a map of the elevation if that map section had been unlocked and transmitted back by a mapping mission? It could also unlock the altitude of impact function on Engineer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if you could do soil samples or soil sample return missions for at least partial credit. Or any thing else to create a function for rovers and landers. There are some fairly cool things that you can do in this game but the \u0022reward\u0022 system seems a little off. I just think there could be some practicality and reward to probe and rover missions so that these are not just empty exercises. I mean right now what do rovers do? When they should be exploring all over. Going and finding rocks and sending back data from all over these planets. Soil samples are one thing but a reward for different geologic formations, now there\u0027s a reason to take the dune buggy to the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I\u0027m at it... Just installed Realchuts but it still doesn\u0027t let me deploy a parachute or drogue at high altitude to use it for any type of aero breaking or aero capture. A deployable Ballute style decelerator, particularly inflatable like a donut cone that you could drop out of the bottom of or a trailing Ballute that you could release would be nice. Skim through the very out side edge of the atmosphere and bleed off speed then chop it and lose the extra drag so that you continue into orbit. You could have radial mount ones too ala 2010. It may have already come up but I haven\u0027t found a pug in for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for all my *****ing this is still the coolest game that I\u0027ve seen for a long time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-22T04:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are some really neat ideas, especially the discovery mechanisms.

I put a lot of work into trying to figure out how to build and land a rover and then it was like... ok, what do I do with it. It was a fun exercise but then it just seemed to be a dead end. Probes were a little better they seemed to have some value in terms of the game but I was surprised that they didn\u0027t play a bigger part. Unmanned probes have been way more valuable then manned missions. Voyager taught us more then the entire Apollo program. Before that we really didn\u0027t know any thing about the outer planets and virtually nothing about their moons. Who would have thought that IO had volcanos or that Titan had an oceans and an atmosphere or that there were ice covers seas of liquid water. Even Mars was a mystery. Our pictures sucked. Canals we thought we could see canals? It wasn\u0027t till the Mariner missions that we had any real pictures and at first it was just a stripe across the surface. It wasn\u0027t till we got a probe into polar orbit that we could actually make a map of mars. Biggest volcano in the solar system. Biggest valley system. And we had no idea till we mapped it with that probe. One of the big things about mariner was it had an altimeter and could look at the height and period of it\u0027s orbit. I really don\u0027t think we had a hard number on the gravity till then. Yes all the orbits were well plotted and you could see the pull of Jupiter on the other planets but Mars was small. Unless you can clock some thing going around it you can\u0027t even guess at the mass of an object. And even then it\u0027s dependent on the altitude of the object and that\u0027s not easy to guess through a telescope. So I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s as trivial as you\u0027re implying. Even the moon is non trivial. Even today it\u0027s actually very hard to plot an orbit around it. The gravity is... lumpy. There are weird mass distributions in the body. You can\u0027t treat it as a point mass. We had no idea that the atmospheres of Venus and Mars were CO2 till we sent a probe and some of the early probes failed because the heat shield had the wrong angle. You need a different half angle for CO2 rather then nitrogen. I mean these were real problems and mysteries till we got out there. The early probes were crucial in understanding the sun, radiation, and our solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure that all of these things should be included in this game.

The lunar mascons make most low lunar orbits unstable in the \u003Cem\u003Elong term\u003C/em\u003E, but knowing where these mascons are is not needed to plot most short term lunar orbits (e.g. the Apollo missions).

What if there was a need for a larger crew. I haven\u0027t downloaded the line of sight mod to play with it. I didn\u0027t see it in the mod store place. I did find the deadly reentry but it seemed to come from some where else. With line of site restrictions you would not be able to talk to a command module in orbit when it was on the back side of the moon. I\u0027m hard pressed to think of a reason that you would absolutely have to... but it\u0027s a reason to have a crew member. What it a larger crew was necessary for certain experiments or to gather certain data. It\u0027s already there in the science module. I did actually use that on a trip to minmus where I went up and down with a lander to all the frozen lakes. I used it to resupply and reset my lander. Then the crew of three came home and reentered in a three man capsule. I think that\u0027s the only time I\u0027ve used the three man capsule. What if landing a lander was a two man job. The light weight lander can required two pilots. That would imply that powered landing would be some how imposable or at least more difficult in a one man pod. I\u0027m thinking an improved display mode set up for landing like the docking mode. Maybe with terrain and slope indicators, better drift indicator\u0027s, main engine control but with RCS thrusters for fine control of lateral drift with out having to tilt the craft like when you wind up chasing the indicator. If the sensitivity of the lander to lateral touch down was increased slightly that might be a big incentive to make use of a specialized lander can or if the terrain had more obstacles. Nice bolder fields might negate the usefulness of normal capsules for landing perticuarly if you had a good internal view with wide enough vision and maybe external cameras to make the lander superior. Think Apollo 11 with Buzz feeding Neal data on approach. And it should be even lighter relative to the capsule with it\u0027s heat shield. What if larger vehicles required larger crews. Part count, staging, mass, I don\u0027t know. Or what if it was based on flight duration. I mean you can\u0027t be awake all the time.

It was a very good model but the errors from Jupiter did show. So there was some idea of the enormous of Jupiter. But small planets don\u0027t show like that.

Which in point of fact I don\u0027t think it did. Remember most of that was from the ground. Could the Apollo capsule have found it\u0027s way home with out guidance data from the ground? And the mercury capsule sure couldn\u0027t do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter. What if the one man pod was not equipped for docking. What if you needed at least a two man Gemini style capsule to dock. Which was the case. And the Clampotron just looks stupid on the small pod. It\u0027s not like you could ever climb through it. The nose is barely big enough for the small parachute. What if you needed Gemini for EVA which was also the case. Even then it was tough getting some one in and out of the capsule even with two people to help. All of a sudden two and three man pods are necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RiggerLee","CreatedById":110780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T01:22:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know you hate it but I\u0027m going to toss out another addendum to the \u0022Where am I going idea\u0022. What if you could enter nodes and flight paths just as you do now but they had a tendency to drift requiring correction burns. The accuracy depending on the knowledge of gravity that you have for that area. As you get more data the accuracy increases till you fill up that particular science bar. So for instance you would need multiple gravity readings at different altitudes of a body before you would have god insight into the future of your orbit. It wouldn\u0027t stop you from flying but it rewards you for doing the research. And it\u0027s fairly accurate in that you may not have a hard number for Dunas gravity till you get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
