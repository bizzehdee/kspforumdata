That bit established...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is experimental in the idea that on most planetary bodies we encounter, there\u0027s a lack of oxygen to burn with normal engines but they do have atmospheres that the fans can take advantage of. As far as the engine is concerned, it only requires a supply of oxygen\u00A0to burn\u00A0properly. Of course, normal air is only about 30 percent oxygen and the remainder is a mix of inert gases that absorb the extra heat, thus\u00A0assisting the turbines due to thermal expansion\u00A0while minimizing overheating of the engine\u0027s interior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe same can be said if you only allowed 70% inert gasses into the turbine then\u00A0added 30% oxidizer and appropriate fuel to the mix and ignited. This would still provide thrust, and would turn the turbines, adding significantly more thrust depending on atmospheric densities at the fan inlet. Granted, it wont\u00A0get you into orbit due to it\u0027s obvious subsonic design considerations, but may be the fuel efficient kick needed to swim through (and out of) the thickest of atmospheric layers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion, this would be the equivalence of a small subsonic rocket motor with turbined expansion bell feeding a larger outer fan for added efficiency. Higher atmospheric ISP/thrust, very low vacuum ISP/thrust, moderate drag due to large fan area, thus subsonic by design.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-15T06:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ve just came upon the concept of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_turborocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eair turborocket\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s certainly doable, but it\u0027s a bit hard for Squad to implement as we\u0027ve never built one in real life that\u0027s designed for the purpose of using inert atmosphere as working fluid, thus there\u0027s no easy performance figures to copy unlike say SABRE engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would argue that if a species is advanced enough to be able to create air turborocket for the purpose of exploring planets with inert atmosphere they would also be advanced enough to create nuclear turbojet.
