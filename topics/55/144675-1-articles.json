Honestly, I think that would be overpowered but the engineer\u0027s ability to fix destroyed wheels over and over is also overpowered so I don\u0027t know. I always quick save once I have my two vessels within about 100 m of each other (as well as retracting solar panels though). I also dock at speeds less than 0.5 m/s to maintain control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso your thread subject should be something like \u0022Engineers should be able to fix solar panels\u0022; that\u0027s much more informative and useful than just \u0022Engineer\u0022.
