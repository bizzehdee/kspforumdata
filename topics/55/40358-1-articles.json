Later, the idea is to have Pilots (in orange), Engineers (in blue), and Mission Specialists (or scientists, in white)... each of those would have different personalities... for example, pilots are braver and have a high nausea tolerance, but they\u0027re stupid; scientists are smart, but cowards and get sick really easily; engineers... not sure yet... maybe they\u0027re somewhere in between, or something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbiter-forum.com/showthread.php?p=279448\u0026amp;postcount=72\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://orbiter-forum.com/showthread.php?p=279448\u0026amp;postcount=72\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T16:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the feeling it was on the orbiters forums but,after I have checked the first post made by HarvesterR,I tough I were wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for checking the others posts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaRocketCat","CreatedById":32377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T16:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking through the pages of that thread now, it\u0027s filled with awesome info and early suggestions that influenced the game as it is today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehehe check out this one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s awesome!
