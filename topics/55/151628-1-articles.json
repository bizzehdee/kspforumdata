It is not very impressive in the looks department at all. Your skybox is an empty blue, your water looks nothing like the real deal. There are no god rays, there is no bloom, no depth of field etc... There is basically nothing going on and still graphical performance is shockingly aweful. I have here a few nice screenshots that ilustrate this very convincingly. Follow me now on a launch of one of my SSTOs to orbit. Note that this savegame is empty, there are no satellites in orbits anywhere, no space stations hanging about, and no debris.

Plenty of people here have installed tons of graphics mods that make the game far more GPU-intensive with minimal loss of performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReading your post, I get the impression that you\u0027re used to games that involve a lot of work by the computer to make everything \u003Cem\u003Elook\u003C/em\u003E awesome and that are well optimized for parallel processing on multiple cores. On the other hand, the individual CPU cores do relatively little calculation as far as game update loops, physics, AI, etc. Consequently most modern gaming rigs have huge souped-up graphics cards and multiple CPU cores which are individually weak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is completely different on a fundamental level. The \u0022skybox\u0022 you mentioned isn\u0027t a skybox at all but a 3D surface whose color gradient and transparency are computed in real-time based on the camera\u0027s position in space (note that the sky looks different at high altitudes, in outer space, or on other planets). Most significantly, KSP is a physics game - rather than simply emulating the motions of physical objects like vehicles or a few rigid bodies as is the norm in most games, in KSP the game is built around precisely simulating every force and interaction affecting every part in the game. In addition to a physical model, each of them has a collision mesh and a \u0022drag cube\u0022 that determine where and how it bumps into other things and what happens when it moves through air at high speeds. KSP additionally adds in transsonic effects that affect the ship\u0027s aerodynamics as it approaches and crosses the sound barrier.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen each part is freely moving on its own, it\u0027s often possible to move them all to different processing threads on different cores, but when all of them are connected, KSP is more or less forced to treat the entire ship as a compound object with hundreds of internal mechanisms. Every frame, the game has to loop through each part on the ship and perform a series of calculations involving each \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E part on the ship. Thus the performance ends up tied to the square of the number of parts in the ship, and every additional part exponentially increases the work that needs doing by the CPU core in question.
