I know there\u0027ve been several Threads about GP2, but I have some Theories that were\u0027nt fully mentioned yet and decided to create an account here to share them with you and ask for your opinion. And afterwards i would like to describe how i would imagine my personal ideal GP2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first, the important things, the \u003Cstrong\u003ETheories\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think everbody agrees that the next planet will most likely be a Gas Giant. And it was mentioned that Eeloo will be a moon around it. Most of the community expect at least this to happen, so Squad will most probably do it that way. So second GG(Gas Giant) behind the Orbit of Jool with Eeloo as a Moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso was announced that Squad aims for Scope-completition first before adding new stuff, wich already exist(like planets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd fact is whenever they can they aim to not break saves with an update. # Here starts the Theorie, the new 7th Planet can\u0027t realisticly be on Eeloos orbit because Gas Giants wont be stable with intersecting Orbits. So Eeloos Orbit has to be erased and a new one has to be created fully behind Jool. Eeloo will change into the SOI of new GG. And that will probably break saves with everything related(Ships) to Eeloo intercepts and SOI. As it is probably easy to create the gas giant (no Surface, so only the outside looks) it would be preferable for squad to implement the new Giant as soon as the next save breaking update. They dont have to implement the Rings to that point (if it will have ones, but its high on the wishlists) because i suspect they\u0027ll be only cosmetical and not physically realy relevant. And they dont have to add more moons than Eeloo to this point, because they dont exist till now and they can add them later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo they can add everything later but probably they would like to implement 2nd GG and Eeloo\u0027s transition as soon as the next save breaking update. They just have to create a (temporarly) no-ring-Giant, wich should be the easiest planet creation of all ,and move another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would wish that will be 0.24 but i cant predict that. I dont know if it will break saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the wishing part. How would my ideal 2nd GG look like (\u003Cstrong\u003ETake Inspiration here Squad!!!\u003C/strong\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst properties: maybe ca. 10000km Radius but only slightly more Mass than Jool (Big but not dense. like Saturn)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Orbit Radius ca. the Distance from Eeloos current Apoapsis from Kerbol, but nearly round , not intersecting Jool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Name: Suggest a good one maybe starting with \u0027S\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptics: Color BLUE !!!!!

In any case, it\u0027s probably not a good idea to introduce any new planets right now. Doing so would probably be quite nice in the short-term (yay, new planets!) but in the end, would just be delaying features that actually add to the gameplay. I believe (although I could be wrong) that one of the devs mentioned that it was a quality over quantity ideology, and that more planets would be kinda pointless until the current ones actually had more stuff (biomes?, better landscapes?) to do on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Not what I was looking for, but relevant: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/303-A-rant-about-development-asymptotes#comments\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/303-A-rant-about-development-asymptotes#comments\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T02:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 02:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GluttonyReaper\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded stuff.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T01:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eid want gp2 to have atleast 1 moon with an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T01:45:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efoolish me typed planet instead of moon.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T05:43:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBy the sound of things most of its moons are already probably figured out!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Gas_planet_2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Gas_planet_2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes I know these plans.
