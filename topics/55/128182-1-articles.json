For the most part this is fine, but there are situations where it can be a real pain in the neck, for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- Releasing air-launched craft (eg. X-15 or Spaceship One style craft): you end up with a draggy, wierd looking decoupler stuck on the craft you release, when in reality the decoupler would remain attached to the carrier plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- When using hardpoints to attach weapons or drop tanks to a military plane, the hardpoint stays on on the weapon, completely screwing up it\u0027s\u00A0flight characteristics and making it impossible to reload anything on the hardpoint if you\u0027re using KIS/KAS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are probably a lot more situations where having the option to choose which side of a decoupler detaches would help, but those were the ones that sprang to mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA simple tweakable option to choose which side a decoupler detaches from could solve a lot of design headaches, and\u00A0(although I have zero KSP modding experience) I\u0027d imagine it\u0027d be quite a simple change to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Sorry, forgot to say I\u0027m talking about radial decouplers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-19T16:00:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2015 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T12:02:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the sake of argument I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re talking about radial decouplers. In case you were thinking about in-line decouplers the answer is easy, just flip them around.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA toggle option for radial decouplers would be very beneficial but the ability to flip them around would be the absolute ideal option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the mean time I do have a workaround for your issue. It\u0027s a dirty fix but it does work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuild your craft as usual, with the decouplers facing the \u0027wrong\u0027 way. Now change the root part to the booster/weapon you want to decouple. Take the \u0027carrier\u0027 and decoupler off and put it all back together again. Change the root part back to the original place. Now your decoupler is facing the other way.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor air launched craft it can be even easier: Start your build with the air launched craft. e.g. Make that craft the root, not the carrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T13:15:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a related note, I would quite like some kind of radial ... separator?
