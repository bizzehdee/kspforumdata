Kinda like the way details of Pluto were only lately discovered because until now we\u0027ve only had high-magnification images.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI figure the initial image would be a fuzzy blob taken by a \u0027surface observatory\u0027/Tracking Station telescopes. Then the image would sharpen through a series of stages, unlocked by placing a vessel camera telescope part in various situations and keeping them there for an interval, similar to how some contracts count how long you\u0027ve been doing something, e.g. being stationary on the runway, and then transmitting data or returning to get the update.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI imagine there being several stages of detail, e.g pictures from:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbin\u0027s surface\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnywhere inside Kerbin\u0027s SOI\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWithin the planet\u0027s own SOI\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLow orbit of the chosen planet\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously improving images would be worth Science!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T04:36:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes please.
