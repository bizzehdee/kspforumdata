Basically, you have limited power on your ship because you forgot solar panels again and you need to prioritize. You have maybe 3 batteries for regular operation and one backup battery. The normal ones would power everything and then once they run out the systems fall back to the backup where only things like life support or torque are on. there\u0027d be this drag thing where you link things that use power to batteries and they can have multiple links.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T22:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see some sort of \u0022reserve power\u0022, or at least the ability to unlock electricity flow from batteries while the electric charge has run out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately though, \u0022Better Electricity Management\u0022 is on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest list.\u003C/a\u003E Hopefully we can get better electricity management soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since this \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E on the what not to suggest list, thread locked.
