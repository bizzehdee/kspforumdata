This means as far as parts and gameplay, the sandbox mode cant really get any better, other than little unnoticeable tweaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But, now we have Career Mode. And it is thoroughly broken/incomplete. While we have the science aspect down pretty good, other aspects we are only just seeing are opening doors for even greater gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Take the advisor function, instead of a flat rate across the board, we get to buff certain things at the cost of others. This will work fine for when we have an actual economy to deal with. But just having a currency doesn\u0027t mean an unstable economy(a good thing) will form. For this to work right it needs to depend on aspects that aren\u0027t in the game yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Take for instance the parts themselves, we have factory/business names, and we can research parts, which right now gives us the parts. But what if, in order to use, say Kerbodyne parts, you had to research and build the Kerbodyne Factory? A building that would appear in the space center screen thats fully destructible(thanks .25).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This would open many grand strategy like components. From research ability, production times, to the ability of the kerbalnauts to even fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This is not so much of an add parts development, this is more of a lets make this game complete development. This could very well become a hybrid 4x grand strategy flight sim.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T15:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEvery day I marvel at what this game has become, and see more and more things that could be done to make it a more complete game. With .25, the path they are taking with this game, whether planned or just adhoc, becomes more clear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Its really not about turning it into a specific style of game, but incorporating different aspects of other game styles for each function of the game. With the Space Center screen representing the strategy style, the VAB/SPH representing the sandbox designer, and well, flight \u0027sim\u0027 is obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T15:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, the full game will be an engineering/flight\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E/\u003C/span\u003Espaceflight/exploration/management game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T16:12:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe its the management part that needs work now. Exploration and plane/rocket design now have full (if slightly buggy) functionality. And while there could be denser, more diverse biomes, its not necessary(let the modders do that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E What we have to work with now is unbalanced. Take the Manley video in which he maxed out science in a handfull of launches turning career mode into sandbox again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I like what Squad did with the Advisors in this next update, but I still see more we can do. Maybe have to hire Kerbals in order to do certain things, like do science. The more kerbals you have doing science, the more or faster it can be done. Base it off the stats that are already there. Smart ones increase science, dumb ones increase productivity inversely increasing rocket complexity and the brave ones increase flight accuracy/stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E We\u0027ve only gotten a quarter of the way there. There is so much still to be done, I look forward to the game complete release\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-04T16:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBtw thanks to whoever moved this.
