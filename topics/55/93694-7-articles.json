Due to Eve\u0027s high gravity and scale height, vehicles that reach high-supersonic/hypersonic speeds in-atmosphere (such as spaceplanes) also become much more profitable with realistic aerodynamics, as drag falls off *sharply* after breaking the sound barrier...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Northstar-\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
