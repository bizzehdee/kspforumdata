It\u0027s huge, heavy and useless. For the weight, you could just add several of the smaller science parts, instead of using the lab to be able to reuse it. So basically, it\u0027s useless unless you are on an unreasonably long journey, where you have to use more than ten science jr. and more than ten mystery goo containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this is my suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave it function as it does now, but give it an additional function: the collection of science over time, with the condition that it will need to stay in the same biome/ orbital altitude interval for the duration of the science collection. The collected science can then be either brought down to kerbin with the lab, brought aboard a command pod/cockpit for optimal gain, or be transmitted back with antennas, just like the other science parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would make bases and orbital stations useful as more than just fuel depots, which is something i really think this game needs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022but what if people just fast forward and cheat\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet them.

All the science equipment would get the fraction of the science available to it via transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, say you land a lab on the same lunar biome, and spend extra time performing research. when transmitted back to kerbin, this would not only net the full science value of all the experiments available to the lab (you could put that down to better communication due to crew on board, better sample processing, whatever), it would also gain a sort of \u0027surface laboratory bonus\u0027 of, say, 50% on top of the science already gathered or something (that would need to be balanced).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumerically using arbitrary values:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission to mun, one way ship with goo container.

Appropriate adjustment of the percentage bonus would allow for balancing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lab bonus could be explained as opportunistic research, or new discoveries that the crew on board didn\u0027t expect to find. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it would create a good incentive for landing a whole base rather than just the individual experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the weight of the lab module, this would remain fair, as it takes far more work to land a lab module intact with all the science experiments than it does to just land a singular ship with all the experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of time taken should be proportional to the total amount of science that can be gathered from the particular setup, naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that it takes more time to do the research would perhaps relate to the difference between the science that the experiments would normally transmit back, and the full value of the science available from the biome, as well as the science bonus.
