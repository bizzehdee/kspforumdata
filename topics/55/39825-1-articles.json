The caps lock to toggle precision controls seems like an odd key to use for a function other than the actual caps lock, I think the precision controls key should be changed to tab, it is right next to caps lock and is free of any other bindings. Secondly, using WASD for rover wheel controls often leads to unintended reaction wheel usage that comes from having driving controls and orientation controls bound to the same keys and with both active at the same time. This seems like a strange controls choice that has obvious consequences, so perhaps IJKL could be used for rover wheel controls, that could interfere with rcs translation, but that can be turned off and is not needed on land while driving.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T07:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can change the controls any time in the settings menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SPWeber","CreatedById":32023,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T07:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes I know, but I think it would make more sense and help out beginners more if the defaults were changed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MelonHeadSeb","CreatedById":67347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T08:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can just switch to docking mode when using a rover and it won\u0027t use the reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
