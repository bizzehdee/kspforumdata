Something like :\n\n\u0022land near x site at y coordinates =\u003E additional reputation, a few bucks AND 75-80% funds back from the ship even though you are very far from the KSC, thanks to the recovery of the ship !\u0022 \n\n Obviously, the recovery site should be visible in the map, just like the EVA and observation sites are visible right now. It would also be very large relative to the EVA sites we have already. It\u0027s pretty hard to pinpoint your landing location from LKO in stock (especially if you are a new player and low on fuel ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) )\n\nThere could be a sentence like \u0022the recovery ship is arriving to recover your vessel\u0022 or \u0022trucks coming towards your location\u0022 once you hit the \u0022recover\u0022 button if you succeded to land at the right site\n\n I think that this would make re-entry much more interesting, and not just \u0022damn i must land my 250,000$ ship right on the launchpad, i need that money!\u0022 Plus, with the new aerodynamics and re-entry heating being added in 1.0, all this stuff should get more attention ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) If you get too greedy and take the risk of making a steeper re-entry and getting funds back you might lose your ship, Or you can be extra careful and go for a shallow re-entry, making it harder to land at the right place !\n\n Moreover the problem of landing at the right spot is extremely important in real life, and it is not really so in KSP. \n\nWhat do you think of this idea ? Do you think it would work ? Tell me what you think is good or wrong about it !"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T16:47:04Z","Content":"I think the pods should have reentry contracts that require reentry at a certain velocity, or from a certain apoapsis/periapsis combo. Like placing a satellite with apo at some altitude, and periapsis just above the atmosphere, step 2 is to lower the periapsis to 40km (or whatever), and reenter without burning up (in 1.0, obviously).\n\nA good training contract for new players, (can pop up with a probe core unlocked, since a possible contract might be \u0022destructive testing\u0022 where you find out how NOT to reenter."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T16:50:23Z","Content":"I thought about this too, but as it is much more simpler it could be a (very useful) tutorial, especially with the re-entry heating being added."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T17:05:59Z","Content":"Sorry for the confusion.
