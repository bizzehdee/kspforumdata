However its job would be to melt the two of them together. This would make a much stronger connection when making things we have no intention of undocking. It would also avoid the debate on making docking ports stronger. So when you dock you just activate the part and it makes the weld and you are left with a single piece rather than two ports that you need to keep doing the math for to see if it breaks. Now, they can be detached via an EVA kerbal in case you do mess up with the weld and the weld part itself can be repaired afterwards with the EVA kerbal like wheels and such can be fixed. Currently if you want strong docks you need to dock with a bunch of ports at once and that increases the part count and the stress calculations. This idea make sense to anyone else? Anything to add?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T23:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be okay with that, I suppose.
