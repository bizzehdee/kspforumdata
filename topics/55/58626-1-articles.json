We could select say 5 tanks \u002B 1 source, choose \u0027Out\u0027 from the source tank which would pull from that tank and auto fill \u0026amp; balance the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wonder whether it would be possible to use docking ports as a focal point for transfers; Select a docked port and have a transfer out/in option which would pull or push fuel from one side of the node to the other. We would not need to worry about selecting any number of tanks, it would just fill \u0026amp; balance from one side to the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoomHawk","CreatedById":97206,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T23:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething you can try is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-fuel-balancer-v1-0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried it yet, but I found it browsing the SpacePort today and it at least looks to be helpful in this process even if it doesn\u0027t make it one easy step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to Squad implementing it, I\u0027d be happy if fuel lines were respected when transferring fuel (also allowing \u0027backward\u0027 flow for the fuel lines on the \u0027destination\u0027 craft), not just when an engine is consuming the fuel.
