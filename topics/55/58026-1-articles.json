I think, we are almost there, honestly and it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s getting time to wrap things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(1) Single currency\u003C/strong\u003E: I think, there should be no distinction between science and credits in the game. Two different currencies only really make sense, if they must be earned in different ways and are not easily convertable. The aim of KSP is to get to places (and ideally back, too) and perform experiments there. That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s what you currently get science for. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s the fun part of the game. What, then, would you get credits for - the boring, repetitive tasks? Do we really want such just for the sake of \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4complexity\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s the suggestion: Abolish science points and make them credits, instead. Researching then costs lots of credits, parts just way less. The only number you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d have to display in the KSC would be credits. Simplifies things, without taking anything valueable away, and gets the game this much closer to completion of 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(2) Parts-XP\u003C/strong\u003E: Any usage of any type of part is logged as experience for the part. After reaching certain thresholds, you can decide to spend credits on a slight boost of one of its stats (in the range of single percentages - dont OP this!). Make the cost of each \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4level\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 of a part rise exponentionly. Unused part-XP is giving a slight discount on follow up techs of that part\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be rather easy to implement, though balancing might be tricky here and there. It would open interesting choices to the player, though, without making things complicated. You can follow personal preference, maybe even a plan based on effeciency, but you cannot run into desaster, because there is no \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4wrong\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 way of spending your parts-XP - even if you dont spend them at all. It offers opportunities, but bears no risk. That\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(3) Career/SB-mode switch\u003C/strong\u003E: Instead of, or maybe in addition to, choosing the game-mode on starting/loading, there should be switch avaiable on all screens in the KSC (e.g. always, but not during flight), allowing to switch between both\u003Cem\u003E proverbially \u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4on the fly\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. For example in the VAB, the game would show all parts when in sandbox-mode [sBM] and you can build away freely. If you hit launch, the game will give you a notification, that you are in SBM and none of the achievements in this flight will count towards the career. If you hit the switch button, instead, and go to carrier mode [CM], the game will inform you if you have not yet unlocked parts on the built and thus will erase it from the drawing board, if you proceed and the parts-list will be filtered to what you have actually unlocked. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis set-up allows you to do inconsequential testflights from within the CM.\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Revert flight\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 then should only be avaiable on launches started in SBM. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, plus heat-effects/aerodynamics, maybe life-support and a bit of polish, and the game is about to be finished, imho...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T14:37:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor item 1, what science doesn\u0027t currently do is encourage efficient craft.

On the flip-side of \u0022Vehicles shouldn\u0027t cost science\u0022, I\u0027d also say \u0022Science experiments shouldn\u0027t generate Kash\u0022 (or what ever else they call it).\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, I don\u0027t like single currency games: Games where all activities generate one currency, and the one currency is used for all purchases. The rationale for this position goes back to game design philosophy, and I believe the \u0022fun\u0022 of games always comes back to decision making. \u0022One currency\u0022 systems subvert this philosophy because decisions are reduced to choosing which option returns the most currency. In systems with multiple, currencies with exclusive uses (exclusive uses means things bought with currency 1 cannot be directly bought with currency 2), decisions are driven not only by currency return, but in the utility value of each currency. This creates deeper decisions making, and, in most cases, more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, One currency systems are too simple for my taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) I\u0027d rather not have devs working on ignorable features in games.

I just wonder what would earn you money in KSP. Cause going to places - the fun part - is already covered by science. There will be a need for money - earning it better be fun, cause it will obligatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Again: Dev-time is a good point. I just think it\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d be a nice addition to the game. I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d not want it to become central, but something you might use once in a while. Like in: Damn it, this otherwise totally cool design fails - if it could only lift this tiny bit of extra-fuel... Let\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s see the tech-tab. Oh, i could raise this thruster\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s boost by 0.5% - that will make the next research field a tad more expensive, but for the mission after this one, i intend to take another tech, anyways. And if this works, the mission conducted with the planed design will probably earn me just enough to fund that tech and the rocket to do it.
