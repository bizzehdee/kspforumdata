Unfortunately this means you cannot create a maneuver node if your ship is currently stationary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESituation: I have a lander on the Mun, and I want to dock with an orbiting station. I would like to be able to click on the lander, create a maneuver node, and then adjust it so that I can see when to launch to get a direct intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would imagine this would be a third option for when you click on a ship, under \u0022set target\u0022 and \u0022switch to\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T13:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI reaqly like your idea.

The problem is creating a flight plan would be \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E difficult to implement, as currently manoeuvre nodes are very simple instantaneous-thrust nodes, where basically a manoeuvre node shows you the path you will take if you thrust in an infinitely small time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating a flight-plan that is ever-changing would mean the game would have to check every fraction of a second how far off you are off course from the plan, this equals heavy CPU usage (ever used Mechjeb automated-launcher? Frame-rate basically \u003Cem\u003Equarters\u003C/em\u003E because of this fact...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, what you are referring to, \u0022I want to create a manoeuvre \u003Cem\u003Enode\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, is not actually a node. A node is a point, and since on launch it is a gradual accellaration (unless you want to pull an infinite amount of g\u0027s), what you should refer to is what I have been referring to, a \u0022flight-plan\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a tip though, if you are finding it hard, you can launch when the ship you want to dock at is about 15 degrees behind in it\u0027s orbit to where you are on the ground, and launch. This angle usually get\u0027s you pretty close (dependant on your situation) to your little Mun ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps and isn\u0027t too ranty \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESam\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
