KF drives are large, rare, require slow recharges using solar power, only function outside of any significant gravity wells, and can jump several times in sequence if enough fuel cells are provided.

Like, planets behave mostly like real planets apart from being ridiculously small and dense. Solar panels behave like real solar panels apart from not following the inverse square rule when decreasing efficiency with distance from the sun. Magnetic docking ports are physically possible and even act more or less as docking ports apart from magnetic forces following inverse square rule instead of inverse cube of the distance, just to make our life easier. Ion engines work as real ion engines do, but they have more thrust to make our lives less miserable, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFTL, on the other hand, is a totally fictional concept bearing no resemblance to the real life, violating laws of physics and even in case of Alcubierre drive being a mathematical concept only.

For some reason, it doesn\u0027t scare anyone off, but when we start talking about spending similar amount of time waiting for interstellar travel using some plausible slower-then-light methods of propulsion people suddenly start saying that we need an FTL.

By which I mean it more or less goes against everything physicists stand for (which just goes to show how little they actually stand for, but I digress). In turn, this \u0022being unconventional\u0022 brings with itself a curious property of not being linked in any way to conventional progress. So STL travel is to FTL travel like the Burj Dubai is to a Japanese tapdancing robot - both are achievements in engineering, but areas of engineering so different that there are fewer links between them than between humans and cuttlefish, and either could be built without all or most developments required by the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, FTL development isn\u0027t going to wait for STL travel to develop to any given point. It can happen at any time, exactly because we don\u0027t understand half the physics involved in its workings. I\u0027m not saying it \u003Cstrong\u003Eshould\u003C/strong\u003E come early, IRL or in-game, but making the assumption that we\u0027d have superadvanced STL drives before we have FTL drives is foolish.
