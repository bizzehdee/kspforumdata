It would be a great way to power Laythe bases and keep batteries charged on aircraft in atmosphere. I could go into why one more body with oxygenated atmosphere would be a great thing to have, but that\u0027s out of this post\u0027s purview.\n\nInvert the Alternator on the Nerv. If we have enough thermal energy from the nuclear reaction to provide appreciable thrust, then logically, shouldn\u0027t we be able to use it as a nuclear power plant when the heat isn\u0027t driving the spacecraft?\n\nRam Air Turbines see use on real life aircraft to drive hydraulics and electrics. It\u0027s about time we had air intakes (either dedicated parts or tweakables on engine-breathing parts) that could generate electricity instead of ventilating engines. Electricity gain would vary based on angle of attack, atmospheric thickness, and airspeed, and function in any atmosphere, oxygen or no. Reversely, let\u0027s see ducted fans use electricity to move atmospheric air and provide thrust.\n\nFinally, with the exception of the Nerv with its inverse alternator, let us disable alternators on engines that have them. This could give a nice boost to thrust or maybe and definitely - more energy from the combustion is impulse rather than electricity - increase specific impulse. Alternator output can be a tweakable just like the thrust limiter, and Isp/thrust bonuses prorated accordingly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-02T14:08:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Samniss Arandeen**\n  \nAdding to original idea.
