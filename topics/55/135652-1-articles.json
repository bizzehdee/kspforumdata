They get downgraded to \u0022feedback\u0022 and low priority, even with the explicit mention that this is unlikely to be changed since it doesn\u0027t break the game and users seem to manage just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you add a perpendicular\u00A0input (normal or radial) to a maneuver node, the handles rotate to align with the new trajectory. However, their effect is still relative to the old reference frame which creates a very counterintuitive experience. Rotating the maneuver node handles is simply\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E. They don\u0027t act in that direction, so why make it seem so?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any vaid reason for prefering this behavior over the much more logical alternative that keeps\u00A0the node aligned with the original trajectory?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User is in an equatorial orbit (let\u0027s call it \u0022horizontal\u0022) and wants to transition to a polar orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User pulls the \u0022normal\u0022 handle (triangle)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The post-maneuver trajectory rotates around until it approaches vertical\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Meanwhile , the triangle handle rotates and approaches horizontal. It is pointing exactly in the direction where the user wants to pull the trajectory to reach a polar orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- So the user pulls the normal handle some more, but the trajectory does not move in that direction, it just stretches out further upwards\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User visits the forums for help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Someone points out that he needs to add retrograde\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User is confused, because the retrograde handle is pointing downwards. He tries it anyway, and low and behold, it works, who would have thunk? Must be some weird mathematical reason behind it, orbital mechanics are apparently really complicated and counterintuitive, you probably need a degree in mathematics to figure it out so better just move on to a simpler game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow compare this with the correct behavior that nodes should have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User is in an equatorial orbit (\u0022horizontal\u0022) and wants to transition to a polar orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User pulls the \u0022normal\u0022 handle (triangle)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The post-maneuver trajectory rotates around until it approaches vertical, but the node stays put\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- User sees that he needs to twist the trajectory sideways now to get towards the pole. The retrograde handle is pointing in that direction, so he pulls it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Great, the node performs the correction exactly as expected. See, orbital mechanics are easy, this is a fun game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, once again, why would anyone prefer the former behavior? I\u0027ve really been thinking about this long and hard, and can\u0027t find a single reason, not even a small one, for rotating the node. The more I think about it, the more flabbergasting it seems. Why would\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0prefer the current behavior? It makes absolutely no sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that there are mods to correct this, but that\u0027s no reason for stock to be so wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T09:17:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% agreement.
