And then some things in the tech tree are sometimes weirdly placed, but overall good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of sending things to space for better technology is great, it gives us objectives to send things to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..But after a while there\u0027s still a lacking of objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe in future updates you should start planning objectives/missions for the Space Program, organised either by researchers/scientists (which is already implemented, the science experiments in space), but also missions given to you by either a Kerbal Government (military/government satellites to send into certain orbits, etc), by the media (broadcasting satellites and weather satellites), companies and corporations interested in space (communication satellites, and corporations investing in your space program for further down the line making commercial space flights), and commercial space flights (in the beginning companies investing and seeing if they can get a bargain out of it, and if it works out both the company and the Space Program will gain profit and will launch commercial flights for civilians). Public Interest and Government Interest should be a thing that could potentially boost your Space Program, increasing your budget, and can help you research more and be able to produce better rockets. Failing these missions would decrease your popularity to both these Interests, which will make both of them investing far less or not at all (maybe you could set a Difficulty for this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I\u0027m not expecting all of this to come in a bang, for now the devs are focused on getting the Science polished up and done. As for that, maybe in future updates down the road focus on later technologies (which would probably new late-tech parts). And maybe sort out the tech tree a bit more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for Training \u0026amp; Scenarios, this really isn\u0027t a priority in development, but I was wondering whether they would still be useful or not? Maybe implement them into Career Mode, that way starting Career Mode will ask you whether you wish to start the tutorial/training or not, and you can check whether you want the message to appear again or not (same could go for Sandbox), and Scenarios could just merged into Missions, unless of course there could be Scenarios seperate from Career \u0026amp; Sandbox, that could actually be challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to comment, add or improve anything to what I said, or point out things that should or shouldn\u0027t be done/implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
