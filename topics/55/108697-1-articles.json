Bam, automatic fuel transfer, just like fuel lines, without line of sight restriction, and without messy fuel lines all over the place.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T20:40:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rohaq**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darthsaber","CreatedById":122778,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T02:03:26Z","Content":"Yes, but there should also be an option to transfer both at the same time, just so I don\u0027t screw up on accident.

An alternative way to achieve the goal is to allow oxidiser to be transferred to \u0022match LF level\u0022. There is no use for oxidiser without a stoichiometrically matching quantity of liquid fuel."}]}
