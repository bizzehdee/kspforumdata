A MK2 ending that is like the cockpit except with the top being flat so that I can make standard tubebody airoplanes without needing to use the mk2 to mk1 adapter and then something else after that to make it end smoothly\n\n ![2r4q1aw.png](http://i58.tinypic.com/2r4q1aw.png)\n\n2. A MK2 Ending that ends up as a flat plane, so that I can make a blended wing and body design, and attach ailereons or other control surfaces after the ending, as well as attaching wings until the very end of the main body. This could be made by just flattening one end of the mk2 half length fuel tank\n\n ![2i6f7tu.png](http://i60.tinypic.com/2i6f7tu.png)\n\nThanks so much for reading this, and if either of these are available in a mod for the most recent KSP, I would really appreciate it if someone could put a link underneath. Thanks for considering, and I wish you a great day."},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:03:54Z","Content":"I totally quote, nuff said"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:13:12Z","Content":"agree. would be nice to have a \u0022beak\u0022 type nose cone too.\n\nlike the one second from left in this pic:\n\n![Yfgm8Ag.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T01:17:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E agree. would be nice to have a \u0022beak\u0022 type nose cone too.\n\u003E like the one second from left in this pic:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s a mistery why Squad didn\u0027t implement that parts too"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T18:10:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E agree. would be nice to have a \u0022beak\u0022 type nose cone too.\n\u003E like the one second from left in this pic:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg)\n\nwhat mod are those from?"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T18:14:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E what mod are those from?\n\nThey were for an expansion to Spaceplane Plus that PorkJet was working on."},{"CreatedByName":"Darkona","CreatedById":99172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T23:15:28Z","Content":"Maybe if we ask Porkjet nicely he can release those? they looked finished enough at that point."},{"CreatedByName":"PikachuNL","CreatedById":124257,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T13:13:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Maybe if we ask Porkjet nicely he can release those? they looked finished enough at that point.\n\nHe said he had to re-do them, cause of the model change (mk2 wasn\u0027t symmetric before) MAAAAAAYBE he\u0027s already remaking them. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T13:26:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E He said he had to re-do them, cause of the model change (mk2 wasn\u0027t symmetric before) MAAAAAAYBE he\u0027s already remaking them. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nMy guess is he\u0027s to busy with Squad things."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T16:26:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E agree. would be nice to have a \u0022beak\u0022 type nose cone too.\n\u003E like the one second from left in this pic:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Yfgm8Ag.jpg)\n\nWow!
