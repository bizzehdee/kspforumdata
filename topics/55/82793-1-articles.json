There should be fuselages which are hollow (allow Kerbal passage whenever it\u0027s implemented) but which can be imploded with enough pressure. Then either through tweakables or by having more than one type, their pressure resistance and mass would be variable. The lightest could survive in vacuum of course, but you\u0027d need very heavy types for going deep into Jool\u0027s atmosphere.
