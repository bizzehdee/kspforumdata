You\u0027ve mentioned one of the major roadblocks to implementing such a thing. That could be gotten around by bloating the stock game with a \u0027registry of mod parts\u0027, which would consist of data on mod models, textures and sounds. That\u0027s a real drawback. However, the idea of such recordings is nice, as the recordings are played back in game and take up much less file size than videos. Examples of such games are Bungie\u0027s Marathon trilogy (starting mid 1990\u0027s); Myth series (around 2000 or so), which allowed viewing the same recording with a camera that you controlled during playback (pan, zoom, orbit, rotate, track, etc.), as well as alternate views (so you could replay it and watch things from other views than just the first playback) ... and built on this foundation of course, Halo. I think Bungie\u0027s approach was to capture data as you suggested, plus keyboard/ mouse input. Back in the day, there was of lot of sharing of those recording files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure there are other games which do this. Such an implementation would create a big demand for KSP recording files, I\u0027m sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
