What if when Kerbals took a surface sample, they got a tiny bit of ore. Not enough to refuel, so like 0.1 units. It would fit in with taking samples, and you could have contracts, like return sample from biome X on planet X. But, to not confuse it with the ore we will use to refuel, we could also make a new resource called \u0022Sample\u0022 or something like that, and instead of being recovered for funds, it could be recovered for science!"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T01:40:41Z","Content":"Personally I feel that, instead of merely turning surface samples into generic Science points, the (repeated) collection of (large numbers) of samples could be used to gradually uncover more useful information pertaining to a planet\u0027s composition:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E As may have been hinted by Squad in certain places, a resource system featuring sample collection / analysis / return as well as mining / processing / storage has been suggested for an as-yet undetermined future release of KSP.
