This would prevent people from unlocking the entire science tree without even leaving Kerbin while introducing new objectives with tangible rewards.

Letting people complete specific objectives to shortcut the usual process would be fine, but it cannot be the only method. You would not endear yourself to the player by forcing them to jump through hoops of your own choosing instead of letting them go where they want, especially if they\u0027re a newbie who needs the nuclear engines to get to Duna in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tylerthehun","CreatedById":109929,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-07T05:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see it as any worse than forcing the player to go up and repeat the same few experiments until they have enough science.

My examples weren\u0027t meant to be final either. You\u0027re right that Duna is probably too far for something as critical as the nuke, but it doesn\u0027t even have to be location-specific.
