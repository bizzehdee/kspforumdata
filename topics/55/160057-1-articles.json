I\u0027d ask a modder to do it, but the low-level nature of a profiler screen makes it the kind of thing that the original developers would have a much easier time implementing, assuming it\u0027s even possible for a modder to do it at all. It doesn\u0027t need to be quite as fancy as Unity\u0027s, but I feel like a few profiler features would be very useful, e.g.:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- How many milliseconds per frame are being spent on aero and thermal FX\u003Cbr\u003E\n- How many milliseconds are being spent on part physics and traversing the vessel part tree\u003Cbr\u003E\n- How many milliseconds are spent waiting for the GPU to render pretty pixels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would help out a lot of people who can\u0027t tell whether their game is truly CPU- or GPU-bound and find the optimal balance of rendering quality, physics fidelity, and vessel complexity (can I REALLY handle an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E or Scatterer installation?), and with any luck help cut down on the number of threads going \u0022I have a [crap processor] and a [pwntastic GPU] and [large amount] of RAM, why is KSP unplayable?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf some L33t pr0 modder thinks s/he can handle this, by all means go ahead, but I suspect it\u0027s a task better suited to those in possession of the KSP source code and scene files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-03T04:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t take this the wrong way, but that would be a lot development for them to put in a tool for the user to use that only developer really needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would you need this information?
