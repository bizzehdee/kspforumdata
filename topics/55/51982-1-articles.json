Five or ten steps would be completely sufficient I believe. It would be ideal if this parameter could be saved with the ship. When two ships with different settings dock together, one of them will win.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be also nice to automatically bring down light brightness (e.g. to 10%) if the object is in direct sunlight (i.e. not in the shadow of a planet). In real world, sun outshines vast majority of artificial lights. This could work independent on and in combination with the brightness setting above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T19:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESort of like a throttle for lights, that could be nice. I know what you mean about the insane whiteness those lights currently provide. They seem all right on planetary surfaces though. It mainly seems to happen when they hit parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T01:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah sometimes I have trouble with this too.
