I realize that the Kerbal system is fixed/finite. But what if it wasn\u0027t? What if every new game created, the orbits, the masses, the sizes, atmospheres, etc. were generated from some random generator. I myself have played long enough that I know a lot of the info for the system so it kind of makes it \u0022oh yeah, it is here, at that distance, so I need to do this to get there\u0022. But if the newly created game generated a new version of the Kerbal system, then a new learning process is created each time having to reach out and learn and explore the new system again before
