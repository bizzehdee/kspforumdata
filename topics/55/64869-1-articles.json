When such circle is displayed and I press and hold certain key (Ctrl or Alt, for example), the central body in the current SOI would be displayed rotated how it will be at the moment when my ship will be at the highlighted point. That could work for whatever trajectory on which I can place a maneuver node, i.e. both real and planned. If I move mouse away or stop pressing the key, the planet would switch back to its actual real rotation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T15:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERather nice idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe have the planet preview in its own little pop-up miniwindow off in a corner of the map view?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T15:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022technicalfool\u0022 data-cite=\u0022technicalfool\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe have the planet preview in its own little pop-up miniwindow off in a corner of the map view?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is in seeing it rotated in relation to the trajectory and the highlighted point.

On an interplanetary intercept, Kerbin can rotate several times between entering the SOI and getting near the surface.
