We simply don\u0027t need the game calculating everything in a base or station. So if I already have a base built or a station in orbit and stable for x seconds, the game should just stop calculating everything but the main parts (maybe this could be activated once we rename the ship and make it a station or a base, each having it\u0027s own parameters to disable physics calculation);\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBring\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003EMax physics delta-time per frame\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eback.

We need more performance options in the game setting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor the ones that don\u0027t know what this is, it basically slows time down so the computer can better calculate the physics. For example, if the physics calculation is pretty heavy on the CPU and frames start to drop, the game will basically slow down time (so 1 second in game takes 10 seconds in real life).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem with this is that it would take more time for things to happen, but the experience would be way smoother (no more trying to click on a tiny ship part at 10fps during emergencies with the cursor controlled by the analogue stick axis).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T03:37:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it plus the kraken would not happen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T03:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223427276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177290\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533331205\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022128094\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arch3rAc3\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Arch3rAc3 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncursor controlled by the analogue stick axis\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis actually made me involuntarily shudder.
