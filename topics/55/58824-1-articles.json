Some of the latest one have 200kW power levels. Many current ion engines are less then 10kW. This type of high-end electric engine is a great way to do long range outer solar system exploration that can visit several destinations in one trip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T20:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe point of vasmir is that you can trade isp for thrust when needed. way id implement this is to have isp go down as you throttle up. so at lower settings, you get isp up the wazoo, but at higher throttle settings you are just spewing gas. power consumption will probibly be high at all levels of thrust, or it might have its own curve. we need throttle curves in the same way we have atmospheric curves and velocity curves, with isp and thrust as parameters (and possibly fuel ratio).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eobviously you would use the high thrust mode when there is a small window in which to perform a burn, the rest of the time you would save your propellant and go it slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-04T20:35:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/04/2014 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
