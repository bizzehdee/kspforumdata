The problem with sandbox gameplay is that it is, dare I say, \u003Cem\u003Eadvanced\u003C/em\u003E gameplay. It demands that you set your own goals, it doesn\u0027t lay them out for you in nice little packages, so if you\u0027re \u0022wandering around aimlessly\u0022 you clearly need to figure out what your goals are and that can be confusing for new players. On the other hand, it is much more rewarding than set piece gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy biggest fear of missions is that they will cut out the sandbox gameplay by providing the only means of gaining a crucial resource. Clearly some people would like missions (or is it \u0022contracts\u0022 in KSP parlance now?) to provide some guidance; I see nothing wrong with that, but sandbox gameplay should not be eschewed in favor of set piece gameplay.

The point about \u003Cem\u003Earbitrary\u003C/em\u003E restrictions being the thing to avoid is perhaps the most important and the key difference between the two points of view. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I honestly don\u0027t really believe anyone would, in fact, enjoy a game more if it had arbitrary restrictions. Perhaps those holding a contrary position just haven\u0027t really thought it through, or are misinterpreting the concept. I think the note about how vs what is well made. I have no objection to a set of tutorial \u0022missions\u0022 for people wanting some guidance when starting out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T12:52:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, you don\u0027t realize how every game rely on substantial amount of arbitrary restriction.
