But that\u0027s not a reasonable argument any more. It is nearly impossible to go through modern life without using a computer or a smartphone or something else with a digital screen. Entertainment is similar; most modern media (except books, which are quickly becoming digitized, and board games, which have been losing popularity for a long time) is digital.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy saying that people who are at risk of seizures should not be able to use technology, you are saying that they should be denied access to almost all modern forms of entertainment (and in fact, also denied access to almost all modern forms of communication - a necessity in life). It is not difficult for the developers of digital media\u00A0to implement a text based warning, perhaps somewhere in the instructions or in the loading screen or somewhere else easily found, in order to allow these people to access digital media (which is almost all modern media) without being at risk. It is\u00A0the same sort of situation as when the organizers of an event involving food may include lactose-free options in the menu so that lactose-intolerant guests are able to eat - although it is in fact even simpler, because a text-based warning requires far less effort than choosing a menu item.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-27T21:34:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2016 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EpicSpaceTroll139","CreatedById":162839,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T22:36:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it not intuitive that making day and night go by at 100,000 speed will cause flashing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time I did it out of map view was literally because I was bored and wanted to see the flashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlickering screens after crashes and other glitches are kind of unexpected, so I understand having some kind of boilerplate warning for the game, but I would think it would be obvious that making the game spin you around very very fast would result in flashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-28T02:26:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2016 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by EpicSpaceTroll139\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T00:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t read\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the comments but this is my thoughts on the issue:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is a known factor and has been for decades that playing video games can induce seizures and that\u0027s even if the game doesn\u0027t have anything like flashes, rapidly changing images, etc. So, like all games, KSP, is no exception and is covered in that blanket.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegardless those with special medical conditions should research the materials they are purchasing; especially when they are under the above mentioned blanket.
