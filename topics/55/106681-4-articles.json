I would really appreciate it if Squad could review what 1.0.1 has done and revert the changes. They say they put a ton of time into tuning the 1.0.0 atmosphere just right, and they did. But *massively* changing it with only a couple day\u0027s testing *after* the full game release is not ok. I\u0027m sorry if this just sounds like I\u0027m whining about a nerf, but all I want is an atmosphere that is somewhat realistic.

It was too high stock also as was lift low down, landing and take of speeds were much lower than in FAR.

My spaceplane was notably less stable as well - the controls were suddenly much more squirrely.
