I loaded that up in gimp, and the intensity (V) is 80 for the upper half of the bar, and 47-71 for the bottom half. That tells me that the text color should probably be black or the background made darker. Also the foreground color isn\u0027t pure white, it\u0027s only about 98% so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, using the color from the top half of that button, I made a sample using the 80-intensity color:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://alpha.renegrade.net/images/Stock-TextBG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Stock-TextBG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d definitely say they chose the wrong foreground color.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
