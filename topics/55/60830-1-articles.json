The UI size adjuster in the options menu is Flight UI Size which I have set to max. This obviously as the name implies only makes the Flight UI bigger or rather stretches it. Because the text or rather the graphics with text in them aren\u0027t much more readable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just the icons in the UI that don\u0027t scale well it\u0027s the text as well. It\u0027s insanely small. Setting my resolution lower on this monitor is really not an option as it doesn\u0027t scale well. Makes everything blury and ugly (or maybe that\u0027s just what 1920x1200 looks like lol). Not only that but it would seem ridiculous to lower the resolution by double to a $300 monitor from a $1200 monitor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t think the devs really tested the game at high resolution. I\u0027m sure if they did they would be just like \u0022no\u0022 we need to scale that much higher. Oh well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably not gonan get a true sense of how small it is on a screenshot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut non the less here they are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/NvSoi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
