I think it would be neat if our kerbals could exit their pods and build struts where you tell them to be placed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen focused on a ship, you can switch between the docking mode and the staging mode. Similarly, focusing on a kerbal should allow you to switch between jetpack mode and construction mode. In construction mode you can select two points on a ship that you want to have a strut build between. Your kerbal will then automatically jetpack his way over to the closest point, maybe play a little welding animation with a mask \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E, then fly to the other point and do the same. After he is done you\u0027ll have a strut put between the two points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow us to make much stronger, sturdier ships in space. If taken further, construction mode could let us fix flattened tires or reattach fallen parts.
