The differences between them are the interval the packets are sent and how much power is used to send each packet. The breakdown is as follows. I\u0027m guessing the interval is in minutes, so I\u0027ll use minutes to help this make sense. Thus to send 20 units of data with the 2 packet size that\u0027s 10 packets for the data set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock settings in 0.24.2.559\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommunitron 16 (antenna) 10 electricity per packet, packet size 2, interval of 0.4 and mass of 0.005 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EComms DTS-M1 (1st dish) 12.5 electricity per packet, packet size 2 ,interval of 0.3 and mass of 0.03 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommunitron 88-88 (2nd dish) 20 electricity per packet, packet size 2, interval of 0.18 and mass of 0.025 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmount of electricity and minutes used to send the 20 units of data in the data set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Communitron 16 will use 100 electricity and take 4.0 minutes or roughly 25 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Comms DTS-M1 will use 125 electricity and take 3.0 minutes or roughly 41.666 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Communitron 88-88 will use 200 electricity and take 1.8 minutes or roughly 111.111 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you used 2 Communitron 16 antennas and transmitted 2 experiments/report (one per antenna) at the same time, you\u0027d be able to send 40 units of data for the same 200 electricity that a Communitron 88-88 uses to send only 20 units of data. That equates to having an interval of 0.20 compared to the Commnitron 88-88\u0027s 0.18, but at only 50 electricity per minute. To top that off you\u0027d only have 0.010 mass. Therefore 2 Communitron 16s can send the same amount of data in almost the same total time as the Comminitron 88-88, while using less than half the electricity per minute and less than half the mass. Due to the amount of electricity per minute used by each type of transmitter, even with 2 Communitron 16s you\u0027d need fewer batteries and solar panels/Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators, thus far less mass to do the same job. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I suggest increasing the packet size of the Comms DTS-M1 and Communitro 88-88 to 3.333 and 8.888 respectively. The way I came up with these numbers was by dividing the electricty per packet of the Communitron 16 by the product of its packet size and packet interval 10/(2*0.4) = 12.5. Then I used the electricity per packet and intervals of the other two with the 12.5 from the previous equation to solve for the new packet sizes. Which gave me a 3.333~ packet size for the Comms DTS-M1 and 8.888~ packet size for the Communitron 88-88. Hey look, that also fits the 88-88\u0027s name quite nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProposed Settings (changes in bold)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommunitron 16 (antenna) 10 electricity per packet, packet size 2, interval of 0.4 and mass of 0.005 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EComms DTS-M1 (1st dish) 12.5 electricity per packet, \u003Cstrong\u003Epacket size 3.333\u003C/strong\u003E ,interval of 0.3 and mass of 0.03 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECommunitron 88-88 (2nd dish) 20 electricity per packet, \u003Cstrong\u003Epacket size 8.888\u003C/strong\u003E, interval of 0.18 and mass of 0.025 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with these new packet sizes to send 20 units of data we get the follow changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Communitron 16 will still need 10 packets using 100 electricity and take 4.0 minutes or roughly 25 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Comms DTS-M1 will need only 6.0006 using 75.0075 electricity and take 1.80018 minutes. That\u0027s still roughly 41.666~ electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. Still more electricity per minute, but less total electricity. Plus the entire data set is sent is just over half the time. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Communitron 88-88 will need only 2.250225 packets using 45.0045 electricity and take 0.4050~ minutes. That\u0027s still roughly 111.111 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. However, the time to send them is cut to about 1/4 what the DTS-M1 uses. It could send 2 sets 10 packets in under a minute using a total amount of electricity that\u0027s only slightly higher than the Communitron 16 uses. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice the Comms DTS-M1 would need 7 packets total using 87.5 electricity and take 2.1 minutes or roughly 41.666~ electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. Still more electricity per minute, but less total electricity. Plus the entire data set is sent is just over half the time. The Communitron 88-88 would need 3 packets total using 60 electricity and take 0.54 minutes. That\u0027s still roughly 111.111 electricity per minute to send the entire 20 units of data. However, the time to send them is cut to about 1/4 what the DTS-M1 uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way this change works out, the higher tech transmitters still use the same amount of electricity per minute, but by transmitting in lager packet sizes, they use less total electricity for the same amount of data instead of more and finish their transmissions much faster. This means not needing quite as many batteries, the same number of solar panels/RTGs, which saves some mass and cost, while also making the mass and cost of the transmitters themselves actually worth using the Comms DTS-M1 and Communitron 88-88 instead of just adding more Communitron 16s. For the amount of electricity per minute used by the stock settings, you could run 4 Communitron 16\u0027s (4x the data sent) and still use less mass and electricity per minute that 1 Communitron 88-88 uses, or you could use 2 Comms DTS-M1s (2x the data sent) for the same amount of electricity, but almost twice the mass compared to the Communitron 88-88.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-21T22:48:18Z\u0022 title=\u002209/21/2014 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Monthar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-23T00:43:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been testing these changes and they work out quite well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
