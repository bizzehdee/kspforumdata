But there are situations when it\u0027s not just about being able to read them, but to even notice they are there. Such as in this picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XdgFb2c.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XdgFb2c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to suggest to give these hints a black outline so they stand out and remain readable also on bright backgrounds.
