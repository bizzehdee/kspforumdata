Since that includes *all* of the command pods, the only scenario that is defeated is a rescue taxi which is controlled by a probe core instead of a manned ship. Usually players will unlock the crew cabin way before probe cores anyway, so the gameplay advantage of such a tactic is minimal. Also, it does not prevent players from sending a probe core with an empty pod up (and attaching crew cabins as required) so Kerbals can get in or out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022design decision\u0022 for the Mk1 cabin becomes even more stoopid when you consider that it does have hatches -- on each end, where it attaches to other stuff. So if you can build a ship which has a Mk1 cabin with an open end, it actually has a hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in the EVA/crew transfer logic. In theory, if there is an unobstructed hatch anywhere on the ship, Kerbals can get in or out of the entire ship and transfer to/from an available seat automatically.
