Its mass at 4.54 makes it the highest of the command modules (the mk1-2 is only 4.12). It\u0027s less functional than similar pieces, the lander can weighs substantially less, but fits more kerbals and has stronger gyros.

I think it should have a larger observation section, and the seat should be further forward so you can actually see out to the sides. And then it should have less mass than the larger and more capable Mk1-2 Command Pod (4 tons) but more than the smaller and flimsier Mk2 Lander Can (2.5 tons).
