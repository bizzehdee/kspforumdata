Eliminating the Ap/Pe markers for near-circular orbits would be undesirable, because without mods, that\u0027s one of the main ways of determining your altitude (yes, you could still read off your altitude at the top, but it\u0027s not as precise, and I personally would find it frustrating to lose that source of information). Instead, I think you could keep the markers, but do the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. As soon as Ap - Pe \u0026lt; epsilon, consider the orbit circular.
