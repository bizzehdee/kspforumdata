And I don\u0027t mean it has to be really wordy like an entire paragraph per thing, but the current style of having just one or two words per thing on a bullet list is only clear to the people who were around when the longer discussion was happening, to know what they are a shorthand for. A one line-phrase is fine. In the example I gave, \u0022hinged movable part connections\u0022 would be a big improvement over just saying \u0022robotics/mechanics\u0022 and thinking that is clear. Someone thinking about hinged parts for payloads isn\u0027t thinking about robots or about other mechanisms that are related to robots. For one thing, robots implies automation and a person thinking about hinged payloads is thinking, \u0022yeah but that\u0027s not what I was talking about. I don\u0027t mean the hinges on robot arms. That\u0027s different.\u0022 That\u0027s the mental impression from the phrase \u0022robotics/mechanics\u0022 that the new poster will get, which is why that suggesting keeps being repeated. It\u0027s not because people are being too rude to check the list. It\u0027s because the list isn\u0027t clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, I\u0027m the person who\u0027s supposed to maintain the already suggested list, but I\u0027m not sure what exactly you mean by \u0022 example threads where an entry was discussed\u0022.
