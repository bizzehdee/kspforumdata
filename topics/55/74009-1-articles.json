In my opinion it would make using a rover much more interesting and easier to use. Also the throttle could help to choose how fast your rover could go which would make them easier to use on low gravity moons. I don\u0027t know if this would be possible to implement but in my opinion it would make rover much better. You could also use the standard controls for rovers and as soon as you press the brake button or key the throttle would stop and the breaks could come on just like a formula 1 cars DRS system is closed as soon as the brakes are pressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T16:42:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen suggestions like these before.
