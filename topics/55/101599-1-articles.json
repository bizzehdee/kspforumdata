I\u0027m a big fan of KSP and eagerly awaiting Beta Than Ever. I found and article/video which I found very interesting and immediately thought of KSP: [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/solar-impulse-swiss-plane-uae-150309032941002.html](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/03/solar-impulse-swiss-plane-uae-150309032941002.html). I wish KSP would add more parts, especially electric servo motors and engines/motors with propellers. This would allow a plane to effectively have infinite fuel with solar power and batteries. It could fly on Duna landing and collecting data forever, something which can only be done with Xenon engines currently but still need a refuel. Also with the extended travel times an autopilot feature would be very nice.\n\nI\u0027m sure there are some mods out there that add this and more - currently I\u0027m using Infernal robotics but it\u0027s extremely buggy and I know I will have to toss my crafts after the update. I would like something more official with better support. I know the game is still in Alpha, but there\u0027s a whole part of aerospace that the game doesn\u0027t touch, like being able to build propeller driven crafts. It just seems natural to add parts that expand into that area and I hope the devs allocate time for this."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T11:45:20Z","Content":"Well, technically, 0.90.0 IS \u0022Beta Than Ever\u0022, the first update of the Beta phase.
