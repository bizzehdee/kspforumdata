I tried it out in-game, but the setup of the panels are just not made for it. Non-tracking would be interesting for solar panels, but they have to be tailor-made to really make it work. Perhaps be 3x6 in size.

I hate that you see a kind of evolution in KSP that eventually settles on the ideal solution. For landers, it\u0027s either the Toyota Corolla or radially attached fuel tanks/mat. bays. It\u0027s great - it\u0027s stable, reliable, plenty of dV - but it\u0027s also boring. Same with LV-Ns for interplanetary tugs, everything just ends up being the same thing over and over again, only the destination and objective change. Encouraging the use of other parts based on their relative merits is wonderful - as with me right now and this Duna mission, with Near Future changing the LV-Ns - and I would heartily support such a change in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-15T11:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want solar panels that give you the option between tracking and locked, retractable and non-retractable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood suggestion indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
