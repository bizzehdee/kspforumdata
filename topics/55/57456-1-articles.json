I think the exit button works as-is because exit buttons are traditionally clustered with file operations buttons. The flag button is a sort of \u0022odd man out\u0022 but at least it\u0027s grouped with the craft name, which is in a good, prominent position. Given that, I think a better solution would be to move the launch button to the left hand cluster of buttons because, while it may be a \u0022game state\u0022 button, it deals with the rocket directly as a game object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kasuha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kasuha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust by the button being there you\u0027re more likely to remember that you wanted to set up the crew before the launch.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could make the same case for the action groups button which I forget far more often than crew because I\u0027m always trying to get Jeb out of the cockpit (damned default crew...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-23T18:23:39Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2013 06:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T21:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll three of the buttons on the left hand side of the screen deal with the craft directly as a game object while the ones on the right are mainly file operations \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E for the launch and exit buttons which deal with game state changes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s matter of opinion, I guess.
