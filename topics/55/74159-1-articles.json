I would love to do the same for space suit design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the subject is rich with interesting design challenges. Depending on the mission, a suit needs to maintain internal pressure, supply oxygen, regulate temperature, vent excess heat, deflect ultraviolet radiation, protect against micrometeoroids \u0026amp; rough surfaces, provide illumination, permit communication, ensure mobility, and facilitate survival \u0026amp; rescue in an emergency. In many cases, there are different ways to approach these requirements (e.g. hard-shell suits vs. soft suits, life support backpacks vs. umbilical tethers, etc.), and each decision has tradeoffs which could impact mission success. If space suit design were part of the game, I predict that we would end up customizing our suits to match the mission requirements, and that would add another layer of interesting \u0026amp; realistic variety to the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s my idle thought for the day.

Keep it simple, for instance have a few base suit types with different-size back packs. An EVA tank could take up say, a 1x1 block, pack of 10 flags 2x1, storage for 5 samples another 2x1 block. Maybe add a few suit-attached instruments to the game for acquiring surface and subsurface science.
