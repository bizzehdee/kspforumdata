Mostly because I like how non-rectangular graphics look on craft, but I don\u0027t think they make good flags, and vice versa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Implementing this would actually be ridiculously easy.

Apollo 11 didn\u0027t plant an eagle flag on the Mun and they didn\u0027t have the US flag as a mission patch.\u003Cp\u003EOne way to do this is rename the Mission Flag option in the editors to Mission Patch and apply it to the vehicles/parts/EVA kerbals/IVA views etc. Then, when you plant a flag, it could come up with the current text box and the flag selection box as well so you can decide on which one to plant there and then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask for this mainly because designs that look good as a decal on a ship (transparent backgrounds, look clean and sharp etc) look bad as a flag and vice versa (fabric wrinkles and plain white background look out of place on a ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
