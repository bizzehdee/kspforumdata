But until then, we can, and will speculate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe developers have said that resources are too up in the air right now to really set anything down for us so for the purposes of this, let\u0027s refer to this chart (I know it\u0027s out-dated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/08hdJyj.png\u0022 alt=\u002208hdJyj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining: The chart explains the concept for this quite well and I don\u0027t expect that to change super-drastically. I do expect that we will see an asteroid belt (possibly with some limited form of dynamic orbits) that we can mine for Meteoric ore (I\u0027ll explain that later on).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResources: If I need to explain this, wow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConstruction: If you are familiar with the Orbital Construction Redux or Extraplanetary Launch pads, you are familiar with the concept here: Being able to construct craft at locations other than KSC. I do hope Squad does implement something to this extent in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEconomy: What are resources good for if you don\u0027t use them to build or refuel? Selling of course! When campaign mode is operational, you will need money. You could get that through contracts, outside funding, or, as I and getting at here, selling resources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s get into suggested resource number one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeteoric Ore: A very dense material that is extracted from asteroids. When smelted down (and usually mixed (on kerbin at least) with rocket grade aluminum and steel), it makes some strong and light metal, let\u0027s call it kerbanite. The kerbanite is 50% stronger and 25% lighter than normal parts, but can only be made through meteoric ore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do we get this at KSC, you ask? Simple. At KSC you have a new building, a silo. This silo holds the resources you bring back. You can then do different things with them. You can pay to send them for processing into whatever they refine to. You can sell them raw or in a refined state. You could fuel a ship with them. You could even use them as payload to supply your orbital depot without paying for the fuel. The idea here is that you can still make a decent profit even if you have to outsource the refining. In the case of the ore, it can be sent away and refined into metal, which is further \u0027refined\u0027 or rather fabricated into rocket parts which then can be used to build your ships out of material with 1.5 times the strength and 0.75 times the weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is clear how modular fuel tweakables would play in here and make things much more interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s go back to construction for a bit. Anyone here who has played with Extraplanetary launchpads has seen how much of a hassle to launch the stock ones are. If and when that becomes stock, what will be your VAB? I remember not that long ago (a year at most) a private space company tested a new inflatable module that started the size of a suitcase and inflated into a full size bedroom (and a master bedroom by space standards). Theoretically, you could make an entire VAB fold up into a pretty small part (I thought something like the centrifuge from the DSM pack). Now think about a base on Lathe!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife support. Let\u0027s face it. Kerbals won\u0027t be as invincible as they are now when they actually start needing oxygen \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E. Those are resources too so I do assume that we will be able to exploit that and make long term bases that much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, time for a curveball. Power transmission. I am referring to the ability to get a lot more power by collecting it via solar close to the sun and then beaming it back towards your craft. To my knowledge, the decay of microwave is a lot less than that of solar. Also, you could then help it out with some transformer/booster/reroute satellites to keep the power up (with a bit if supplemental generation \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and aim it to the dark side of planets. Think remotetech for power. In theory, you could even provide power to Kerbin, fulfilling contracts and earning cash. It would also be great for powering Munbases and other bases where long nights are a common problem without resorting to battery spammage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m willing to hear opinions on my take on all this stuff, clarify stuff at people\u0027s request, and otherwise comment.

It\u0027s honestly not and I\u0027d LOVE to see even more complexity added to it. More ores, deep life support like food, water, oxygen, waste, KASPAR style storage modules that you can load and unload into little airlock compartments like a dumbwaiter for fun EVA aspects to resupply missions in addition to like...one or more types of food production for dedicated long-distance missions and bases where resupply missions wouldn\u0027t really be feasible. Maybe have food and waste be something you can toggle on and off via an options menu \u0027cause some people might not want to hassle with resupply missions. Or maybe have a slider which changes the rate at which your kerbonauts use life support resources. Hmm~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see one or two more resources, like maybe a generic precious metals resource called Kerbinum or something that you can mine. It would weigh a lot and if you landed it close to KSC, you could salvage it for moderate profits. Somethin\u0027 like that, anyways. Just more resources is good good good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with that complexity is solely involved in dumping too many things on the player all at once. If they started with just a couple resources, getting you used to them and how they work together in your rockets and such, then introduced a couple more...and finally started teaching you how to mine them(perhaps one surface type at a time), then it\u0027s a very gradual type of thing. That\u0027s how we learn anything, gradually. It\u0027s only when someone piles too much on you at once that you get overwhelmed, which is partly why they\u0027re working on career mode now, for people like me who\u0027re a little too thick to figure out what\u0027s good in that ever growing list of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T05:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of all this, but isn\u0027t every single one of these ideas on the what not to suggest list?
