The way I see it, one can look on KSP in one of two ways. Either you think KSP is a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E where you construct your own rockets, fly to the places you want just because you want it and explore the KSP universe simply because its fun.

There are tons of games out there that are essentially sandboxes, where you are given a load of basic elements with which to construct something, and it is up to your own creativity to have fun with them as you see fit. Games like Minecraft, The Sims, Sim City, Elite, Transport Tycoon all are definitely games rather than simulators, but are also sandboxes in which you as a player are given minimal structure to follow, and just do what you feel like. Equally, a computer program can be considered a simulator where the purpose is to run a business, follow a particular defined path and achieve carefully architected goals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difference between a game and a simulator is down to the objective of the program. If the point is to provide a method for the user to entertain himself, then the program is a game. If the objective is to model a real-world phenomenon as accurately as the computational power available can manage, then it is a simulator. There are simulators that are fun to use and there are games that are highly realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy day-job is as an aerodynamics engineer, and one of the key tools I use to do it is computational fluid dynamics. I use powerful computer hardware/software to simulate, as accurately as possible, real world physics problems. KSP is absolutely not at all like proper engineering simulation tools. It is a game, and that\u0027s why I play it. I could produce a long list of shortcomings of KSP as a simulator that, if \u0022fixed\u0022, would give it much greater physical accuracy, and in the process entirely ruin it as a fun pastime for anyone other than actual rocket scientists. KSP is like lego.

I don\u0027t think \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C/em\u003E is claiming that KSP is astronaut training (if they have, you are welcome to quote them, and I\u0027ll agree with you). It is none the less a simulation of aspects of spacecraft operations at a coarse level of fidelity, to be sure, just as many \u0022flight simulator\u0022 are low order simulations. I\u0027d vote it is a simulation game (or some similar choice). Simcity is a sort of simulation, I suppose, at zeroith order (or less \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). Il-2 series is a \u003Cem\u003Elow order\u003C/em\u003E simulation of ww2 air combat, Silent Hunter is a low order simulation of submarine ops in ww2, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of \u0022flight sims\u0022 of ww2, for example, having played them, I have a much better understanding of ww2 air combat in reading historical accounts of pilots than I did before I played them (starting rather a long time ago, lol). I have no illusions that I am somehow now a fighter pilot, but when I read descriptions of real engagements, I visualize them accurately, whereas I frankly did not before that. I can\u0027t say more than \u0022I get it\u0022 now. I think many can say the same about orbital mechanics playing KSP, they \u0022get\u0022 aspects that would not have been clear to them before (say reading about the Gemini missions trying rendezvous/docking operations for the first time).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T22:35:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T22:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is Yes. It has components of what I would consider both a game and a simulator. KSP has a certain humor and way of going about things in a manner that I would most likely associate with a game. On the other hand, KSP\u0027s dedication to Newtonian physics and many other realistic features would classify it as a simulator. Scott Manley once said that he enjoys KSP in part because things behave the way you would expect them to in real life.
