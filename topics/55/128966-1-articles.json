I wont argue that there is a correct way to play Career mode this time around, ill stick to the main issue I have with suggesting a warning for low power. \u00A0There are no real warnings in this game outside of when you build the craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlying there are no alerts if you are running out of fuel, about to hit land, things are happening in the background , just nothing. It just lets you do what you want to do without any forgiveness. So this isn\u0027t localized to just electricity, its across the whole game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame play wise the best way I fix running out of electricity in any probe ship is keeping the electricity in the probe core off limits. So if I find im out of power I ALWAYS have power in reserve. Now I have forgotten to do this many times and really its 100% my fault for not thinking things through and ultimately the extra aspect of using probes instead of manned missions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo should we have warnings about power while in flight? It would help counter these problems, but then aren\u0027t having this problems part of the game and fun? Its not like the game is unfair by\u00A0doing this, rather its being 100% fair. To the point you screw up your done, no help, no hand in hand, no warnings \u0022hey bro you screwed up and are about to lose power\u0022, just your probe is out of power and you should of flown it\u00A0better or designed it better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow on the topic of if we need more warnings in general I actually like how it is. If you were to play this game with moderate amounts of warnings alarms like a real space craft you would defiantly have less fun doing dumb things. Newer players also would be spammed with messages as they have their Jeb smiling as he re-enters Kerbin without a parachute. Yea having alarms and warnings is realistic and helpful for practical spaceflight, but this game is as much impractical as practical. As such its also brutally unhelpful, and leaves everything up to me which is why its not considered an easy game and thus shouldn\u0027t have alarms.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-01T01:28:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2016 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
