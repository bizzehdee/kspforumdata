I looked at the \u0022already suggested\u0022 thread on this topic and I didn\u0027t see something that seems like a really obvious fix brought up: How about allowing tank-to-tank fuel transfers to be set up in action groups? I looked for this feature trying to build my latest SSTO, and saw it was not there. It does not seem like this would be very difficult to implement, and it would make the problem of balancing complex SSTO designs in flight far easier. You could also maybe set up an action group for a set of tanks that says \u0022fill through X docking port\u0022, that takes fuel out of whatever is on the far side of that port and puts it into tanks on the near side. Also, it would be great if you could set up fuel lines between any two tanks without actually having to place the part. It is often very difficult or unaesthetic to do this, and placing this structural barrier in the way of internal fuel transfers is inconsistent with the way you can transfer between tanks using alt-click. Anyway, it seems like implementing these changes would require a fairly trivial amount of development time, and would make the game significantly more fun to play, especially once you get into large and complex ships, space stations, etc. My apologies if this is all well-trodden ground, but I feel like this issue is important for gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-22T15:27:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2014 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
