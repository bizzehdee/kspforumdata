I know from experience that this will reduce the TWR and increase DV\u00A0of those engines but there is no indication in the VAB\u00A0that this is what is happening. Why not 75% or 50% for the \u0022Swivel\u0022? Its effects are apparent in the next Training exercise \u0022Go For Orbit\u0022 in that it means you can keep the throttle on max rather than adjusting it during launch to keep your speed below the burn limit caused by atmospheric drag, but if it\u0027s training\u00A0it should explain why it\u0027s getting the player to do something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
