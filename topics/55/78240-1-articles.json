Little did I know that your latest update had now moved my RCS thrusters into another part of the tech tree making my ship unable to launch as I now had to research them...with research points I can no longer get since I have explored the whole of Kerbin:huh:! So i take the RCS off (cos who needs it anyway?) to find my ship is now \u0027over budget\u0027 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E! Squad I have invested tens of hours into two careers only to find you wish me to start all over again. Before you say \u0027sandbox\u0027, I dont want to play sandbox. I want to play career (i like working towards goals and deliberating where science is best spent), but without the economy thing you just added because it feels like a massive muzzle...and it just broke my careers. I dont want to start all over again either. Please do something that will keep old careers the way they were started. You should have made it so that old careers were unaffected by the new patch. I hope you understand my (incredible) frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T17:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERCS acted the same way any parts moved in the tech tree work - the game decides what parts to show based on whether or not their tech node is researched, and if it is researched, decides whether to select them or not based on whether they\u0027re researched in that tech node. For them to be able to move parts around in the tree without making them disappear if researched in the old node, they\u0027d have to change how the tech tree checks is implemented. The new spot makes more sense for RCS (in flight control, instead of under \u0022fuel\u0022), and while a change in how the tech tree works to make rearranging it work better would be nice, I wouldn\u0027t hold my breath.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor funds and contracts: It\u0027s not a ridiculous idea to imagine that people playing career in 0.23.5 would like to take advantage of the career additions in 0.24. There\u0027s always science mode if you don\u0027t want to use them, but career now includes contracts (if you don\u0027t want budget or contracts, it\u0027s not career).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to use your save in the new science mode, try opening the persistent.sfs in a text editor and changing mode from CAREER to SCIENCE (and the thing in parentheses after the name, also change to SCIENCE).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T17:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForward compatibilty has never been guaranteed with KSP, you should never expect your save files/craft files to work in newer versions of the game.
