The purpose of this post is to discuss what I think work and don\u0027t work about career mode in its current state (.24) with the hopes that maybe it could impact future iterations of career mode. I\u0027m posting this in the general discussion section because I want to hear what others opinions are on what i think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMajor topics:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Pacing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Tech Tree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Contracts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Science collection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPacing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPacing is the number one reason i have abandoned 2 out of my 3 careers so far. I want to be able to do missions in what seems to be a logical manner to me. This would be sending probes and satellites (as well as maybe small rovers) to other bodies before I visit them. I also feel like my first missions should always be unmanned, perhaps launching a few satellites around Kerbin and collecting basic data with sensors. I don\u0027t really feel like it makes sense to risk the lives of my kerbals when just starting a new space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would best be fixed through the tech tree which I will talk about next.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETech Tree\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion the groupings of items in the tech tree are not so great. While i understand the idea of unlocking technologies 1 at a time I would rather unlock things by size, so i can make cohesive ships, rather than by tech, which is usually at a seemingly random size. What I would really like to see from the tech tree to fix this is perhaps separating the tech tree from the part unlocks. In this system you would unlock a technology in the research labs, and then you could go to something like a foundry to implement the technology into a certain parts. An example of this would be to research energy storage, then use that research credit to unlock the small satellite battery while leaving the large satellite battery locked. I think this would allow you to specialize your space program better for the different phases of a space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I love contracts, they\u0027ve added a much needed goal orientation to career mode. All I want to put in this section is my ideas for additional contract types.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ENew contract types\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Satellite launches (ie. put a satellite with a communicatron in orbit around Mun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Maintain a station around X body (would give passive science over time as long as the kerbal hadn\u0027t been in space for too long)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience collection\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a smaller factor to what bothers me when playing career mode and is somewhat linked to the tech tree. The basic idea here is that I feel like I should have access to scientific instruments earlier. Personally I think the gravioli detector would be the most important to have early on so that you can get science from space probes that wont be in the atmosphere. However it\u0027s the last sensor that you unlock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESummary\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall this most recent update has had a hugely positive impact on career mode and I can\u0027t wait to see more. I just hope to see myself enjoying the early campaign more in the future. Because currently I find the early game to be fairly boring and I only start to gain interest once I reach the mid-career level of technology. Let me know what you think about my ideas and how you feel about the pacing and other parts of the current career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
