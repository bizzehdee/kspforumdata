You can choose whether or not fuel passes through a decoupler, but there\u0027s no such option for crossfeed between tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy second stage was a bundle of 7 orange tanks with Mainsail engines, but some of those tanks were probably considered to be \u0022closer\u0022 to certain particular other tanks due to tiny floating point rounding errors. The result was that some tanks were running out more quickly than others, and I suddenly got an asymmetric flameout with empty tanks on one side and half full on the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know I could solve it with fuel lines, asparagus staging etc. (and I probably will since it will be more efficient),\u00A0but it would have been nice to simply disable this crossfeeding. Just add an option to each fuel tank to optionally\u00A0isolate it from\u00A0adjacent tanks, like the option to let fuel pass through a decoupler or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T21:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Closeness\u0022 doesn\u0027t matter, it\u0027s the logical arrangement that does and floating point error doesn\u0027t figure into that.

Probably better to use decouplers, separators, docking ports, or other parts without crossfeed to isolate tanks from each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T07:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been getting the same problems with a cluster of 3 tanks around a central tank, the central tank has fuel lines going raidally outward, but the tanks drain unevenely, and I have to do some tricky fuel transfers to get the darn thing to fly right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment, I don\u0027t have any better picks of it but here it was as the payload:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002210441055_10103614966504973_7518848353140\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xat1/v/t1.0-9/10441055_10103614966504973_7518848353140663427_n.jpg?oh=493eef27b919b662b7b3bf4bd97d0b7e\u0026amp;oe=57713DEF\u0026amp;__gda__=1462994989_1e8fcb0c6f9cbfe4149caf0d78a9e16e\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe center 2.5 tank has a mk2 lander can, and then a \u0022half orange\u0022 above it feedes to the 3 tanks \u002B adaptor tanks around it, each with a poodle below. Its my duna ISRU craft, and it becomes unbalanced rather fast without shutting down the fuel flow on all tanks except the center, and manually transfering fuel into the center to keep it going. Thinking that it may be related to being put in as a subassembly, I basically rebuilt the thing, put it on the launchpad, and then swapped positiongs via .cfg file editing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe newly made one had the same problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T09:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso guys, don\u0027t forget that fuel lines have trouble when going from one tank to two or more, two into one works but not the other way around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRockets should only be drawing from their stack as well, not adjacent tanks, only jets draw fuel from neighbouring tanks and they do so equally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your rockets are drawing fuel from radial tanks it\u0027s either not a stock install or you put fuel lines on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireball","CreatedById":125706,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-25T18:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a mod for this, updated to KSP v1.2.
