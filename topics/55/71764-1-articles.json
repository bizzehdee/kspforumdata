There is what I came up with, while i was reading it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Kerbals\u0027 stats\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you know kerbals are featured by two stats: \u003Cstrong\u003ECourage\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EStupidity\u003C/strong\u003E (you should change this one to the Intelligence). Those two could affect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Science Multipiler (via Intelligence) gained from their EVA and crew roports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Reputation (via courage) you gain by sending them into space (more courageous kerbals attract more sponsors and stuff like that).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there isnt anything that could affect your money balance so here comes the \u003Cstrong\u003ESalary\u003C/strong\u003E. Kerbal\u0027s salary will reduce you reward from contracts. Below is a simple example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EContract reward is 10,000.00 KSD (Kerbal Dollars). Jeb\u0027s Salary is 2%, Bill\u0027s 4% and Bob\u0027s 1%. You Substract sum of their Salaries (salaries?) which is 7% from your reward and you get 9.300.00 KSD, because 10,000 - 0.07 * 10,000 = 10,000 -700 = 9,300.00 KSD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Building construction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you start new save first thing you see is huge VAB, big space plane hangar with its loooooong runway, mission controll antenas and R\u0026amp;D, but I don\u0027t really think that NASA started with all its facilities all around the USA so Kerbal Space Agency shouldn\u0027t too!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to start with small crane as a VAB, flat sandy area as a launchpad and a small lab as a R\u0026amp;D facility. As you progress on your tech tree you will unlock ability to expand some buildings (for some cash of course) to make some parts avalivable. Below are possible ways some buildings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - VAB and Launchpad - Rocketry, controllability and Construction tech tree branch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SPH and Runway - Aerodynamics, Survability (parachutes, landing gears), controllability and Mobility Improvements (ladders, lights) tech tree branch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - R\u0026amp;D Facility - Science and Electronics tech tree branch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Mission Controll - Unmanned Tech, Electronics and controllability tech tree branch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Astronaut Complex and Training Grounds - All branches and Reputation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Community And Finance Centre (read further to know more about it) - Reputation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. New functions for existing buildings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only one thing I could say there (for now) - Astronaut Complex. For now you can only hire astronauts there, but there could be more. For me it could be better to make kerbals train in there. As you hire a Kerbal he will go to the \u003Cstrong\u003ETraining Grounds\u003C/strong\u003E and spend few days in there and after that he will become a real astronaut. I would also improve kerbal stats system there\u0027s not much to talk about, Kerbals should have base stats (can\u0027t be below 10%) that can be improved via Training Ground by max 50% of base stat. Example: Jeb has Intelligence and Courage of 50% he go to the training ground for some time and both of them rise to 75%. But what if a Kerbal has already 100% of something? His stats just simply go to 150% and that\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. New Building\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already mentioned Training Grounds, but there was also \u003Cstrong\u003ECommunity And Finance Centre\u003C/strong\u003E. In CAFC you can sign contracts, manage your money, find sponsors and gain some reputation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5.
