Bet... 1.0 full release, this one is (also) damn critical because it is the only way to win moneys in Career mode, and what every new players hope to give them intelligently made scenarios.\n\nSo, questions :\n\n**- Are you satisfied by the current Contract system ?**\n\nIf not :\n\n**- Do you consider it\u0027s a question of fine tuning ?** (like forbidding the generator from generating some requirement, reducing the requirement or increasing the reward)\n\n**- Do you consider it can be solved by improving and adding new feature ?** (like adding the ability to \u0027negotiate\u0027 your own mission)\n\n**- Or do you think it need a complete revamp ?** (ex : relying over 50% on a periodic budget (reputation-driven))\n\nAnd a last one :\n\n**- Baring what you wish, how would you fix what we have ?**\n\nMy opinion : \n\nI see procedural generation of contents as a cheap solution to generate content with minimal work, but it is cheap that misused it can turn out worse than if you painstakingly wrote a few missions yourself or asked a forum of amateurs to do it for you.\n\nAnd in the case of a video game that is already very very difficult, it can literally become a barrier : How would a new player know if a contract is possible/easy or not (the price isn\u0027t even an indicator) ? How does a NEW player know what the parts he is asked to test do ?\n\nI am no particular fan of linear progression (such as historical milestone objectives) but in our case I think it would have been better from the start, than the system we have now. Of course this forum would surely be asking to get \u0022automatically produced (magically)awesome missions\u0022 but at least we wouldn\u0027t face the frustration of impossible contract, meaningless tests, non-rewarding contracts and the feeling to grind continuously since the few missions there would have would hopefully be tailored by intelligent game-designer.\n\nBut enough badmouthing, this isn\u0027t sooooo bad. The framework is good, the game can keep track of (now) multi-step complex missions or \u0022program\u0022 all with a relative freedom when the contract-generator isn\u0027t being a smartass. And this, is incredible enough.\n\nIf you wanted to do any hand-made mission, the framework allow it.\n\nIf you wanted to add a Periodic-Budget, the framework allow it.\n\nI can believe SQUAD is being hurried to finish the game yet still compensate with feature that can be modded/revisited easily (because apologizing for everything would lead nowhere).\n\nSo if I had to propose solutions...\n\n- **FILTER nonsensical parameters/parts.** A jet-engine don\u0027t need to be tested in space or at speed it can\u0027t reach (or anymore in 1.0). \n\n- **LESS USING ALL PARAMETERS !** This isn\u0027t because you can set all speed/altitude/place limits that you should.\n\n- **Make it contextual !** Suggest the a good way of accomplishing the contract, propose contracts that get you RP from place you forgot.\n\n- **Make it friendly** so it can be punishing as well. If you always had chance of (very) highly rewarding contracts (or a periodic budget as a fail-safe), you could have actual penalty and down period in your space program.\n\nps : Someone else have the feeling the Administration Facility is (still) pointless ? Aside from the time that ONE strategy was ridiculously efficient, the missions are so grindy and the gain from strategy so pointless I\u0027m not consider using it ever. (the [rigid grind-tree](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-A-more-intuitive-tech-tree) doesn\u0027t help)\n\n**Your turn...**"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:50:11Z","Content":"I agree on pretty much all points. Now that atmospherics have been implemented, there needs to be rebalance of contracts.\n\nAlso agree on the Admin Building is a nice novelty, but at this point I\u0027m only spending Rep points on any strategy, why waste hard earned cash/science when I have more pressing issues?"}]}
