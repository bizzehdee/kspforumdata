This type of animation looks \u003Cem\u003Euber\u003C/em\u003Ecool, and is also extremely realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m proposing here is a minor implementation of soft-body physics to KSP. Even though my idea may never get beyond this very thread, it\u0027ll still be fun to talk about!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, I believe soft-body physics would be useful in animating the rocket engines and wheels, things like that. In rockets, engines would realistically contort to the thrust being expelled out the nozzle, and could even crumple if you land on them. This particular idea was inspired by Apollo 15\u0027s LM\u0027s Descent stage engine being smashed up when they landed unevenly. SB physics would also be handy in animating bouncier wheels, and maybe even steel-mesh wheels that could bend if too much pressure is applied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA list of other uses I see include flags, solar panels, and dentable fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize that this is an idea that will take quite a bit more power to run (probably, I\u0027m no computer expert) but what I suggest is only partial implementation. Less accurate physics points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for being drug though this long suggestion! I\u0027ll answer any questions or address any comments you can present.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T20:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea, it would be more neat than simply exploding tanks *imagines Danny exploiting it*, but this would be strictly for higher end computers considering how gpu intensive KSP is, so I imagine it would preferably be a add-on so it doesn\u0027t send the laptop KSP players\u0027s computers in flames... (though maybe it would force them to get a good desktop....).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine people using jumbo 64s as tylo lithobreaking tubes.... at orbital velocity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T21:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have always wanted ksp to have this, but should be done later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shna_na","CreatedById":14950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T23:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be a fantastic addition, but would consume a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of precious development time. I mentioned it to C7 in a stream before, and he seemed pretty taken aback. I believe his words were \u0022WHOA-nonononono...\u0022 then he went on to say about how demanding it would be in terms of development time and PC-crippling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, hypothetically speaking, if it \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E to be implemented, I\u0027d like to see it in the settings in a similar format to the terrain scatter: have it so that it can be toggled on/off and a slider to determine how easy it would be to make something crumble under the pressure, so to speak. I think it\u0027d also mess with the damage system a little... I\u0027d like to see it, but given the negatives, eh, I can live without it. This is the one time where I say that \u0022the modding community might do that\u0022 is a valid argument.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T23:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis feels like something for a hypothetical KSP 2.0 (I also just thought it\u0027d be cool if the KSP 1.0 solar system were reachable in KSP 2.0. hah)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah it\u0027d be cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
