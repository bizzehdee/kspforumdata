However this little issue that brought the idea forth has come again during my playing session today so I immediately took time to post it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m absolutely annoyed by the Biome system (in some way)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore precisely I think that there should either be a much more detailed information section online on a ksp wiki page about the exact locations of biomes. Or even better yet, there should be a in game option to better distinct biome areas from one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is surprising I haven\u0027t yet heard anybody else complain about it. Possibly because they didn\u0027t exploit every available biome as I have. On the planet Kerbin for example there are ofcourse Obvious biomes available. Ones that you cannot miss. Like.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-grasslands, highlands, water, dessert and ice caps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther biomes that are assumingly easy to find but sometimes pose a challenge are the... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-mountains, shores and tundra.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only leftover biome (badlands) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find most troublesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E wiki page for guidance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn this page biome maps are displayed. These maps seem to be painted in Ms paint or some cheap photoshop program and are completely undetailed and only present a vague unclear area radius in which you can expect to find the biome your looking for. Obviously it poses no difficulty for the Obvious biomes like highlands, grasslands etc, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I had alot of overshoots on on biomes like the tundra, badlands and shores. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took Kerbin as a example here. I\u0027m nog even going to begin discussing this issue about the Mun biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short however the way you should see it is that I have build a rocket (with a lab i.e.) to land on the mun. Which I presumed to be the Mun\u0027s canyons for example by using the Mun ms painted biome map. And then find out I landed 20km short with a immobile processing lab and other science equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESUGGESTION!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1:\u003C/strong\u003EMake a highly detailed 2560 x 1800 colour map that displays the biome map in more detail then it does now. And put a 2nd photorealistic map behind it to compare (the way you see it from orbit) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2:\u003C/strong\u003EMy favourable suggestion. Update KSP so that you can \u0022Target\u0022 anything on the ground. Perhaps with a Key combination. Lets say you click kerbin (mmb) to select the planet as target. But Ctrl \u002B Alt \u002B MMB on a body to select the location on the ground. Which would then give the information what area of the planet that actually is (thus the biome))\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T20:57:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck this out: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.kerbalmaps.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has an option for a large, high resolution biome map.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
