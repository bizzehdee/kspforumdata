I haven\u0027t posted in a while and have lost the hang of it, so correct me if I\u0027m wrong with a few things here and there or if this has already been suggested (sorry in advance!).\n\nI would think a logical step in the distribution of recently released downloadable content for the game (Asteroid Day, Kerbin Cup?) would be to add them to all DRMs (Steam, GOG etc) as free DLC. It would allow the lazy, such as myself, to not fiddle with Curse and have access to these features again once uninstalled-reinstalled etc and without running the risk of forgetting about them. \n\nAlthough I\u0027ve come to find Curse to be great for the modding community, I don\u0027t find it to be a great option to **solely** distribute optional dev-made content to the public. \n\nI apologise if this was posted in the incorrect sub-forum. I was tossing up between General KSP Discussion and this one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T10:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chezburgar7300**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T08:44:36Z","Content":"Nah, just add it in stock for the next update."},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:48:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nah, just add it in stock for the next update.\n\nKerbin cup was never made stock, and I don\u0027t think Asteroid Day should either.\n\nBarring any limitations on the DLC system with steam and the like; I don\u0027t see why the \u0022Official\u0022 Mods shouldn\u0027t be free DLC, at least in view of the distribution platforms used."},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T10:34:43Z","Content":"They are \u0027free\u0027.\n\nplus they posted asteroid day on kerbal stuff.\n\nI do think that asteroid should be included in the game but the world cup mod shouldn\u0027t.\n\nfootball/soccer is completely unrelated to Space and KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Chezburgar7300","CreatedById":114873,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:14:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I do think that asteroid should be included in the game but the world cup mod shouldn\u0027t.\n\nJust to clarify, this suggestion isn\u0027t about these official mods becoming stock but rather them being officially supported and distributed on the DRMs that KSP is sold on as **optional**, and free, to aid with convenience."}]}
