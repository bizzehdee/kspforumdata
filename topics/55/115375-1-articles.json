I haven\u0027t posted in a while and have lost the hang of it, so correct me if I\u0027m wrong with a few things here and there or if this has already been suggested (sorry in advance!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think a logical step in the distribution of recently released downloadable content for the game (Asteroid Day, Kerbin Cup?) would be to add them to all DRMs (Steam, GOG etc) as free DLC. It would allow the lazy, such as myself, to not fiddle with Curse and have access to these features again once uninstalled-reinstalled etc and without running the risk of forgetting about them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027ve come to find Curse to be great for the modding community, I don\u0027t find it to be a great option to \u003Cstrong\u003Esolely\u003C/strong\u003E distribute optional dev-made content to the public. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI apologise if this was posted in the incorrect sub-forum.
