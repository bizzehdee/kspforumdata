Asteroids. Asteroids occasionally spawn around the edge of the solar system. Also, asteroids occasionally spawn in the asteroid belt. Asteroids can be mined if you manage to land on one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Explosives. Why explosives? You can use explosives to blow up asteroids, make a smoother area to land on asteroids, and you can use explosives to make temporary craters on planets and moons that last about 2 minues before they start filling up again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Comets. Comets are like asteroids but they can be seen from far distances and come from outside the solar system. Comets occasionally pass by Earth, and if close enough, can be seen in day time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Mining outpost: With a new range of mining drills, you can dock yourself on planets and moons and mine for resources, gaining you coins and science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you mine and where:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho: Space rocks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve: Amysist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin: Rocks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna: Iron\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres: Preserved water\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool: Gas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo: Freshwater ice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMOONS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn ice: Preserved ice\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn rocks: Rocks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn normal land: Alien soil\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Other solar systems. After you leave the solar system, and after you travel for a while you might come across another star system. The cool thing about foreign star systems is the ability to name the planets, moons, and star yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypes of star systems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal star systems: Basically like the solar system you came from, but with unique planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDouble star system: 2 stars orbiting each other. These star systems rarely have planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDying double star system: These systems never have planets. The two stars are on an orbit that is slowly becoming smaller. They eventually collide and explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed giant system: These systems only last for around 20 kerbin years. They then have a 50% chance to explode and a 50% chance to turn into a white dwarf system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhite dwarf system: These sometime spawn naturally, or they can be from red giant systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESupergiant system: These systems last for about 10 years until turning into a black hole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Black holes. These spawn far away from the solar system. They are extremely rich in science if you come upon one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Eas-5 struts. Eas-5 struts are like struts, but they are lighter grey, and they are twice as powerful as normal struts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Space outposts. Space outposts are like space stations, but they are meant to explore deep space with something more than a small capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Void engines: Harness the power of black holes and equip your planes with black hole engines. These make the area around your ship turn black when on, and they go extremely fast, and do not require air. However, they require twice as much fuel, even though they start off with some of its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. New gas giant. It would be called Caliisti and is meant to represent Saturn. It has rings, causing gravity assists. It is very hard to land on because of this. However, if you can manage yourself onto an asteroid, you can get some pretty valuable resources to bring back to Kerbin to study.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Gas giant storms: Whenever planets are gas giants, they will often have storms. They can last for as short as a month to as long as 10 years. Jool usually only has 1 or 2 storms on it at a time. In rare cases, it might have 3 or 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. Nebula, It would be so cool to have nebula to try to navigate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. Custom astronaut skills: In sandbox mode, you should be able to customize your own astronaut\u0027s skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think of these ideas. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-12T02:52:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s an idea dump.

Without same places for everyone, the game loses its developing mythology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESF engines will not be implemented because game authors want science, not fiction. I agree with that, too. SF fooled us into thinking universe is something we can grasp. KSP is puling us away from such delusion. It really shows you how hard it is to travel around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMining is a cool idea, but it would have to be carefully developed. Explosives would be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew gas giant is planned, so far it\u0027s code name is gas giant #2. Krag\u0027s Planetary Factory has Sentar which has rings, check it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStorms would be a nice eye candy, as long as it\u0027s just eye candy.

Please read it in future before posting; it is there for a very good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExplosives might be useful, but as it stands I doubt they\u0027d be very much useful at all until a great deal of other things are implemented first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the struts, you really don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E them. Whackjob has figured out how to make standard struts work a lot better by combining them with girders, so that the connection will flex instead of just breaking. Basically, attach a small girder to either side of the connection point, then connect the open ends of the girders with a strut. But yes, I suppose stronger struts might be useful all the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot completely sure exactly what you mean by \u0022outposts\u0022...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, I don\u0027t think that kind of engine is really necessary.
