I excitedly went to one of the many science-equipped satellites I had in orbit in my (sandbox) saved game, and got a message along the lines of \u0022This data is useless with the R\u0026amp;D facility closed\u0022. This a very disheartening message, and at least for me is a break of immersion. This problem has only increased with the addition of contracts, which are also unavailable to sanbox mode players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth contracts and science have a place in sandbox mode. First of all, both funds and science can serve as a sort of numerical measure of your success. Science especially serves (for us roleplaying types at least) as a measure of your contributions to kerbal knowledge, and can be fun to obtain for its own sake. Furthermore, I like having contracts (especially with FinePrint installed) to give me ideas on what I can do next. However, as a veteran player, I find the tech tree annoying and often times I want to run before I walk in a new save (such as going straight to Jool without having landed on the Mun first). However, in career mode I usually must grind science and funds before I can do the type of massive missions that I want to do right from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo currently I have two options: play sandbox and be deprived of features, or play career and use save-editing/the debug menu to give myself funds and science when I need them (which feels like cheating). My proposed solution is this: give sandbox all the features of career mode, with one key difference: when you lanuch a ship that costs more funds than you have, you can launch it but your funds simply go negative. Likewise, you should be able to unlock tech tree node whenever you want by just having your science go negative. This lets sandbox players see if their space program would be successful in the long run, even if in the short run they may want to do some hideously expensive mission. Sandbox should have fewer \u003Cstrong\u003Elimitations\u003C/strong\u003E than career, not fewer \u003Cstrong\u003Efeatures\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR:\u003C/strong\u003E Sandbox should be just like career mode except your funds and science can go negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts/Ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T14:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it should have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a sandbox after all.
