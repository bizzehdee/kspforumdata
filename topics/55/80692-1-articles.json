These include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-a checkbox option for physical data, such as a goo container or surface sample, that when enabled causes an attempt to transmit it over the radio pop up a warning,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-the option to stack crew reports on top of each other, as is possible with EVA reports. A crew capsule can hold an unlimited number of EVA reports at once, provided each is from a different biome, but it can only hold one crew report, period. Given crew reports are apparently just a file folder, like EVAs, it seems like they ought to function the same, and should be possible to store limitlessly as long as you only get one per biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my two cents.
