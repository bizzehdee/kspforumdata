Mission Control. When you would click mission control (the building) it would bring you to a screen that says select server or create. When you would create a server it would give the option: Mission Control/Air Traffic Control, or astronaut/pilot. When you would click mission control, it would give you all the roles as mission control, CapCom,Flight Director,etc.When you would choose \u0027astronaut\u0027 you would select your seat. And I know what your saying. Time Warp! TimE wArp!? I have the solution. One of the Flight directors jobs would be to accept a time warp request. The astronaut would request a time warp, if The FD accepts, he can time warp, but the FD can stop the time warp at any time. This is my idea and a step foward to realism. If anyone suggests anything, or wants to add something just post it. I won\u0027t have any hard feelings if you dissagree with me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"42undead2","CreatedById":47664,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T14:10:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou still have to think, some people might be in the atmosphere or doing transfer burn to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn while others are out and about in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TADBTD","CreatedById":73888,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T14:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnly Ship at a time, but b capsule there maybe more than one seat.There mght be more than one ship launched, but one one can be controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LongHairedHuman","CreatedById":14396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T15:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think, rather than just plainly requesting a warp, you should request a warp-to-point. This way, you can always maximum-warp, and you don\u0027t have overshootings, and long transfers only take a bit longer. And just add an ETA, and notification for when a craft is about to reach it destination. This way, you can control multiple missions a bit more, without too much drama.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T15:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright guys, no matter how you propose it, multiplayer is still multiplayer.
