Maybe an option next in the tracking center to refuel any craft landed if they are landed next to the space port. (or maybe a some docking ports at near the start of the runway that SSTO craft can use. There would need to be a few at differnet hights and maybe some verticals ones that VTOL carfts can use.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EATM the only way to do this is to spawn a fuel tank on the run way with docking ports and they recover it when done. Which is a bit of a pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it would be nice it would be nice if you could colect science from any craft landed at or near the Space Port with out getting rid of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T18:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could recover the craft and launch it again.
