I sticky every thread that I like - no doubt some people would disagree with me, a lot of people would think that I was unfairly promoting stuff that I myself wanted rather than what the community as a whole wanted.. Yeah, one mod thinks it\u0027s a good idea - what makes their opinion any more important or valid than anyone elses?
