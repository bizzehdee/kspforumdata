What a cool game idea and good implementation of that idea. Me and my friends play together using a big 52\u0022 screen as the mission main monitor, it\u0027s extra taxing on weekdays when missions push it past 3 am. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Also, I appreciate the efforts in the Linux port since I\u0027m a Linux only guy. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS GAME!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this has been posted already, but here goes anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem in getting my space programs going is the vehicle editor, it\u0027s very cumbersome to work with. A few suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Abort detach with escape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sometimes when you accidentally left-click the wrong part it detaches and it is sometimes a real pain to stick it back in it\u0027s original spot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E When you have a node detached it would be helpful if you can press escape (or right click or whatever) to return it from where it was last detached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Grid snap (or similar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I use a mod for vertical snap now which helps a lot, but it would help if this was in all three dimensions. Not sure how this would be implemented, but\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E sometimes it\u0027s very hard to keep a vehicle symetrical when the symetry option doesn\u0027t help / work out for what you\u0027re doing. Snap to grid or something similar would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Undo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Probably not easy to implement, but would be very much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Show connections / part tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Some sort of skeleton lines with dots to show how the part tree is built would be nice. This ensures that you actually did connect something and that it\u0027s not just resting on top of another part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It would also be helpful to see where you have connection possibilities and where you have actually connected properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Remove the \u0022auto-symetry\u0022 feature. (consider this a bug?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Sometimes when I want to connect ONE part to another part that has been placed using symetry, the symetry count is automatically reset to the value used on the existing part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m not sure if this is a good description, but it disables the option of placing a single part using no symetry on parts that have been placed using symetry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Show stage total weight and thrust in the stage list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Pretty much what it says. Since the physics engine can calculate this, it shouldn\u0027t be any problem calculating this in the editor and putting it in there somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Part info on right click.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Just as in flight mode you can get some information on each part, maybe in the editor you could show things like weight, fuel info, thrust and if a part is included in an action group, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe frequent facepalming and trying to attach a part the way I want for 15 minutes is stealing time from all the cool missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re only on 0.21 (I think), I\u0027m hoping we will have a kick a** editor by the time we reach 1.0. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for taking time to read this in your otherwise busy schedule. As a sidenote, I hope you guys can make more money out of the continued development so it doesn\u0027t halt due to economic reasons. I wouldn\u0027t shy away from buying the game again if it would give me an improved editor. Consider making add-ons similar to those of games like Neverwinter Nights or have open donations for specific tasks / subprojects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/Spongie\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-27T16:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022spongie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022spongie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
