Whenever you start doing anything related to poles you get punished. Polar regions are where weird stuff happens, camera view directions change abruptly, Kerbals do strange things or even die. There are textures crack in polar regions. Using polar orbits, which are in fact rather convenient for interplanetary travel is made very inconvenient by lack of convenient viewing angles in map view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion the main reason is using polar coordinates to represent surface position which may seem convenient but for which poles and anything along the rotation axis is area of divergence and singularities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to replace representing surface position by two numbers in polar coordinates by using three numbers which represent point on unit sphere. This representation may seem a bit more complicated and may require slightly different math for handling but it is smooth and the only place where it has problems is in the center of the body which nobody should enter anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this system for surface coordinates would mean there will be no longer any problems with anything standing on the pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this system for camera views would mean there will be no more sudden direction changes around poles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing this system for texturing the ground would get rid of any cracks because the surface can be smoothly mapped to flat area in any region.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T14:19:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGiving a craft\u0027s landed position in latitude/longitude is all fine, really -- trying to get people to learn an entirely new coordinate system just to figure out how to get back to certain spots is going to be messy. However, at a deeper level, I think this sounds like a good idea... assuming, of course, it really is that simple. I have a tendency to suspect there\u0027re always going to be some unexpected results from any changes made, really.

I mean, they\u0027re designed to wrap around a sphere as best they can, obviously, but... yeah.

But that\u0027s not relevant to the problem in hand. The problem with surface cracks is IMO caused by some points being at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and some points at 360\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 which due to arithmetic errors do not fall onto exactly the same point. But with normal representation you don\u0027t have anything like that because you don\u0027t roll around something. There\u0027s no skip from 0 to 360 or -180 to 180 or -90 to \u002B90 on poles etc. It is smooth and arithmetically stable representation.

But since KSP uses several different textures for displaying various detail levels based on the distance from ground even this might not work perfectly as it would create visible single colored circle on the poles. So using same texture with changed projection (as rendering it would be rendered on equator) might do the trick. But hten you need smoth transition between this one and regular one. But it is doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for generating planetary terrain heightmaps use of single colored top/botom ege textures is a must.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut making camera freely rotate on all three axis and not be limited to polar coorinates would make KSP much better.
