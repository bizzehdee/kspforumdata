I assumed the Mk1-3 was named so because it would be the 3rd Mk command pod. Any time I thought of \u0022new parts\u0022, to my mind it meant \u0022more parts\u0022. Not replacing the old ones with new ones. Plenty of players wanted parts that looked sleeker and more polished, but I think there are plenty of us who did not. Even with the mesh switching, the rockets I\u0027ve seen this far all look pretty similar. Basically, something out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. One of the best things about this game is the vast difference in style from one player to the next. I love seeing other guys\u0027 screenshots, because their ships are always so different from mine. People liked to crack on the old Rockomax tanks, saying how ugly they were and constantly going on about the \u0022garbage found by the road\u0022 stuff, but that\u0027s really just looking at the part on its own. If you worked at your design, you could make ships that were really cool, asthetically appealing, and extremely Kerbal. To me that was always part of the fun of the game. You shouldn\u0027t just be able to throw\u00A0 parts together and have it look good. You should have to work at it. You should actually have to put some \u0022design\u0022 in your design. If you follow the Gameplay Questions forum, how many times have you seen someone ask what was the best way to do something, be given a perfectly good suggestion and say \u0022no, it wouldn\u0027t look right\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want cookie-cutter rockets. Take the new LEM, for instance. You want a lander? Okay, here\u0027s your lander. No, I want to build my own lander. The Mk1 Lander Can was no beauty, but I\u0027ve seen some pretty slick lander designs with it. I know they\u0027re trying to keep part-count down to make the game a bit easier on the average computer, but I prefer to build things myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe1.875 parts, on the other hand, are a great addition to the game IMO. The drop-down from 2.5m to 1.25m is a bit extreme. Having a middle option should help make for some smoother transitions. And since I often favor huge rockets, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll make use of the 5m tanks. For me, additional content is always welcome; but newer does not always mean better. I\u0027m not ready to throw away the past, and I suspect plenty of others aren\u0027t either. If there\u0027s enough outcry, hopefully they\u0027ll be fully reinstated.

I don\u0027t know if beginners really don\u0027t care about weight or not, as you said, but if you\u0027re saying it\u0027s harder to launch a lighter payload, I\u0027m not seeing the logic. I used the Mk1-2 for my Jool 5 and an Eve ascent vehicle precisely because it made things more difficult. They were not easy, and I\u0027m extremely proud of them. To me, light rockets are difficult when you get to the end of the spectrum. In other words, when you make it so small you\u0027re now pushing the boundaries of capability; like a \u0022low mass\u0022 challenge. Building a good, huge rocket can be just as difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t dislike the Mk1-3. And I don\u0027t mind the added functionality it has. Your \u0022top of the line\u0022 command pod\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have things the others don\u0027t. However, it should come at a cost. And not just funds. To me, this game is all about accomplishment. Even after a simple mission, seeing my chutes pop back at Kerbin always makes me feel good. It\u0027s something that sets this game apart. So if you wanna launch 3 Kerbals but save mass, it\u0027s going to cost you in looks and \u0022cool factor\u0022. You\u0027ll need some combination of smaller pods or passenger cabin or (God forbid) command seats in a fairing or service\u00A0 module. If you want 3 Kerbals all in one pod that looks cool, is extremely sturdy, and has more functionality, it\u0027ll cost you mass. It should be so heavy, in fact, that it makes you wonder whether or not it\u0027s worth it. Design decisions should not be easy. If you want this, it should cost you that, and so forth. So I\u0027m fine with the new pod, I just think it should be heavier. At least 4 tons. Make it a tough decision instead of a no-brainer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always though, this is just one guy\u0027s opinion. I doubt I\u0027M the only one, though. Others surely feel the same way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
