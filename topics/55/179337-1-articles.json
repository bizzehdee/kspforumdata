Now that Microsoft has confirmed developers will be able to update their games with this feature on a case by case basis, It seems this would be an expected\u00A0update to KSP enhanced edition. Do the developers even plan on supporting the XBox One playerbase in\u00A0this way? Or are we out of luck and just have to deal with the difficult controls?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a long time KSP fan, I really hope they do plan on a mouse and keyboard update, because I\u0027m not likely to return to KSP unless I can play it on Xbox without getting frustrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-28T22:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere will be no mouse and keyboard support, because the developers have disabled that feature entirely.
