Textures look horrible! ...? Oh, texture size set to \u0022half\u0022 by default. That\u0027s weird. I don\u0027t remember any other game trying to show me its worst on first launch. Usually, it\u0027s either set to best/close to best or it tries to predict optimal settings for particular rig.\n\n2. Let\u0027s fire up a tutorial, shall we? Ignoring all the insults thrown my way by the old geezer, let\u0027s build a simple rocket and... what just happened? It seems that tutorial... ended? I see a crapload of parts and I can continue to build things. Let\u0027s launch, just because we can... again, what? Game just quits into menu. I don\u0027t get it, let\u0027s launch the same tutorial again... WHAT??? Now I can\u0027t even select a pod. I\u0027m clicking on it but nothing happens. Also, I can\u0027t exit the tutorial now because all buttons in the top right corner are inactive. So, Alt-F4 (it\u0027s great that I know this key combination, not everyone does). Maybe I\u0027ll launch the game again.\n\n3. Screw bugged tutorials, I can build things myself, and launch, and go to the Moon or whatever... why are my things exploding? Overheat? No warnings? WAIT, WHAT? DEBUG MENU? I HAVE TO USE CHEATS JUST TO PLAY THE GAME? I\u0027d like to punch devs and QA in the face now, thank you very much.\n\nSeasoned player perspective:\n\n4. Confetti fairings look awful, don\u0027t support partial deployment and break things. If fairings, decoupler and next engine are in the same stage, engine doesn\u0027t activate.\n\n5. Any hope of stock wheel module handling multiple wheel colliders is lost. No rocker-bogie rover suspension for us. Medium and large landing gear don\u0027t even spin their wheels, which is kinda ridiculous.\n\n6. Dynamic lights do not cast shadows. Google \u0027deferred lighting\u0027, which is available in UnityPro. Dear Squad, you call it a \u0022Release\u0022 and you don\u0027t bother to spend 1500$ (it\u0027s a one-time payment)? No wonder Unity team doesn\u0027t help you to fix x64 issues - you\u0027re not their customer and they don\u0027t owe you anything.\n\n7. If it was 1.0 Release, [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-0-27-Apr-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29) wouldn\u0027t even exist. More so, most of it was updated right after \u0022release\u0022. By one person (Thanks, Claw!). What does it tell us about QA process?\n\n8. Kerbal professions are STILL linked to kerbal names. Seriously, Squad?\n\n9. Water still looks like crap. I remember Squad members saying that \u0022it\u0027s a placeholder\u0022. There may be no placeholders in proper release.\n\n10. Procedural Mun craters. It was a great addition to the game. Community loved it, as I recall. I\u0027m also recalling someone called HarvesteR saying that every planetary body will be revisited and improved at some point. Now, I\u0027m pretty sure that save-breaking updates (like changing height maps for planets) are off the table after release. I mean, usually. So, either Squad thinks that it\u0027s OK to break saves for people using the supposedly finished commercial product or there will be no more polish on planetary bodies. Which one is it?\n\n11. Sound FX are still somewhat bugged. If I\u0027m in a map view, I would either not hear engine sound at all, or hear it constantly but muffled. Loud stuttering puffs are certainly not the way to do it.\n\n12. Why is The Claw still available in one size only?\n\n13. Antennas are still retracting after transmission and get stuck retracted.\n\nNow, good things. New Big-Ass plane parts (do not pretend that you didn\u0027t expect it to be pronounced this way) are great. Engine thrust changing with air pressure is great and long-awaited for. ISRU is nice-looking, although it needs some work. Female kerbals... never thought they\u0027re much needed, I\u0027d better have sexless/androginous kerbals, but it\u0027s not a bad addition to the game, just the one I don\u0027t care much about. That\u0027s about it.\n\nPS One more thing I forgot because I\u0027m used to RemoteTech:\n\n14. Stock SAS SUCKS in any other than \u0022hold direction\u0022 mode. Try setting Mk1 pod with parachute to hold surface retrograde at reentry, and all it does is just... vibrating. Same for small satellites. It doesn\u0027t account for vehicle mass, multiple SAS sources make it go crazy, it overcompensates and tries to shake vessel apart. This abomination was introduced in 0.90 (the one and only beta release we\u0027ve got) and somehow is still alive.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T15:43:41Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by J.Random**"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:14:43Z","Content":"Although that was a pretty aggressive way to bring the message, it really has a good point.\n\n1.0 still has a few flaws, and I hope they fix it soon."},{"CreatedByName":"Moss","CreatedById":106413,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T11:18:13Z","Content":"I think the points you have made are interesting and relevant.

This is how the game has been forever and will never change. 1.0 wont make a newbie become a pro by walking him through how to build a rocket, get to space, orbit, to the moon, to the surface back to Kerbin, and back to the surface through re-entry. If a newbie wants to the creators for creating the game this hard then they should really research what this game is XD\n\n@4 the stage separation is very odd and could be done better. But I want to play around with it more before I really decide if how they did it hurts gameplay wise. Engine thing is something to fix though. I always disliked how the LV-N shroud came apart, the fairings are similar, but worse. Its something to work on, being able to choose how many parts or at least directions would help with more cramped designs. \n\n@6 Wait what dynamic lights are you talking about? \n\n@7 It says it was rushed. Not unexpected what so ever.\n\n@9 looks fine to me, doesn\u0027t lag the crap out of my game which is really the only thing that matters in a space game.\n\n@10 At this this point I would only believe this to happen in a future update where they add more planets, if they ever do such an update. It would be fitting to break saves at this point and move some of the planets around possibly. Otherwise oh well thrown out the window. \n\n@12 did they say they would give out different sizes? Smaller sizes don\u0027t seem very useful for any sort of asteroid handling as the crafts that could carry these are far to small and larger sizes aren\u0027t exactly necessary for the same task. The current size one isn\u0027t hurt gameplay wise by its size, so having a bigger one isn\u0027t exactly necessary to handle even the largest asteroids. More RCS and fuel would be more useful than a larger claw. \n\n@13 this one i have noticed for a while. I\u0027d throw it in the minor bug category that is even lessened by the fact i throw all my antennas into the cargo bays to stay retracted anyways haha."},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T12:35:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E @6 Wait what dynamic lights are you talking about?\n\nSuit headlamps and illuminators.

The devs promised A LOT of things that are not in the game and even promised to not waste time on other things that are or will be. That is what alpha games are about. I am quite sure that harvester planned on another game when he first started coding and know that I imagined it to be very different when I first backed this game with my money. \n\nI have been very disappointed with quite a few things about ksp and that made me realize that I can\u0027t complain. This is not my game, I just financed it with nothing else than the endresult (whatever it may be) for me to play.

We are never told how in the mindless and brief tutorial.\n\nc - even if you can access the debug menu, like myself, i still can\u0027t find temperature data to save my life.\n\nHonestly, if i\u0027ve paid for the game, I have a right to complain when certain features are a complete letdown. I also have a right to not candy-coat it, in the hopes that one day a dev might stumble upon constructive criticism and actually do something, instead of releasing junk like this.\n\nFor #12, you\u0027re completely missing the point. Oh sure, we don\u0027t NEED a bigger claw, just like we don\u0027t NEED bigger landing gear. But you are alienating anybody who wants to build a large ship with visually pleasing, appropriately sized components. Why not just make one set of parts if only half the components are going to be available in a given size.\n\n1.0 was completely broken compared to .90 - which is fairly unprecedented. At least .90 was playable, didn\u0027t require hot fixes just to access the game.\n\nWhile we\u0027re at it - The introduction to a new player is not good. They don\u0027t even tell you which building is which beyond simply saying, \u0022here you are, you build stuff in the VAB\u0022 (without indicating it). So a new user has like 8 institutions with no idea how any of them are relevant to the gameplay let alone what buildings you should be upgrading, or which research you should unlock based on your desired contracts or playstyle.\n\nConsider this, \n\nI start a new game, on \u0022easy/normal/whatever the default is\u0022. I right click on the ship building facility, and upgrade it! Voila, i\u0027m now completely broke, not enough funds to do any contracts and either have to find my way to an emergency loan, or restart the game. \n\nSo I start a new game. I right click on the research building, upgrade that.. Voila, i\u0027m now completely broke again, not enough funds to do any contracts and either have to find my way to an emergency loan, or restart the game. \n\nSo I start a new game. I build three or four giant rockets, run out of money.. Voila, i\u0027m now completely broke, not enough funds to do any contracts and either have to find my way to an emergency loan, or restart the game. \n\nSo I start a new game. I don\u0027t upgrade, I don\u0027t build large junk. I finally make it part way to space, and parts start exploding, with no discernible reason why. I guess it must be aero - So i\u0027ll build my craft a little slower - it\u0027d be nice to have a Dv readout, but you need mods even if you want to know where you can go in this game. Real cool. So I lauch this craft, and it still blows up.. Too fast again. I try to build a third craft and.. Voila, i\u0027m now completely broke, not enough funds to do any contracts and either have to find my way to an emergency loan, or restart the game. \n\nWow, this is some tedious trial and error stuff. You\u0027d better jump online and find someone who\u0027s been around before .23 who can give you some actual advice on progressing in this game. That\u0027s some real genuine gameplay right there. A new player needs 10x the funds that the custom slider will even allow. 10-50m funds would be a \u0022start\u0022\n\nIt has literally nothing to do with them making a \u0022hard\u0022 game. They had a very logical and fluent system before they integrated career mode. It seems like they continued to tack bad ideas on top of bad ideas, to try to make something fun come from career mode. There have been threads on how to make the system more \u0022game like\u0022 - whereby the game gets harder as you go, unlike now, where it starts exceptionally difficult and then becomes easier. That is completely asinine video game design. The difficulty hasn\u0027t particularly changed since .16 - but they\u0027ve put in SO MANY barriers to having a fun experience that you feel in control of, that it\u0027s next to impossible to play a vanilla career mode, unless ofc you enjoy grinding out pointless contracts, littering space with garbage. \n\nHonestly the community has been very pleasant and forgiving.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T02:21:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb**\n  \nMade somewhat more pleasant"}]}
