The first and last of these make sense, but it seems strange that I can completely obliterate all of a craft\u0027s parts without a trace. Instead, I think that it would make sense for it to be replaced with a \u0022decommission\u0022 button, which would represent the KSP giving up entirely on maintaining a mission. The craft would turn into debris, and any kerbals inside would be considered KIA. When currency is implemented, this would also stop the costs of upkeep for the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T20:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould you not just re-name it as \u0022Decommissioned\u0022, assign it the debris symbol (can\u0027t remember if that\u0027s an option) and ignore it from then on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T20:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou CAN manually set it as Debris currently via the Rename function.
