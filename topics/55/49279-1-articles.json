However, there is no easy way to determine which biome you\u0027re in, like \u0022Splashed down at Kerbin\u0027s Shores\u0022 or \u0022Low orbit over the Mun\u0027s Poles\u0022, short of rightclicking on a part that\u0027s biome sensitive and asking for a report. This rapidly gets very tedious, as I learned while trying to get EVA reports from a polar orbit around the Mun. Now, a lot of the biomes are easy to spot, like Kerbin\u0027s Waters and the big craters on the Mun, but some, like Kerbin\u0027s Shores, are very much blink and you missed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose is that there be some readout, possibly in a collapsible Science menu, that tells you something like \u0022You are now in X biome, at Y altitude.\u0022 This would make it much easier to tell where one science situation ends and another begins, which is especially important for the small, narrowly defined biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, it would nice to be able to generate an in-game biome map that can tell you which biome is which when moused over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have anything to add, change, or criticize about this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garm","CreatedById":67179,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T21:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about another scientific module for that purpose?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T21:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer to see it integrated into a general science control panel for the ship rather than be yet another part to drag around.
