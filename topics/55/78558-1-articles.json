What do you think?\u003Cp\u003EFalange: I wanted it sometimes, and I un-wanted it other times. In the end, it takes away a gameplay element because it takes some of the guesswork and some of the trial and error and figuring out for yourself what the delta-V is. It might take some of the magic away. One of the great things about KSP is doing just what Chad was doing just now [Editor\u0027s note: this was Thursday afternoon, and Chad Jenkins was in the process of livesteaming his creation of a flying rocket-powered surfboard, killing two-dozen Kerbals in the process]. That ridiculous contraption he was doing, just trying to see if he could make it to the water, just shooting it on a rocket. If you make it too technical, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s certainly possible to calculate it. But it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s like giving the answer to a puzzle sometimes, and I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if we want that. The same applies to showing how much burn time you have remaining. I think there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s always this element of tension of trying to calculate in your head how much fuel you have left and if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to make it. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s like filling out the crossword puzzle for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T07:29:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game already has delta-v and TWR indicators \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 they\u0027re just a bit hard to read in the stock game.
