Besides, I completely like the idea of kerbals being of no ***. But it just isn\u0027t so, considering e.g. thst Von Herman or whatever his name his in the sci building. He has mustache, and that is a obvious masculine trait. And no, it cannot be a sexless kerbal \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith mustaches, because it is a human masculine trait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, I really love this game and this, but believe it or not, in this state it is sexist, even if unintended. And please, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t put them in pink dresses or give em make up, just a nice subtle approach to this issue would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T22:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWho says Mustaches are only trait of Male Kerbals?
