However, when in (especially low) orbit, it is nearly impossible to switch the view back to whatever craft you are currently flying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProposed fix: create a toolbar UI (yes, stock toolbar) button that opens up a drop-down menu of celestial bodies, and then you can click the one your craft is orbiting. That then drops down a second menu with a list of the crafts orbiting it. Double clicking should then switch your camera focus to the vessel in question. The craft you are currently flying should be displayed at the top of this list, or even at the top of the planetary bodies list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T00:50:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBackspace\u003C/a\u003E may be your new best friend. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBackspace: Reset focus in orbital map\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would still be nice to have a list of all vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T01:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Master Tao\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Master Tao\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Key_bindings\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBackspace\u003C/a\u003E may be your new best friend. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to marry mine.
