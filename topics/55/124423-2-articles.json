Air breathing engines have had issues for a while now. As \u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138338?p=2275726\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2275726\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecantab said\u003C/a\u003E, weight is a problem for these engines. To be balanced well with the rest of the game, air breathing engines have to be heavy, but as they exist only as nozzles, their mass is unrealistically far back in the craft, causing handling issues. Squad remedied this by placing the part\u0027s CoM outside of the part\u0027s model, but this is only a bandage on the underlying issue, giving us weird non-intuitive, non-physical behaviour, such as placing a nozzle on the back of a rover to make it tip forwards. The non-colliding jet engine model is a step in the right direction, bandaging the non-intuitiveness of the CoM shift, but I think it can be brought further, given development time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to the criticisms about preventing VTOL, short craft and counterweight uses, I believe that these are indications of niches that are currently missing parts and being hackily filled by the current odd behaviour. Tiltable engines, rotatable nozzles, short lifting fans and counterweights should be added, rather than preserving a hack for the hacks built using it. Example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/toeW29I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022toeW29I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current solution still leaves non-physical oddities, lacking a collision mesh and clipping through fuel. Given additional development time, the best solution to all of these issues is the one \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138338?p=2275593\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2275593\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edescribed by Kordolius\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138338?p=2275724\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post2275724\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eand Frozen_Heart\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. We already have intakes which are separate from the engines, using invisible internal piping. Separating nozzles from the turbine is the next logical step. It allows many more real-life design opportunities, such as running multiple nozzles from a single engine, placing thrust off-line with engine mass, removes the need for part clipping through fuel, and actively encourages stable aircraft and VTOL design by making engine mass placement an explicit choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/F-35B_Joint_Strike_Fighter_%28thrust_vectoring_nozzle_and_lift_fan%29.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022F-35B_Joint_Strike_Fighter_%28thrust_vectoring_nozzle_and_lift_fan%29.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-04T16:33:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2015 04:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pizzaoverhead\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
