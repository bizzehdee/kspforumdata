Since KSP is pretty old by now, so it doesn\u2019t use newest optimization techniques. Phones are getting more powerful as the time comes by, so maybe, using some heave optimization it will be possible to at least partially remake KSP for mobile. Since Gen Z is consuming most of it\u2019s content via phones, making a mobile KSP will give a great source of new players for KSP 2 and possibly KSP 1. I also had a pretty good idea for game to be free to download, but having only career mode avalible, so you will have to pay for these two features:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreative mode\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechjeb like addon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do are your thoughts on this topic?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-06T20:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few points from me\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. There is no way you can optimise all the physics and calculations to run well on a mobile, or in a way that the battery lasts long enough to do even a short mission. If you want an example of how trying to port KSP 1 to anything other than PC would end up, look no further than the console version of KSP 1, which runs poorly and has an unintuitive control scheme to boot. The control scheme is another thing, I don\u0027t anticipate there being any possible way to elegantly control the interface using just finger gestures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. Freemium is a bad idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC. You\u0027re suggesting porting a game to mobile with the implied idea that they can play on it for a few minutes while they\u0027re not busy or waiting for a bus, despite that being inherently contradictory to the dedication and time KSP 1/2 demands for missions of any length or ambition. Despite Squad and its partners making an absolute pig\u0027s ear out of KSP 1 Enhanced Edition, at least it fundamentally made sense given that you can sit in front of a console for a few hours and that there\u0027s an additional audience that it introduces to KSP. The type of audience you want to introduce to KSP, even if they had a mobile device capable of a bearable fps and battery lifespan, would probably be turned completely off by needing a substantial amount of time to learn the ropes or pull off any kind of mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-06T20:46:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2023 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 6\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Bej Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerballlistic07","CreatedById":225447,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-07T01:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think an iPad version is\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ewell\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0overdue.
