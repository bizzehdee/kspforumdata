As seen in another mod, Kerbal Foundaries, I know it is possible to link the parts via groups and have them all set to the same value when applied. Only one part in the group has to be configured and when you apply to group, it applies the same setting to all the parts in the group. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, is an amazing benefit in Kerbal Foundries. I feel that this functionality should be applied for all stock engines. Right now the slider is not accurate enough to match the thrusts quickly. I would love to be able to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EConfigure Engine\\part values via direct number entry\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EApply the value to a predetermined group set on the part\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBe able to reconfigure the groupings on the fly\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would make the values and adjustments so much more enjoyable (and simple)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
