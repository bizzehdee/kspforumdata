If implemented, I would like to be able to see the launchtower from inside the VAB as well though, if at all possible, for consistency - in fact, could make that clickable as well to enable/disable use of the tower so you don\u0027t need to exit VAB before launching just to set/unset the tower.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess adding a checkbox somewhere that we click, or a question pop-up, when we click the launch button could work too.. but having that extra action for every launch if you happen to be predominantly of the non-default persuasion might get annoying quickly... so to me seems like the least preferable solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would probably need to have some cost associated with it too: launch towers get damaged every launch, even if just getting the paintjob scorched.

This would also correspond to costs, so having a large rocket means you need a larger upfront cost to hold it on the launch pad. It could get more complecated, but the Launch Clamps are todays launch tower.
