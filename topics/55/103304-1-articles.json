Among other things, like designing small rockets and experimenting with SSTO vessels, i want to mess with gravitational assists for interplanetary travels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that, it is really a must increasing patched conics limit and sometimes it is easier to see the trayectory with other draw modes. But when not needed there is no reason to have limit at 4 or 5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that it would be very useful to have the chance to easily change those two variables in-game, without having to restart the game. I dont know if there is already that option (never heard about it) or if it very hard to do. I understand some loading time may be needed to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this has already been suggested, or there is a way to do it manually without closing and restarting, just tell me!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and regards!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:06:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-90-0-Precise-Node-1-1-2-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/a\u003E, it includes an UI to change the conics mode, and will allow you to save much more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:32:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ilo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ilo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-90-0-Precise-Node-1-1-2-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/a\u003E, it includes an UI to change the conics mode, and will allow you to save much more fuel.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the mean time, yes, he could use a mod.
