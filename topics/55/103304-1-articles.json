Among other things, like designing small rockets and experimenting with SSTO vessels, i want to mess with gravitational assists for interplanetary travels.\n\nFor that, it is really a must increasing patched conics limit and sometimes it is easier to see the trayectory with other draw modes. But when not needed there is no reason to have limit at 4 or 5.\n\nMy suggestion is that it would be very useful to have the chance to easily change those two variables in-game, without having to restart the game. I dont know if there is already that option (never heard about it) or if it very hard to do. I understand some loading time may be needed to change.\n\nMaybe this has already been suggested, or there is a way to do it manually without closing and restarting, just tell me!\n\nThanks and regards!"},{"CreatedByName":"ilo","CreatedById":130783,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:06:28Z","Content":"Try [PreciseNode](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-90-0-Precise-Node-1-1-2-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes), it includes an UI to change the conics mode, and will allow you to save much more fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T09:45:13Z","Content":"I support this suggestion."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:32:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try [PreciseNode](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/47863-0-90-0-Precise-Node-1-1-2-Precisely-edit-your-maneuver-nodes), it includes an UI to change the conics mode, and will allow you to save much more fuel.\n\nIn the mean time, yes, he could use a mod.
