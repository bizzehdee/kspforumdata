Clicking \u0022Warp to\u0022 would warp vehicle to the point on this trajectory (assuming trajectory doesnt pass through atmospheres or planets/moons etc...). I think this should be possible since the way KSP works when on rails is by calculating positions at time t rather than integrating. Thus, the points before the desired point need not be simulated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way i see it, there are a few main advantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) This ability would make transfers to Jool (and the additional gas giant planets when they are added) instantaneous; at present, even using 100,000x takes a few minutes of real-life time to get out there, and I assume the dev\u0027s dont want to add a 1,000,000x button...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) It would make time-warping past maneuver nodes easily avoidable (instead of manually time-warping to a maneuver node, you simply click on a point sufficiently before the node, and click \u0022warp to\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) It would allow SOI changes to not lose precision (since current patched-conic values would be used exactly)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-28T07:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2014 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T12:52:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a neat idea.
