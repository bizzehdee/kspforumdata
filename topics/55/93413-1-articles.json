Building upgrades are too expensive (and the first two tiers are way uglier than the barn, TBH), and the gizmos really aren\u0027t as cool as they were made out to be. The best part is the new part sorting system, which is kind of sad.

Sure, it takes a lot more attention to pilot it well, but once you do it, your scientist/engineer will immediately have 1 star. It\u0027s only in bigger ships that aren\u0027t easy to control where it can become a problem without SAS.

All that does is makes one class of Kerbal absolutely necessary at a time when one of the other two classes (Scientist) is far more critical. It\u0027s not a fair trade-off for less experienced players, it\u0027s literally saying \u0022you either put a Pilot in your craft or you will not go to space today\u0022. That\u0027s bad design, plain and simple. More to the point, as it stands there are zero benefits to putting a Scientist or Engineer on board before they get to rank 1, so why does the Pilot class deserve to have such an overbearing and essential role right from the get-go?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it makes more sense that the Kerbals themselves have \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E to do with the ship that THEY are supposedly flying! And it\u0027s not too far off from reality. In the early days of NASA, all crew were pilots. Even the space shuttle required a manned landing.
