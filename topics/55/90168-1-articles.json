Upon selecting it in the VAB/SPH, it would show a preview of the control surface at maximum deflection in a highlight/see-through style. This would be shown whenever the tweak palette is open. Alternately a the standard method of animating parts in the VAB/SPH may work. As long as the part returns to the default deflection when the tweak palette closes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously wording is an issue for left/right/diagonal cases, but up/down may be good enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speedbrake function would activate along with the wheel brakes by pressing \u0027B\u0027 or through the GUI. It would be interesting if they deployed faster than current control surface deflection rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a functional standpoint, it would be the same as setting maximum trim for that control surface.

In your image above, that configuration would most certainly modify lift because the surfaces are not equal size and not in the same positions. The best way to be certain they do not is to have symmetrical deployment and positioned in a place where they would not alter the lifting properties of the wing.
