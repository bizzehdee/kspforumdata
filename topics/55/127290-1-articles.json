It could be implemented as an action group action available for the larger tanks, or as a surface mount part that destroys the part it is attached to. A demolition charge part could also be used as an advanced decoupler for more complex designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome kind of debris parts would also be a great addition to the game, could have a few different sizes that are spawned when a part is destroyed and larger pieces can break into smaller pieces (down to a limit to prevent too much lag).
