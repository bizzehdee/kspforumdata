I\u0027d also question why the camera is 340m away from parts that are either exploding or otherwise making a noise (firing engines). Would be pretty neat to have as a mod (and it already is), but I think it wouldn\u0027t be that big of an improvement to be worth development time. Aside from the fringe cases where it\u0027d be A, noticeable and B, pretty awesome, I can only see people asking why their sound is slightly behind the audio. And by slightly, I mean like 1/4 of a second or less. Noticeable, but only just.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
