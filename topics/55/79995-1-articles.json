If this sounds like Planet Factory, I think that mod\u0027s Sentar was made to imitate all known info about GP2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoons-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEeloo - Craft orbiting Eeloo would get a free trip to GP2. Therefore, I don\u0027t really like the idea of putting Eeloo into orbit around GP2. Perhaps Eeloo (where it is now) could be replaced with an identically sized, identically scienced, but visually different planet with similar terrain, while Eeloo itself could be rescaled into an orbit around GP2. This would seem very unrealistic to craft orbiting Eeloo, however, for the planet to change suddenly. So, even better, Eeloo could stay where it is now, and a \u0022fraternal twin\u0022 icy moon could go around GP2. This would be invalidated, of course, if GP2 did not go into \u0022old\u0022 Career/Science saves. I see that Eeloo will have geysers, which would be great if it is the innermost moon. It makes perfect sense - I believe that the real life Io has its volcanoes due to tidal forces upon it from Jupiter. By the way, Laythe would need something too to matc, being Jool\u0027s innermost moon, although I don\u0027t think that the concept of making Laythe dangerous is a very good idea. Maybe a little dangerous, but not too dangerous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaphy - Not much detail to this description, but I would think the \u0022fluff\u0022 should cause just a little bit of sinking of landing legs and cause liftoff to be a bit difficult for a few seconds after ignition. Sounds like a bit of mystery to me. Maybe it could be the extra-Kerbinian orgin of the Mystery Goo found by the side of the road. (not suggesting aliens, I\u0027m saying that goo could have been transported to Kerbin via an impact event like Mars meteorites on Earth. Maybe it would explain why Daphy is so small - the impact broke it up. In the rings sounds like a great idea. By the way, to go with the \u0022broke up\u0022 idea, how about some of the other tiny moons should go into orbits nearby. Maybe even a tiny \u0022moon of a moon\u0022 a bit like the Magic Boulder. Maybe even a \u0022binary moon\u0022 system - two moons with a relatively small mass difference orbiting each other a la a captured-asteroid scaled version of Pluto and Charon. After all, the wiki says that GP2 should have at least 20 smaller moons, so why not put them here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotatus - Sounds like a good plan. If it rotates very fast as the wiki says it will, it should have biomes, so you get more science from the equator than the poles. There should also be mountains between the poles and the equator to make roving a bit more difficult and encourage (attempted) landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFonso - Oh, this sounds great. If you didn\u0027t know, this would be a moon 300km across (I guess that means 150km radius, which is a bit bigger than Dres\u0027 138km or Ikes\u0027 130km. If they mean 300km RADIUS, which it doesn\u0027t sound like, the size will be more like the 320km Duna.) Anyways, the moon will have a 2atm atmosphere (compare to Eve\u0027s 5atm at surface) and peaks stretching above the atmosphere. In my opinion, the largest peaks should have some ridges on the way down that require careful navigation by rover to avoid them to give getting down into the atmosphere a bit of difficulty. Not too difficult, however. I\u0027d like to see an Eve-like surface (but still a transparent atmosphere) with lakes of methane like the Saturn\u0027s real moon Titan or KSP\u0027s Eve (although I would like smaller oceans than Eve, more like lakes.) I also would like an orangish color. In Planet Factory, the equivalent (Skelton) looks a lot like Duna and has the same radius, but I wouldn\u0027t want to see a Dunar clone, especially with a thick atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for my own original ideas-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy moon ideas-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPuff - This would be a moon that is very dense, but small, giving it a high surface gravity. It would have a thick atmosphere at the surface - maybe thicker than Eve - but the scale height would rapidly thin this, although the outer atmosphere would extend high up. The surface would be essentially flat, with slow and rolling hills. Everything is crushed down in Puff\u0027s gravity - as I said before, even the atmosphere itself is. Despite its distance from Kerbol, Puff would be rather \u0022warm.\u0022 The thick blanket of gas around Puff is also a very effective greenhouse gas, allowing Puff to hover just under 0 Celsius.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESynco - This would be a small (Minmus-sized) moon in a perfect synchronous (stationary) orbit. Whether it is an inner or outer moon will depend on GP2\u0027s rotation speed. It would be highly reflective, making it visible from just above the clouds of GP2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBorealis and Australis - Two Gilly-sized moons in a precarious dance around GP2. Borealis has a highly elliptical orbit with apoapsis over GP2\u0027s north pole, while Australis has a nearly identical orbit with apoapsis over GP2\u0027s south pole. This means they stay over their namesake poles, hence their names. They have identical orbital periods, but are timed precisely - Borealis will be passing apoapsis over the north pole while Australis makes its close approach below, and Australis will be passing apoapsis over the South Pole while Borealis makes its close approach below. The moons themselves would appear as giant ice chunks, like Minmus. However, as I said before, scale and mass would resemble Gilly. The two moons would have subtle differences - most notably, Borealis will have a tall peak on its own north pole, while Australis will have a tall peak on its own south pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarve - This moon would be about the size of Kerbin\u0027s Mun. It would have a thin atmosphere about 5km high. But wait... why am I on the surface, but I\u0027m still 5km up? Well, that\u0027s because the atmosphere is actually 10km high and very thick at the bottom - while most of the atmosphere is light gas, some of the mixture it is heavy and sinks. So where does it sink to? A 5km deep canyon that follows the equator. How do I aerobrake? Simple, put yourself in an equatorial orbit and fly into the 5km deep, narrow canyon that goes around the whole equator. The canyon would be a valuable, science-rich biome, but you would have to descend into the final km, going from a Duna-like thin atmosphere to the thick, dense fog in the bottom of the canyon. Oh, and the canyon also puts you much, much closer to the moon\u0027s relatively strong gravity. Make sure your chutes don\u0027t break as you go from barely any atmosphere to Eve-like thickness, and make sure you aim for the center of the canyon, or else you might find yourself tumbling down a cliff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENon-moon ideas-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERings - The rings will, I imagine, almost certainly not be made of asteroids or anything else. That would be way too laggy. It would just be drawn on. However, I suggest maybe giving the ring a more broken-up appeareance as you get closer. I also think the ring should produce the occasional asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVortices - Short-lived hurricanes on GP2 that last for a few days. Skim the atmosphere and you might get some extra science! But don\u0027t get too low - Kerbal scientists think that the Kraken living below is hungry when he whips up a storm!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do you like my series of ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T17:02:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad has not promised GP2, Nova planned it and is no longer a dev. nothing has been confirmed or denied for certain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: also of note, I advise against using the community run wiki as evidence for facts. the wiki you linked to has no affiliation with squad, and the \u0022planned features\u0022 listed within aforementioned wiki are also not indicative of squads future plans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-29T17:19:47Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2014 05:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efun facts.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T17:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESquad has not promised GP2, Nova planned it and is no longer a dev. nothing has been confirmed or denied for certain\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunate but true.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T17:15:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThose are some interesting ideas nonetheless.

If Laythe existed in real life (in comparison to jool), there would be massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions around the moon, not to mention the radiation that bombards Laythe\u0027s atmosphere and land. Underwater will be safe, but in orbit, 2 minutes outside your ship and you\u0027re dead. There would also be massive auroras all over Laythe considering its thick atmosphere. Even though the presence of oxygen in the atmosphere hints to possible photosynthetic life floating in the oceans, they float near or on the water\u0027s surface. Which means that they would all be killed by radiation. The volcanoes will do the rest to poison the atmosphere. On the ocean floor, chemosynthesis is possible but who knows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, Eeloo HAS been planned by the developers to be relocated to orbit GP2 when they release it. When the debs released Eeloo, it was at first only meant to test the feasibility of 3:2 resonances like Neptune and Pluto.
