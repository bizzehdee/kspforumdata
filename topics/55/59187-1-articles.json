That was not my intention, but it just worked out that way. However, I feel it would better suit medium size space vehicles. There could perhaps even be a smaller variant, one third the size of the Gigantor, though that would be fairly similar to the 2x3 panel, just oriented length-ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might even be practical to make it a packed unit like the SP-L and SP-W that would fit snugly on modules like the Storage Container as shown above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zero266","CreatedById":42044,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T18:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second this notion\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T18:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatKerbal","CreatedById":98809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T18:51:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what your getting at (Sorry) But i\u0027ll support but still please explain it to me (Sorry)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dreadwave21","CreatedById":73680,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also support\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this too, it\u0027d be nice to have a middle ground. Although, really, what we need is more things to actually drain power, there aren\u0027t many occasions when you need more than a couple of OX-4Ws, unless you\u0027re transmitting a lot, or using ion drives.

I would also say we need some true gigantor panels for stations. ISS style. Not quite Balka Solar Wing size, but at least twice the size of Gigantors. There used to be a mod that had these. They were amazing for station aesthetics. And yes, we really do need more stuff that draws power. Two gigantors will run an ion drive no matter how far out you go. We need more reason to use them! Though, if you have kethane, you get plenty use out of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
