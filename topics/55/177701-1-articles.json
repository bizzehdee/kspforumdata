I forget exactly what the issue was, maybe it was lag, maybe it was vessel fragility, or whatever, but whatever it was, it was fixed by making parts on the same vessel unable to collide with each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently the problem was worse than the solution, and the clipping won\u0027t show up if you have designed your vessel properly (autostruts, normal struts, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
