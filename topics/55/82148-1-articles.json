Each celestial in orbit around this primary body which has a significant gravitational pull will also have a sphere of influence, though its own orbit is influenced by the gravity of the object it is orbiting.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I would like to discuss other options for orbital mechanics and what advantages or disadvantages they have, what complexities in programming they present, how they will affect gameplay, and in what scenarios they function best or worst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea I had in mind was that all celestials(stars/planets/moons) could be placed on permanent rails but have gravity simulated from all relevant bodies onto your craft(s) and onto the random asteroids. For example, a ship in orbit around Kerbin would be tugged by Kerbin, M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, Minmus, and the sun, but would not be tugged by other planets. If it got outside of Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence (SOI), it would be tugged by the major planets Moho, Eve, Kerbin, Duna, and Jool, but not by any moons, nor by the minor planets Dres and Eeloo. Now each SOI would have a greater sphere of secondary influence around it, in which you would be affected by its gravity as well as by the other things near you, but it would not alter the other things affecting you. This would cause you to be affected by the gravity of Dres or Eeloo while in interplanetary space if you are close enough to them, or also by Eve or Duna while around Kerbin when they transit close enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterested in hearing all your thoughts, guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T02:16:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m certainly thinking there should be a threshold of gravitational forces below which they shouldn\u0027t count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the planets pass close enough to each other to create enough force to pass this threshold. In fact, I don\u0027t think the pull of Minmus even passes this threshold when you are in orbit of the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, each object should have a range of gravity but those ranges should overlap. I would generally also put a cap on even considering the possibility of 8 objects of influence at a time, since it\u0027s very unlikely that you would enter the field of 8 objects, and putting a cap on it would greatly simplify things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T03:33:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eintegrate all the things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust dont complain when the kracken hurls your homeworld on an escape trajectory into the universe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yoha","CreatedById":108392,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T07:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is not worth the trouble.
