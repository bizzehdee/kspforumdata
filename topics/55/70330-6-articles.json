To them, proposing something prim and proper like a NASA VAB could be built by Kerbals is ridiculous. Well, I disagree. Take a good look at the parts: at the LV-N engine, at 3-man pod, at the landing legs, at ion engine. Those are cleanly executed pieces of impressive technology. Kerbals are indifferent to safety precautions and are very excited about explosions, yes, but they make an impression of extremely capable and very competent engineers.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenius is not the same as accuracy and fastidiousness, a mark 1 design can use parts, physics and designs never heard of before. It can be half the weight and twice as efficient as the old engine, it can also have a 10% of blowing up. The Kerbal way is to use it before the blowing up problem is totally fixed. They are very good engineers they just don\u0027t quite care so much about safety records.

The reason I feel that it is important is that seeing the numbers gives you a little bit of understanding of what you are actually doing.

It might be closer to compensating for lack of some concerns (like full-scale ground testing or ability to calculate and execute your delta v budget with high precision) with some other things like learning from failed flight tests or building slightly overpowered crafts. And here is the thing: learning on the flight and compensating for what you can\u0027t do perfectly at this point with something you have already mastered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Orbiter it\u0027s difficult to start - you can\u0027t do much without learning that control layout and even then, if you are not expert at flight sims, you\u0027ll find yourself in the situation \u0022how the hell is this thing supposed to lead me to the runway???\u0022 I relatively easily (with the help of the instructions and tutorials) got how to get to Moon and Mars and even land on the pads (of course, that Delta-Glider packs quite some delta v), but I still wasn\u0027t able to land that thing on the Earth properly. It gives you highly detailed spacecraft, but it also locks you with a predefined craft with predefined capabilities (that you should learn and master) and predefined situation to execute your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is much more free at the beginner level: you are shown how to assemble a primitive rocket and what buttons to press in flight and... that\u0027s all you need to start! When you get some basics you understand where you can go next and can guess what you have to upgrade and gradually learn by trial and error (just don\u0027t attempt to go to Jool straight away). Also, the simple and intuitive interface means that once you have idea what you want to do it\u0027s pretty easy to figure that by some minimal amount of trial and error and maybe just couple slight tips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, having some extra numbers for better performance is good, just don\u0027t turn KSP into \u0022have this number on this display and press tis button to engage autopilot\u0022.
