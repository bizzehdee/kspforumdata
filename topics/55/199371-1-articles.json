Remember that the key requirement for fully parallelizing software tasks is that they have no dependencies.

With the current stop-everything-and-wait approach, this works as expected, because the in-motion crafts are saved to disk and then\u00A0loaded into the space center scene with the same positions and velocities they had before (though this scenario would already suffer from\u00A0some hiccups\u00A0with atmospheric drag and physics distance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith an attempted parallel loading system, it could depend on how long ago the game started loading the space center; if it began\u00A0before the burn (not completely crazy if it currently takes you \u003Cem\u003E45 seconds\u003C/em\u003E to load a scene), then when you switch to the already-loaded space center scene, the craft in orbit might effectively have its de-orbit burn \u0022un-done\u0022, because it had not happened yet when the space center scene was loading and needed to know about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere might be better examples;\u00A0this was just the first thing I thought of.
