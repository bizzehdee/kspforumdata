After extensively testing some base modules on the runway at KSC and deeming them fit for use (tests included the ability of a Kerbal to get into and out of these bases), I\u0027ve now found that I can\u0027t get anyone out of them. I thought perhaps the ladders I\u0027d placed were the root of the problem. Nope, the ladders are fine, hence my deeming of fitness from my tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/ebRSKOg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ebRSKOg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ebRSKOg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it turns out that the ground is the culprit.

I\u0027ve found this happening on Mun, Minmus, and even Kerbin (excluding the runway, apparently \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E), so it\u0027s a good bet that it\u0027s also going to happen to the base module that I\u0027ve already put on Duna, which fortunately is unoccupied at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I know it\u0027s the ground? I got a test base, turned on hack gravity, and a Kerbal was able to escape once the base floated up a bit from the launch pad, even just a tiny bit further above the ground than the legs permit. Ugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis shouldn\u0027t happen. Those modules have more than enough room for Kerbals to wander around beneath them, so the hatch obstruction distance needs to be reduced so that things things a metre and a half away don\u0027t actually interfere when they blatantly shouldn\u0027t be doing so. Could this happen, please?
