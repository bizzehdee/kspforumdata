I\u0027d like to be able to right-click a part and click \u0022Hide\u0022, which would make it (and any of its symmetric siblings) transparent (so you can see behind it) and prevent anything from snapping to it.\n\nIn today\u0027s world, I can detach the part and then put it back afterward, but then I have to deal with getting everything lined up properly again."}]}
