Just by reading the OP\u0027s title I started thinking of buttons near the warp arrows.\n\nAlthough it\u0027s a nice idea, I feel many would complain about having a button that did X, and not a button that did Y. A lot of games have a clutter of icons that will do things you\u0027ll only need every so often, and that just take space and complicate things.\n\nI like KSP because it\u0027s very straight forward in the way it looks, with the right amount of minimalism.

Ground bases may want to get solar power. A landed ship may want to lift off to the East (into the sun) at local dawn.

Not quick or simple to implement.\n\nMy opinion remains, I think it would go against the simplicity the developers want for the ui and the controls"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T16:13:43Z","Content":"If this were implemented as a mod, it would work quite well as a KAC update, I\u0027ll give it a stab to see if I can get it to work and post a pull request"}]}
