At some point, are we going to get type of simple \u0027latch\u0027 system we can use to say.... Stuff a small rover under a lander, so that when we land we can then send a kerbal under the ship to \u0027unlatch\u0027 it and let it gently fall down to the ground? Currently it seems like the only way to bring a rover along with you is to mount it to the top of your lander/rocket.. and have it \u0027launch\u0027 off the top, then parachute down again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs trying to \u0027decouple\u0027 it from below, even with the smallest decoupler, tends to send it slamming into the ground with an earth-shattering force. =T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre any type of \u0027latches\u0027 in the works for later on down the road?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd im not asking for something that can support 100-tones of weight or anything... just something i can use to secure something with 4-wheels, a battery, and some science stuff, with a seat strapped to its back and maybe a solar panel, to the bottom of a lander so my kerbals can drive around and .. well.. do the science! (without having to have a secondary \u0027post-landing\u0027 launch to get the lander down from off the roof.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any replys!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECelestianKitiara\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T06:48:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting proposition.
