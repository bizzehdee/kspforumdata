Anyway here is my feedback to add to this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst and foremost, and I don\u0027t like the current currency/reputation system. I think it\u0027s terrible, in fact. I was really looking forward to this update but I\u0027m finding it frustrating and annoying just building the simplest of rockets. I still haven\u0027t completed a single contract, they make you complete some ridiculous/notorious things to try to complete them. Some of them are completely impractical such as launching a basic MK parachute over 370m/s when you are moving faster than the speed of sound! I unlock parts and then it restricts me due to insufficient funds. OP also mentioned that it kind of kills the science system which should be more separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut more than all this, I don\u0027t like to bash KSP and Squad because this is probably one my most favorite indie games in the world, but the reason this entire system SUCKS is because of the 2.5km part limit on launch. Scott Manley did a video exploiting this. You use solid rocket boosters for example (which I use many on some of my bigger rockets) and when they fall past that 2km mark or however far that physics limit is, the parts disappear and you get ZERO return on them regardless if you put parachutes on them and what not. They also need to have a rover part on them (which is silly) to make them recoverable. This entire thing makes this new career mode entirely broken IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically every time you have a launch and use up expensive rocket parts, you can\u0027t recover them.
