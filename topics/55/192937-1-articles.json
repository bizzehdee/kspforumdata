A good example of this is with jets like the F-35B (can be seen in this video\u00A0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woBLPwEmQW8), where tubes are ran out through the wings for roll control. I know this could be difficult to do, given the physics engine, but I was thinking that you could attach them directly to the end of an engine and simply make the thrust come from the end of the tube. In order to balance them in terms of power, perhaps they could have a loss in efficiency; such as having them give ~80-90% of the overall thrust?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KingDominoIII","CreatedById":168848,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-07T16:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d be all for this.
