This option might be disabled depending on difficulty, but i think if a \u0022welded\u0022 part (i.e. a single part for the purposes of physics engine) has structural limits equal to the weakest link, then this feature will just increase FPS rather than \u0022cheat\u0022 the physics. Regardless, i think i a feature like this is necessary for the building of large space stations\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
