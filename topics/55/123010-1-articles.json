My idea: It would be great to be able to sort your craft files into certain sub-folders. You could either sort them by function (similar to what is already implemented for subassemblies) or maybe by mission (e.g. having all the single vessels for a multi-launch Duna mission in one folder). What do you say? Or does anyone have another idea how to make the craft list more clearly arranged?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-14T11:42:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2015 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T14:37:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes please.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T15:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see two ways this can be improved:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Expand the existing in-game dialog with more metadata. The thumbnail was a step forward, it could be built upon by adding creation date, vessel mass, number of stages, crew capacity, etc, etc; then let us sort by these values. And yes, subfolders, too. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flow","CreatedById":135718,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T08:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always thought the in-game dialog a bit clumsy.
