I think that both styles are fun (from playing pre-0.22 in sandbox, I always used probes first), and starting with the manned capsule certainly seems the most reasonable to me! But still, I think there should be some reforms to the \u0027tree. (Though not nearly as much as Better than Starting Manned!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1): Fuel Tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake the FL-T800 (long 1.25m tank) available first, then work down in size. This is a more interesting progression, as it removes the ease of fine-tuning your fuel early on. Unlocking the larger tanks first would mean that you are more restricted in early-game missions and staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2): Decouplers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be a cooler idea if radial decouplers came before stack decouplers. It\u0027s a more kerbal-y idea, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik_lv.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ematches reality a bit closer\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3): More nodes for 3.75m parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now you get the S3 Kerbodyne parts in one node. When there\u0027s more Kerbodyne parts, they should all be spread out more. For instance the F-1 (KR-2L) was built waaay before the SSME (KS-25).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a few solutions to the Manned vs Robotic start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne: Allow both to be possible, you have to go to the R\u0026amp;D Facility to unlock your starting parts and you can choose either the crew pod or the probe core, and the rest of the tree will (where applicable) be changed based on this decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo: have \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E, but the first cockpit would be unpressurized and thus would overheat and explode (overheating would be representing a pressure buildup) while above 30km. You\u0027d also get a Stayputnik, with a longer battery capacity than currently available (About a day\u0027s worth, but no reaction wheels). This would nicely mimic the starting technologies of the space race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThree: Choose between Manned start and Robotic Start in gameplay settings. This would even determine your entire tech tree! One is a more american progression, one is a more soviet progression. (Manned vs Probes respectively)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe Cores start would have radial decouplers and more time until larger rocket parts are available, Manned start would have stack decouplers and sooner unlocking of larger rocket parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T22:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like the second idea, humans build unpressurized manned containers way before probes (citation: cardboard box) but probes came before space capsules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T02:01:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fine with starting manned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think about it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a study in the late 1930s about landing on the Moon.
