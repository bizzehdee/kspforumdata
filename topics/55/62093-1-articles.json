I\u0027ve recently started putting together a refuelling station in orbit and noticed a small set of parts which I think would get rid of a few frustrations I\u0027ve had while not noticably altering the gameplay balance or mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A xenon tank similar in size to the FL-T200 Fuel Tank, with a capacity of ~8000 xenon. For a re-fuelling station, it\u0027s nice to have your fuel supply in as few containers as possible as it makes it easier to examine what you have and to perform fuel transfers. Instead of a handful of these I\u0027ve attached 18 of the radial-mount ones to my space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Fuel/oxidizer canister of similar shape/size to the mystery-goo container or Stratus-V Cylindrified Monopropellant Tank. On occasion I\u0027d like to be able to add a little bit extra fuel, though making the rocket taller isn\u0027t appropriate. Or I\u0027d like to use it a tactically-placed counterweight for my SSTO refuelling plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Longer version of the Pegasus I Mobility Enhancer - perhaps 8 rungs worth. I like to run ladders along my space station to allow Kerbals to EVA with fuel. However, I have to put *lots* of these on to cover the length of my refuelling station. This is time consuming and leads to a lot of slightly-misaligned parts. Also, I\u0027ve read that large numbers of parts on things can slow down the physics engine - this may be one way to reduce that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Different-diameter versions of the Structural Fuselage. When trying to make an extended docking arm for my station I wanted a bit of clearance, so I used a stack of ~5 xenon canisters. One launch it bent like an accordion. Launch issues were addressed, though it would be nice to have a longer, ridged option for changing the lengths of things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T03:39:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not qualified yet to comment on 1,2,4 but 3 is a good idea, I\u0027ve pretty much given up on ladders already and I\u0027m still pretty low in the tech tree...you just have to place too many of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T03:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 \u0026amp; 2 are in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30472-0-23-x-KSPX-Kerbal-Stock-Part-eXpansion-mod-reposted-v0-2-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSPX\u003C/a\u003E pack, most of which has been added to the vanilla game already.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T03:50:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brofessional\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T15:04:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes these all seem like decent ideas to me, although I personally don\u0027t use much xenon!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see a 2.5m verion of the docking node in the stock game.
