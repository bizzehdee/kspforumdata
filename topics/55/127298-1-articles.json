What happens if you allready researched EVA? Loosing control seems plausible but its somewhat unrealistic and just letting the pilot die is even more problematic (loosing control on the other hand could be easily bypassed by controling the craft from an onboard probe core).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI prefer the\u00A0idea of having more or less heat \u0026amp; crash resistant version of mk1-3 parts, currently you can fly all this stuff at high speeds, close to mach 4...if you lowered the heat resistance of the base version (with higher relative crash tolerance and lower price but similiar\u00A0weight), make the second version black like the base pod - clear distinction to the normal models and a nice nod to the X-15 and Blackbird. The black version should have a heat resistance a bit above the current. The command pods have a heat resistance of 2400K while the current \u0022plane\u0022 parts are at 2000K...make that 2300 or for the black versions and perhaps 1400K (or even lower) for the base versions - this would also include other aerodynamic parts like Wings, Intakes (there are allready differences here) and landing gears. The current crash tolerances of plane cockpits are 40-60m/s, I think this should be reduced to 5-15\u00A0for the black versions (the MK1 Pod currently has a crash tolerance of 14m/s while the lander cans are at 8m/s), make these planes fragile while cool - landing outside the Space Center would be quite a challenge giving them a disadvantage compared to their normal versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T15:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn all black version would clash with many designs.
