While it takes more dv to get to Moho, it is much more difficult to return from Eve. One could argue that landing on Eve is much easier, being able to use the atmosphere to brake from interplanetary speeds and parachutes to finally land, but as the new rank is only awarded upon return to Kerbin, maybe orbiting (Moho \u0026gt; Eve) and surface operations (Eve \u0026lt; Moho) should be treated differently.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJool\u0026#39;s moons all award the same XP despite varying difficulties to landing on/taking of from them.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFlying in Jool\u0026#39;s atmosphere awards less points than in Laythe\u0026#39;s, although it theoretically takes more effort to leave Jool\u0026#39;s atmosphere again due to its higher gravity/orbital speed and flying on Laythe is checked anyway during any landing.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T15:36:09Z","Content":"\nI think the KXP should be based on the type of missions the crew takes part in and be limited to SOIs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFor example: Kerbals can get up to two stars in Kerbin SOI, but to get XP they need to complete contracts.
