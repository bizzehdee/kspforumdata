Atleast two, One Saturn analogue and an Ice giant analogue, or maybe the planet discussed by devs earlier which would have an extremely thick atmosphere and lots of gravity. Along with the Saturn planet an extensive moon system.

The ksp team once thought of adding an asteroid belt but ended up dropping it because It caused a performance problem on computers and replaced it with Dres. I think that the ksp team should add more planets in the outer reaches of the current star system. Planets with tens of moons, each with geysers and cool geology. Having only cool as the only gas giant makes ksp less entertaining due to the limitations of exploration in the system. In my view, I suggest that the ksp team to add 2-3 planets in the outer regions and a additional asteroid belt. Given the size of adding a new planet and asteroid belts, this should be a long term goal for the development team to make ksp better and more adventurous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T23:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222666925\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143375\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221467994975\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/8/2016 at 9:22 AM, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Suggestions.\u00A0 (Though please note that \u0022moar planets\u0022 is a common suggestion, there are already quite a few threads for this).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152681-gojira1000/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022152681\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152681-gojira1000/\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003E@Gojira1000\u003C/a\u003E... go take a look at Outer Planets Mod, you\u0027ll be glad you did.\u00A0 It implements precisely exactly what you\u0027ve asked for, nicely Kerbalized (equivalents of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto), with stunningly good production value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just gorgeous, totally up to the quality standards of the stock game, and gives you all kinds of neat playgrounds to play in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion:\u00A0 Now that we have a 64-bit system are the memory issues a thing of the past?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
