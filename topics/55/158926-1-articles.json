Nevertheless, I think it should be part of the core game as it can be utilized by many Mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see a new class or namespace (I\u0027m not so familiar with C# yet) which provides functions to assign vessels to groups and organize those groups. The groups should provide functions to alter the behavior of their members. E.g. change \u0022load distance\u0022 and \u0022pack distance\u0022, alter the color of the \u0022patched conics\u0022, prevent any interaction with the vessel (for rescue missions), hide vessel Markers,...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA UI to use the groups can be implemented in the Mission builder of \u0022Making History\u0022 and the tracking station. By the way \u0022Tracking Station\u0022 should be called \u0022Mission Control\u0022 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo provide a competitive \u0022role play\u0022 gameplay style these groups could be organized in a tree structure. Any specified behavior will override the behavior specified in the parent group. And those groups could keep track of Kerbals, contracts, funds,... implement commnet restrictions between groups (No science over foreign networks)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to know what other modders think about this suggestion and maybe you could provide more ideas to improve the suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
