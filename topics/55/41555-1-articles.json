It also has the potential to make the various scientific instruments far more valuable for actual gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is simple. Set minor objectives within the research and development GUI that can be completed with the science instruments. For example, \u0022Take an atmosphereic reading of Duna.\u0022 If the objective is completed, you should unlock a free part, or have however much credit applied to whatever is currently being researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding more science objects would go a long way here. I know some kind of apparatus for soil samples is often asked for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T03:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood news \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Eeveryone\u003C/span\u003E mustang!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022harvester\u0022 data-cite=\u0022harvester\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Einstead, i think the most authentic mechanic would be for nodes to require a \u0027science\u0027 rating, which you earn through experimentation (flying) and gathering data (packing science gear aboard possibly).

Train someone to be a scientist, put them on a mun and have them do certain tasks on their own. I\u0027m not sure what extent they\u0027d implement automated tasks like that, but I get the feeling they\u0027d be kinda simplified. Like the kerbonauts can do the job, but if you did it it\u0027d be a lot faster and better or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, they might have something completely different in mind by now.
