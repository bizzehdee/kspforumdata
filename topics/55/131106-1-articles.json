I dont even care if we get a third party program to do it but we need one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems as though it would be written as a patch program to catch the part moves in the tech tree (by graphically moving parts).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverytime we get an updated MOD either the CFG file needs to be written or each part moved by cheating F12 (I think I cant even remember); this is way to archaic; I apologize but the Community Tech Tree is not an answer and I think it is even disbanded because they are trying to get SetiTree or EngrTree or some other \u0027certified\u0027 tree to get modders to patch to them; this is rediculous and show no concern for the player and how a player would want their parts to be placed depending on how they play the career game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe trees are fine but we dont need modders to patch to them; I have to go in and change every CFG file back to STOCK so I can move them where I want later; I have to change CFG files twice now; or figure out how to get rid of patches, and even then figure out as some of the MODS are softcoded to other TREES and not patched; I dont feel there is any consistency with the Tech Tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe patch thing may be okay even though that is hard for me to figure out how to use and I am a good programmer, and I cant get Techmanager to work I dont know if it works with 1.05\u002B; I tried some version once and it failed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem then is at game start is having parts not available because they depend on a Tech Tree not everyone wants to use; if modders would stick to plopping their parts to the STOCK Tech Tree, and KSP had a graphical implementation of part moving and part availability if no node exists, as in TreeLoader/Editer (NOT TED), it would make Tech Tree building so much easier (and even possible); I dont even have a clue as to how they are making Tech Trees now with XLS (?) and then even adding them to KSP; yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease Make A Graphical Tech Tree Editor In KSP !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommander Zeta\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
