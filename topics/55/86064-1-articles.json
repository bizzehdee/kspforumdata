They would start as a flight suit with a parachute, and advance from there. The advancement might be something like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachute----\u0026gt;Tethered----\u0026gt;RCS----\u0026gt;Rocket Pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also suggest an \u0022Airlock\u0022 where you could change suits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be interesting, if life support is ever added, to have advancing amounts of life support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HMS Sophia","CreatedById":122688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T21:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love for this to be implemented.
