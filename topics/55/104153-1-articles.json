Bassically, if you want to send sattelites to orbit multiple times, it can get very tedious. However, if you can have active vessels while not on focus or in the physics range, and an autopilot to steer it, we can do multiple automated launches without spending ,much time.\n\nHowever, this i likely to use ALOT of resources. Can you do something such as run the simulation in a texture-less, more basic simulation?\n\nRemote tech sattelite launches can ge annoying when theres so much other awesome things you can do."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:56:03Z","Content":"SQUAD dislike word \u0022Automated\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:57:29Z","Content":"How about piloted?

We have astronauts, they are supposed to have various skill levels, and career is supposed to be a \u0022tycoon\u0022 like game. In a railroad tycoon game, is the player required to use a rail yard engine to move all the rolling stock to various trains, then drive the trains (serially) across the country themselves? Didn\u0027t think so.\n\nIf you play Empire: Total War, must you load each musket yourself? If it was KSP you would. Hard to get a company of troops to fire a couple shots a minute if you had to even just click \u0022reload\u0022 on each guy, much less the KSP equiv, which would be doing it as a sort of maneuver.\n\nKSP has zero aspect of managing a space program if the player is forced to do every, single action in the game personally.\n\nI\u0027ve never used MJ, myself, but I\u0027d be happy in the later game to have my cadre of astronauts do resupply missions to my orbital station, or transfer crews from Munbase, or whatever, while I do whatever it is I feel like doing at the moment.\n\n\u0022Managing a space program\u0022 and \u0022no AI\u0022 are in fact mutually exclusive ideas. I\u0027m fine with dumping career, maybe we\u0027d get better stuff if they didn\u0027t bother wasting resources on \u0022career\u0022 mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Uzric","CreatedById":102098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T17:42:28Z","Content":"There is a mod that addresses this issue in a very elegant way: you have to do it the first time, then you can save what you have done and it will be auto-schedule and done by itself.

I should be able to have the fun of piloting back a booster stage (falcon9 style) while my fully capable 2d stage is piloted to orbit by Jeb, or whichever astronaut I assign. I should be able to set up cool EVA missions (like a munar scientific survey) and have the landing crew walk around doing them if I like (or drive a rover, or walk an astronaut several km from the lander, and be able to tell it to head back without me having to do it).\n\nNothing stopping a player from CHOOSING fun piloting activities, but the ability to do 2 things at once (like if 2 SoI encounters happen at the same time for some reason).\n\nOn topic, I would love the ability to have maneuver nodes have a toggle to complete them automatically by stealing a \u0022background focus\u0022 when needed (maybe dropping time warp to 1:1 if required).\n\nEarly in the career game, it\u0027s not an issue, but I do not time warp gratuitously. I extra planetary probes early in the game as soon as I can (Eve, Duna, Jool). It takes a long time for them to arrive, and I go about my Kerbin SoI business (note I\u0027m usually playing an RSS cfg of the Kerbol system, so it might take 10 years to get to Jool). By the time I\u0027m getting near SoIs, I have stations, mun bases, craft in assembly in orbit for Duna (with life support). I have to do everything by hand. I have missed SoIs before (yeah, I should add KAC, but I haven\u0027t yet), or maneuver nodes. I have to resupply stations, etc. Many flights in space at once.
