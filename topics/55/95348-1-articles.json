Maybe make it cost a little science for normal career. You do preliminary research of the buildings, and upgrade them with the money. In science mode, the science cost can be inflated for balance reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T19:44:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t disagree but the problem is, will Squad really balance out the progression across three modes?

I am not sure why the XP system isn\u0027t for example. It doesn\u0027t seem to depend on anything that isn\u0027t in the science career.
