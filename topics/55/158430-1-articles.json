Like you landed a processing lab in a biome and started researching the science from the biome in the biome, would give the research extra data or something or just a bit more science. because if you were in that situation you could go out and get more samples or test new ideas as soon as you have them. so what do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-31T08:57:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think part of it is implemented. I\u0027ve read somewhere that there is a difference in research depending on situation you research - landed, in space low, in space high. IIRC you get more from surface science on surface, low orbit science in low orbit etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
