However, I can see a few benefits to having build-times at least somewhat accounted for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one thing, it adds pressure on the player to build their rocket quickly in the event that it is needed for a time-critical mission. For example, if a contract is running out, or they are trying to catch an impending launch window, or they are playing with life support mods and they are trying to conduct a rescue mission, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, and what primarily motivates me, is player inmersion. It feels strange to me that 20 minutes into a game, I have already launched half a dozen spacecraft, broken every altitude record, and made orbit with half the tech tree unlocked. It doesn\u0027t impact the game play any, but it does slightly ruin the immersion for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest solution I can think of that neither punishes the player nor can be trivially bypassed with time warp would be to simply have the game clock run inside buildings, including the VAB. In doing so, players would have incentive to plan their designs out in advance and construct their rockets quickly. It would also give that little checkbox in the difficulty settings which allows stock vessels some added importance: since the player might have a suite of rockets available at the outset, they can fire off their missions at a higher rate than someone playing without them, thus suiting individual playstyles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also solve another problem that has been bugging me about the VAB for some time. Namely, when you go inside the VAB and look through the doors, it\u0027s broad daylight regardless of whether the time on Kerbin is day or night. Since the devs already went through the trouble of making the space center scene reflect the actual state of the game around the space center, wouldn\u0027t it just make sense to have the VAB and SPH reflect it as well? Especially since that is where the player spends the vast majority of their time when they are not flying missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are probably some other benefits as well, but I\u0027d like to open the thread for discussion.

If all the battles were evenly matched, on the same terrain, with the same victory conditions, the game would be BORING. Sort of like what you might see in an exploration game where you already know where everything is, and exactly how to get there before you start, and you can in fact explore the entire game in a very short period of time, every time (since it is always exactly the same). Hmm, what game is like that in career that we all know?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople whine that X, Y, and Z additions are \u0022too hard\u0022 or in the case of time progression that \u0022people will just warp past it.\u0022 They miss the point that everything is connected.

Or maybe you cannot alter the launch vehicle/probe enough for rescue, but there is a cheap, fast part that can be bolted on to land LS supplies such that you have time to mount a proper rescue.
