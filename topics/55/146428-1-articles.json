That little extra weight buys you a wing area of 0.35, which is not a bad deal, especially since it can be part of the structural fuselage (and not some floppy wing on the side). Also, it will survive re-entry a bit better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat cargo bay has a mass of 0.25 ton, which is heavy. Sure you can stuff more stuff into it, and I personally almost always use one such cargo bay to put science, reaction wheels and batteries in, but you need only so many of those.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said before, I would be in favor of a small \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;float:none;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003Eupgrade of the Mk2 fuel capacity... but even without it, I use it frequently\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
