Bigger wings have a higher lift rating and more drag, smaller wings a smaller lift rating and less drag, but lift induces drag, so having excess drag decreases the performance of an aircraft. Aircrafts with smaller wings need a bigger runway, which is less than ideal in some situations. My solution: being able to change the lift of an airplane wing in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHigh lift devices\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh lift devices increase lift when you want them to. There are 2 settings, one when the lift is higher and one where the lift is lower.
