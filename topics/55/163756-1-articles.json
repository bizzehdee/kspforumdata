I have completed most of the basic missions from testing a widget at the launch site, to an info gathering slingshot mission around the MUN. I am at the point now where most of the missions that pop up are hauling passengers or gathering data from specific points around the universe. I, as well as many others have little interest in these, as we like to spend time preparing for flight,\u00A0 then getting to and from space. Since peoples interest varies, it would be nice to have a way to select specific types of missions so collecting widgets would not show up if we had no interest in that. It is is great game, and this is just a thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD One\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-27T13:07:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGame suggestion moved to Suggestions \u0026amp; Development Discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
