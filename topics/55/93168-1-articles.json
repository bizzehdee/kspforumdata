For the most part engineers are useful when you screw up, or something breaks. But thats about it, beyond that they sit around and don\u0027t help the flight like the pilot or help your science gains like the scientists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts pretty clear that the game lets: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilots impact the \u003Cstrong\u003EFlight\u003C/strong\u003E part of the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientists impact the \u003Cstrong\u003EScience/tech\u003C/strong\u003E part of the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut engineers hardly can affect anything in the \u003Cstrong\u003EBuilding\u003C/strong\u003E part of the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really are a few ways squad can buff out the engineer roles so they are more than \u0022We need this fixed\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. They can add \u0022flight engineer\u0022 type boosts, acting as data relays to help pilots fly. Think of a cut down Kerbal Engineer (makes sense hu?) with more levels adding more detail to the data. Such as true altitude, AP, PE heights, what biome you will land in ETC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. They can add more things that can break and be fixed. Maybe engines can malfunction (THAT WOULD BE BAD!) Or struts can break? This is a very gray sort of suggestion, but entirely possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. They can add something in line with the Kerbal Attatchment System Mod. Which adds utility parts and the ability for Kerbals to do minor building on ships. Such as adding struts, lights, fuel lines, and small parts like batteries or science gear. Along with that the mod adds winches and grapple hooks. All of which an Engineer would be able to manipulate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third option seems like the most interesting(at least to me) as then the Engineer would be more a representative of the building aspect of the game. Being able to rig together ships in space with struts, or bases on land with fuel lines. It\u0027s also not really a question as if this is in the \u0022scope\u0022 of the game, since nearly half the game (or a third in career) is building things. Why not move some of the building into the flying/simulation part of the game for a more dynamic experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be pretty disappointed if the Devs neglect adding something like this. They have even been quoted as saying they would like to look into this mod. So I hope to see some move toward getting this kind of mod into the game in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alias72","CreatedById":111778,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T20:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t be too worried.

He very well may serve as a form of Kerbal Engineer. Telling you your current mass and DV in flight. And I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if KER values become accessible from the hanger.
