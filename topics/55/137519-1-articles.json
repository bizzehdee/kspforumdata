Before 1.1, you could disable and enable resources on a craft even without control. This change now makes it impossible to put probes into hibernation if you\u0027re sending them far away. Sure I could stick some solar panels or RTGs or whatever onto them so they\u0027re constantly running, but that\u0027s not the point. I like the idea of putting probes into hibernation mode while they\u0027re coasting through interplanetary space to their destination, like real-life space probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T23:29:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am torn on this issue, on the one hand it is definitely cheaty and on the other hand i have used it because Stock does not have a hibernate/low power mode. \u00A0And beginning probes are very hard to work with before solar panels which come very late in the tech tree.\u00A0 I am also sad because I like to put 1 panel facing the sun and leave a spare battery off in case it gets drained and I need to re position the satellite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly I think I will be using infinite electricity when this happens\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
