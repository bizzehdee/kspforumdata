I love the new complexity the aerodynamics and heat offer, but the lack of quick ways to track it is quite frustrating. What I\u0027d like to see as a feature is some sort of obvious visual cue that things are about to explode. I\u0027m finding the majority of time piloting is being taken up by just guessing what is about to happen, rather than enjoying actually flying.

I don\u0027t want to have to fly everywhere with the debug menu showing heatmaps and similar. Some little bar that fills as the parts slowly overheat, even if they don\u0027t recover (maybe that\u0027s how the heatshields work? I\u0027ve not tried them yet)\n\nI\u0027ll go through some options more soon. Hopefully someone will add a mod that does it if it isn\u0027t added in stock. Currently I\u0027m flying with 50% heat, and despite this reentry is still pretty infuriating to work out. Think I\u0027ve got the hang of ascent at least, good thing the engines are all so powerfull now! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:28:06Z","Content":"The heat shield has an indicator for its rate of ablation (**Resources** button, top-right of the screen). I\u0027m finding however, that external parts on the rocket (antenna, radial chutes, science experiments, etc) are not protected during reentry ... I\u0027m constantly losing my Communotron 16 antenna, which is ok - I guess. It would be cool if it flared off (sparks and such) instead of exploding ... which I find quite nerve-racking. I\u0027m also finding issues with the Service Bay and 2Hot Thermometer science experiment ... I think the Service Bay should be protecting the internal stowed components from heat."},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:10:16Z","Content":"One kind of hacky method is to simply use an engine as a heat shield.

That\u0027s what I first thought you meant, but maybe you mean messages and gauges could appear just somewhere on the screen, not necessarily next to the staging icons where some overheat information is currently displayed.\n\nMy idea would be to show a gray outline/shadow of the ship from three cardinal directions (front, left, top) and either overlay a heat map or a warning indicator on the gray outline when a part was overheating. (Don\u0027t know the feasibility of coming up with the gray/shadow on the fly but I suspect it could be done) This overheat outline would be in a tab next to the contracts and fuel/resources tabs. ShadowZone\u0027s idea could work here too, there\u0027d be an overheat warning tab where messages would appear as parts began to overheat. This would avoid spamming the screen and having to hunt for the warnings."},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:33:53Z","Content":"I like the suggestion of making parts that are about to overhead produce a fizzing sound and start smoking/sparking/spewing flames, just like DRE does. The sound very quickly alerts you to the fact that **something** is overheating, and the effects show you what is overheating without cluttering the UI. I would be fine with overheat gauges on the staging menu in addition to this."},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T19:49:27Z","Content":"I \u002B1 on this, something easy to see and not obstructive.
