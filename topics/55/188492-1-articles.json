This comes from me using some Vector engines today on an expendable rocket (in sandbox) and this got me wondering, could there ever be anyway that I could use these engines small size and exceptionally high thrust without launching this rocket and breaking the bank doing so. This is the answer I came to.

This engine uses a timer to determine ignition life of the engine during thrust manuevers, I don\u0027t think they change the speed of the timer based on percent thrust, but they could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-27T16:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223678029\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188492\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221569567961\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept from SRBs, you can fiddle with thrust limiter in flight, no?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I assume using these kinds of \u2018budget\u2019 engines, the limiters would be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
