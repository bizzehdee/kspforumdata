Fuel reserves have been drained to dangerous levels and without more KSC will come to a grinding halt. \n\nI came up with a rough idea for a new game mode that could offer a scenario driven experience outside of the Career mode and career mode lite (science mode). I also wanted something that would make the new resources really come into play. While I originally came up with this as a mod idea I think this could be a fun stock game mode along side the other 3 and wouldn\u0027t require any major features to be added into the game. \n\nDown to the meat and potatoes. This game mode would be much closer to Sandbox than Career as you would start off with all the science researched and there would be no funds limiting you. What you would have is a limited volume of fuel to start the game off with and more fuel cannot be purchased. This would require players to setup mining colonies and refueling stations in order to keep their ships fueled. While there would still be Ore on Kerbin there should be options to remove Ore from the KSC with a slider to adjust how far out from the KSC you wont find any ore. Any leftover fuel or ore on a recovered ship gets added into your stockpile of fuel but still falls under the same recovery rules where the further away from KSC you recover the smaller percentage you get back.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T17:32:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roguelycan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadows2b","CreatedById":137562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:16:41Z","Content":"Grindfest for fuel, could be interesting as a late game event in career mode, but there is to few parts about ore to be viable."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:17:57Z","Content":"This could probably be scripted real easily.

Unfortunately I dont know the first thing about modding and don\u0027t have the free time to try to learn on my own. I could just roleplay the scenario in my head but like many movies based off books sometimes it is more fun to see the idea realized on screen. \n\nI see no reason why this idea wouldnt work with modded resources and mining.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T17:35:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by roguelycan**"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:31:44Z","Content":"What about a game mode where players can create scenarios/challenges. \n\nThey can specify budgets, allowed parts, and goals etc..."},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T17:34:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Grindfest for fuel, could be interesting as a late game event in career mode, but there is to few parts about ore to be viable.\n\nI dont think the number of mining parts would negatively affect this idea.

I would love to see this and more things like it in the game. I haven\u0027t checked the scenarios section since 1.0 but last time I looked at it, it was pretty lame. This idea reminds me of when I used to play Rollercoaster Tycoon. There were lots of interesting scenarios to try out like guests that couldn\u0027t stand scary rides or guests who were really cheap/hated spending money. I would love to see more of those kinds of things in KSP, where, unlike career or sandbox, you have a specific goal and a specific challenge. \n\nAnother idea would be a \u0022tourism only economy\u0022 where the only contracts offered are tourism ones and you have to find the cheapest way to get lots of Kerbals into space and to other destinations to make enough money to stay afloat, as well as do science.\n\nI think this type of thing would add a lot to KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T18:25:37Z","Content":"Science mode I think is great for beginners to learn the game but offers little to more experienced players.

As much as I like the idea of mining and refueling stations I find that they are not that insanely useful 90% of the time. In career the fuel itself is so cheap compared to the cost of actual parts that setting up a refueling station would provide very little benefit. In Sandbox they are practically useless because it is almost always easier to just send another flight into LKO for a refuel. By limiting the fuel you start with plus no option to purchase more fuel would not only make mining actually useful, it would be mandatory."},{"CreatedByName":"roguelycan","CreatedById":64979,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T21:05:08Z","Content":"I am curious how difficult something like this would be to create a mod for.
