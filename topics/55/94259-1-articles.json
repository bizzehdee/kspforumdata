Then in the available contracts I was able to accept the high paying ones (thus getting the advance of money and now some science) and subsequently cancel the contract. Money never goes into the negatives and the science \u0027advance\u0027 is never revoked. I was able to do this over and over, racking up science without doing anything. Then when I had my fill of science I simply accepted the contracts I wanted, thus going from $0 to whatever I got from them for an advance and voila, continued on my merry way with new parts for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be fixed by allowing negative money essentially making it possible to \u0027bankrupt\u0027 your space center and making the current game unplayable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ikaneko","CreatedById":109214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T17:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere will always be exploits, however well the game is designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing with exploits is that you quickly get a feeling of unfulfillment once you\u0027ve finished the game. Therefore you will derive more enjoyment from the game actually playing it as supposed to cheating. So the best thing to do is to just play fair: that is the most fun and fulfilling experience of all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on track:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe negative money would help, but the entire point of career mode is trying to learn from your mistakes as supposed to a \u0022haha, you failed\u0022 type thing. It is best for new players to help them to learn from what went wrong last time and so become a better player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T17:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ikaneko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere will always be exploits, however well the game is designed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is true, however I think this particular exploit is one that does need to be fixed. A failure condition on running out of money (possibly reputation as well - you could just say nobody\u0027s willing to fund a space program that can\u0027t get anything done or is unnecessarily cruel or whatever) or at least a harsh penalty for it (loans?) would probably fix this quite easily. New players can always play on easy, where you have A: revert flight and quicksave, and B: lots more money than you actually need.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T17:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I recall correctly, having 0 the minimum funds cap is a temporary thing and will be changed in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps going negative will lose the game?
