Like if i explore the oceans of Kerbin and I find fish i should be able to put them into a canister or payload in this building and then bring it in as a Sub-Assembly and launch it to collect science. much like in the 0.22 update video where there was an octopus being put into the canister.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it should include 4 main items,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. payload canisters \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. collection canisters (used to collect organisms for later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.

Recovered specimens could be viewable at the R\u002BD facility, loaded into science modules in the VAB, and you could observe them in different environments in IVA in the science lab module after launch, much the way they bring all sorts of things up to the ISS to see how they behave in zero g.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
