I think this is a feature that should be implemented in stock KSP becuase it would aid greatly in interplanetary travel, perhaps there could also an indicator that tells you when the best launch window is? I reckon the best way to do this would be through the tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, something in the tracking station that tells you when the most efficient launch window is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Typo in the title, it should say \u0022A way to tell...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-05T16:19:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2014 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by kerbonaut101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded info about a typo in the title, can a mod fix it?\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
