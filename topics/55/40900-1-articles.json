With step 4 you can let him more time on orbit, but water may became a problem, since isn\u0027t recycled, and health became a concern: After some time the kerbal would became sick or crazy. After step 6 as long you put all necessary parts on your station or ship the kerbals won\u0027t became sick and their endurance will only be a matter of food reserves. After step 11 you can harvest food in greenhouse and don\u0027t need to replenish food reserves or bring kerbals back to kerbin anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also know that Squad don\u0027t want anything random in the game, and I agree. To deal with this without any random events, kerbals should have levels for thirst, hungry, health, sanity and waste. Thirst and hungry will increase in a know rate with time and when reach a know level kerbal should die. Health would decrease with a know rate, depending on ship and flight profiles. For example, the smaller mk1 capsule would make health decrease faster than the hitchhiker container, because of the small space and not so good temperature management, and of course, the kerbal\u0027s waste level. Flights near kerbol or maybe some radioative planet/moon (if ever implemented) could also increase the loss of health rate. Sanity would follow a similar logic, but the rate should depend on other factors, like the presence of another kerbal, the courage and stupidity values and so. When sanity and health drops below a certain know value, the kerbal would be incapacitated (sick or insane) and can\u0027t pilot anymore, so better to have a backup crew or a remote control module on ship to bring it back to Kerbin or a Space Station/Bigger ship with infirmary. When health reaches zero the kerbal die. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it may sound complex, but I believe it can be done in such way that looks simple to the player. I.E: Add the right modules to the ship and all will be fine, or just don\u0027t forget your kerbals in space too long in simple ships and it\u0027s all right too.
