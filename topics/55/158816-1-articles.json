This should provide a decent analogy of the distribution of real stars. Mostly red dwarf stars, many orange stars, some yellow stars, a few white stars, rare blue stars, rare red giant stars, and rare red supergiant stars. Throw in a neutron star, a few white dwarfs, and a stellar-mass black hole as well. The seed for the procedural generator defaults to 0, but can be changed to another number for a new universe if you want.in the settings config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to the procedural local system, there are a few analogues of notable real world (and maybe some fictional)\u00A0exo-systems. Alpha Centauri and Proxima Centauri, TRAPPIST-1, etc. Some planets, just a few, will have life on them. (Probably just trees and grass\u00A0or something simple, but how cool would it be to have alien animals that you could grab with a claw and bring home for examination)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDistances between these objects should be on the scale of 1/10 lightyears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cstrong\u003Esecond\u003C/strong\u003E major feature is a set of different interstellar technologies that become available only after most of the rest of the tech tree is unlocked. The Advanced Tech Tree would gain you access to fission and fusion technology, laser propulsion, laser communication, and antimatter technology. In addition, there are many improvements to the stock rocket parts that can be unlocked. This Advanced Tech Tree can be split into several parts, corresponding to the state of the art space engine of that part of the tree. Slowboat, Relativistic, and Superluminal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowboat drives are basically just really powerful rocket engines that allow a ship to go to another star system within hundreds of years instead of hundreds of thousands. (Strictly speaking with timewarp extension you could go interstellar with a conventional rocket.) These would be fusion rockets and Nuclear Pulse Rockets. Slowboat drives are also terrific for fast interplanetary travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelativistic drives are even more powerful engines, and include such things as ramjets and antimatter fuel. We also get matter replicators which use ore as a resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuperluminal drives become more advanced and powerful as you go up. The\u00A0superluminal drive is the Warp Drive, which allows faster than light translation through space, at the cost of lots of power. Theorhetically the velocity attainable by this drive is unbounded, but it would require far too much energy to be practical after around 100c. They also do not account for the actual speed of the destination, so if you go from the fast Moho to the slow Jool you\u0027re gonna need a rocket to slow down. Towards the end we also get some really out-there sci-fi stuff like short-range teleporters which can teleport objects between two stations. At the end we get matter/energy torch drives and energy/matter object replicators. We also get FTL ansible for instant communication with probes and science transmission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cstrong\u003Ethird\u003C/strong\u003E major feature is the inclusion of Special Relativity and Time Dilation. From a vessel-centric viewpoint, time appears to go by faster and faster as you approach the speed of light. From an outside perspective, the ship\u0027s acceleration appears to decrease. This is coupled with the capability for thrust, both high and low, under timewarp. In addition, signals now actually travel at the speed of light, and probes need flight computers to execute manuever nodes from a distance. The speed of light can be changed in the save file, but defaults to 1/10 the real world value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUp until the third part of the Advanced Tech Tree, this should be a hard science expansion. (At least as hard as Stock KSP is.) \u00A0At the third part it should still be tough. I expect some amount of research into the real physics of the Alcubierre drive to be used for warp. And please don\u0027t have the strange colored ball that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Warp Drive uses, that would be a tremendous disappointment. If you\u0027re doing it with an expansion pack and you have black holes anyway, you might as well have a good warp effect shader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be a few technological advancements here that mods could not feasibly do here. A procedural star system generator would require something new for sure, and the special relativity simulator as well. Obviously this would be a much much bigger expansion than what I think we expect from Making History.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T05:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223012019\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491504849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161551\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022peewee69\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, peewee69 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been thinking a lot about what I would like to see for the next expansion pack and wanted to share my ideas and invite you all to share yours!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy sole idea for EP[x]: Better performance (physics \u002B runtime GC).

You only get a little something for following in their shadow.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEach Agency has a multiplier for every player based on former dealings. Each successful contract will give you a boost with that Agency, and the sooner you complete it the better. Failed contracts hurt your relationship (on top of the general Reputation penalty).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMany contracts are offered to multiple players. You can see if another player has taken one that you have selected. The person to finish it first gets the bulk (or all) of the reward. If an Agency really likes you, they are more likely to offer you exclusive contracts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome contracts call for direct competition. It might ask for players to send up the most tourists in a single launch, and whoever gets the most wins. Or they may ask you to deliver some payload to the surface of the Mun, and whoever gets there first wins.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome contracts call for direct cooperation. For example, it may ask multiple players to contribute to a station together, or visit someone else\u0027s base, to get a shared reward.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience could be a point of competition as well. It would probably go too far to say that the first person to collect Science from a situation/biome steals it from anyone else. But you could give a bonus for the first person in each case, encouraging players to go somewhere new.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSabatoge of other players is punished so that the game doesn\u0027t devolve into an ICBM war. (perhaps that\u0027s open to be disabled by mods for people who want to build in combat)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd a \u0022press center\u0022 building where you can check up on what other players are up to, how they stand with different agencies, insight on what tech they have, see what contracts they\u0027ve taken, etc.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd Strategies that play into all of these new mechanics.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou could go a few ways on how the AI works. I don\u0027t see a reason to make him actually process launches, burns, etc. that you aren\u0027t present for. From your perspective it\u0027s mostly just going to seem like they\u0027re spawning ships in orbit and sending them around to do contracts. He mostly just needs to be able to keep track of fuel usage so that he doesn\u0027t cheat. You\u0027d have to limit how fast he can build/manage. The real trick is teaching him to design ships. It would obviously be best if he could procedurally generate ships for different purposes following some basic design rules. (rather than work with a set of predefined ships)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly:\u00A0 Multiplayer? Ideally, this would all be set up in such a way as to allow for playing with other humans rather than AI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T00:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223013731\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158816\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221491619559\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002236077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 08/04/2017 at 0:45 PM, GregroxMun said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealready paid for the game\u003C/em\u003E.
