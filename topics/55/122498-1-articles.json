Make it a Public domain project! Make licensing where everyone can work on the code so it\u0027s also good for real programming classes and make a separate mode that is for programming and anything that can be turned into and make stuff to help teachers program from that end also. Like unloading stuff for students in a classroom to do their coding from scratch. Or even physics teachers to do the same or chemists etc. Once you treat it like a giant programming tool you can do anything!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also make the game code publicly viewable and create the best environment for the greatest and fastest work and resolve that issue. As everyone could also help and get to learn from the work being done. So even if sqaud does the physical programming for the main(current) game mode of the game they get the advantage of learning from the entire community and their own game as well. A little more like gaming and programming communities were a few decades ago. This would help everyone no all sides in everyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the separate mode, if only one, could be usable for everything and step up for various things and programmed and designed by everyone! Then just set up a basic license allowing everyone to use the code simplify the situation down and allow yourselves to still sell the game for cheap to keep the project going. Then if you need to put up a donation box to boot if needed and be on your way. As it\u0027s a public domain project(I used the term loosely as it doesn\u0027t literally have to but you could.) it may very well make itself and even help make the base game as there would be the widest array of examples. It could also be set up to allow all other game developers(past present and future.) to use all the code freely to help get rid of certain issues and help everyone write code! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not this could be something to do with the game after it\u0027s completely. If you don\u0027t want the benefits earlier that is. Either way I think it\u0027s a cool idea and something that should be done somewhere. I just hope the baseness and greed rampant in the world doesn\u0027t still make a thing like this impossible(Which legally is impossible in the U.S. but there is a lack of education to know this. 8\\) . You would think being backed up by NASA there could be potential hope and means though! ;p\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T07:01:49Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T08:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can have your public domain, I will have SQUAD not getting bought out and the developers staying employed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T10:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can have public domain and still sell something.
