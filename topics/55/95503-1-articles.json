If it was a case of moving two vessels close together and then welding them together without the use of any additional parts (except maybe tools or something for the kerbals to use) then I think that might be worth the hassle. If you\u0027re just going to use something like a docking port but not quite, then it would simply be easier to enable you to make docking ports a permanent connection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T19:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI actually just posted this long post (with crappy pics!) in the Add-On Affairs thread the other day. Copy-pasted here in case any one is interested:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea I have is to solve what I see as a problem with building in orbit. The main problem for me is that the only way to do this is to use docking ports. This isn\u0027t the worst problem in the world, I know, but it does cause problems and it isn\u0027t the way things are done in real life (this game is not designed to be a sim, that is why I suggest this idea in Add-on Affairs and not Suggestions). One problem is it causes long space stations or crafts that are build out of separate modules to be terribly wobbly. I know you could just make stronger docking ports, but I do like the idea that docking ports aren\u0027t as strong as normal joints, it does add something to the game, but you shouldn\u0027t always have to deal with it. Another problem is part count, as it adds 2 unnecessary parts for every module in a game where high part count can make it practically impossible to play. In real life, the space station is not simply docked together but built, bolted together by astronauts on EVA in a way that is not meant to come apart without problems and work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here is my idea: \u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Welding Rings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow it might work:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch a module intended for permanent attachment to a station or craft, rather than putting a docking port on the end, you would add a welding ring. The ring would be a massless part that has little or no thickness to it, node attachment only, and possibly no collider. Whatever node you intend to attach that module to would also have to have a ring on the end of it, of the same diameter, just like a docking port. It would function partly like a docking port as well, in that when it gets close to the other ring, a \u0022magnetic\u0022 force attracts them together, but it should be a lot weaker so you have to be very precise and go very slowly. Once the two parts me, well nothing happens. They are still 2 separate parts held together by a very weak magnetic force. To finish the job, you must get a kerbal out on EVA to right click the part and select \u0022weld parts\u0022 from the menu. In order to right click the part, they may need to extend past the edge of the parts, so a 2.5m ring would actually be a little bit wider than 2.5m. Once \u0022weld\u0022 is clicked, the parts snap together (at whatever rotation they were at, just like docking) and maybe some sparks fly, and the 2 parts are joined permanently as if they had been built in the VAB, without all the wobbling and whatnot. It seems like something that a lot of people would use, and adds an interesting gameplay dynamic and a reason to go on IVA as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe following is a terrible mockup of the idea I made in SketchUp very quickly.
