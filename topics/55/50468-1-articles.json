I suggest that instead the R\u0026amp;D building serve a slightly different function in Sandbox as it does in Career mode as follows. In Sandbox the R\u0026amp;D Building should allow the user to configure the tech tree in any manner that is possible in Career given enough science points. Research nodes are able to be locked and unlocked at will including a node that controls all other parts that do not have an associated tech tree node defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe benefits of this system are to allow easier testing of R\u0026amp;D mechanics by mod makers as well as allowing a user-directed \u0022pen and paper\u0022 style career mode utilizing Sandbox if desired. The user could also see the entire tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
