I have mine set to 25%, so the difference is quite noticeable.\n\nIn-flight, it affects the MET clock, navball, altitude readouts and staging centre. It does not affect the portraits, staging sequence or toolbar. The result is that it looks quite disjointed.\n\nIn the Space Centre view, the bar containing time and go-to controls along the bottom is affected, but not the toolbar or currency bar.\n\nSimilar issue in the Tracking Station: the flight filters, time control and go-to control are affected, but not the tracked objects bar... yet the action buttons at the bottom are."}]}
