My idea is to make tanks more flexible. Let we say the tank got capacity of 10000 liters. So what i can do is fill it with 10000 liquid fuel or oxydiser or 50/50 or use it for monopropelant. Let we say if you use one type of fill you got full space 10000 but if you use two or tree walls inside your capacity go down by 1% (for example). so you use tank for just fuel ok 10000 liters. 50/50 ok you got 9900 liters for fuel and oxydiser (4950 each). So why not use extra grid in tank and take some monopropelant with you. 3 grids take 2% and you got capacity of 9800 so you fill it with 4800 (each) fuel and oxy and extra 200 for monopropelant. This idea not support an ore for them still shoud be separate tanks :confused:.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T01:47:40Z","Content":"\nWell, realistically, different type of liquids require different tanks. It\u0026#39;s not the same to pump monoprop or whatever liquid fuel is than liquid oxygen.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUnrealistically, yeah, something like the firespitter fuel switch or the interstellar fuel switch (small mods that do precisely that) would be great ingame, even if it adjusts the dry weight of the tank to compensate for the different \u0022pumps\u0022. It would also reduce the parts clutter in the VAB/SPH\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T06:23:01Z","Content":"\nThe Modular Fuel Tanks mod does just this, but I do agree it should be stock.

I cluster the heck out of the liquid fuel tanks instead or switch to MK3 fuel tanks, but we are sorely lacking a 2.5m liquid fuel tank. They are perfect when paired with the Stack Quad Adapter, or my personal favorite -- radially attached 1.25m tanks around a 2.5m tank.\n"}]}
