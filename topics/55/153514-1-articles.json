For example, every month/week whatever, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E will give you a set amount of funds to you that can be changed in the options menu. Doing this will make the game a little bit more bearable when you\u0027re the type of person to build big rockets, or playing on harder difficulties.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n/ Change the penalty for asking for a government fund. There are certain instances when the player might run out of money, and will need to use the strategy that grants you an amount of funds based on the percentage bar. However, the penalty for this is extremely high, and if it was toned down by about 15-25%, it wouldn\u0027t make it overpowered, but it would make it much less of a pain.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Loans. The player can ask for a loan. There can be four different options on the loans; 50,000 Funds, 500,000 Funds, 1Mil Funds, and \u0022Custom\u0022 where you can choose an amount of funds between 0 and 5Mil. The player will have to repay the fund before a certain deadline, and will have to pay interest. For example, you take the 50,000 loan, you will have to pay 10% interest every month (5000 a month). If the player fails to pay back the loan, the player will get hit with a massive reputation penalty.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n/ Balance the price tags of the different parts. Since the loans feature as well as the monthly fund increase are a thing in this hypothetical update, the price tags for parts may need to be increased/decreased respectively. I\u0027m not gonna pay an absurd amount of money for something I could go to my nearest DIY store and make the same thing\u00A0myself for much less. I know it\u0027s a game, but some things really need to make a little bit more sense.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Statistics. A trend graph depicting where funds are going to/where they\u0027re coming from. For example, I\u0027d like to know why I just lost about 500,000 in a couple of months. I could go to the statistics graph in the administration building, and notice that 500,000 was spent on snacks. (I\u0027m joking, but I\u0027m assuming you know what I mean :P). I\u0027d also like to know how much money is coming in, and see if in the end my reusable rocket strategy is either making me earn back money, or lose it. Speaking of strategies....\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B/- Strategies. This is a bit of a different from my previous suggestions because I\u0027m implying that\u00A0the strategies be both improved upon (adding more) balanced, and removed.\u00A0While I don\u0027t have a concrete idea of what could be added here, but I\u0027d like to see some actual strategies involved. I\u0027ll expand on this a little bit in my next suggestion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B A simplified version of competition and alliances. For example, say WinterOwl is doing better than I am. They\u0027re getting most of the funds that are circling around this small economy. Therefore I want them to stop doing so well, and will activate a strategy that will make them lose money, and make me earn more. These strategies work very closely with the strategies that we have now, as if we do this, it\u0027ll be seen as an amazing person-ish move on our side, so we will lose reputation for it. In this hypothetical update, let\u0027s also assume I\u0027d like to help or collaborate with another company that\u0027s doing poorly. I can choose to activate a strategy that will make me lose some funds, but add reputation. It\u0027s really simple, but could make the gameplay more interesting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n- Remove the old strategies. All of them. I will expand on this on my next suggestion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Budgeting. If we go to the administration building, there can be a budgeting tab. In that tab, I can choose to either put more money into R\u0026amp;D, reputation, or invest it into something, with an interest rate. If I put it into R\u0026amp;D, I will lose the set amount of funds that I am putting into it, but will research techs quicker (I am actually gonna suggest something later on to expand on this). If I invest it into Reputation, my money will go to creating propa- *ahem* motivational rallies showing the greatness of our space program, creating reputation. If I choose to invest into some company or the government, I will earn a small amount of interest on the amount I put in, making me slowly earn more funds. This will all be handled in a screen in the administration building, where there will be 3 sliders, and I can divide them equally in percentages (i.e I have 100% I can use, I invest 40% Into R\u0026amp;D, 20% into reputation, and 40% into the investment. I feel this will work well with the statistics feature. Strategies will still be a thing with the competition and alliances features.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Allow you to filter contracts by companies.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Researching costs funds. Kerbonaut hiring is a set price along with monthly payments (for every month in action you have to pay them, if you fail to pay them the Kerbonaut will start to become unhappy, and loses XP points temporarily until the player has enough funds to pay them. This shouldn\u0027t be a problem.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u002B Recovering costs funds depending how far away something is. It can be set at ____Funds/KM or something. It also takes time. (Will be explained later)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I have for career mode updates, if you\u0027d like to suggest anything, go ahead and do it, I\u0027d welcome them. However before I finish this post I\u0027d like to suggest a little extra something. I\u0027m sure many of you have heard of the Kerbal Construction Time mod. It\u0027s a mod where rockets take time to build, buildings take time to upgrade, launchpads need to be refurbished, buildings take time to be repaired, and tech requires time to be researched. I suggest it\u0027s implemented into the base game. This will work well with the hypothetical features that have been suggested in this post. If you\u0027ve got this far, I thank you for reading, and as mentioned suggestions are welcome. If you agree that this should be a thing, please encourage Squad to add it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSincerely,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStelum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-14T16:31:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2016 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stelum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EA couple of new Ideas\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-14T20:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice!
