Along with the crew limits, there would be limits to fuel and electricity, and with each bit of fuel or electricity added, less space there is for crew. Discussion time!!! I think this would be helpful when sending up large colonies to orbit or to another planet. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T23:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Hitchhiker container is an early example of an habitation module in-game, with a crew capacity of four.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonolithic hab modules with greater crew capacities would require either insanely long or insanely wide fuselages, as well as internal space for amenities to support such a high population, which would be impractical to fly into orbit.
