And then you notice you forgot the landing gear or something equally silly, or that your design doesn\u0027t work well as a lander or something. You could use hyperedit, but that is not so handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo could we have a space craft simulator in the space center for testing our designs in other situations? One could design a vessel, and then try that out in a simulator. Simulator would have different options to start the vehicle from (From low orbit or surface of any planet). You could use this to test if your design works as a lander and can possibly return to orbit, or see if your SSTO can take off from other planet. Or you could even try to see if the design can do planetary transitions. (for this, you might want date/time setting for the simulator too)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay wise this would create a alternative universe, where there are no other objects but the simulated vessel and planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Time should also not advance much (maybe a bit, but simulators should be able to do the time compression without game time moving faster. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Actions in simulator would not field any science, and would not fill any mission conditions. I guess EVA should be disabled in this model too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Running the simulator should cost a little credits (fixed amount maybe? Or small % of ship cost) in \u0022programming fees\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Simulator could have multiple levels as a building, with higher levels locking more distant planets to be used in testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think?

If for example I would want to test if a lander can get down on Duna and up to orbit again to meet with main vessel, it would seem pretty silly to create the whole thing and fly it to Duna just to find out that the lander part does not work. Then you have to load your save, resign the lander, then fly again to other planet to test it. And maybe changes added too much mass, so now you can\u0027t even make it to the planet, and you must design your main vehicle again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecially if you are one of those who design stuff on gut instinct, I think it would be a nice option that you could test just one part. It would enable you to build programs in reverse so to speak. \u0022can this lander part get to orbit from the surface of other planet\u0022 -\u0026gt; \u0022what do I have to attach to that part to make a working lander?\u0022 -\u0026gt; \u0022what kind of delivery system do I need to get the lander on orbit?\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as said, this could be done with Hyperedit. But that will complete any missions and train the Kerbonauts. So I don\u0027t know if that is ideal way to do this. That is why I would like to see a simulator built in. I think it would be pretty easy, as it would simply save your old game, and start a new one with defined parameters (and when that one ends, you would return to your previous game.) From implementation POV it might be quite easy addition (not sure but based on my limited programming experience) so it would not be that much effort to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the same framework could also be used as a scenario editor, allowing people to create scenarios with their own designs, and maybe share them like ships.
