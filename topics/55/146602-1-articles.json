The ability to actually design a rocket and its capabilities would be excellent, I think. To decide what kind of fuel flow versus power output versus price\u00A0versus fail rate. This could be for many of the modules. Command modules with greater battery life at a cost of propellant or price tag. Construction materials that question price over durability or even the number of hard points for adding other modules. If a player doesn\u0027t want to construct their own KSP produced products, they could always default to the many companies eager to peddle their wares to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
