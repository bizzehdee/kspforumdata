I\u0027d love to revise these thoughts based on the suggestions of others.

Provides Revenue.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nRule #1, the idea has to be able to make money. Game developers have to eat too. Any suggestion, particularly ones that will be expensive to implement, has to provide a plan for how it will result in making money for SQUAD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample:\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdeas like new languages and new platforms provide clear revenue pathways -- these are new markets to attract new users.

Adds Complexity Appropriately\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou can\u0027t make the game more complicated for beginners. It\u0027s OK if the game becomes more complicated as play progresses, but this is a complicated game for most people, and expanding to a bigger audience is how the game will make money. It\u0027s OK to add \u0022option complexity\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Load and Clear\u0027s\u0022 CommNet and KerbNet\u00A0are a good examples of adding appropriate complexity, because signal strength doesn\u0027t really matter until the game is well underway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLife Support is a better concept for Mods, because it adds complexity right at the beginning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E4.\u00A0Be Fun\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is a category of suggestions that increases realism, but probably doesn\u0027t increase fun (for most people).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
