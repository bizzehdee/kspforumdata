From death\u0027s cold embrace in the depths of space to the hellish heat and pressure of Eve, your Kerbonauts never have anything to fear.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EI am here to change that fact.

Some things I recommend: a backpack slot, chest slot, helmet slot, and general clothing slot. Each of these slots can be filled with attachments.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EFor example: Jebediah Kerman is going to fly his hypersonic jetplane, but he is concerned about bailing out if things go down (which we are all sure it will, to some degree), so he equips his backpack slot with a parachute pack and customizes his uniform to make him look like a true BadS \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EAnother example, you might ask? Sure thing: Bill Kerman is going to space. He needs to go on EVA while in Kerbin orbit. Bill equips an RCS theuster backpack into his backpack slot and equips a tether rope to his chest (which he can alter the size through the R\u0026amp;D lab) for infinite oxygen but limited mobility.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EAnother example? Fine: Bob Kerman is going to land on Mun with his rover. Because there is no oxygen on the Mun, he equips an oxygen respirator to his chest, which he can refill by going over to his lander capsule or boarding his rover. Because of the Mun\u0027s small size and lack of metals at the core of the Mun, he equips weighted boots to his feet slot, which will help keep his weight on the Mun down (for ease of use, you can adjust these weights before launch). Due to the threat of nightime landing on the Mun, Bob also equips his helmet with a flashlight that has a narrow, but long field of view. If he were conducting EVA in orbit, he might want a wide, but short, field of view. Because he wants to stay in contact with mission control at all times, Bob eqiups his personal radio pack so he can transmit all those EVA reports.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ENow, I know what you\u0027re all thinking: OP, this is an amazing addition and a testimate to your brilliance and fashion choices, but how will I equip my Kerbonauts with this technology? Never fear! You simply make your way over to the training center and build your suit. Equip your suits with the right tools for the job!?

After sitting on the idea for a day or so, I realized that this different tree would have to cost less in science than the main tree. It wouldn\u0027t make sense to pay 160 science for an enhanced respirator and boots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome additional ideas I came up with was the default suit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the start, your EVA suit has a standard helmet with no real features. Some future helmet unlocks might include a sun shield to give more science during daytime EVA (you won\u0027t want the sun in your Kerbal\u0027s eyes, would you?), helmet lights for enhanced vision and more nightime EVA science, and heat treated helmet which protects your Kerbal in reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your backpack, you have an RCS pack that is really weak and inadequate for use even on Mun. Later enhancements may include a \u0022backpack 2 and 3\u0022 slot that is basically a fuel, oxygen, or radio pack on either side of your main pack. Other enhancements may include better thruster packs, parachutes, as stated in my original post, and the last enhancement, a rebreather. Keep in mind: these side tanks could be combined, so you could have a radio pack and an oxygen tank, or an RCS tank and an oxygen tank, or even two oxygen tanks or two RCS tanks. Parachutes and rebreathers, however, are large packs that take up the main slot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the chest rig. The chest rig includes an oxygen respirator that holds about 1 minute of oxygen or have a tether that provides infinite oxygen supply, but severely limits mobility down to 5 meters in any direction from the capsule. Later enhancments include longer tethers, up to 100 meters, or longer lasting, but not infinite, respirators, going up to one hour of oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen comes the legs slot. The legs slot includes a default setup that has no advantages. Later upgrades include weighted boots, cushioned boots (which lessen impacts, each new one improving on the last; can be used on higher gravity worlds like Eve, Laythe, Kerbin, and Duna), and spring boots (that enhance your jump height).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for suit customization, there could be suit designs that are default and edited. You can add new suits like you could add flags.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-30T18:30:18Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2014 06:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Carl Sagan The S Stallion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T11:43:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy even a tech tree?
