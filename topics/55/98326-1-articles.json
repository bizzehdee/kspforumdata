When you recover a part it will enter into your recovered inventory. You will receive a credit for it (minus fuel or other resources) the next time you use it in the VAB or SPH. If you recover an assembly (like a fully assembled spaceplane) it enters your inventory and you can choose at a time to restore/reconfigure for the next flight. There should be a small refurbishment fee for parts and you have to replenish the fuel. You should also have the choice to break the recovered assembly down into parts which would offer the same VAB/SPH credit as described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like think this would add a few appealing aspects to the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You could have individual vessels that begin to define a legacy (the 5th flight of the Falcon or something like that; i\u0027m not implying that craft build experience just the nostalgia)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. When you recover a rocket stage/spaceplane you can not turn that into a science probe for the next mission. It makes much more sense to refurb and refuel that stage and launch again to realize the financial benefit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-31T15:23:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eagree, it would just need an other building which keeps the recovered vehicles, dont destroy them but takes science from them, refuel them and you could modify them. it was my first disappointment when i\u0027ve started to play this game ages ago that there is nothing like this...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
