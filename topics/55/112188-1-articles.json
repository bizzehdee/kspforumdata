Obviously, this isn\u0027t a suggestion for playing dress-up, as Kerbals are rarely seen outside of their spaceship except for when you accidentally make Jeb go on an spontaneous EVA whilst attempting to get into orbit or when you\u0027re collecting scientific data.\n\n I propose items such as data storage units, that allow Kerbals, with different tiers of course, to collect multiple pieces of scientific data whilst on an EVA. These could even be split into storage units for surface samples and EVA reports. Naturally, this specific piece of equipment may seem overpowered, but may become of use if extra solar systems or planets are added, as spending hours to get to a planet to land in a specific place to get two bits of data, then return to the ship and travel for long periods of time on foot to retrieve data could, and in some occasions is, become tedious for the player. \n\nAs for cockpits, extra functions such as ejector seats, escape pods, or other such additions could assist in keeping Kerbals alive, which, though it\u0027s interesting to watch them disappear in a puff of smoke, can save players funds and real time trying to build up experience on a new Kerbal. To prevent these from being too commonplace and to ensure the survival of KSP\u0027s infamy as a cold blooded murderer of its adorable green men, random failures and high research and funds costs could be implemented. \n\nThese additions could add more realism (Which some players strive for) and extra complexity (I know I, at least, love lots of game elements) to KSP\u0027s already impressive world. I\u0027m definitely not an experienced programmer, having only completed a couple of little projects in an obscure language, but I know that coding and fitting new features into a program is incredibly hard and takes a long time, *definitely* more so if the program is already well-established and thousands of lines long, so I realize that my gaming mind *may* have asked too much in this suggestion, but I propose it as a section of a future larger update, if you developers, and fellow KSP players, like it enough to think it worth hours of work to add it to the game. As typical of a suggestion for any game, yes, yes, I think it\u0027s a great idea, and yes, I think it would be a cool addition to the game, but I will be serious with one common aspect of suggestions. Thank you for at least taking time to read this, and especially thank you if it\u0027s added to the game. \n\nOh, and as a side note, great job on 1.0. I\u0027ve never been able to get the hang of planes before, but now I can land the cockpits of my ships with no landing gear or parachutes thanks to the wings attached precariously to the side. Valentina Kerman is most definitely an ace pilot. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
