But making the game more difficult for the sake of making it more realistic isn\u0027t what KSP is really about. Yes it needs tweaking to make things a little less exploitative (flapping ships that fly?) but it in no way needs to become an engineering task. Especially for those who want nothing to do with it. (Rocket Flyers)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI generally agree with your post, but I have to ask, how is making the aero model work in a more realistic manner making things difficult for difficulty\u0027s sake? It has been said many times in this thread: FAR should not be stock, but stock needs to take a step towards FAR. To boot, FAR is not at all difficult and is much more intuitive, and easy to use, than the stock aero model because it follows a more realistic model (and quite frankly, there\u0027s a lot of realism that ferram4 hasn\u0027t put into FAR). Furthermore, there\u0027s no need to make this a \u0022checkbox\u0022 sort of thing; the sad fact of the matter is that the current aero model is terrible and needs to go away because it teaches new players the wrong things, and they cannot draw from real world experience. People who are primarily rocket flyers, like me, will also appreciate the ability to make a proper \u0022gravity turn\u0022 instead of the current \u0022lol climb straight up\u0022 model (and when we step into the airplane world, it won\u0027t be such a mind-boggling experience).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T20:29:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ippo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ippo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually FAR makes the game *easier*, so...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you explain your reasoning for thinking this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FenrirWolf","CreatedById":72121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T20:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould you explain your reasoning for thinking this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresumably because getting into LKO takes around 1k less delta-v when your atmosphere isn\u0027t made of soup.
