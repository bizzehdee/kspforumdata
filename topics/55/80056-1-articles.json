To support the weight of the ship, you have to apply as much power to the shuttle as the main liquid engines and solid rocket boosters in order for the vehicle as a whole to be stabilized. But that\u0027s not easily accomplished as you can only control general throttle. It\u0027d be neat to have a secondary throttle gauge or even a whole numbered panel for different throttling positions for different engines so that you can lower the throttle to the max thrust of a smaller engine and have SAS control the difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T01:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can adjust the Thrust Limiter setting in the engines\u0027 context menu in order to achieve this.
