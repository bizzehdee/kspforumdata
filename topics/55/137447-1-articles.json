I think if you\u0027re going to buy craft designs, it would be more useful with a more complete overhaul. You design a rocket, but before you use it you pay its design fee. Once you pay it once you can use it again much more cheaply, but any additional things on top of it (your actual probes) will require another design fee. This would leave you with a fleet of launch vehicles that you use regularly, with updated designs coming at a price. Premade crafts could maybe be more expensive? It would be a level of realism, and would add more complexity to career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus idea if multiplayer becomes a thing: sell your craft designs on an exchange, you get money every time someone uses your design.
