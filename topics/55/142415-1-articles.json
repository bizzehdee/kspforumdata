If they were coloured, maybe I\u0027d be able to remember that I\u0027m interested in the blue and orange ones etc. I do try giving them appropriate symbols but that only helps some of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00225lBLrcB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5lBLrcB.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T16:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be awesome - no more issues with figuring out which orbit belongs to which craft when docking.

Cyan, Yellow, Orange, Purple, and Red are all in use already by Craft, Target, and 3 Node/Encounter colors.\u00A0\u00A0 So how many distinguishable colors could you add?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I would find much more useful is if the craft icon itself would change color when targeted.\u00A0 Many times two craft are sitting visually on top of each other and I can\u0027t tell which one is my target.\u00A0 Even though the orbit is yellow, the icon is still white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
