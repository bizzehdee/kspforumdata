Basically, by moving the mouse in control mode, you can control the robotic arm in two axis. I believe this could be a superb addition for docking mode, or precision RCS in general. My idea therefore is to have the mouse able to control attitude while in docking mode, freeing up WASD for translation controls, and leaving RCS a lot more intuitive to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T09:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice. However, how would you move the camera?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-03T09:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood point. Perhaps only activate the mouse controls while pressing Alt, or locking the camera to the same button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
