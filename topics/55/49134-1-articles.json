The Lander got onto Duna safely, but I found one design flaw; no Drill. That\u0027s when I come here. I suggest that a drilling probe be added to the game in the next update, so that unmanned lander\u0027s can take in Soil samples and analyze them without Kerbal\u0027s doing it instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
