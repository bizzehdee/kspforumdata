I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m not 100 percent enthusiastic about the way it\u0027s currently set up myself now that I\u0027ve had a bit more time to play with it, and I would like to see something being done with it that makes it truly unique and useful and not just a \u0022booster\u0022 for probes. Thus, I\u0027m proposing the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKeep the ability to reset \u0022used\u0022 experiment modules.\u003C/strong\u003E This is incredibly handy.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERework the experiments processing into a full-fledged new feature rather than a transmission cap boost.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo elaborate on that second point, I\u0027m basically envisioning the Lab as a module where kerbonaut scientists can run more advanced and more rigorous \u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E experiments on materials than they could with the scant equipment available in a non-specialty pod, and can cross-reference the data they get with data from other experiments as well. Thus, I\u0027m going to propose making this change to the science processing system: Instead of \u0022boosting\u0022 a single report, my idea has you processing two reports together into a single, advanced report.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo go into a little more detail:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERather than being \u0022enhanced,\u0022 the two reports are consumed to create an all-new \u0022advanced\u0022 report with a value independent of its sources.\u003C/strong\u003E In other words, you can use it to \u0022recycle\u0022 reports that you\u0027ve already exhausted through conventional means and bring in some fresh science.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAll advanced reports transmit for 100% value.\u003C/strong\u003E This allows the Science Lab to more effectively serve as a \u0022science hub\u0022 without any need to constantly return vehicles to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEach particular report combination only works once.\u003C/strong\u003E This will help cut down on the \u0022science spam\u0022 while at the same time encouraging players to explore more of the solar system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBonuses are awarded for combining two similar reports, but you\u0027ll be penalized if they\u0027re \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Etoo\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E similar.\u003C/strong\u003E Again, this is to encourage players to explore and experiment with different combinations.
