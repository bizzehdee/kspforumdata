Recently I sent a satellite into the orbit, and it has few antennas. I deployed them so the satellite looks cool. And once I transmit the data antenna retracts and I can\u0027t manually deploy it anymore, it only deploys when it\u0027s transmitting data. So it\u0027d be nice if this get fixed in the next update, thanks in advance ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
