It would also be cool to see a 2 kerbal capsule, but I\u0027d be more interested in a 2.5-3.75m 6 kerbal pod sloped to match the C7 adapter. We don\u0027t have anything in this size range and it would be really great for larger planetary missions. I\u0027m thinking it should be about 5t, expensive, and have high heat and impact ratings.
