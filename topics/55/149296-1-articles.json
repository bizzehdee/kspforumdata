What about localization?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRussia is, definitely, a country associated with the space. But there are no official russian version of KSP. So I translated it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently I translated the descriptions of all parts of the game (1.1.3), given the subtlety, humor and specific stylistic features. I know the Russian language well, for example, I fit A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S. abbreviation in Russian word A.E.R.O.T.O.R.M.O.Z., saving the whole point. Also, I translated companies\u0027 descriptions, strategies, etc. Russian community appreciated my translation and made it recommended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could translate the texts of contracts, interface and encyclopedia, but it\u0027s harder to do because of more changing the game files. So I haven\u0027t decided to do that, because the format of these files may completely change during development and everything I do can become useless. Some phrases can be translated using the module manager functions, some phrases can be translated only by taking root in the game files. It\u0027s impossible to make a complete translation in the mod format.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I want to ask the developers. Is it possible to make the language files more universal? Or perhaps you can tell how exactly you\u0027ll change the files. And can I get KSPedia textless screens? Or perhaps the miracle happens and you\u0027ll make a single format for all game sentences, and even scientist in the lab won\u0027t disappear, even if he\u0027ll be called \u0022ucheniy\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be very grateful, and not just me. Therefor, I can at least offer you russian localization of 1.2 for free, and maybe I\u0027ll do something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-05T00:15:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLocalisation was mentioned by Squad at some point, and before 1.1 was released, rumours said it would come out with 1.2 with code implementation as soon as\u00A01.1.

Since then, nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere have been a lot of changes in the Squad team recently, and 1.2 is coming out soon without any clear idea of what will follow, so I\u0027m thinking it might be a good time to ping Squad about this.
