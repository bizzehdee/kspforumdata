But I\u0027m thinking of wider distro here. A lot of people are not going to peak under the hood of their OS or write a script to to this. My suggestion is that the game core should do it in the background as standard. Otherwise it\u0027s not an improvement suggestion but rather a gentle hack.\n\nSO... you are correct, it could be addressed by a clever custom install and an attentive maintenance procedure - but that\u0027s not what I was envisioning."}]}
