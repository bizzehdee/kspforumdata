I would set the time of activation of the gear to null/0 and the time of the light to 3 seconds. After activating action group 1, it would immediately activate the gear going up, and then 3 seconds later the light would turn on.\n\nAs an application i think it could be great to drop probes onto the surface without leaving the ship which if done properly could automatically activate thrusters/parachutes, gears, antennas, solar panels ect. all without having to babysit a craft. It could be used for sending craft into space without **being** there. Maybe a rover that could be sent forward and told to break a days later, without you having to control it directly. \n\nIt could basically be used to control a lot of things without having to directly be there, it would be amazing."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T08:15:16Z","Content":"There are A LOT of things you can do with timers, and indeed I wish them too.\n\n\u002Brep."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T09:26:57Z","Content":"Timers would add so so much to the game. \n\nStaging AND action group timers. \n\nThere are so many possibilities with this!\n\nA drag and drop script builder would be my preferred choice way of doing it.\n\nImagine completely automating your rocket launch with this. \n\n(It\u0027s not \u0022auto pilot\u0022 if the player decides when things happen ahead of time)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T09:29:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 09:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Capt Snuggler**"},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T10:05:41Z","Content":"I fully agree it would be amazing ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nIt would work just like in real world where NASA sends probe to Mars and during atmospheric entry only software (basically coded time based actions) is piloting craft."},{"CreatedByName":"h4didact","CreatedById":140792,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T13:36:20Z","Content":"Great idea.

Would there be an if-then option for contingency planning? Other than that, this sounds like a pretty good idea. It could also teach a little bit about coding. Perhaps when you next got on, it could notify you of which plan your autonomous craft was on. Perhaps if a rover flipped over and broke its solar panels, it could then try to right itself and go into hibernation mode (brakes on, SAS torque off, etc). It could then notify you when you got to the space center view. You could then decide what to do next. \n\n-Vec"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T21:23:27Z","Content":"KOS?\n\n10 char"}]}
