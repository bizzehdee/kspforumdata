As Scott Manley showed, you can max the tech tree in TWO flights (I know it\u0027s Scott Manley, but still). I do, however, like the idea of science. So I thought of a different kind of science: Experimental science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of random goo experiments that offer arbitrary points to unlock completely unrelated things, the experiments could be offered in a few categories: Structural, Electrical, and Rocketry. The structural one is what comes to mind the easiest for me, so that will be the one I explain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine having a large rocket, one prone to flexing. Put some \u0022stress meters\u0022 on it (stress meters would be available in the utility/experiments tab), and let her loose. The stress meters would measure the flex of the rocket, and once you\u0027ve done enough experimentation with it, you will have enough Structural points to purchase improved parts. But that\u0027s not all. Once you\u0027ve maxed out the tech tree for structural parts, the stress meters would still have some advantages. The more you stress your rocket, the more the Kerbals learn about stress, and \u003Cem\u003Ethe stronger they can make the connections between parts.\u003C/em\u003E What I\u0027m saying is that the more you use your rockets and the more you push them, the stronger they will become. This system will \u003Cem\u003Ereward\u003C/em\u003E those who do the crazy and outlandish, because they would end up with overall stronger rockets. This has a much stronger feeling of \u0022science\u0022 to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, we could put the old school experiments (Gravi-tron) to good use. Say, for example, you want to do a landing/return on the planet Eve. Obviously you want to get to the highest point, right? Since I assume KSP doesn\u0027t model different Mass Concentrations, we can assume that the highest point also has the lowest gravity on the surface. So, strap a gravi-tron and some sort of radio projector onto a basic survey sat, and put it in orbit around EVE. Now, turn on the Gravi-tron and wait...eventually you\u0027ll have a map of the gravity field on the surface of Eve, with red being areas of high gravity and blue being areas of low gravity (It would also be useful if this map could be overlayed over the planet in map mode). This may not unlock any science points, but it would provide something useful to the player: A map of the gravity field around Eve, which could be used to have more complicated missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this all seems idealistic and quite difficult to implement, but I feel like this would be a much better way to do science. It rewards experimentation and encourages the design of crazy rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T18:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour design may reward experimentation but it doesn\u0027t reward exploration, which seems to be one of the core concepts of the game. This system would basically ignore all landings, sample returns, and most experiments in space. I feel the current system works very well if you don\u0027t abuse it. I did a career mode run without transmitting anything except readings from detectors (gravioli, seismic, etc.) and crew reports, and I had to do many flights and a 3 ship Jool mission to unlock the whole tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the grinding aspect will be irrelevant with the .23 update anyway, which will fix the ability to gain all the science just by transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaito","CreatedById":65793,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T19:51:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was just an idea for structural science.

This is exactly what I had in mind, but couldn\u0027t put into words. I\u0027d be cautious with forcing good players to resort to pointless explosions, though.

Obviously the Main Sail is better in a Vacuum, but the Nuclear Engine is better than all of them, just because it\u0027s designed differently. Having a ship designed specifically for testing different engines at different altitudes would mean \u0022discovering\u0022 the nuclear engine sooner, merely because instead of just passively observing the engine and assuming it\u0027s fine, you actively tried to make the best of your design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dwight_js","CreatedById":83255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...be cautious with forcing good players to resort to pointless explosions...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, you wouldn\u0027t want to force everyone down one linear path.

Like slope analysis to find flat spots for landing and base-building. Or they could analyze surface composition to identify areas with possibly useful natural resources. Follow up missions could then analyze surface samples to confirm the chemical composition of the soil, and placement of seismic sensors and the use of an \u0022impactor\u0022 satellite could determine the size of the deposit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope the developers explore these types of hands-on and relevant science instead of just \u0022click for points\u0022 options.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JSD","CreatedById":57153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dwight_js\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dwight_js\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love this idea.
