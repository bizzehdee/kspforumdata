But there are no 0.625 meter SRBs or upper stage SRMs at all. These would add to the game in quite a way.\n\nWhat if you don\u0027t need those 1.25 meter boosters, but something less? Then a 0.625 meter booster is a good size, right?\n\nWhat if you want a cheap rocket, and using liquid upper stages would be too expensive? Then a solid upper stage could help out a lot.\n\nI\u0027m thinking the 0.625 booster could be modeled after the GEM series of boosters. And the solid upper stage (SUS?) could be modeled after a Star motor.\n\nBasically, solid motors need some love in KSP.\n\nNot to mention that it\u0027s showing an image of solids being used only as boosters, when they were used many times as upper stages.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOr even bigger solids, maybe 2.5 meter diameter. This isn\u0027t unrealistic at all. Since the INT-05 was a saturn IB with a 260 inch SRB first stage (rivaling, well, the S-IB stage) was a seriously considered launch vehicle.\n\nEDIT2: \n\nThrust Vectoring, too. It\u0027s an actual thing. But on the smaller boosters it would be a bit overpowered.\n\nEDIT3:\n\nThe RT-5 Flea is a nice addition to the game, however, a smaller 0.625 meter design is preferred.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T23:19:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bill Phil**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T00:22:57Z","Content":"To take this in another direction: I\u0027d like some larger solid boosters as well.
