So mission fail conditions are broken. The recover \u0022scrap\u0022 element showed \u0022failed\u0022 which is correct. So failing the scrap recovery broke the recognition of the other mission element. So the condition logic is wrong somewhere.\n\nAlso I would like to comment that the mission conditions should warn us about larger objects. The tracking station showed simply that it was a Size A \u0022smallest\u0022 object. I don\u0027t think a Science lab is the same size as a capsule, shouldn\u0027t there be something to indicate the weight or at least the size?"}]}
