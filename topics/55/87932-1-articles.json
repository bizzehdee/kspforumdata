Don\u0027t get me wrong: personally I\u0027d love to eventually have some sort of \u0022orbital dry dock\u0022 in which to build large interplanetary vehicles. But that\u0027s beside the point. Apart from convenience: these don\u0027t serve a great deal of purpose in KSP\u0027s current state. But it did spawn an idea which since the implimentation of destructable buildings did seem like something with merit: a secondary launch site for smaller vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s face it: if you\u0027ve played career mode currently, you\u0027ve realized that you will inevitably end up with a good number of one-shot, semi-expendable rockets designed to test one or two parts and collect the contract rewards. It isn\u0027t really practical to go for a half dozen of these or so at once simply from the altitude and speed requirements being occasionally radically different. SO my idea was: what if you could conduct these flights with nno risk of breaking stuff at the KSC, and the answer I thought up was: a launch ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow before you say that this is inpractical, this is a real thing that companies use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Launch\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic idea here is thus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Spend X amount of funding to build/purchase the secondary site (ie: ship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It can then be accessed from the menu, same as the VAB or hanger\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- its interface would basically be identical to the VAB, but with some additional rules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Those rules: the ship you build, unlike at the KSC, will have an upper cap on its launch mass and footprint, thus making these factors for the first time (besides cost obviously)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the advantages: 1) that the ship could be placed at an \u0022optimal\u0022 equatorial site by default, 2) there is no risk to your KSC buildings on take off, and 3) in the event that you do total the launch ship (somehow) you could buy another, possibly for a cheaper price than repairing one or more KSC structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- This also lends itself naturally to the \u0022upgradable\u0022 thing that I\u0027ve seen being kicked around, ie: a larger ship with higher caps on tonnage and footprint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts? It\u0027s kind of a halfway-house between the current single-site, and the more open \u0022let us build anywhere\u0022 concept I\u0027ve seen posted. Personally I think it\u0027d make for an interesting game play element: first with the limitations on the size of your rockets launched from it, and the principal that instead of starting with it, you would have to \u0022invest\u0022 in the sea launch site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T04:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of having secondary launch locations. I wouldn\u0027t use the ship much but I\u0027d try it out at least once and be happy to have it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively it could be nice to transport a rocket on a boat before launch to get it into an ideal launch location. I usually like the KSC equator but sometimes other parts of the globe are more ideal. Water transport may be slow but it could be fairly cheap compared to other forms of transportation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
