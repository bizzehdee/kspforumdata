Their launch profiles were as identical as you can get without resorting to an autopilot, too.

Definitely should have reached orbit each time, however; the profile is close enough to optimal for that. It\u0027s outlined above in terms of angle and altitude, and the rocket used is also outlined (it was a very simple vertical stack, so everything is listed in order), meaning you should be able to reproduce it easily if you want to test for yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodlance","CreatedById":115299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T06:14:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere is my fix to the problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i didnt post it here, didnt notice it , here :\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMKWqxJ-z9I?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022fix\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T06:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SkyRender\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SkyRender\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, but I have noticed a strange phenomenon wherein the time of day of the launch somehow messes with rocket launch efficiency. A rocket launched at exactly midday will somehow be more efficient going into orbit than one launched at dawn or sunset. This... makes no sense, but my tests have been fairly conclusive. Exact same technique for each launch, but the sunset and sunrise rockets need an extra ~300dV to reach orbit than the midday launches no matter how well I fly them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1) I have not noticed this, and I doubt KSP models this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2) (also addressed to the posts that follwed yours), there is a real world explanation.
