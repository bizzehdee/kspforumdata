This is why we see struts all over Cessnas or modern biplanes. \u00A0(Antique biplanes used struts and wires to maintain the rigidity of the wing box due to the limitations of spruce and other materials at the time, but I digress.).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, can we get a slider that trades overall craft mass for overall craft rigidity? \u00A0That would get us thinking about when to use struts v. When to use heavier materials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T07:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play on Xbox so I didn\u0027t have a chance to work with auto struts in 1.2 yet. \u00A0I guess this is already addressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
