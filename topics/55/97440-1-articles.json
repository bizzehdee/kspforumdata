I think it would be an incredibly useful addition to get a slider or some sort of graphic that shows if you are using your air usage poorly or are being efficient. For example, if you are able to add to your air availability then the slider should show green whereas if you are being incredibly wasteful then it should show red. I believe this would help people understand the flying profile for SSTO\u0027s or fuel powered engines at various altitudes/speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-22T14:32:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKerbal Flight Data\u003C/em\u003E should be made stock, yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s1378.photobucket.com/user/craigmotbey/media/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Stratos/screenshot856_zpsa2a189b8.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1378.photobucket.com/albums/ah120/craigmotbey/Kerbal/Beta/Kerbodyne%20Showroom/Stratos/screenshot856_zpsa2a189b8.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot856_zpsa2a189b8.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you mean by efficient air use, though?

I constantly find myself pointing towards the ground (still maintaining positive vertical speed) in order to maintain a minimal air availability loss. Once I nose up, it goes from 0.1 to 0.7. Maybe it\u0027s my misunderstanding of using air breathing engines as I\u0027m still rather new to them, I was merely suggesting possibly getting a slider that shows if you\u0027re being wasteful or being conservative.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
