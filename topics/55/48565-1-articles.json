You can have a space race, you can collaborate, you can do whatever you want and have some fun with it. For example, you could make an international space station together. Everything would be in real time, and all players would have to agree to all timewarps and pauses in the game (It wouldn\u0027t be too much of an issue because I\u0027m thinking only 2 or 3 players max). Hopefully it wouldn\u0027t be too harsh on the system. I don\u0027t know much about optimization and all that, but it seems to me that if you limited max debris or something, it could be manageable. The possibilities are endless, and this would be boatloads of fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T02:39:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35310-The-L-O-G-Multiplayer-Project\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe LOG Project\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awass","CreatedById":77431,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T02:41:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheCanadianVendingMachine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheCanadianVendingMachine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35310-The-L-O-G-Multiplayer-Project\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe LOG Project\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am glad that this is a thing, but are there any plans to put this into the stock game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T02:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will not be included in the stock game anytime soon, per the developers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever several mod projects appear to be working on implementing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, please refer to the what not to suggest list found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer is among the listed suggestions we have either heard too much of or know will not be added anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
