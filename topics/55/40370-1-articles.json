It would be great if one could set as an option to have the game automatically switch to no time acceleration -1m from the next nav node. Maybe allow setting when the time warp should drop to 1X but -1m seems reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very high time warps are specially tricky with irregular orbits as one goes from Kerbal to the Mun as the ship moves very slowly at first and suddenly accelerates as it enters Mun orbit. So it\u0027s pretty easy to miss the orbital encounter nav node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T06:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t a bad idea but I think one thing that would help would be a timeline view in the map screen (assuming we can time warp from the map screen at some future date, which is a feature we REALLY should have), in which the time of future manuever nodes is marked on the timeline, with \u0022now\u0022 on the lefthand side, and the scale of the timeline zooms with the map view zoom. (so when zoomed far out, the timeline shows several years of time, as would be needed for looking at interplanetary intercepts, but when zoomed in tighter it might only show a day or two of time, as would be needed for maneuvers in orbit around a planet or moon.).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scorpi15","CreatedById":34189,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T11:07:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are having too much trouble you can use the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod. It allows you to set alarms that can drop you out of warp a set time from a specific point, be it a SoI change or maneuver node. And if you do get it then you might as well get the Advanced Maneuver Node mod, that allows you to set your nodes with a even greater accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T19:26:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scorpi15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scorpi15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you are having too much trouble you can use the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m aware of the mod. But I\u0027ll say the same thing to you that I say to anyone who replies like this to a suggestion thread. Suggestions are about the core game, not about mods. And the existence of a mod as a workaround to a problem in the main game should never be a reason to stifle suggestions about making the main game better. After all, a lot of the new improved map view screen is stuff that used to require the Haystack mod. The existence of Haystack shouldn\u0027t have meant that the main game\u0027s behavior on the map screen should have remained as it was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
