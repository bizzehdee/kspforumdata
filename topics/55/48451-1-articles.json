I get that a lot of us like the whole \u0022Kerbals are incompetent expendables\u0022 mentality, but not all of us feel this way, I believe Bac9 said as much in a blog. I\u0027d like career mode to at least have the option(and perhaps some sort of bonus) to focus on keeping Kerbals alive, including using probes for testing spacecraft, and one-way flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, as some people have raised, the science points sound excessively generic and gamey.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, if the glovebox isn\u0027t part of enhanced IVA, that\u0027s an issue, because it does not make sense for that to go outside the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at what mods are popular.

All that requires is a bit of planning, estimate how long your mission will be and pack supplies accordingly. That adds a lot to gameplay IMO. I consider KSP a simulator. The simulator-game distinction is a silly discussion, and like I said, you can look at the add-on forum and see that many of us want a simulator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe glovebox is the box with globes, posted in a preview.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T08:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of us do want a game, some want a simulator.

You\u0027re free to play KSP as you see fit and if that\u0027s with mods that add complexity that\u0027s great, but in the end this is a space related game, and not a simulator \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: people who seek complexity shouldn\u0027t be ignored and in my opinion they really aren\u0027t: mods like IonCross are great, but the reason there are so many mods is that Squad has written an extensive API that allows mod makers to add to KSP relatively easily\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"possum","CreatedById":84085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T08:47:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is the ultimate sandbox, even the career mode. The easy of which mods can be added allows the game to be molded into whatever you want it to be. If you want a sim make it a sim. The game being built more as a game makes it more appealing to a wider audience. If the career mode is not the way you want to play don\u0027t play it, go to the sandbox mode and give yourself your own restraints to how you want to play. Harvester said in an interview that the dev\u0027s are constantly trying to find a balance between fun and realism. They tend to lean more toward the fun side but KSP is so easy to mod it rest with the user to make the game what they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
