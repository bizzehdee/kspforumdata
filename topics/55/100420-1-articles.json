The market share is small (definitely smaller than GNU/Linux), but on the other hand you\u0027d have the lead as there is literally no games for BSD operating systems (excluding [obviously meh stuff](http://www.freebsd.org/ports/games.html))\n\nBut you\u0027d probably not get much money from it anyway. Still, I see you are the developers who don\u0027t put the money before everything else (why otherwise focus on Linux and continue working on a game, while most Early Access just cash in and release ....), hence why I\u0027d like to ask if at least you consider it as a future possibility. Your game works in Wine, but I\u0027m pretty sure you know how (un)reliable Wine is, especially for games ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"NWM","CreatedById":67386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T21:22:33Z","Content":"Men,\n\nThere is a BSD-Linux compatibility layer (like wine) for almost each BSD-distro working quite a fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T22:18:00Z","Content":"My FreeBSD box appears to be able to run linux binaries natively, although as it\u0027s a server I\u0027ve not tried X11 apps ( and there\u0027s never been a reason to do that either ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) ).
