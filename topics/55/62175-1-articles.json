Especially when switching between the two. I often have to deal with pilot-induced oscillation - the pilot being the computer, not me. It would help a lot to be able to adjust these and others during flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tweakables I desire are \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Rate of adjustment (in degrees/sec)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Maximum angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Linear progression or user defined (increase or decrease in rate, nice for keyboard flyers)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was about to yell at you since they can be tweaked, then I saw \u0022durring flight\u0022 yea good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
