It will be a huge project realised by many countries across the Kerbin.\u0022 in any test video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be four types of contracts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Where you need to make your own module: \u0022Can you \u003Cstrong\u003Ebuild and send\u003C/strong\u003E new truss piece to support larger solar panels?\u0022 or \u0022Station is getting overppulated so can you build and send new habitat module?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Where you need to send existing module for other companies \u0022We are happy to announce, that C7 areospace is joining the Duna Orbital Station project. We\u0027ve just tested our new science lab, but we haven\u0027t got rocket big enough to lift it up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E into space, Can you help us?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Where you need to launch first module for new station \u0022We highly recommend you to stert new orbital sation around Laythe, it will make manned mission to this body easier. Are you interested?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Where you need to move your station from one place to another or deorbit it: \u0022We collected almost all science we can get from the Minimus, so Minimus Station we don\u0027t need it anymore here, still we haven\u0027t explored Eve yet. It would be great to move it there.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey will unlock after first docking on the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve got another idea for space stations - when you switch type of vessel to \u0022station\u0022 You will be able to choose your station\u0027s name when all modules still have their own names, and you can view their parameters separately in the orbit, and after clicking on the station in orbital view it will show you number of docked modules in it\u0027s parameters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T12:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it, the last bit about naming the modals seems like it would be a bit tricky to implement but possible i suppose. I feel that ideas like this and the others all over the forum are going to be looked at when they finish up contracts in the next update.
