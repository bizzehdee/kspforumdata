There are new engines that cross the border such as the \u0022Vernor\u0022 engine and the \u0022Puff\u0022\u00A0RCS engine that consumes more but gives more power. To get the same sort of performance as the engines have now, you\u0027d have to consume way more monopropellant, and by the time that comes up it\u0027s better just to stick to rocket engines anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlus, the LF/O engines and RCS thrusters are noticeably different in construction. It wouldn\u0027t make much sense to be able to switch, though of course you could always mod the game to do so if you wish, I\u0027m pretty sure its possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, of course, is the fuel problem. If you were to have, say, a \u0022Rhino\u0022 engine pumping monopropellant rather than LF/O, you\u0027d have to have massive tanks full of the fuel, which we don\u0027t realistically have. Largest ones I can think of are stacks of FL-R1s, which would become pretty unstable if stacked too much without reinforcement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - Doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense logistically, current systems are better in theory and practice anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-14T21:18:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2016 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Maximus97\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-14T22:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think he\u0027s suggesting engines being convertible between LF/O and monopropellant.
