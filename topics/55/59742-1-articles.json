The only real issue is that mouse movements are obviously only two-dimensional - you\u0027d still need to use the keyboard for roll, better than nothing though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T08:27:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, Yes, YES!

Also, no this would mean we need to use the keyboard for yaw, not roll. If it is implemented like warthunder, moving the mouse to the side will roll and pitch at the same time. The closer to the \u0022Dead-Zone\u0022 (as you called it) the mouse is, the less it will roll and pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Denodon","CreatedById":103476,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T11:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would indeed be an interesting feature to have. I have not yet had any success in getting my (admittedly old) joystick to work with KSP so I have had to sate myself with using the keyboard to fly the maneuvers. I mostly see the mouse flying ability as being something you could toggle (like in FSX with Ctrl\u002BY) as I would really only use it one already in the air when fine maneuvers are needed. For take off I prefer the strong response of the keyboard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf123","CreatedById":77544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-02T23:36:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really want this to happen!
