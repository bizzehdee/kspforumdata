First of i like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then i disslike that science components are SOOOOO small and u can put all those stuff so easly and they dont give any disadvantages for now, would like to see them bigger and with some actual weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see more science components as well. Next one is that u can repeat science with one ship for example as low orbit of mun until it wont give u any more science, i truly disslike that it kind of brakes all the fun. I think it would be much more fun when having a \u0022few science components\u0022 on one ship would be max or they would just have a bigger weight so it would be harder to have all of them on one ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tracer","CreatedById":72149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T14:42:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess a thermometer is pretty small \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see them implement some science components that give you science over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, science labs that you can put on space stations that, when manned by a kerbal, generate x science per day / week / month\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd telescopes - visible, Ir, uv, etc\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T17:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI somehow assume that telescopes are de facto something we\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll get at some future update ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eafter all one of the planned features are undiscovered planets in the Kerbol system ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t see any other way to discover them than with telescopes\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
