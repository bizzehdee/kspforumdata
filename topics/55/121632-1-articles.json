It could default to white, but you could change the color in the \u0022change name\u0022 dialog where you currently set the name and icon. You could also do this in the tracking station UI for the currently active vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t need a lot of colors, just give a few basic ones (say, red/blue/green).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracking station would not only allow assigning colors, but would also have checkboxes for filtering by color, the way it currently allows filtering by icon type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason I want this feature: In games where I have very large numbers of ships, it\u0027s awfully hard to keep track of them all, and they clutter up the UI miserably. I\u0027d like a way of categorizing them based on \u003Cem\u003Erole\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003Esituation\u003C/em\u003E, rather than physical ship type. If there were color-codable icons, I could use that color as a categorization system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when I\u0027m playing RemoteTech, I have a large number of communications satellites. Would love to be able to mark them all \u0022red\u0022 (or whatever) so that I could turn them all on or off in the map display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, for example, I\u0027ll have a large number of ships that are in their final situation (they\u0027ve landed, or achieved orbit around the target planet)-- these are the large majorityy. But there will be a small number of ships that are en route and I need to remember to keep an eye on them so I can do the necessary maneuvers at the right time. Would love to have a category I could put them in, so I could turn off everything except them when I want to keep an eye on \u0022how many balls do I have in the air.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T13:04:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like:)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA colour option would be a good, simple and effective method. Maybe a few more icon styles too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso how about an option to add say a 2 or 3 character \u0027tag\u0027 which could be used as a filter in the same way. A drop down menu next to the icon bar at the top could list the tags you have assigned. Much more versatile and not colour blind sensitive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
