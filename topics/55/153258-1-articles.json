Could this be easily done to allow multiple stock parts to be stuck together with the same basic stats or effects it would otherwise. Just in this case the connecting physics removed and counted as one part. Would it be hard to make a simple tool(3D) or simple edit tool(2D/text) to edit the stats for this if needed? Could it be done in a way that would be easily kept in game from version to version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would think the most complex tool needed would be an updater that could try to change values per part then resave the part for each version manually. Basically something the player has to do but with a slight aide to get them started.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be insanely useful for making giant wings and make them act like large single objects. Same with big player designed fuselages and engine pods or cargo containers or anything else you would want a single object. Slap together/save to remove part count then stick on the plane like normal via nodes or radial attachments. A base part could be saved in the part with root before saving as a single object or something and nodes turned off/on if possible to say which ones are active. This could define some parts parameters to make it act as desired. Lots of more creative things could be done with this also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI imagine the physics externally and the lift/drag and stuff could be left how it would be if they were separate parts.

Wing segments, radial intakes, static radiators as structural. Docking ports as decouplers. Stack separators instead of multiple radial decouplers. Many parts have multiple secondary functions and small hidden features that allow you to save on part count massively.

Fuel pipes are almost entirely obsolete except rare obscure cases; so are standard struts. Docking ports are often superior to decouplers of their \u0022native\u0022 size. A probe core like HECS2 will remove the need to carry batteries. Elevons don\u0027t need to be attached to a wing to work. A cargo bay makes an excellent airbrake and a decent set of landing legs.
