It\u0027s not some demarcation line between what\u0027s in the solar system and what is interstellar space. It\u0027s a matter of being the dominant gravitational force within the sun\u0027s own SoI. This means that in order to leave the SoI of Kerbin\u0027s sun (the name Kerbol is one the players gave it, the devs just refer to it as \u0022the sun\u0022), there would have to be a gravitational force stronger than that of the sun at that point, meaning you\u0027d then be in orbit of whatever mass(es) create that gravitational force. In the case of Sol, it would be the theorized super-black-hole at the center of our galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a comet were to cross the sun\u0027s SoI, it probably wouldn\u0027t be coming back within the lifetime of the kerbal race. Comets that come back (all of them that I\u0027m aware of) are in orbit around the sun but completely within the SoI, though many (actually most, I think) of them have an apoapsis outside the heliosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give you an idea of the difference, Voyager has passed outside the heliosphere (currently what NASA is using for demarkation between the solar system and interstellar space) at a distance of 120 AU. One AU is just over 8 light minutes, so 120 AU would be less than 17 light hours. Sol\u0027s hill sphere has been estimated to have a radius of about a light year, which is quite a bit more than that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I have nothing against the devs adding comets to the game, we won\u0027t be leaving the SoI of Kerbin\u0027s sun until said sun is no longer the center of the kerbal\u0027s universe, and even then, it\u0027s going to take either a heck of a lot of time warp or some kind of warp drive to leave the SoI.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seshins","CreatedById":71258,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T09:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also vote a resounding yes to comets.

In fact, there\u0027s one passing close enough to Mars later this year that it\u0027s remotely possible (1 in 600 chance was the last update I found) that it will impact Mars. There\u0027s also a few classifications of comets, depending on how long their orbit is and sometimes on other characteristics. The ones that can repeat at less than 200 year intervals are short period comets believed to come from the Kupier Belt and don\u0027t make it back out above the heliosphere, whereas the long period comets are believed to come from the Oort Cloud and have much higher periapse. Short period comets further get broken down into Jupiter class comets (an orbital period under 20 years) and Haley class comets, with orbital periods between 20 and 200 years. There\u0027s also a class of comet called main belt comets that mostly stay within the asteroid belt, though more modern theory argues that these are actually asteroids with a dust trail rather than an actual outgassing comet. Exocomets are comets that came from outside Sol\u0027s hill sphere and are probably going back there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Haley comet itself seems to be the only short period comet that\u0027s visible to the naked eye, and it\u0027s also one of the few celestial objects in a retrograde orbit. Short period comets tend to be close to the ecliptic plane, whereas long period comets can come from any direction (given that, I suspect that the bulk of celestial objects in a retrograde orbit are long period comets).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-21T17:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere have been a number of threads suggesting comets already.
