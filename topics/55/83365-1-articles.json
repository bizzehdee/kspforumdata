In some cases it will be even more practical than adding new MK2 parts. Just think about space shuttles. 1.25m parts barely fit into the MK2 cargo bay. But with bigger parts it will be easier to send satelites, or maybe even small space station components. It can go even further with adding some of B9 parts systems, that are big enough to fit 2.5m parts into them, just some paint job to make them look more stock alike. There are more missing parts in SPH than just better MK2.
