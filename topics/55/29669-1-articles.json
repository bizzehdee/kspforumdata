Once the fuel started depleting and the CoM moved back toward the engine it couldn\u0027t keep a heading without a reaction wheel (I had already put one on but toggled it off just to see), but this is just the same as it was with such a low mass aircraft with standard parts and fuel tanks. I think it was only about 10 parts or so, just a couple of the modified delta wing tanks, a standard tail, some structural fuselages, a stock mk1 pod, the reaction wheel, basic jet engine, 2 radial intakes, landing gear and a decoupler just because. CoL was ever so slightly behind the CoM, and even with the fuel gone it wasn\u0027t that far ahead of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel lines from the modified delta wing part to the fuselage were required for it to work though, just as a previous poster said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason I wanted to do this was because I wanted to keep a more constant CoM in relation to the CoL, which is I guess why they do it in real life aircraft.
