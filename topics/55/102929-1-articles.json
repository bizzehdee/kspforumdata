If you look at the engine clusters closely, you\u0027ll see that the individual engines in the KS-25x4 are similar to the Skipper in size, while the engines in the LFB are closer to the Mainsail. As you can\u0027t fit four 2.5 m engines under a 3.75 m part, or two 2.5 m engines under a 2.5 m part, the existing engine clusters would become impossible. Doing something similar to the KS-25x4 and the LFB with the existing engines would require a complete overhaul of the way the engines are used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
