Other times they will be knocked clear of the seat entirely, and be reclassified as debris which can not be controlled at all. This is usually no big deal if you\u0027re on Kerbin, because recovering the vessel will give you back the Kerbal as a proper Kerbanaut. Problem is when you\u0027re on an alien planet. I once sent a claw ship out to Duna to ferry a broken Kerbal \u0022debris\u0022 back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe it started in the update that made Kerbals you\u0027re not controlling stand up after ragdolling. 0.21 I believe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T15:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis definitely needs a fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T19:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHad this happen far too often while crash-testing rovers.
