An example of this is when you choose the icon for rockets and within it you get wheels, antennae, wings, a new parachute, oh, and more engines and boosters! I also do not like the \u0022history of Kerbal\u0022 or \u0022history of mankind\u0022 tree options as suggested above for a few reasons, and I will explain why in a bit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat needs to happen is the tree needs to be overhauled from the root sciences up. Begin with broad categories - communications, structural, control, and propulsion. From there, conduct your flights and when enough science is generated, then choose something to research. If you choose \u0022Communications II\u0022 (as an example), then you get only better antennae; if you choose \u0022Structure II\u0022 at that point, maybe the tree branches into \u0022Aviation\u0022, \u0022Spaceflight\u0022, or \u0022Ground Vehicles.\u0022 This would require researching each branch of the tree to achieve certain milestones or mission capabilities. In fact, each of the \u0022root sciences\u0022 could eventually branch out. I would even include \u0022planetary sciences\u0022 as a root branch, requiring it to be studied in order to gain the technology to drill, refine, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that for many this would slow the progression of KSP in career mode, but it would also serve to put some asymmetrical growth into the program. Right now, it is far too easy to create balanced craft in career mode - and as we all know from the various space programs histories, this was never the case. It would also negate the need to have a user-selected option for \u0022history of Kerbal\u0022 or \u0022history of mankind\u0022 tree options. It would follow a natural progression compared to what we see on Earth with the space programs of various nations. It could even be a factor in a multi-player version of KSP that could allow players to not only compete, but to trade technologies, much as is done now. (Please note, I am NOT fond of a multiplayer version of KSP).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-25T13:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of the tech tree is not to be historical, though that would likely happen with a better tree simply because hard things are hard, and easy things are easy, and the real world actually works that way. The point of the tech tree is supposed to be so that the player has meaningful limitations that impact design choices. Career was never really thought about, and to the extent they did, \u0022tycoon\u0022 was a bad model to pick---not least because that mode \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C/em\u003E elements they never planned on adding (totally autonomous kerbals to manage). Any tech tree that is designed outside a specific gameplay concept is broken from the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two concepts that make the most sense are exploration, and a space race. Exploration requires stuff they have also stated they don\u0027t like, like\u00A0randomness. This leaves only a space race as a plausible career mode to work with, though ideally some part failures would be in there as well---note that my goal is limitations and drivers to push the players into making interesting design choices. Think about replay here. There is no chance of me failing on basic tasks in KSP, ever, in career, and it\u0027s been pretty unlikely for a long time. I\u0027d like a chance to not always \u0022win\u0022 on a replay.
