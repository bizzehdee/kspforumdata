Adding a scratch pad to each craft that can be edited and updated mid-flight would be useful to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2 - This one might be impossible/impractical to implement. It is probably best explained via a scenario...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunch a vessel and get to booster burn out - jettison the booster. At this point the game would \u0027save\u0027 and you can switch to the booster that is now headed back towards the surface. You can \u0027fly\u0027 the booster all the way down, deploying the parachutes and recovering the parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe kicker would be that you could reload the main vessel and the time would revert back to where you left it, allowing the vessel to be piloted to orbit/wherever. The SRB that was jettisoned would follow the flight pattern that you had flown previously and be recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be the real world equivalent of having a separate, parallel control team for each part of the vessel and flight\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could also be used to fly multiple craft at the same time for maneuvers or other fun things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3 - Kerbal Uniforms for specialists\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that you can get the Kerbals specialism via the Astronaut Complex but that is a pain. I have 7 kerbals in orbit around Duna and I need different crews for different tasks on each mission using one multirole vehicle (fuel or science). Making sure I have my scientist on board or my engineers is crucial for the success of each mission.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be so much better to have different coloured uniforms (or even a patch/label) to say which kerbal has which trade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T14:47:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi ChrisD!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you are waiting for Squad to implement these (if they\u0027ll do that), you could try mods which provide the game mechanics you want.\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50884-104-in-game-notes-notepad-checklist-v0122-20151006/#comment-726660\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50884-104-in-game-notes-notepad-checklist-v0122-20151006/#comment-726660\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72605-105-flight-manager-for-reusable-stages-fmrs-v1001/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72605-105-flight-manager-for-reusable-stages-fmrs-v1001/\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) I\u0027m not sure.
