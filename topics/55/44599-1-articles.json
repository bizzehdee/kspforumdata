Could work well with training kerbals up in specific fields of expertise perhaps. A kerbal could carry any particular item, but they get bonuses for having an item that\u0027s relevant to their field(s) of expertise. Provide a non-monetary cost to a kerbal so people don\u0027t just splash them into the floor and buy another one like they\u0027re an easily-replaced toy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T13:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethey were working on a toolbox and assosiated system a while back - i presume it got shelved for career mode to take centre stage. but fundamentally it would do just that - the kerbal would be able to hold one item, use it, return it, then pick up another. possibly with limited bits in the toolbox to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-02T14:20:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewould be nice if command modules would have extra tool storage too.

Like in a real space program, you\u0027d want your astronauts to be proficient with all the tools in case of an emergency. Or perhaps that\u0027s something you\u0027d have to train your self if you didn\u0027t want to take risks. More specialist scientific tools however would have to be assigned to particular Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
