There is one thing I\u0027d ask of it, tho: the ability to remove completed (or missed, for that matter) maneuver nodes in partial control. That way, I can set multiple nodes in succession, hit the Maneuver Node pilot mode, do the maneuvers at full throttle and hit the green checkmark (or the red x if my maneuver wasn\u0027t goot enough - eh, you preprogrammed the probe and it didn\u0027t perform 100% as expected, life\u0027s harsh), and the ship will point to the next one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-13T20:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2016 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by monstah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T21:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is intentional. Rather than the harsher \u0022no control at all\u0022 when out of contact, some modicum of control is allowed, including one maneuver node for doing a capture burn on the far side of a body. Multiple node maneuvers are outside the limit of this limited control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T02:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn console I can\u0027t play 1.2. \u00A0I thought without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to probe communications we only have rudimentary control of probes. \u00A0You are saying the probe can still maneuver per a node and execute a programmed burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nOr will it be able to maneuver to the maneuver marker and the player have full/no throttle control with comms out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T12:38:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222802992\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476412111\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168077\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jonfliesgoats\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, Jonfliesgoats said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn console I can\u0027t play 1.2. \u00A0I thought without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to probe communications we only have rudimentary control of probes. \u00A0You are saying the probe can still maneuver per a node and execute a programmed burn?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr will it be able to maneuver to the maneuver marker and the player have full/no throttle control with comms out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are three settings: one without Commnet at all, as it was before; one where you need a comm link to do anything on a probe, and it bricks without a connection; and a third one, where you have \u0022limited control\u0022 of the probe when without communications (the one I use): you can\u0027t access right-click menus, but you can use action groups; you can\u0027t control throttle, but you can do full-burn and cut throttle; you can\u0027t turn or translate the ship manually, but you can use the autopilot buttons (so, you can point at a maneuver node); finally, you can\u0027t add or edit maneuver nodes. Basically, you act as if you had pre-programmed the probe (action groups and maneuvers) to act on its own when out of signal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem, for me, is that since you can\u0027t even delete a maneuver node, you can only do a single one in this limited control state. I understand it\u0027s about giving the player more limits (it\u0027s in the name!), but I suppose I could have pre-programmed a couple of maneuvers on a probe to execute autonomously (attempt a landing at the dark side, for example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T23:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
