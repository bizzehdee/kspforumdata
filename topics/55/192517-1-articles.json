It would be cool to have it in newer ksp versions. I know something like this is possible in the interstellar mod but I would like to have a standalone. If the creators could make a separate mod it would be great. Also I have some experience with programming so I could to try to make it myself. If anyone has any idea of how it works in interstellar I would be grateful for the info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-19T17:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203385-flyingdolphin/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022203385\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203385-flyingdolphin/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@flyingdolphin\u003C/a\u003E!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you suggesting this purely as a mod idea, or are you wanting it to be in the stock game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"flyingdolphin","CreatedById":203385,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-20T10:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would make sense to have it in game. It is a standard feature in simplerockets2 or pioneer and some other space games. From what I understand it wouldn\u0027t be that hard to implement. the game would just have to stop emulating physics for each part and make a quick calculation of the orbit is change each tick. it would also make things like ion drives actually usable in a stock game even if they were nerfed to be more realistic. of course the developers decided not to do it for some reason so I would be happy to just have a mod like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-20T12:22:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean thrusting during non-physics warp?
