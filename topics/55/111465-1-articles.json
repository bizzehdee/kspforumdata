I think if while doing this, it would be great if they allowed re-skins to be easily implemented. I can imagine a plethora of different designs that could surface if they did this. While I like the current theme, I (and likely many others) would thoroughly enjoy making and using alternate UI skins/themes. It should theoretically be a small thing to add, but I think it would add a lot to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:00:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree. There could be some more skins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would like the old one to be refreshed, too. The grey-ish theme of the KSP UI got kind of old.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
