However when I eventually got them both into the correct orbits only one was registered as being successful ![:mad:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif), it seems to be because only one probe core was considered to be in \u0022command\u0022, even after I had decoupled them. \n\nSo even though I had a probe in the second specific orbit, the one that had been in command when launched was in the first specific orbit. Maybe I\u0027ve just been stupid and there\u0027s a way to remedy this, if so, I\u0027d love some suggestions! If not I really think it should be programmed in that more than one command module can be launched."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-20T16:52:01Z","Content":"You can definitely send multiple sats up in one launch.

I once set a sat up to an orbit, got it perfectly matched, and was ???. Then I noticed that I didn\u0027t actually accept that contract, but the orbit showed up in the map window.
