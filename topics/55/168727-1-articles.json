The most important attribute beyond its interstellar origins is the fact that it is fast, possessing a eccentricity of 1.2 and is currently on its way out of our solar system at 26km/s. Nothing we\u0027ve built so far has ever reached that speed and an intercept this late in the game would need to get started within\u00A0the next few years IRL. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://phys.org/news/2017-11-lyra-mission-interstellar-asteroid.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Lyra \u003C/a\u003Ewas\u00A0commissioned to study that proposal, but something tells me we can do better. One wonders if a somebody or group of somebodies or perhaps even Squad themselves can develop an Oumuamua encounter vaguely based on the Lyra premise. I would like to contribute but sadly do not have the modding skills or time to even consider it, so broaching the idea here will have to do. Of course, there are challenges to consider, mainly in that KSP isn\u0027t a 1:1 solar simulator. Tech realism isn\u0027t so much of an issue, but it is a consideration. In either case the basic path and composition of the asteroid are known quantities, so pluses and minuses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this belongs somewhere else, definitely feel free to move it.
