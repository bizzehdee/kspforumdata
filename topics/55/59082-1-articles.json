Additionally, I would like like to play with stock-only parts but still have some other mods enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I am imagining is something similar to how Firaxis Civilization V handles mods. When creating a new game, you can pick and choose which mods can be enabled for that particular game instance. This way I could have one saved game with all mods, another with selected mods (maybe I just want mechjeb and procedural fairings), and one with no mods at all, etc. etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: visually, if I have a part pack like kW rocketry, if the mod is enabled then the parts would show up in the vab, otherwise they would not appear (rather than simply shading the part disabled)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary benefit here is so that I don\u0027t lose half of my active fleet because I want to tear out KW rocketry part add-on for instance, or resort to installing a second copy of the game (not even clear if i can install a second copy via steam).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if KSP as an application can handle this (or if it\u0027s an existing feature I am not aware of), but it would be a wonderful feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and if this is has already been suggested then my apologies, my search skills can be poor at times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for allowing suggestions and thanks for the great game; I can\u0027t stop playing....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T17:37:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 05:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ThreeWholePunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExpand thought\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
