All other designers should take note of how space games really should be based fundamentally on real physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter many attempts to design an efficient long-range ion thruster driven probe, I have finally achieved a nice balance. Five Rockomax Mainsails, plus four solid boosters take it into orbit then on to a Mun encounter. A smaller engine and a 720 Rockomax tank is good for at least a couple of fly-by maneuvers. The final main mission vessel has 1 ion engine, enough tanks and batteries for 7800 xenon gas and 2010 electric, plus the scientific instruments of course. With 6 gigantors and a few other smaller panels this configuration can run 1 ion engine at full thrust indefinitely in good sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I\u0027m disappointed at how the game mechanics (still using vanilla no mods installed) make Ion Thruster propelled space craft fairly unusable (or at least less fun) to play with. Specifically, because of their low acceleration performing all but the most minuscule of maneuvers requires that they \u0027burn\u0027 for several minutes; sometimes as much as 45 minutes or an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, it seems the only way I\u0027ll be able to use my long-range ion driven probes is if I leave the game running at 1x speed while I either stare at the screen for 30 or 45 minutes or put the game in the background. Obviously both viable. However, my suggestion (if it is possible) would be to adjust the game mechanics so that it is possible to leave these types of engines running even while the space ship is not the focus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a search and did not notice any threads that clearly were suggesting this change to game mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ernest3.14","CreatedById":75412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T18:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use physics warp to get up to 4x the speed (if your ship is fairly small).

If you were to implement a way to allow acceleration at warp greater than four, the integrity of the physics accuracy would most likely degrade as the physics delta_t would have to be accordingly increased as well (unless you have a badass processor) to maintain simulation speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if, instead of allowing acceleration under warp, you wanted to instead switch to a different craft or building, I could see this as being more viable. You would (hopefully) still be unable to increase the warp factor, but you could at minimum do other things with your time while waiting. I think the concern with this though is that if something goes wrong with your ion-powered craft (the course changes by accident or the burn needs to be adjusted, staging needs to be performed, Jeb decides that he\u0027s curious what an ion engine under power looks like and goes EVA only to get left behind), there is no way to place the fault onto the person at the controls since there was no one there, and you might not be able to revert to a quicksave before the incident (though running the game in the background already does this, it is assumed that you are still at the controls). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe there is a better way to accomplish this, such as pausing the 3D rendering, audio, etc., until a condition is met (like a SoI change or a certain time elapsed) and only performing the physics calculations necessary, then resuming normal operations.

But as the game evolves and the desire for scenarios or campaigns that model economically-efficient long-range interplanetary or edge-interstellar missions grows, I think it will be realized that this shortcoming in how Ion Thrusters operate is a serious limitation. It is my understanding that, for long-range space craft of the next 50 years, ion thruster technology is likely to be one of the most prominent. Unless I misunderstand how these systems are used and will continue to be used in real life, applying thrust for long periods is typical. And that is not very practical to do in KSP at present.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaleb","CreatedById":73828,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:45:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAm I the only one who finds this limitation on using the Ion thrusters to be \u0027annoying?\u0027\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first things I did in the game was to create a bunch of ion probes to start unmanned exploration. I fired one up and went to go do something else at the space center (I didn\u0027t even know about time warping at the time), and I had *no idea* why I was unable to leave the flight without ending it. The space center option was grayed out without any explanation of why. Eventually I discovered the restriction on leaving (or time-warping) with throttled-up craft, and I\u0027ve been disappointed with it ever since. I love designing with Ion engines, but I hate trying to fly them for this exact reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem with them is that they don\u0027t really work with the Maneuver Node system, since it (reasonably) assumes instantaneous impulse burns, rather than long continuous burns. Imagine what you could do if you could set up an ion engine to fire continuously (even at \u0026lt;10% power) and set it on a course towards Duna or Jool. For short distances like the Mun, it may not make sense, but over the long haul, long periods of low thrust may get you there faster and more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I\u0027m not sure what can be done about this, since continuous low-thrust trajectories are still an active area of research, and are much more difficult to compute than standard Hohmann transfers. But I would love for Squad to do something about this, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, with only one Ion engine, you should only need 1 gigantor array to run it at full thrust (around Kerbin, assuming its unobstructed, and oriented towards Kerbol). Definitely not six. The rough rule of thumb is 1 gigantor per ion engine. However, Gigantors are also heavier than the equivalent amount of smaller panels (1x6 or 2x3 panels) needed to produce the same amount of electricity. IIRC, 8 smaller panels produce the same amount as 1 gigantor, but weigh less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also cut the burn time down somewhat by adding on additional engines, but this requires additional solar panels, which drive up the mass, and reduce the dV. But this approach seems to miss the whole point of ion engines, which is long periods of low-thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T20:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wish a dev would reply to this, because I recall a while ago that Harv was going to implement a \u0022jump-to\u0022 system, whereby you would initiate a burn, hit the button, and the game would jump you to when the burn was done.

It seems like a calculus problem to just figure out the position vs time equation given two different accelerations - one due to the gravitational primary body, and one due to the craft thrusting in a constant fixed direction (although the thrust is in a constant direction it\u0027s not in a constant acceleration because you also have to calculate how the fuel gets burned and reduces the mass as you go). I\u0027m not saying I particularly want to be the one to do the calculus to figure it out, but it does seem like it should be a solvable problem. You know the formula for how the acceleration due to the engine at constant throttle changes over time as the fuel burns ( a = F/m, where m is changing over time by a linear slope downward ), and you know the formula for how gravity pulls depending on current position relative to the primary body, so in principle if you add those two together you should get an equation for the total acceleration from both effects and be able to integrate it twice to get the position equations. Of course this shouldn\u0027t be done on the fly, but be done ahead of time by the mathematicians in the dev team, and then the final result could become the new \u0022on rails\u0022 equations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T08:37:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt seems to me that if it\u0027s possible to calculate the elliptical path as a time-parameterized equation for on-rails coasting, it should also be possible to calculate what the curved path should look like under a thrust as well... \u0026lt;snip\u0026gt; ...Of course this shouldn\u0027t be done on the fly, but be done ahead of time by the mathematicians in the dev team, and then the final result could become the new \u0022on rails\u0022 equations.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHm.

Turns out, at least in polar coordinates, if you assume tangential acceleration is zero (i.e. your engine is off), that lets a whole bunch of stuff be constant, meaning a lot of terms end up going away. Once you add tangential acceleration in there (as a function of time, no less), those terms stick around, and the equation is much more complicated. I worked on it until I got to a system of equations I don\u0027t think one can solve analytically.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T07:59:12Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 07:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tssn1611\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"benjiful9000","CreatedById":38135,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T12:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[closed]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-04T19:13:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2021 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by benjiful9000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
