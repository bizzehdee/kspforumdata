It would be useful to be able to enable/disable fuel/oxidiser from specific fuel tanks being used by engines by pressing the action group keys, instead of having to right-click each tank every time you want to make a change, it would be particularly useful for space-planes since you could use it to mitigate the effects of the COM moving about relative to the centre of lift for example.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T17:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis would make managing multiple drop tanks alot less troublesome. also can we have action group defined fuel transfer?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-06T17:54:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2014 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T18:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy feeling is: if it\u0027s tweakable, it should be able to go into an action group.
