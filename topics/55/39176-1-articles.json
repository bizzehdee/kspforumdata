It would be very helpful if the ASAS system allowed rover controls to change the SAS heading lock in the same manner that yaw, pitch, and roll inputs do. Otherwise, I have to keep toggling the SAS with T or F to lock in a new heading after turning the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
