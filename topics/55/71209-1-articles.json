I\u0027ve been experimenting with various modules to make them consume a resource, but they don\u0027t act accordingly and function even with the resource depleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my request is a small adaptation (or maybe insight in the proper syntax in the configuration file) of the modules so they can consume resources. IMHO it would be a great addition to the game, since most movable parts in aerospace consume hydraulic power, electricity or both. It adds another layer of complexity for those who want it. I really do not wish to force this on everyone, the part.cfg could have a switch like ConsumeResources = true/false\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Engine gimbals, lowering/retracting landing gear, suspension ride height, control surfaces, wheel brakes, wheel steering, deployment of antennae and cargo bay doors. Good example is flying the Altea XR5 in Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-02T09:50:17Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2014 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Azimech\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
