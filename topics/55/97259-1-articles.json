Another issue about having a 4th upgrade level is texture memory. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve noticed how much memory usage has increased with the recent version. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised, if a significant share of this comes from textures for all the different upgrade levels. Of course, if SQUAD were to efficiently reuse textures between the different upgrades, that would be no issue... but again... low standards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
