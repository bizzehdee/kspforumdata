It seems no matter how far away from Kerbol I get though, the experiments only take data from \u0022Space high over Kerbol,\u0022 just the same as when I had barely left Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I would definitely like to see a new biome outside of the SOI of the sun (or maybe a certain distance outside of the Kerbol system limits), perhaps named either \u0022deep space\u0022 or \u0022interstellar space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Interstellar\u0022 would be out of scope for this game.

The Voyager probes are currently leaving the sun\u0027s Heliosphere, and are able to take various magnetic and chemical measurements of how the solar wind interacts with the interstellar medium. If their RTGs last long enough, they may be able to sample the interstellar wind directly. Kerbal spacecraft could take similar measurements of Kerbol\u0027s astrosphere. To decrease mission time, such a probe could use a jettisonable ion engine and solar panel stage that lasted until Jool\u0027s orbit, or use an NTR to make a high-dV burn as it flew past Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
