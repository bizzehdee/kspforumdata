This is quite useful to save money when you have a station around Mun with a lab to process data and send it in large packages to Kerbin on a small escape pod. The problem is that when you have enough science to build a station like that you really don\u0027t have to build it any more, as there isn\u0027t so much profit to be made. So... having maybe a space telescope or something like that (and receive a reward for that) would be quite interesting. Without the missions and cash issues I always had a station around moons which sent data back home until I completed the tech tree. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that would be nice... satellites! Fly to a precise orbit, put a large object and make it work non-stop would be quite fun, I think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso... well. Ideas, I guess...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weeble","CreatedById":117348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T08:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Controller 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-Preview-Version-1C-%28KSP-24-2%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-Preview-Version-1C-%28KSP-24-2%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr my favorite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88445-0-24-2-Fine-Print-v0-5a-Formerly-Extra-Contracts-%28July-27%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88445-0-24-2-Fine-Print-v0-5a-Formerly-Extra-Contracts-%28July-27%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine Print is newer but adds aerial/rover reconnaissance, station/base building as well as fixes some of the impossible missions like testing stabilizing clamps on the Mun...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty cool and I like it a lot, just be careful as his contracts have lower payouts than stock so you really have to figure out if you can complete it profitably.
