The performance impact of loading (suitably stored/cached) models, animations or textures from disk that aren\u0027t in memory should be a few tens of milliseconds at most in a typical case, assuming they\u0027re not absurdly huge, and most of that is due to seek time. That makes it practical to only load the models etc used in the active ship and any close enough to see without significantly affecting performance. How easy any of this is to do in Unity though, I don\u0027t know; it\u0027s not an engine I\u0027ve worked with.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-22T21:52:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2014 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T22:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
