This would not only more realistically reflect how real life operators of space boosters get their scientific contracts, but would also give more meaning to the contract system. Scientific modules would be issued with the contract with the mission to place this module into a specific orbit or land in a specific biome of some celestial body. How the spacecraft that carries this module to that orbit or biome, is then up to the player. one could even go as far as letting the player chose between a robotic or manned mission if a sample return is required in the contract.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYet a different architecture for scientific research in KSP is along the lines of the science checklist. The science checklist currently in game only keeps track of the data gathered so far, but what if each scientific discovery would also give you a monetary and reputation reward? This would be more then enough incentive to go out and do science to develop one\u0027s space program. Also, making \u0022science\u0022 a bucket list in stead of a more or less\u00A0linear line up of contracts would be less restraining to the game experience, and would be closer to KSP\u0027s free sandbox spirit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T13:10:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 01:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Rombrecht\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T13:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPre-designed worlds would be best, but the could then all be slightly varied via scaling.

I agree with a lot of people that career mode has its issues and certainly could be improved, but I don\u0027t agree that the problems are so fundamental that they would require a total re-write (nor do I think that\u0027s in the cards even if they were). To address what ails things you have to understand what most people are struggling with. Here\u0027s a summary of the issues I see most commonly here:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EContracts: \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Contracts are random and therefore feel like side-quests.

While science points do a nice job of giving players freedom and offering scaled rewards,\u00A0the act of experimentation in-flight\u00A0feels burdensome and underwhelming, and doesn\u0027t generate anything useful to the player besides\u00A0generic science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- At the same time progression through the tech tree feels grindy for many players, it also forms the base reward system of the game, so without anything else to go on players feel as if completing the tech tree is \u0022beating the game\u0022. For them the challenge of career mode ends there and seems to truncate the overall\u00A0experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGeneral:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The step-ups for building upgrades feel very steep, locking out many essential tools in a way that hinders smooth career development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Strategies, while\u00A0useful, don\u0027t seem to accomplish what they might--to let a player direct the style of play they wish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s good news here I think, which is that the issues that are causing frustration at times are not central\u00A0but ancillary, and can be solved without abandoning any major part of the game\u0027s structure. Here are the solutions I\u0027ve come up with that I think would address these problems for most people without any kind of major re-write:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncorporate an open-world main quest:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EWhat players seem to want most is a sense of control over \u003Cem\u003Ewhere to go next\u003C/em\u003E. They want to look out at the tracking station and think \u0022Okay lets go there!\u0022. They want that open sense of adventure. Whats great is because of world firsts they absolutely can, but when they go to Mission Control they don\u0027t see those missions automatically\u00A0listed and can\u0027t receive advances for them. It seems obvious to me that the basic act of sending missions to planets is the main quest of KSP, and should be displayed up-front to players at Mission Control. My solution is two-fold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Organize contracts by body\u00A0at mission control. The main screen would display a top-down map of the Kerbol system on which you could click the planet of your choice (or side tab) and be presented with the available missions for that body. This map could be limited to just Kerbin, the Mun and Minmus at tier zero to ease new players into things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Once a tab is opened, the contracts for Flyby, Orbit, Land, and Plant Flag should always be up at the top with the generative contracts for things like rescues, satellites and resource collection listed below. While the main exploration contracts would always be available, their \u003Cem\u003Eadvances\u003C/em\u003E could be locked out until a high enough reputation was earned. This way players could see that they can go anywhere they like and what the reward would be, but would still have to work to build reputation in order to earn advances. Additionally players could easily understand \u0022Beating the game\u0022 to mean planting a flag on each planet and moon in the Kerbol System, and wouldn\u0027t abandon their careers when the tech tree is complete. Whats nice is this \u0027main quest\u0027 can be completed in any order, letting players decide where they\u0027d like to go next while still giving an achievable, but hard, goal for completion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMake science more fun and feel like science:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThis I think is the hard part. A lot of people are feeling underwhelmed by the science system and my analysis is that the problem lies with the experiments themselves. They are each functionally identical and so you don\u0027t feel like they\u0027re really doing anything specific. They also each require repetitive clicking, which tends to distract from the experience of flying rather than aiding it. They also don\u0027t produce information valuable to the player outside the tech tree, and so you don\u0027t really feel like the data\u00A0has any intrinsic value.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Make experiments unique and remove the need to right-click wherever possible. Scale the payouts to tasks and maneuvers unique to each instrument, and tie them to valuable flight information. For instance the Barometer might pay out for the swath of vertical air-column it passes through\u00A0and the seismometer could become an impactor experiment. Including a thermometer might let a player see heat-bars, and the gravoli detector might produce biome-maps. This way data feels useful and not just generic, and experiments retain value even after the tech tree is complete. I wrote a big long post about this \u003Ca href=\u0022?/topic/141235-making-science-more-fun/#comment-2617122\u0022 rel=\u0022external\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Include biome mapping and vary the value of different biomes on the same world\u00A0with significant boosts for very small biomes around anomalies. This way players are incentivized to carefully scan\u00A0and select landing sites, and to land precisely and bring\u00A0rovers, planes, and probes\u00A0to scout out the most valuable locations. This way the sense of exploration extends onto the surface of each planet and doesn\u0027t end the moment a flag is planted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EAdd another building tier:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EThis Im sure is on Squad\u0027s docket already.

A place to tell the \u0022Kerbal Public\u0022 what goals you are aiming for, which would influence the contracts you receive and the payout you get for them. Players could build something of a grand contract for themselves to follow, such as \u0022We\u0027re going for the Mun\u0022. Contracts (like we know them today) would then appear like \u0022Science temperature data from the Mun\u0027s East Crater\u0022 or \u0022Plant flag on the Mun\u0022. After announcing your strategy, the first Mun landing would pay you a lot more than it otherwise would in terms of Science, Funds and Reputation, while other contracts paid comparably less. Failure to deliver on your promises would also be costly. The Media Center could also present grand strategies to you. For instance something like \u0022After the blockbuster move The Dresian became a box office hit, public interest in Dres is soaring. Announcing a plan to send Kerbals to Dres would be very profitable right now.\u0022 And so you\u0027d be given a large upfront sum, and a set of Dres-related sub-contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a little something to create \u0022story arcs\u0022 in Career mode, with a goal to aim for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for making Contracts more compelling, perhaps they could offer more than just Funds, Science and Rep? Say... extra experience for Kerbonauts on mission, permanently making some parts cheaper, or unlocking special parts? How cool would it be if Rockomax offered you their RE-I5B \u0022Skipper Mk II\u0022 engine if you planted their flag on the Mun? Or have Kerbodyne send you a counter-offer, promising you a better version of one of their parts?

It makes sense with how it is easier for these people to get to space, and because they are a more daring and adventurous people with simpler minds. It makes sense that kerbals would fly in rockets before they have the technology to make robots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see career mode balanced a bit better at the start, as it is difficult to get going not because the parts aren\u0027t good enough but because they don\u0027t match up with each other very well. It is very difficult to get a good center of mass and lift to keep your rocket stable, and it leaves little or no room for re-entry plans, especially with the starting vehicle mass and part count so low. The buildings also only get upgraded twice, which seems to move too fast. I wish they would be upgraded three or four times before you\u0027re done with them. Moving from 30 parts to 255 parts is just silly, you go from barely being able to get to orbit straight to being able to construct colony ships for long-term interplanetary space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing always bothers me about science: by the time I have the technology, there is no drive to gather science. But when I have lots of science to gather, I can\u0027t make the craft I want because the parts aren\u0027t unlocked yet. So I wish there was more use for science after you unlock all the parts. It could be unlocking more part variations, improving the quality of parts, or special highly-advanced technology that you don\u0027t really need for most of the big missions. Or maybe there could be other creative uses for science outside of your spacecraft technology. A lot of it could be trophy-themed, wherein you collect it as an achievement and some part of the game proudly displays it for you. I know you can check which biomes you have researched, but it would be a lot more special if there was a decorated room showing your accomplishments with some artistic flair. What I\u0027m trying to say is that there should be more to accomplish after I unlock all the tech. Without this stuff, I always end up quitting my space programs before I get out of the Kerbin system. I\u0027ll be ready to do an interplanetary mission, but there\u0027s nothing to gain from the mission--and I want to have a reason to do my first large-scale interplanetary mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know what would really make me want to send kerbals to other planets?

And a Tracking Station too, so you don\u0027t have to return to Kerbin every time you just wanted to open the map. For balance, the shipyard could offer the same parts as the VAB on Kerbin, but at a vastly higher cost the further from Kerbin you went. What costs 100 Funds on Kerbin could cost 500 on the Mun and 4000 on Vall, for instance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only would this make interplanetary exploration easier and less tedious (getting everything out of Kerbin\u0027s gravity well gets repetitive after a while), but it would also give players something to strive for in the long run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard, though, that certain technical restrictions mean that a full-fledged KSC on bodies other than Kerbin isn\u0027t possible at the moment.
