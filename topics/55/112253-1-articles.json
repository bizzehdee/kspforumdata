If anything, adding the choice would add confusion, with people getting mixed up between cfg file values, in-game values, wiki values, values in forum posts, etc. A single scale used for all eliminates that likely confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone really has never heard of Kelvin (within the subset of people who are able to comprehend KSP\u0027s simplified orbital mechanics), it\u0027s literally 30 seconds on Google, and you know all that you need to know to understand the Kelvin scale (assuming you\u0027re already familiar with Celsius), at least as far as interpreting the numbers for basic hot vs. cold.
