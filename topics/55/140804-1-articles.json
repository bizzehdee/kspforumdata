The mod is awesome after you get used to it, but it also has (in my opinion) a big flaw. Realism comes with some engines from the real world (like the famous F1 engine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I like the idea that you have to make the rocket fit the engine and the payload, I don\u0027t think the system is particularly realistic. As Bob Fitch has pointed out a few times in his realism series \u0022Project Alexandria\u0022, many of the real world engines have gone through many small and big changes that made them do what they needed to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that fitting all of them into the game would probably take too much memory, so I came up with an idea of procedural engines (Actually swamp_ig (developer of Procedural parts) has firsth mentioned them under \u0022 \u003Cstrong style=\u0022font-weight:bold;color:rgb(39,42,52);font-family:\u0027Helvetica Neue\u0027, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:22.4px;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;word-spacing:0px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255);\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EFeatures That Are Not Planned\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThis system would sacrafice the strict rules of having only a set of engines, but in terms of realism it would be a big improvement cause it would let you design engines the way you want. I personaly like to have parts that i have full control over (I can rescale them to what I need).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scale\u00A0would be only one of many thing that you could change. Scott Manley posted a video yesterday thalking about engine nozzles. His video is actually what made me start this topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHere are some\u00A0options that are in my opinion needed:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Nozzel lenght tweaking (Changing the ISP in vacuum and atmosphere)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Scale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Closed or open cycle (Go for the safe but inefficient approach or go for the unreliable but much more efficient style) (There might have to be some game balancing things to be taken care of if this is implemented)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The number of engines you have (I kinda doubt this is needed but it could cut down the part count and save some frames)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK. Those are some of them. I will not post any ideas on how to make models, because I\u0027m just a begginer at Blender and I don\u0027t know much about making models yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone is interested in making this mod I will be verry happy cause I\u0027m waiting for it for a long time now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-30T07:20:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggested the same thing some time ago.\u00A0Would be nice to have procedural parts BUT only if \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129410-11-kerbal-krash-system-034-2016-05-05/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis was a thing.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy?

For\u00A0what\u00A0I care there could be a normal engine model with\u00A0tweakable\u00A0parameters that would affect the engine\u00A0performance\u00A0(like if you make the\u00A0nasallonger it will have a higher ISP in vacuum). The visual effects (thenozzle\u00A0gets bigger when you adjust the parameter for it)\u00A0can be added later. I seriously doubt I could do this on my own cause I just started messing around with the config files. I can try but I don\u0027t promisse anything. I think someone else with much more experience should do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Luka 999","CreatedById":127252,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T12:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222624309\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221465505624\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259415\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022John FX\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9. 6. 2016 at 10:53 PM, John FX said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have not yet tried it, some of the mods (not exactly sure which ones) in Realism Overhaul allow engine improvements based on your tech level, giving more Isp, burn times and thrust (also ignitions). Testflight allows more reliable engines after testing/using them for a while. You may have to start using realfuels. Not sure, I just installed the whole thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmight be something to give the function desired while you wait...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been playing around with TestFlight recently. It\u0027s cool to see parts fail on you when you don\u0027t expect. My fuel tank got a hole in it while I was in orbit and all of the fuel leaked out. Then I send up a rescue mission and when I got close the engine of the rescue mission failed. I fortunatly had KIS installed so I could throw off the dead engine and replace it with the engine from the original craft. That was verry fun. I will have to look up what mod allows you to improve engines in RO. I am using RealFuels when I play my hard core career. I like the idea of fuel stability. Maiby I\u0027ll get off of my ass and start messing around with configs a bit more. We will se what I can do. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
