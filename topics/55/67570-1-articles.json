One of the major concerns when fireing the engines to alter its orbit is the rotation of the asteroid. If not careful, it can start to spin rapidly. This situation forces the player to be aware of the angle between the thrust vector and the asteroid\u0027s center of mass. It feels to me that it adds a very realistic component to the ARM. However, any non-physical time warp kills instantly the asteroid\u0027s rotation if it is attached to a tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to restore the rotation after the time warp has ended? Or restore the orientation AND rotation as if the asteroid rotated all the time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpheratz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxcvb55","CreatedById":12874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T01:59:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is something that has been brought up quite a bit for ships, but I think it is now MUCH more relevant now that asteroids are involved.
