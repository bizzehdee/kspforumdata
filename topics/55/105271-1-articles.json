Everything with 1.0 is absolutely fantastic except 1 little detail. The re entry heat is confusing as well as how rockets act upon re entry. \n\nI built a properly balance top stage. [http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/527262341749794446/6D3AE77EF3484B30C388457B775AAC29EAC2A027/](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/527262341749794446/6D3AE77EF3484B30C388457B775AAC29EAC2A027/) As you can see here. It\u0027s the most balanced while using the basic parts a beginner can. (Removed the legs due to re entry problems on that end). However, at around 10km it keeps wanting to flip over nose first regardless of how aerodynamic it is, basic laws of ballistics tells me the air traveling on all sides of the ship should be stopping it from flipping over so easily right? (I could be wrong, but it seems that the faster you\u0027re traveling it should be harder to turn into the air flow, unless the other side is just THAT much heavier, but as you can see it\u0027s not in the picture). \n\nThe problem I\u0027m having though is not just the flipping. \n\nAt 10km I\u0027m still getting increasing amounts of re entry fire, while realistically I should be slowing down slightly and the heat going away slowly to a point. Instead the fire is just getting stronger as my speed continues to increase until I smack into the ground. (if I don\u0027t pull the chutes open). This is completely confusing for new (and old) players alike. Since it\u0027s also known that fire and re entry can destroy and damage your chutes, you don\u0027t want to pull them out while fire is blazing past them. However.... \n\nThat\u0027s the only way to successfully land my re entry section. I need to pop the chutes open at 15km before it flips itself over at 10km, and not give a damn about the fire blazing past my ship. The moment I pop those chutes, the fire stops, and I gracefully drift to the ground... \n\nThere seems to be no middle \u0022safe\u0022 ground to fire the chutes like there was before. Previously I\u0027d wait for the fire to die off as my speed started to decelerate (to lower the G\u0027s on my kerbals as well), and then fire the chutes when it was safe. \n\nI think this is both confusing for new and old players, and a slight problem as it defies logic, and even what\u0027s being told to the player \u0022watch out fire is dangerous to chutes! (but you have to fire the chutes with fire to land safely)\u0022 and anyone who\u0027s interested in rocketry a bit and the space program knows that old school re entry vehicles such as the Apollo programs didn\u0027t fire the chutes with fire blazing past the cockpit at 10km..\n\nEdit: after several more tests it seems to be fine with just cockpits. there is a nice middle \u0022safe\u0022 ground. Perhaps I\u0027m just coming in far to steep? Could just be me.. heh..\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-27T21:07:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena**"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:03:26Z","Content":"Yup, you\u0027re coming in too steep ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"LadyAthena","CreatedById":88614,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:37:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yup, you\u0027re coming in too steep ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nYea I got it figured out.
