I can see how it might be an issue if you\u0027re half asleep though. Moving the buttons to the bottom would be more consistent with typical UI layouts, but it would be more annoying to have to move the mouse that far to click them (especially for the poor laptop users who insist on using their trackpads). If there was a hotkey for both accept and cancel (that you were unlikely to accidentally press) I think that would be great though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T21:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve nearly clicked the cancel contract button accidentally a couple of times because of this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmacku","CreatedById":134528,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T23:41:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I\u0027ll second this.
