Do decouplers and nose-cones at very least count as cargo bays?"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T05:24:12Z","Content":"I think clipped parts might be counted as covered, because, things behind nose cones will be counted, and, nose cones will create a drag occlusion effect on stuff behind them.

Any part exposed to the light would produce drag the same as a solar cell produces power. Thicker atomsphere stronger light more drag. The more surface area a part has the more drag it can produce unless you point the pointy end toward space. \n\nThat\u0027s at my thinking anyway but probably full of holes."}]}
