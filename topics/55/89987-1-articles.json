I don\u0027t want to discuss the buildings, there already is another threat for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I want to suggest is a seperate space suit model that matches the style of the developing space center. The shiny white suit looks weired next to that junkyard/farm thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see something that looks more like the 50\u0027s/60\u0027s suits for high altitude flights (x-15). Or the suits used for the first EVA\u0027s that were puffy like a balloon and mostly made out of textiles. That\u0027s what I think would match the idea of progress. It could upgrade with the VAB or maybe require being upgraded seperately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure if there should be a disadvantage with the earlyer suits or if it should be visual changes only. Also those early ones didn\u0027t have RCS. However, EVA in ksp without RCS is not a good idea, ladders are a little buggy as we all know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T20:09:09Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 08:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by prophet_01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dansmithers","CreatedById":11592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T15:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, the current aesthetic of the game does not mesh with the look of the Tier 1 Space Center\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-11T20:45:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/11/2014 08:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by dansmithers\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T20:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah sry.
