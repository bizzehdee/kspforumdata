You engage thrust, it pushes your craft forward. If any part of your craft blocks said thrust, it negates all thrust and stops it from working.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, my suggestion is this:\u00A0 Thrust is physical\u003Cbr\u003E\nReason I\u0027m suggesting this is for the problem of blocked thrust due to a wing or control surface or part. We\u0027ve all been there. Built a plane and placed a part behind the jet engine, go to launch, turn on the engines, full thrust... and... you go no where because the thrust is blocked.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo what I suggest is to make thrust act more like physical particles than a static invisible force.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis would allow control surfaces and wings to be placed behind the engine inside the jet stream. It would also allow control surfaces to act like thrust vectors, pushing the thrust in any direction.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI can also see this being useful for hidden engine builds like replica B-2, in which the engines are hidden inside the wings and there\u0027s exhaust ports for the thrust to come out. Since the wings wouldn\u0027t block the thrust, and instead direct it, it wouldn\u0027t have any problems.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T10:33:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223588350\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183971\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555996625\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002277770\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoldForest\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, GoldForest said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I suggest is to make thrust act more like physical particles than a static invisible force\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds desirable, and given enough computing power it would certainly make things act more intuitive/realistically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut KSP is already heavily constrained by how much physics it has to calculate every frame.
