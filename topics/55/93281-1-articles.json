They were almost perfect before .90, not too grindy but failure was costly. Now setting it on hard makes it equally risky as it used to be, now with 10x the grind. You can play with the values to get a somewhat decent result, but nothing like it was before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think another part of the problem is that building costs are tied with failure penalties. I think building/part/research costs should be a separate setting altogether (if you even want them to be changeable). This way, you can increase penalties for failure (introducing that risk factor) without making the costs skyrocket (introducing super grindage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
