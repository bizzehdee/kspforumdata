Training a Kerbal would require your astronaut complex to be at a certain level (see next suggestion) and would cost a certain amount of money - maybe even as much as building a small spacecraft. Training might endow your Kerbal with progressively more impressive MechJeb-style abilities, maybe progressing from circularisation to Hohmann transfers to aerobraking to *gasp* landing! And, most important of all, upgrading a kerbal would give them a shiny new spacesuit colour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do, however, realise that this quickly starts to stray over the line into autopilot, which the wiki page informs me isn\u0027t happening. However, the reason I think that this isn\u0027t as potentially game-breaking as full-blown autopilot is that if you manage to kill that kerbal - they\u0027re dead. You\u0027re not getting that training back. Which provides a bit of an incentive to keep the little green guys alive! Also, by having talents assigned to individual kerbals, each of them can only be on one craft at once, so for every \u0027autopiloted\u0027 ship you\u0027d need to train another kerbal at great expense. Or successfully return your other kerbal pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature which I feel would fix any game-breaking tendencies would be only allowing a certain number of autonomous manoeuvres per kerbal per launch. After each kerbal\u0027s manoeuvre limit is reached, they have to be returned to Kerbin before they can perform any more (It\u0027s tiring stuff, this spaceflight business). This would be upgradeable - more well-trained kerbal could perform a few more actions per launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this means is that you still have to do most of the grunt work - or train a LOT of pilots. And you\u0027d have to bring them all back - or pay to train more - before you can launch the next semi-auto mission. For example, with a kerbal with level 1 endurance you might decide to automate a M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar capture, but you have to aim for the SOI in the first place and you have to do the orbital manoeuvres. Or maybe you can do the capture for yourself but you hate circularising. What you can delegate depends entirely on how much you\u0027ve upgraded your kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should also be possible under this system to upgrade a kerbal\u0027s Science ability, maybe as a simple multiplier (let\u0027s say they\u0027re sending back more detailed notes or something). This gives you a reason to pile loads of kerbals onto one ship!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a very crude mockup of a RANDOMLY SELECTED Kerbal\u0027s stats screen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7cvYWB3.png\u0022 alt=\u00227cvYWB3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, Jeb here is able to do any type of manoeuvre you want, but only three manoeuvres per launch. He also adds a slight multiplier to science collected - say 5%. And all of these stats are upgradeable inside the Astronaut complex. You\u0027d hover over the boxes to show what that box allows the kerbal to do when unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a little bonus to the system, some kerbals could come with better skills right from the start - but cost slightly more to hire.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EBuilding upgrades\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see building upgrades implemented.

You might then upgrade this to 40 parts. Then to 80. Then 160. And so on. The SPH would be similar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERunway:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027d like to see length/width upgrades, but I have a feeling that this might be a little tricky to implement without blowing up anything that\u0027s already there.

Upgrades would seem to be the simplest system. Upgrades would simply unlock planets on the map, one or two at a time. Until discovery planets would still exist but not appear on the map until you hit their SOI. So it would be theoretically possible to shoot for planets without upgrading, but a little tricky...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELess importantly, it would be nice to see visual upgrades to building too, representing how advanced they are, though this would obviously require multiple new exterior models for everything and interior models for the SPH and VAB so might be time consuming to no real end. It would be nice though. Starting out would be in slightly tumbledown, rickety buildings, e.g. a corrugated iron hanger for a SPH and a dirt strip (island-style) for a runway. The observatory (if implemented) could just start out as one guy with a telescope! As noted above, this might cause problems with collision meshes and destroying what\u0027s already there, so the aforementioned message would be absolutely necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHow do I think this would add to the game?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think what I\u0027ve suggested would add an extra layer to the money system of the game (when it\u0027s implemented) without being overly complex, make the game simpler to play BUT ONLY IF YOU WANT IT and without being game-breaking, and (less importantly) create a visual reward of sorts for committed players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EOne last thing\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system I\u0027ve suggested does allow some leeway for the possibility of an \u0027easy mode\u0027 in which facilities are fully upgraded from the off (as they are now).

Things like: Fly this vehicle to this space station, dock, transfer all of your fuel into the station, undock, reenter and land at KSC.

You should have to fly the requested mission yourself with the same vehicle once to prove to the game that it\u0027s possible, but then the game just does it for you automatically. This would be easier to implement because you don\u0027t have to install an autopilot or anything, you just build up your kerbals\u0027 skills by taking them on missions and then they are valuable to you because you can use them to perform simple tasks like maintaining a fuel depot in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[append] I should also say that it would be nice to be able to watch the missions in real time, but that would require a fully functional autopilot.
