They\u0027re not going to just stop doing KSP, it\u0027s been a great product for them. So with that in mind, here are some ideas I\u0027ve come up with, to either improve on things or to make a better game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. The graphics. I don\u0027t know exactly what they can do to improve the graphics. It may be that they just don\u0027t have the game engine just can\u0027t manage better graphics, given the way KSP works. However, if possible, I think this is an area that definitely could use some work. I\u0027d like to see the planetary textures at higher resolution, clouds and atmospheric effects, and a better use of more advanced graphics acceleration methods. Not to improve performance, but just to make everything more realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Greater detail in science modules. I\u0027d like to see something like a probe core, but one that has various slots in it for experiments, rather than the modules we have now that can be stuck anywhere. Also, I think the science modules should be physically smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. More \u0022on the go\u0022 science. By this I mean, more science where you don\u0027t just have to enter orbit around a planet, or land on the planet, but where you actually have to look around and do science in several nearby locations. Kind of like rovers do now on Mars. One of the reasons I like this idea is that rovers are kind of pointless now. They\u0027re fun to build and drive, but there\u0027s really no point to it. You can technically drive a rover to a new biome and get more science that way now, but generally the distances are prohibitive. I\u0027ve never really wanted to spend several hours driving a rover to a new biome. So I just don\u0027t get what rovers are good for now. It would be better if you had to search around a little and find things on the surface. This would make rovers more meaningful and also make the science game more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have more, but that\u0027s a good place to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-16T10:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy do you want to pay for a new game that is just KSP \u002B more/better stuff?

There was a lot of damage done to its reputation with the botched 1.0 release and the console release.
