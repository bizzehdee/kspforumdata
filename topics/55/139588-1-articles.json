Could be called supply command or Virtual command center\u00A0, but its function could be to have scientist \u0027compute\u0027 trajectories for planets/systems that have already been explored. The level of trajectory accuracy and compute time\u00A0could be based on \u00A0the buildings level and scientists level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other component of this building could be the remote control of ships by pilots. I know in my career game i have multiple ships doing things. if pilots could be used to control ships based on trajectories by scientist this could free up players time for more building rockets and exploring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe player could assign the pilot a ship/probe w/e and then give the planet (orbited/explored)\u00A0or ship that you want that pilot to dock with and then they do the rest. they can request\u00A0trajectories off the scientist, may have to wait if there are not enough around. If the trajectory was off somewhat then they can course correct etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof course comms will be needed, I haven\u0027t tried the new comms change but it sounds fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea\u00A0solves a number of issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nit frees the player up to do more funs things rather than fuel my super rocket that\u0027s in space(I do it in stages since career has limitations).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngives scientist and pilots a purpose endgame\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ngives the career mode more things to unlock and add to the experience\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of these ideas maybe in mods. I don\u0027t use mods for KSP so IDK. But it would be nice in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
