Not all skills should be doled out by the game. If a player is good at EVA movement they should *not* be hobbled by the game GUI. I despise hobbling player ability and skill typically in the name of \u0022balance\u0022. The challenge should be the rocket science, orbital mechanics, logistics etc. The GUI should not be the challenge. Games should be fun and challenging, not tedious nor the player\u0027s \u0022experience manager\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-11-19T16:26:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2020 04:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
