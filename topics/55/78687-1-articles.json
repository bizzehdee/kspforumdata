Perhaps, letting time also dictate info. It does not increase the amount of science, while certain time frames can yield info. Like instant, will let you know how it reacts quickly in an environment. One day can be used to show effects of 24hrs, than the next mile stone would be a week, than months, etc. But they can only be done once, and it has to be spread out. Maybe that could be implemented with the reputation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
