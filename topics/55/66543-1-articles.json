At certain insolation they become saturated, below certain insolation they stop providing power at all, and the proportion between insolation and output is not linear. So current solar panels in KSP feel real enough to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T06:50:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAye, it depends on the panel. If the panel was perfect, it would output energy according to the inverse square law, but nobody has perfect solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
