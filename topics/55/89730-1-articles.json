When get close to/enter the rings, you will see a variety of particle effects (could be just simple points, could be small rocks) moving at orbital velocity in the rings. If you enter at a relative speed of less than say... 50 m/s, you will most likely be fine. If you enter faster than that, you will engage a system based off the reentry heat system (when we get one) that will cause you ship to be damaged. Shields, of some sort, (maybe just a large wall of structural panels) will mitigate this damage. It will also apply a slowing effect that will attempt to draw your ship into the a closer orbit to the rings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like it if the \u0022no random failures\u0022 rule was bent a bit for the rings. Occasionally, when you\u0027re in the rings, a small \u0022meteorite\u0022 will randomly impact your ship at a high relative velocity, damaging and maybe even destroying the part that it hits. (They would be modeled as a straight line running towards your ship, so that don\u0027t they destroy something that is completely shrouded by other parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENumerous small, untrackable asteroids will randomly spawn in the rings (Not too many, though. Don\u0027t want to kill the physics engine. An average of five or six in a 2.5 km radius would make me happy), alongside a smattering of regular asteroids (which are also untrackable at below say, C-class). Large D and E class asteroids are extremely rare in the rings, and you may be given a contract to visit them because of their rarity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it\u0027s a bit too complicated, but it would still be incredible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T12:42:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vaporo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vaporo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe time warp could be completely restricted while in the rings?
