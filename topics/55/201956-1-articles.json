For example, every pilot wears the ESA suit, maybe the scientists will always wear the pale blue suit, the engineers the normal white suit. And from henceforth from selecting this, any new engineers/scientists that I hire would have the suits that I selected that type of kerbal to have.\u00A0I am aware that Texture Replacer accomplishes this but a stock implementation in the suit picker would be nice. It would also provide some continuity; you could look at a kerbal and instantly know what they are due to their suit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Sorry if I worded this in a weird way, I just wasn\u0027t sure how to say it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-24T13:52:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2021 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Vovical\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T13:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes I agree, perhaps the same suit but different colour \u201Cflashings\u201D ala Star Trek and you select which colour for which branch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T15:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, whenever I hire new crews I always try to remember to assign their suit at the time.\u00A0 A stock \u0027Set default suit\u0027 option for each \u0027class\u0027 would be\u00A0nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T16:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put my pilots in classic suits, engineers in retro suits, scientists in the futuristic suits and tourists in ESA suits.
