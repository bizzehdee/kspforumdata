A system to identify biomes would be needed aswell. And that\u0027s the tricky part in my opinion. Text based info screens only would not rly improve the gui or appearence of the game. Visual systems similar to the tracking station or a map require more work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this will make it into the game in some form, but I won\u0027t hold my breath \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
