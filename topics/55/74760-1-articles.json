(in which case you WILL need to look at bringing on someone new...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure a ton of KSP players would love to do anything possible to make the game develop a little quicker- and possibly earn a chance to work on the dev team someday if you guys ever expand. It\u0027s one of the advantages of having built such an enthusiastic player community. Plus, a lot of the modders already have at least a little familiarity with how KSP works under-the-hood... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust an idea- but I think it might make the game better in the long run... Many hands make light work- as the proverb goes- and if you\u0027re getting some of that work for free (and possibly hiring one of the interns someday if you decide to expand), then you have more total development time to devote to maknig KSP all it can be...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T13:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-11T13:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo they do that with moderators?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf so, they should expand it to the game, as you said.
