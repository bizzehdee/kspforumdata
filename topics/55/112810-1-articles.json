A good haul from the Mun should boost your early career significantly, but constant collection of science from the Mun to max out the entire tech tree is just absurd.\n\nThat, and the addition of the new science lab makes it even easier to max it out, I believe the lab definitely warrants a nerf on several functions.\n\nI find this uninteresting as you quickly exhaust the use of science. To have a complete tech tree, you should be required to visit at least 3/4 of the Kerbol system.\n\nThere are several ways to remedy this, besides the obvious reduction of science gain from Mun and Minmus, the tech tree could branch out more, and have a steeper science cost curve. Instead of 5/15/45/90/160/300/550/1000 (approximately), it can be 5/15/30/100/250/600/1000/1500. This is just an example of what I have in mind, it can be solved by adding more tech tiers as well.\n\nAdditionally, a way to broaden science use could also be by doing just that, adding more uses for science points instead of just tech unlocking and exchanging it for cash. Parts that cost science along with cash to buy (every time you use them, like a price) first come to mind.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T02:47:06Z","Content":"Reduce the science gains in your difficulty settings when creating your save."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T10:15:56Z","Content":"You can grind your way through the tech tree, or just send a couple of probes to joolian system and recover them.

I\u0027d prefer to get a chance to use the end-tree parts within the main part of game, rather than having to work my way through most of the Kerbol system to unlock them. By way of a concrete example - I like building space stations. They look cool and they give me something to do whilst my interplanetary flights are in transit. For me, it would suck to \\*have\\* to run those interplanetary flights first to unlock all the parts that I want to include in my space station. I think it would also be pretty discouraging for less experienced players if Career mode games forced them to go interplanetary to unlock the fun parts.\n\nAt the moment, Kerbin and its muns are a nice training area where new players can unlock all the parts and play around with them and intermediate players can unlock the technologies (ISRU, decent power supplies) for more ambitious missions. Meanwhile, as Kweller pointed out, more experienced players can use interplanetary flights rather than biome-harvesting, to get their Science."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T13:19:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m with KSK.

By the time I had unlocked the entire tech tree in my current, normal difficulty career save I\u0027d used science from Kerbin, Duna, Dres, Ike, Gilly, the Mun, and Minmus. I only hit Minmus and Mun for science twice and only used Kerbin for the early stuff to get to the Mun. By adjusting the science gain down to half I could make Jool a requirement to unlock the tech tree. Basically I can play exactly the way I want by not prioritizing science grind and instead just playing as I want. Then, when I hit the endgame strategies, I can get some easy science for money and turn my career save into a proper sandbox save.\n\nKSP is a pretty good sandbox in that regard, newbies can easily cut their teeth in the Kerbin system, possibly hitting Duna for the finale, while veterans can play a much looser game and pick and choose how they go about things."},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:26:09Z","Content":"How about this: make a variant of career mode where in order to unlock parts of the tech tree, you need to achieve certain milestones. For example, in order to unlock basic rocketry, you need to achieve at altitude of 20km. In order to unlock engineering 101, you need to get crew reports from the grasslands, the highlands, and flying over the water. And the tech tree tells you all this. For higher tier stuff like Advanced Electrics you would need to land on Duna and land on Eve, for example. And you can still collect science...and you need to get a certain amount of science to unlock tier one, tier 2, etc. So in order to get the best rockets in the game and the best aerodynamics and all that, you would have to visit the really far planets, and you also have to spend science to unlock a particular tier before you can do the science experiments that unlock it.\n\nThis way, people who don\u0027t want to be able to unlock everything before visiting all the planets are satisfied, and the people who don\u0027t care how you can just fill up a MPL with data and time warp a few years don\u0027t bother with this mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T16:09:34Z","Content":"Science balance is just fine as-is, it\u0027s not broken, and absolutely does not need fixing.

I dont see how a surface sample of Mercury could help us building better engines, so the idea of milestones suggested above is not bad at all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T16:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 04:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by juvilado**"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T21:45:21Z","Content":"I cut my global science multiplier to 40% via new game setup option, that choice increased the value of the science lab, which some say is overpowered at default levels.

A bit more science on Kerbin orbit\n\n2. A bit less science on Mun/Minmus\n\n3. More science on other planets.\n\n4.
