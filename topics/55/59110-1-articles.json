Essentially, if one engine in a manually selected group flames out/runs out of fuel/shuts down, I want a sensor to automatically deactivate all the other engines in that group. I already link my engine shutoffs into action groups, but I keep leaving them on too long and having my engines flame-out asymmetrically.

I tried it, and it did prevent flameouts. Unfortunately, it did it by being very conservative with the throttle, whereas I would prefer to let the engines flame out at full throttle, but rig it so that the engines flame-out/shut down symmetrically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMR4Y: Thanks for the input, but I think you misunderstood my suggestion. I do not want symmetrical flow such that engines flame out symmetrically. I just want to be able to tell the game to detect when an engine flames out, and then shut down other engines in a symmetrical fashion, whether those other engines still have fuel or not. As to the auto-throttle down in .23, I think that\u0027s just because they become air-starved and can\u0027t maintain maximum thrust. In any case, it doesn\u0027t prevent flat spins when one engine flames out and another doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPursuedtank: Thank you.
