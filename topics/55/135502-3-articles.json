They may have a Ph.D in rocketry\u00A0or be a 14 year old kid that has only played shooters before or be a stay at home wife in her thirties. You already have a tutorial system on how to build basic craft and execute basic maneuvers that helps to get a grasp of how things generally work. After that, they begin to explore the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u00A0now want to introduce a parameter those players most probably have not seen in their lives before. How do you accomplish that without it being too complex but\u00A0ELI5-style and 100% correct in terms of physics? Please consider the attention span of an average player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a big chunk of people rockets are up-goer machines that work on magic and math. They don\u0027t want see the math though, they want magic. If Squad had really concerned this problem, they would have implemented their solution a long time ago.

Delta v is not a complex concept, and in fact every player that actually tries to leave orbit (or rendezvous) already sees for every single maneuver node they already use. Having that number appear once they get to orbit, for example, as something they cannot miss, is a little learning experience. It could be a pop up window upon reaching orbit the 1st time in a given save of that mode. \u0022Congratulations on reaching orbit! You\u0027ve discovered that your spacecraft needs 4500 m/s to achieve orbit, any less than that in the VAB, and you won\u0027t make it!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo continue with your random player example. They get to the Mun, and plot a node to get back, but come up 50 m/s short on their maneuver node. They in fact chose a poor place to do the burn, and actually had the dv to get home, but only know that they now have 0 LFO left. Had the game bothered to tell them they had XXX dv remaining, and their sloppy, plotted burn used XXX \u002B 50 dv, they\u0027d have perhaps tried out nodes in different places of their orbit to see what if anything worked.

First, because of difficulty calculating thrust vectors and whatnot, though I\u0027m fairly sure that it can be done given time.\u00A0Second, because how the hell are you going to implement that in the UI, in a way that\u0027s friendly to new players? To those of us who are not enamored with the game enough to go on the forums and post about it, DV is basically a meaningless number. While you may think that sticking a gauge in one corner might be good enough, it\u0027s not, especially for a new player who doesn\u0027t have the time to read through a zillion pages of tutorial, and might end up just skipping the page on Delta-V because it sounds like some unnecessary advanced concept? Personally, here\u0027s how I think it should be done. Have a window that you can open. It contains basic statistics about your craft, L-W-H, mass, crew,\u00A0etc. (like the Engineer\u0027s Report)\u00A0as well as some info about the performance. By \u0022some info\u0022 I mean text, saying \u0022\u003Cem\u003EThis rocket [will/won\u0027t] be able to lift off,\u00A0[you should be fine/add more engines]\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022 Also, something describing the range, maybe with a nice gauge. Also, account for player skill. \u0022\u003Cem\u003EThis rocket will easily be able to go to orbit. If you\u0027re a good pilot, it\u0027ll get to the Mun. It probably won\u0027t be able to return, though.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 Something like that. Then you can click on an \u0022advanced\u0022 button (a\u00A0la From The Depths) to view stage-by-stage dV, TWR, burn time, IsP, thrust, mass, amount of \u0022bits, blips, flops, and fannies,\u0022 as Yatzhee put it.

I tend to think you could leave the calculator locked until you upgrade the VAB and SHP to tier 2, but once you have it should be multi-stage. Perhaps a tier 3 upgrade could add a drop-down that would show TWR\u0027s for different bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-31T23:05:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2016 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-31T23:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is not instantaneously determining the dv of the remaining bit of a single stage\u00A0during a burn (though even that can have issues with some bizarre craft), it\u0027s anticipating what those numbers will be in the future.
