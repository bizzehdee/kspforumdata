Each probe had a small rocket pack for separating from the mother ship, a parachute to survive re-entry, a control unit, some solar panels, and some basic science and radio instruments. My plan was to put lots of mini-science stations all over Kerbin with a single launch. In Cold War parlance, this technique was called Multiple Independent Re-entry Vehicles, or MIRVs for short. (The idea back then was to nuke many targets with one missile.) But in my case it was all in the name of science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI launched the rocket up very high on a sub-orbital trajectory, jettisoned all 32 probes (after activating their parachutes and rocket packs), and then sat back to wait as they all re-entered and landed on various random places on Kerbin.

KSP doesn\u0027t preserve objects that re-enter too far away from whatever vehicle has the focus. Most of the probes simply vaporized upon re-entry and/or impact, even though they all had active parachutes. Only the very few that I actually shifted the focus to, and tracked live through touch-down, were preserved. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the computational challenges of tracking so many objects, but is there a way that they could be preserved? Here\u0027s my suggestion: Compute the atmospherics, at least in a basic way, for any object that has a command node (i.e. it has a manned capsule or an unmanned remote/robotic control node built into it) as something that has to be preserved and computed all the way through re-entry and touchdown. Spent boosters and other debris don\u0027t meet this criteria and can be safely vaporized. Presumably only the \u0022important\u0022 bits will have command nodes attached to them. In general, people won\u0027t bother sticking command nodes on things that aren\u0027t important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately, when you have a non-focus object that is about to impact an atmosphere, pop up a dialog that asks people whether it should be calculated or not. Or at least pop up the dialog if said object has a command node in it. MIRVs could be fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T20:32:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to do that, they\u0027d need to stimulate physics for each craft.

Given the planet\u0027s size, the gravity, the atmospheric density gradient, the speed and angle of atmospheric entry, the vehicle\u0027s mass, and an approximation of its drag coefficient, I bet someone with math skills (or math software) could come up with the integrals to determine where it would be, and how fast it would be going, at any point in time.
