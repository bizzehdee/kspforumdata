The last time we had a major Unity update, it was practically an update dedicated to just the Unity update but not entirely so, so I think the likelyhood of the third option would depend on just how many features the devs intended for 1.0 that got pushed back.

They\u0027re quite serious about Unity 5, there was just no way to work it into the 1.0 development cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I don\u0027t know if they\u0027re going to give U5 or the missed 1.0 features priority. We\u0027re definitely getting a hotfix patch. I\u0027d be surprised if they did much more than these two things before diving into U5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So what I\u0027m saying is that if you don\u0027t count the hotfixes as an update, then I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll see \u0022a few updates\u0022 before we see an update with U5, unless they hit a roadblock with U5, which is possible. The Beseige devs tried to get U5 working for Beseige and they weren\u0027t able to get it working smoothly enough yet from what I\u0027ve heard, and Beseige is probably the closest game to KSP in the kinds of Unity features it uses.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T23:16:42Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 11:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolfox","CreatedById":59958,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T03:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022NavMesh data for non-carved regions takes ~2x less memory now.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHeightMeshes bake faster, work faster at runtime, and use ~35% less memory.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that features mentioned above means that we will get significant RAM usage boost even if 64-bit won\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be a thing.
