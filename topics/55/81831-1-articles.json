This occurs because (as I have heard it) the game calculates the craft\u0027s current atmospheric drag once per second and maintains that for the entire second. So, for instance, a craft traveling at 75km/s straight down toward Kerbin could have a drag calculation at 70km, then reach the ground before the next calculation, thus experiencing no drag at all before hitting the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: re-calculate drag both once per second and once per scale height unit. This can make rapid entries slow the game more significantly than they already do, but will result in the craft experiencing several stages of increased drag before reaching the surface, no matter how fast it is going.
