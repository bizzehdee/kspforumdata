Right now the system is very simple and straight forward, place stuff into a labelled folder, have module manager updated and start game. \u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only knowledge needed is knowing where to put stuff. If this is too much, Squad CAN make their own GUI system to help those unable to figure it out to \u0022Load\u0022 their mod/add-on, weather it may be flags, textures, mods ETC. But at the same time this is easy enough any third party program would do, plus I don\u0026#39;t think you can be in the actual game to load assets into the game itself, without changing code around.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIdk the current system is so easy all you need is a readme.txt installation file and anyone can figure it out. Arguable adding things into this game is easier than another famous early access sandbox title.
