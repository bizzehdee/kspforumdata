They reminded me of my stock Saturn 5 which had the wrong engine exhaust color - A blue flame, which is the sign that a rocket is burning Liquid Hydrogen for its fuel, not sooty\u00A0Kerosene. (The engines I were using were the RS-25 engines, which in real life shot out the blue exhaust of\u00A0the space shuttles and will do the same\u00A0for the future SLS) I\u00A0thought that because this is an obvious replica of the F-1s and that it seems they were very accurate with their model, it\u00A0would seem that they would pay attention to something the color of the exhaust. It would be very cool for the developers to fix this and make the engine historically correct. And while you awesome developers are at it, please make them powerful enough to lift fully-fueled tanks.
