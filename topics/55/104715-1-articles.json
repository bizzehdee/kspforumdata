By this point, I have noticed, the crew assignments seems to want to default to a single crew. What I would like is to have a return of crew assignment randomization (including the orange-suit Kerman brothers) based on your existing hired crew (or at least a setting to turn this on/off).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:21:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow you can set crews and leave them that way.

When pressed, it could randomly assign available kerbals to each seat in a crewed module. (doing this one module at a time means that you can, say, manually assign crew to the MK3 cockpit on your spaceplane, randomly fill the Hitchiker in the Cargo Bay, and leave the science lab you\u0027re launching empty). The button would ordinarily select crew regardless of role. However, if the vessel currently has no Kerbal of a certain role assigned, that role would take priority (e.g. if Jeb and Bill are in your MK2 plane\u0027s cockpit, the first Kerbal assigned to the passenger cabin will be a scientist if one is available. In addition, by right-clicking the randomize button, you could override this and force the game to assign crew of a certain role.
