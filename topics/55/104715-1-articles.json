By this point, I have noticed, the crew assignments seems to want to default to a single crew. What I would like is to have a return of crew assignment randomization (including the orange-suit Kerman brothers) based on your existing hired crew (or at least a setting to turn this on/off)."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:21:27Z","Content":"Now you can set crews and leave them that way. They\u0027re perma-assigned. That\u0027s good.\n\nIf it was random, then you might get a non-pilot or something in single kerbal craft...."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:23:50Z","Content":"What I meant was that it would randomly assign them while in the VAB/Hangar.

When pressed, it could randomly assign available kerbals to each seat in a crewed module. (doing this one module at a time means that you can, say, manually assign crew to the MK3 cockpit on your spaceplane, randomly fill the Hitchiker in the Cargo Bay, and leave the science lab you\u0027re launching empty). The button would ordinarily select crew regardless of role. However, if the vessel currently has no Kerbal of a certain role assigned, that role would take priority (e.g. if Jeb and Bill are in your MK2 plane\u0027s cockpit, the first Kerbal assigned to the passenger cabin will be a scientist if one is available. In addition, by right-clicking the randomize button, you could override this and force the game to assign crew of a certain role. Finally, using shift-click or alt-click, you could tell the game to randomly fill the *remaining* seats of a partially filled module, instead of the default which is booting any already-assigned crew out of the part and assigning new ones.\n\nPossibly the right-click menu could also allow you to tell the game to prioritize high or low experience."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T22:54:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is probably one of those \u00221.1\u0022 updates, but I\u0027d recommend implementing it by means of a \u0022randomize\u0022 button in the crew selection interface of the VAB/SPH.
