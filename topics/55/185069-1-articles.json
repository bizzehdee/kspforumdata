If a ship is only docked to a station then it should retain its own control point (switchable with the square brackets as if they were still separate craft) while allowing resource and crew transfer as if they were one craft the way it is now. Only berthed modules would actually become part of the station and respond to commands as the same vessel. This would mean if I\u0027m controlling my space station with a ship docked to it, I no longer have to worry about manually shutting down the ship\u0027s engines in case I accidentally hit Z and send my whole\u00A0station into a spin.

Vessels are merged and all functions and resources are collapsed under a single command point.

Docked vessels will be held in place with the same force as berthed modules for simplicity, but will remain as separate vessels as far as the display is concerned and can only be controlled by shifting to their perspective\u00A0with the vessel switcher. Crossfeed can be enabled according to user preference and/or type of docking port and connection. You could simulate requiring fuel and power lines having to be run through open hatches, which is generally only done for berthed vessels or propellant-only docking ports, but I\u0027ll understand if that\u0027s not bothered with for gameplay\u0027s sake.\u00A0For convenience sake an extra field could be added for the vessel mass (or other) display indicating the individual vessel and the total mass of all docked spacecraft, which would be handy even without these functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPros:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Eliminates the HUD clutter that\u0027s a hallmark of large space stations with many vessels docked, which makes the staging readout and action groups useless, eventually requiring every action to be done via hunting for part\u00A0menus to click on constructs that can have many hundreds of tiny parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Lets us quickly see and switch between every vessel docked to\u00A0the same station, and be ready to launch using the ship\u0027s own action groups immediately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-No more worries about accidentally activating a docked vessel\u0027s engines while trying to control your station, or getting into the paranoia-induced\u00A0habit of disabling all visiting crafts\u0027 main engines after docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Simplifies station and modular spacecraft construction with an easy way to delineate temporary or host vessels from the permanent construct, and stops resources being drained from payloads due to absent-mindedness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Requires time from a programmer to modify the docking code appropriately, and possibly an artist/art technician to design and rig a new part for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-May cause conflicts with mods performing a similar function, necessitating they update or be replaced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s basically it far as I know.
