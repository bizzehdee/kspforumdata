I see two main uses for this-if a vessel had a relay antenna and an\u00A0RGU on it (a probe control point, manned or not), other craft could transmit to that vessel (storing the experiments in the RGU) even when it is in the comm shadow of whatever body it is orbiting, to be (automatically or manually)\u00A0forwarded to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when the relay comes back into contact. This would be very useful for landed craft with geostationary satellites that frequently lose connection, even more so when they are on large bodies. This is especially so in the case of gas giant atmodiver probes, since they can\u0027t wait for the planet to orient itself favourably so their relay has LOS during the transmission window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other would be when a kerbal is on EVA. If an EVA kerbal had a tiny, short-range antenna built into their spacesuit that treated all antennas within physics range as relay antennas and could transmit science to them (esp. EVA reports) for relaying back (though the direct transmission mentioned above could only be done after transferring the data to a vessel), draining EC from the relaying\u00A0vessel as normal (this is why the range should be \u0026lt;2.4km) to prevent exploitation. This would allow the transmission of science without having to walk back to a vessel every time and sift through the potentially hundreds of science reports stored in it to pick out the ones you collected while on EVA to transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m guessing this in\u0027t covered by the \u0022common suggestions\u0022 this time? if it is, please berate me\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T00:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223036300\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159830\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493289947\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166341\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022voicey99\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, voicey99 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently the only means to transmit science is from a vessel to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E-but what if you could transmit it from vessel to vessel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is a good idea in certain instances!\u00A0 Of course you can EVA and manually transfer science experiments via Kerbal, but this isn\u0027t a valid method in the use case you cite (Atmospheric probes).\u00A0 The other way of doing it is to have a suitable CommNet in place\u00A0so you can bounce science from one relay to another that will transmit to Kerbin with direct line of sight, but I think you should be able to bounce science results (not physical experiments) to a relay (or other ship)\u00A0for later communication to Kerbin when LOS is achieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically - Allow storage and forwarding of science results from and to any ship in range of the antenna with the requisite parts.\u00A0 good call.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T01:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
