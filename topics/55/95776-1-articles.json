There is no randomness to it and there is no actual research. You just buy groups of unrelated tech with a research currency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would rather see a tech system more similar to that in a x^3 game (explore expand exterminate). Something like in Sword of the Stars or Masters of Orion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou select a category and research over time based on how much money and how much research in related fields you put into it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with the current system is that if you want to build a plane or something with wheels you have to put a ton of research into completely unrelated and unwanted tech.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be nice if there was a bit of randomness to the parts you research. I know there was a huge stink about parts needing to be universal for space ship consistency between players but really that is not needed for career mode. Keep all the parts at 100% in sandbox if you must but allow different levels of the same part in career. SO you might research an specific engine and that engine might become more powerful / better fuel efficiency if you put more research into it and level it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere has to be a BETTER way to do the research.
