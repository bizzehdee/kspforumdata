Right now, even single digits arent above its respective others, so figuring if my cost is less/more and how much do I have left need reading both values everytime and estimating it in mind, instead of single glance on counters and seeing, that left most digit of cost is more to the right than left most digit of avaiable funds, so I can add much more parts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-14T18:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.

Maybe it was the youtube quality, but having to parse the different decimal places in the figures as well as actually reading them takes longer than just seeing if 3 is bigger than 2. Not to mention they\u0027re different fonts and have different spacing.
