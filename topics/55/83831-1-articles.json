Now, the question is what does that mean.\u003Cp\u003EBy your definition and in your words, any spaceplane flying above sea level is airhogging.

Mine is solid, clear and presents an obvious solution to fixing it (make jets have thrust vary with ambient air density as they should); the common one is highly subjective and is thus pointless.

Sure, you could build one with properly-behaving jets, but it would require designing to a lowest mass, lowest drag optimum rather than a \u0022more intakes, more intakes, more intakes, more intakes\u0022 solution. And from my experience, trying to optimize something like that is certainly more fun than figuring out exactly where you can stick another bunch of intakes for a single jet engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, btw, did you know that once you account for the different scale heights between Earth and Kerbin that you\u0027re talking about flying at 60 km? Now granted, this is a good 1.5x the current jet-propulsion altitude record, but it\u0027s certainly possible to sustain flight there, though it\u0027d be difficult and require fairly massive engines for the plane to produce enough thrust.

It means adding 12-20 ram air intakes PER engine (jet or Saber) to a craft. It is called air hogging because you are hogging all the air. The definition that it is jet engines above a certain high makes no sense with the name like air hogging. It would only be relevant in the most basic sense of hogging the sky and could be used to describe a 2000 part rocket hogging the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jet engines defiantly fly too high though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have wondered if the thrust to atmo curves do not work quite right. I have played around with 4 point atmo curves and could never get them to follow the patten stated. 1500 at 1, 2000 at 0.5 0at 0 would seen to work fine BUT add in a 100 at 0.1 and it or one other point would be inaccurate. I wounder if the thrust curves only allow for one curve and try to fit all point in that curve rather than allowing bumps or multiple curves. If I\u0027m right (which I am not sure of) this means that although the engines thrust is accurate for 0 and half atmo at the top of the sky the thrust is too strong and can\u0027t be fixed unless ground or 0.5 atmo thrust is changed.
