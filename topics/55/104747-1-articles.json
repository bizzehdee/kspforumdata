I\u0027m talking about parts that don\u0027t have fuel, exploding with a big fireball.\n\nlike the air intake here:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/gXAkepo5YS8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt is totally unrealistic (which is not always a problem, i know... but i think now it is), it confuses me, and it is a little thing that makes the game feel unfinished ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNot a big thing, i agree, but it should be easy to fix, and something that would improve game experience, i think.\n\nI dont think it would be a problem if the damage would not be as visible, it is even more fun (the kerbal way ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)) if you loose a part without noticing it.\n\nThe minimum is that parts that dont have fuel, should only explode with scatters, but not \u0022fire\u0022.\n\nThe sound effect should be different too, when there is only destruction, but no explosion.\n\nBut there are possibilities for improvements: like, making the explosion size depend on how much fuel was in the tanks, or mixing the \u0022damaged\u0022, and \u0022exploded\u0022 soundeffects together, so destruction of low fuel parts would sound more \u0022scratched\u0022, and with less \u0022boom\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T11:21:55Z","Content":"Now when crashing on the ground it doesn\u0027t make sense for air intakes to go boom. However, when re-entering at super high speeds, it\u0027s more like the intake is explosively melting/ablating into explosive oblivion of explosions."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T11:53:40Z","Content":"I\u0027d like it if parts would spawn little orange particles just before they reach their heat limit. as if the part is ablating away. it would also make a good visual warning to the player about the imminent part failure.\n\nUnfortunately I think the best way to show heat damage would require each part to have a \u0022damaged\u0022 or \u0022scorched\u0022 state, which would require a huge amount of art work.

In the real world, a nominally empty tank that has not been inerted or purged is a high risk for explosions due to the residual fuel vapour often being present in a fuel:air ratio which is excellent for producing an explosion. A full fuel tank, on the other hand, is much less likely to explode until the contents are vaporised and mixed with air or an oxidiser. In real world physics, a high energy impact often sets up the perfect circumstances for a subsequent explosion due to the vaporisation created in the impact. Half filled, and you can have the worst of both worlds, with a nicely explosive fuel:air mix above the fuel, and plenty of bulk fuel to subsequently vaporise and make things bigger.\n\nVapour explosions in slack or empty tanks are a very real concern in the aerospace industry, although the level of risk, and the need for inerting systems is still under debate around 20 years after the loss of TWA800. A320s and 747s have been identified as having a higher than typical risk, and flagged for \u0022early action\u0022, but mostly inerting systems are only common on military aircraft. In a perfect world, they would all have inerting systems, but the real world is forced to accept that it\u0027s acceptable for the tanks to be potential bombs, due to the frequency of failure being sufficiently low. Next time you\u0027re sitting on a plane, contemplate for a moment that by the time you\u0027re half way through the flight, both wings are in a perfect condition to catastrophically explode from the tiniest of sparks.\n\nRandom lumps of metal, on the other hand, sure they should not explode with a big fireball. That said, it\u0027s a game, I see nothing wrong with just having everything explode with fire and smoke, unless the game gets a new mechanic where it actually matters in terms of consequences whether or not something would really tend to explode. Right now, it simply doesn\u0027t matter."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T14:42:42Z","Content":"Those weird explosions always got me too...

Also, I feel like splash damage is something sorely needed. Especially for those people who like to set up space battles, hitting one part should damage the parts around it. Especially if that part explodes with greater force. Might not be too noticeable when crash landing, but it would certainly be something you notice if a part fails on liftoff or you accidentally jettison a stage into another part of your rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:07:20Z","Content":"Area effects would also be great for determining damage to buildings.
