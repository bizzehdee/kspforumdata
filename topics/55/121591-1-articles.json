You can drag all 6 node arms forward and back, which will change your resultant trajectory in every manner possible. You can also drag the node itself along the orbit path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gsonnenf","CreatedById":151457,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T21:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhile I agree it doesn\u0027t sound difficult, is it so difficult to right click the node and click the X?

I think the delete button should delete things if they are selected and you press delete.
