We unlock the 1.875 fuel tanks before any engine that fits them. Sure we can use multiple 1.25 ones with the new decouplers and it works great, but for the casual new player I think it is a bit too complicated for a start. Why not unlock some of the 1.875 engines with the tanks or at equal tech level ? It also seems broken to get the (overly efficient) AJ-10 replica that soon because it outshines most of the other engines and most of the supposedly more advanced ones that we unlock later...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I know a lot of mods change that,\u00A0 but I just wonder why Squad never reworked this tech tree, if there is a good reason for the choices made or if it is pure random...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T09:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey focus on bug fixing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T10:16:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGameplay \u0026gt; Realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals =/= Humans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe stock tech tree is more focused on being a tutorial that slowly drips new concepts to you.

The option of different tech tree paths, more complex choices, more complex planning and mission operation- not just straight up more difficult contracts just for the sake of increased difficulty. Entering long term career paths should be available, like locking in plans to go to a planet/moon and research it, and with it comes benefits but also the limitation of other missions (can\u0027t go to Duna when researching the moon), etc \u003Cstrong\u003E[Basically what the mod Strategia offers]\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother major suggestion would be to add some sort of overarching purpose to contracts.

Noting now that not every design tested sees eventual use- it still should be mentioned that if something is being tested it\u0027s likely for use. Looking to real life space agencies and corporations, when they test a new technology, let\u0027s say like the various test firings of the RS-25 for the Space Launch System. The purpose is to get data to ensure it operates to it\u0027s best capacity and work to resolve any faults in the design. However testing a part in KSP has no function whatsoever other than haul it to X destination with Y conditions and receive money for it. There\u0027s no long term reward for any action taken. Every contract has the same amount of weight in the long term.
