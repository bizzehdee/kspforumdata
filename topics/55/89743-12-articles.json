I think it is more intuitive and more elegant, it provides a for a nice flow; whereas the Sherkaner tree has no flow, you just hop from one node to the other. \u003Cp\u003EAlso, I agree that the way science is gathered should be updated.

It still seems to assume that there is a correct order of unlocking things, just an order that\u0027s a little more sensible than the arbitrary groupings of parts we have now. The fact that there are two versions -- rocket-first and winged-flight-first -- to me highlights just how prescriptive it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI certainly don\u0027t think that my tree is perfect. (For one thing, I do think that in the starting stages in particular that I could perhaps narrow the choices just a bit to simplify initial decisions.) But after playing the tree some, I still believe that it\u0027s really not as daunting or confusing as it might seem just looking at the final tree. It very much has a \u0022flow\u0022 -- each line of technology leads through a sequence of related upgrades and related parts, with links between lines where sensible. And most importantly it gives the player maximized choice in how they progress the technology of their program. I think players will find that very fun and rewarding, and I\u0027m very much hoping that even if the specifics of the tree that Squad impements diverge from what I have, that this aspect of maximizing choice is included.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-22T03:55:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2015 03:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sherkaner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T00:54:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly speaking, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153m still stick to sandbox in 0.9, because the science tree is NOT intuitive currently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be really glad to see any improvement of that unlock-a-node-n-get-random-part thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T18:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SaturnV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SaturnV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI will be really glad to see any improvement of that unlock-a-node-n-get-random-part thing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe too.
