Not having an AI is better than an AI that causes you to \u0022lose\u0022 if you don\u0027t actively keep overriding what it\u0027s doing. You don\u0027t want to turn this into The Sims, Kerbal edition, where you have to slap your Kerbals around because they forgot to sleep, or forgot to go to work, or forgot where the bathroom was and started peeing on the floor (messy when in freefall), or tried to pilot themselves in EVA and failed at it and are now drifting away from the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-22T19:16:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2014 07:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimeCrusher","CreatedById":105427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T19:24:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, idle animations, awesome, but auto-moving Kerbals would be fun, but just to a point, it would just mess up everything, imagine carefully putting 10 kerbals into a line, and then noticing they\u0027re wanting to walk around in a messy way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this got me thinking, maybe on a future update they can add animations to EVA reports, surface samples and maybe interacting with other things, as for example removing science from an experiment (An easy \u0022grab and put in space-pocket\u0022 animation can work on this) and repairing wheels (Same animation as grabbing science, but reversed?).
