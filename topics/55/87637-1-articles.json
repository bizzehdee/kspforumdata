This is what we originally set out to achieve with the old Resource Mining plan and saw ourselves running into a very tedious dead-end. The Resources system was flawed because it overcomplicated accomplishing a basic need: To be able to find something out in space which can be used to fill up the tanks again. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the essence of it, and we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need 40\u002B single-purpose parts and 9 different resources to do it. In fact, all that complexity was going to be very effective at making sure most attempts to build a refueling outpost would fail.

Although I highly respect Squad\u0027s ability to interestingly model complex systems, I really want the system to survive and make it into the final game more than anything else. And we all know where things went the LAST TIME they let themselves get carried away with complexity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am of the opinion that the best use of Squad\u0027s time/effort in implementing a FUN Resource system would be to create just a single collectable resource (similar to Kethane, or better yet, Karbonite), and 2-4 types of collectors (1 or 2 different sizes of drill, an atmospheric collector, and maybe an oceanic collector as well) \u003Cstrong\u003E*that all collect this one resource*\u003C/strong\u003E, and thus are 100% interchangeable (and added for slightly more immersion/believability than having a single do-all collector part) so there is \u003Cstrong\u003Eabsolutely no need\u003C/strong\u003E for players to actually have to learn how to use multiple different parallel resource trees stemming from a thousand different collector parts like in the original system- and then a single type of refinery (perhaps available in 2 different sizes) that can refine this resources into most or all of the different in-game fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also add interesting opportunities for Squad to add all sorts of fun part flavor text about how this resource works/ was discovered. And, of course, teachers in the classroom could do a whole segment on the real-life possibilities for In Situ Resource Utilization (Methane through Sabatier Process, Kerosene through Fischer-Tropsch, Oxygen from lunar regolith, etc.) as a means of teaching a bit of chemistry in a fun way when using the Kerbal.EDU version... But the Kerbal stock resource need not have any real-life name, and in fact it would probably be better if it did not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think Squad should focus HEAVILY on creating a good system for detecting the resource in the first place (Kethane and especially Karbonite mods are somewhat lacking in this regard unless you also install the ScanSat mod), perhaps also including a potential mapping feature for advanced players if ti could be done in a performance-friendly way (newbies could rely on atmospheric filtration on planets with atmospheres- which wouldn\u0027t require any use of maps...) as well as on creating good cost/mass balance (for this, real life relative costs of some of the cheaper ISRU systems might be a good starting-point, tweaked a bit for FUN of course) and visuals/animations in relation to the rest of the game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E Another thought, in an entirely different direction than planet-based ISRU, that Squad could go in, is to make some asteroids mineable- to reflect some asteroid/comet compositions including not just water-ice, but also oxidized alumina and various simple organic (\u0022organic\u0022 means carbon-based, NOT necessarily associated with life) compounds... Although, IMHO, I don\u0027t think asteroid-chasing would be NEARLY as fun (or practical) as, say, setting up a refueling base on Duna, and should only be added as a secondary method of obtaining the mineable resource(s), if at all\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-17T10:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2014 10:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T16:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimple, fun, and useful, that\u0027s all I\u0027m looking for in it.
