I wouldn\u0027t mind that \u0022Contract Filter\u0022 of yours but I consider it utterly insignificant (*being dramatic here*) compared to what refiltering contract-generation would achieve, cosmetic even, equivalent to (I wish) replacing all industry-logo and generated-text by Clean logo\u0026text telling exactly what the mission is (rescue, survey, exploration, satellite...etc).\n\u003E \n\u003E ...however it replacing strategy would be a downgrade.\n\u003E \n\u003E The Strategy of the Administration building we have now ARE in fact more Strategies than your suggestion. They have just been balanced out into oblivions in the process of making them failsafe, like how you can\u0027t possibly fail contracts or get stuck in R\u0026D.\n\u003E \n\u003E The system we have right now allow to consider each contracts as \u0022projects\u0022 toward which you choose technological, funding \u0026 reputation means.\n\u003E \n\u003E Like how \u0022Manned presence on the surface of Mars\u0022 was a \u0022project\u0022 toward which NASA and SpaceX choose strategy (which are not based on filtering what contract they get but the means to accomplish any of them)\n\u003E \n\u003E To give an analogy, SpaceX isn\u0027t clawing its way by \u0022doing Commercial Service\u0022 over \u0022Exploration\u0022, all agency/company do both ([illustrative link](http://www.bgr.in/news/nasa-certifies-spacex-to-launch-big-ticket-science-probes/)).\n\u003E \n\u003E SpaceX is making itself relevant by its choice of investing in Reusable engine/stage rather than reducing the cost of purpose-built rocket (or say making spaceplane).\n\nThis is likely a semantic problem with respect to the use of the word \u0022strategy\u0022 in english. A strategy is a plan to achieve an overall aim. Outsourcing R\u0026D is not a strategy, period, it\u0027s a *tactic* that might be part of a strategy. KSP suffers from some misuse of words in general (perhaps for the same reason). Mission Control in KSP is *not* mission control, it\u0027s a contract office of some sort. Mission Control is the part of NASA that *tracks missions in flight*, period. The tracking station in KSP is actually Mission Control. Again, it might stem from english as a second language for the devs. This is not my opinion, it\u0027s just english.\n\nAbsolutely companies and agencies both do some of each, but it varies a lot. NASA, for example, builds almost nothing. They contract out companies to build stuff to their specs. Companies like SpaceX might have an exploration goal, but they absolutely launch stuff to pay the bills and fund research. My idea would be that the player would choose a balance as an overall strategy for the administration. \n\nIn current game terms my idea would effectively be a filter that presents the player with contracts weighted to their strategy, say: 50% science contracts, 10% tourism, and 40% commercial launches and parts testing. The player would never then see more than 1 in 10 contracts offered be a tourism contract. If he/she picked 0% tourism, they\u0027d never see any tourism contracts at all.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As for \u0022budget\u0022, be it periodic or not, I never believed in market-driven Private-Venture, even SpaceX need backers and subvention and even a \u0022National Space Program\u0022 need a job/reason for existence, amounting them to roughly the same thing. In result, to me \u0022Budget\u0022 is more of a nondescript balance mechanism to keep a player able to rebound without making Contract impossible to fail (and obviously a lever to play on with reputation/funding).\n\nBudget would be hard in KSP as it stands, but not impossible. Player would have to be \u0022NASA\u0022 or \u0022ESA,\u0022 and would be given money up front for specific projects (\u0022contracts\u0022). They\u0027d need good time limits, and have a real chance of failure that would hammer Rep. Bad Rep would reduce the budget next fiscal period. Losing Rep would be the loss mechanism.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So basically, as I keep saying :\n\u003E \n\u003E - Contracts are not reliable enough, not to make them OP or failsafe.\n\u003E \n\u003E - Administration strategies don\u0027t make meaningful difference.\n\u003E \n\u003E - R\u0026D is based on grinding rather than experience-based decision.\n\u003E \n\u003E But otherwise, **KSP don\u0027t need to change that much** (though, balancing a game can be harder than coding the features as demonstrated by the Aero-change)\n\u003E \n\u003E Ps : The above is quite a long answer to a topic that specific. So I don\u0027t mind if you don\u0027t wish to continue or correct me here.\n\nI don\u0027t actually disagree. I advocate for changes to contracts in semantics because as it is (at least for a native english speaker) the whole \u0022contract\u0022 idea kills immersion for me completely.\n\nI sometimes propose career ideas that seem complex because I\u0027m trying to work within the current system---like the idea that perhaps budget gets doled out every 50 Kerbin days, and if you run out, you time warp to the next Minmonth (a minmus month--- 50 days) to get more budget. This would force the player to move time forward (set initial budgets such that you might only launch 1-2 times every Minmonth). Combined with the tech tree that you like (the parallel one), and contracts and missions that actually time out, it might be interesting. Rescues, for example, would all have to be immediately accepted, then done pretty much instantly or you\u0027d fail. \n\nPerhaps some contracts could be obligatory after a fashion? Say rescues are made far more rare than they are right now. You might get a rescue---all would be reasonable, you\u0027d only get rescues for SoIs where you actually have crew already assigned---and the guy needs rescue in 15 days (I\u0027m thinking of Roverdude\u0027s LS mod right now and default LS per pod). The mission is there for you, like it or not. Failure loses no funds at all, but results in a *small* rep hit (your program was not on the ball enough to be able to rescue those idiots). Success has possibly no funds reward, but a huge rep gain. So if you have guys at the Mun, you could get Mun orbit/landed rescues. If you have astronauts at Duna, then you might be asked to rescue guys there. Perhaps when such a mission is taken there is a special ability to add 1 crew to an existing craft. I like the idea of having to think through a sort of Apollo 13 scenario. With KIS/KAS I might add parts to a ship landed at a base ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T06:04:24Z","Content":"I think I see what you are having difficulty wrapping your head around, is that space program in KSP is not a government entity but is instead a business entity. And you would rather see it as a government entity. The trouble with a government-budgeted system is there is going to be a lot less feeling of choice for the player. \u0027Either do A, B, and C or your program gets handed to another lackey.\u0027 That doesn\u0027t feel to me like such a good trade-off. I like the business model with the contracts. I can pick and choose what ones to do without feeling like skipping the others will end my game. I can launch a mission of my own willy-nilly for some extra science or to give a kerbal some flight time without feeling like that will end my program.\n\nContracts do need some work, especially ones that get offered at the weirdest times, but that is hardly reason to just wipe them off the table for a new model. Bear in mind that most of those contracts are actually community-made or influenced. What Squad made alone was a lot, lot smaller. Asking or expecting those to just get tossed to the wayside for a different model is way too one-sided, especially this far into the game\u0027s development.\n\nMaybe a lot of rescue missions get offered, but none of them are obligatory. If you don\u0027t like the current set, just move forward a \u0027minmonth\u0027 for a new offering. That actually seems to fit within what you are proposing. I guess all it really requires is just looking at the whole thing from a different perspective. I would rather not have KSC under a government-budgeted model, myself, but as it is, it is actually not hard for you to look at it that way yourself. Instead of business contracts, they can instead be seen as government-budgeted contracts that you can take on for funding."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T06:58:57Z","Content":"It\u0027s neither, and both.\n\nWhy would Acme Corp ask for a pure science mission? If it was like SpaceX, then you\u0027d get contracts from the Kerbin Space Agency to do science (that would at least make sense). That\u0027s in effect what NASA does (they supply the astronauts and missions, contractors build the stuff).\n\nIf my own commercial program wants to do science because that\u0027s why we started, then why are all the science contracts coming from 3d parties?\n\nNote that as I suggested, you can have both versions possible by moving a slider of what kinds of missions you want."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T21:20:06Z","Content":"**Samstarman5,** we really don\u0027t have a problem with that because as said above it\u0027s neither or ~both.\n\nCurrent KSP-career do not represent one nor the other. It is trying to be whichever a players want, taking liberties with reality.\n\nThe real market for satellite depend entirely of technology and time, there weren\u0027t a market for space-satellite during the cold war (ICBM at best) and Exploitation of space-resources (more than fuel/ISRU) is frankly still far away from us. On top of this, you have 20 communication satellites launched for each science-mission and no private business as any real profit motive to explore Mars (unless you live in a Heinlein\u0027s rocketpunk dream).\n\nMyself I consider that both Governmental agency/Private space company can be considered equivalent.\n\n- Government budget = Private investor/shareholders/subventions\n\n- Gov Agency provide launch service = Private company provide launch service\n\n- Gov Agency do Moon-landing = Private company is paid to do Moon-landing by government (it was unrealistic in the 70s but possible by the time we get 100% reusable Spaceplane)\n\n- Private Contract = Gov Mission\n\nSo IMHO, in the end you are best blurring the lines and facilitating the means for players to \u0022play pretend\u0022, hence the various suggestions to better achieve this.\n\nMaybe you thought I couldn\u0027t understand \u0022private space company\u0022 because I wished to erase around 90% mention to them... this isn\u0027t the case, I don\u0027t care that much and said shortly : **a fancy logo and auto-generated texts make no difference**,\n\nNext, **Tater,**\n\nThis is not much of a semantic problem, more of **gameplay abstraction** and defining what you are abstracting.\n\nOne can say **\u0022Mission Control\u0022** deal with what we ultimately do with any space vehicle (before the mission, during the mission and even after)\n\nAnd the **Administration** deal with \u0022how\u0022 we obtain and build the space vehicle. Filtering \u0022contract\u0022 is not \u0022how\u0022, it\u0027s \u0022why\u0022 and \u0022why\u0022 is answered by the above.\n\nHence my disagreement with your that idea of yours.\n\nAs for your other \u0022rescue\u0022 idea, I see nothing fundamental to change either. I think the right change would come naturally if SQUAD reconsidered the way they balance the 3 pillar of Career mode.\n\nps : I won\u0027t have as much time as before to debate.
