I have been building more complex structures as of late. My current project is a larger interplanetary ship with multiple landers/probes/command pods. I am a going with the assemble in orbit method to put the parts together however this exposed an annoyance with the way sub-assemblies currently work. Although I do have to remind myself this feature just came out and its alpha! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I deploy a sub-assembly I cannot choose the mount-point (for lack of a better word). IE sometimes I want to mount from one location for a certain deployment (IE attach the engine to a decoupler) and other times I want to mount from another location on that assembly (say the other end heat shield). However it seems to only allow connection from the first part that was instantiated in the sub-assembly build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something in the current version that already resolves this? If not this would be a great improvement to the current version, at least for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T15:29:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is because of the way the build system works. The first part you place is the root. That root is what you pick up when you drag the entire rocket. That root is also what you pick up and drag the rocket (or sub rocket) to the sub assembly building. That root is than the only one with connection points when you load up the sub assembly part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA way around this would be to let us change root part while we are building. (I believe there is a mod that does this, but I\u0027m not sure)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil we get that, the work arounds are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign something with the specific idea of it being a sub assembly. So start with a decoupler (or a fuel tank), that you are going to attach below the thing you want into orbit (for example if you design an atmospheric lifter)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake a small root, attetch your sub assambly to this.
