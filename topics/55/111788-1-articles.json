If it detects an impactor asteroid you get an alert and the asteroid is automatically tracked in the tracking station (I\u0027d also like it so when you view it from the space centre view there is a red flag flying, and a Kerbal running around in a state of panic). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage it doesn\u0027t matter if you ignore the asteroid or not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second tier is where this starts to impact on the game. The second upgrade should look a bit more serious, more like an observatory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this level it is able to detect impactors that are 60 days away from Kerbin\u0027s SOI and as before you get an alert (and a silly animation in the space centre view) and the asteroid is automatically tracked in the tracking station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBut you also get a contract automatically added to redirect it\u003C/strong\u003E. If you choose to upgrade to this level you are entering in to having an obligation to redirect impactors. Failure to do so will cost you rep. The contract that gets automatically added to your accepted contracts will be to knock it off course so it misses Kerbin and you will get rep (and possibly cash) if you succeed. However if you fail it will cost you rep (quite a lot, and more for larger asteroids).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first tier is more like a taster, it just lets you know about impactors, but there is no consequence for letting them impact and no reward for redirecting them. You can then choose to upgrade to the next tier or not (and that choice should not impact on any other part of the game). You should get due warning that upgrading to the next tier will have consequences if you fail to redirect an impactor, but equally you can gain rep for successful redirects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if there is any need for a 3rd tier version of the building (or maybe have one that just gives you earlier alerts). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key point about this is it\u0027s optional. If you don\u0027t want to deal with redirecting asteroids then don\u0027t upgrade the building to it\u0027s 2nd tier. But if you want a bit more urgency to your game and aspire to being the hero of Kerbin (we know you are already, but now you can prove it), then you can opt in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like to see something like this in the game. Even just to have an early warning system without any consequences would be nice, but I think if there are consequences associated with it, it would add another fun aspect to the game.

With the current contracts system you\u0027d be able to choose to ignore them and the current contracts have very long time windows. I agree just deflecting an asteroid is not hard, but the challenge comes in having a small window and needing to setup a defensive system of a number of craft that are ready and waiting in orbit and can deal with the threat quickly and then return to a waiting position (so fully reusable otherwise it would become too costly). The fun in it is that unlike asteroid capture missions which tend to have long burns, this would be quicker missions and your focus would be on building the process to deal with them rather than having to make accurate and often tedious manoeuvres with asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
