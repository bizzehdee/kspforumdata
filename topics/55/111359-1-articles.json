If you want to show overheating in engines, please be consistent with the way it is represented in all non-engine parts, and give the engine a pulsing orange outline. Do I need to further point out how silly it looks and nonsensical it is for the interior of bell nozzles to glow only after an engine suffers re-entry heating in many cases, but not the rest of the engine? I would like to see my jet engines fire up and exhaust nozzles glow red after expelling white-hot rocket fuel out of them once again, like they should. The engine glow effects were designed for exactly this purpose in mind, and re-purposing them for re-entry heating (when you have a viable system for representing part overheating \u003Cem\u003Ealready implemented\u003C/em\u003E, no less) makes no sense, visually or otherwise.

As the part heats up, its engine emissive is animated to reflect that heat. However, the new 1.0 heat changes completely bork this system up. Now, the engine\u0027s heat is constantly transferred to other parts, so the engine doesn\u0027t start showing a heating emissive-or even overheating-until the engine has been on for a very long time. This makes no sense as the individual parts of the engine that are animated by the emissive (pipes, turbopumps, nozzles, etc.) shouldn\u0027t take so long to heat up and shouldn\u0027t conduct heat so darn fast. What I suggest being changed is that the emissives should use a separate heat value that uses the old pre-1.0 heat system. The orange glow is enough to signal whether the engine is overheating or not.
