And until we get stock cargo bays, or I download a mod that includes them, I\u0027ll probably continue to use rockets to lift \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E structural into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe bigger issue is that you cut-out the part of my post you quoted that makes the SSTO\u0027s even \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E cost efficient, which is not choosing to not recover them and refuel them instead. Then, on subsequent missions, you\u0027re sending resources up basically for only the cost of fuel.

The only thing you need to buy is the fuel. The truck can stay on ground. Right now Its part of Mission Controller, but when .24 comes out I plan on separating this part of plugin and having it all on its own. That way people that don\u0027t like MCE can still use the Refuel Tanks and get charged in game via the new economy in KSP .24. I also added a Sell Tank that can sell resources too.. Like kethane.\u003Cp\u003Emakes planes really fun. I had a small fleet of Space Planes in my last game.

Still, your spaceplane will cost quite a lot - these arerospace parts are among most expensive (and you will lose fraction of that each launch even if recover it). So its not necessary will be more cost effective than just do a small two-stage rocket launch for comparable weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes were never really efficient in mass fraction, since they have to haul all of these airbreathing parts and wings in space (where they just dead weight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, we will have to wait and see what exact cost values, recover fractions, etc 0.24 will have after release.

This would allow more staged rockets to be economical, as you could attach chutes and save them, even though physics might not be loaded for that staged part. Arguably it all depends on the recovery amounts, and the balance of the economics, but if this whole system shouldn\u0027t be completely trivial, then SSTO\u0027s as it right now, will be the \u0022go to\u0022 lifters, even if it does require more launches. To strike a balance will be hard, but I think staged rockets should be allowed to at least in some capacity, save their staged parts if effort to do so is put in by the player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallace","CreatedById":77574,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T20:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnly if the fix the problem of despawning parts as they go low.
