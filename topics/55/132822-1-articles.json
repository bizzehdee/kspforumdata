While, yes, the current system works, an idea came to mind that might make it be a bit more.. Well, interesting.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I mean by this is, mainly, doing an integrity check. Say I have a craft that is fully capable of SSTO stuff, and is meant to deliver a cargo and return.. But I\u0027m off on my aim a bit (And don\u0027t particularly feel like flying halfway around the world to the space center). If the craft still has enough fuel to fly to the space center (Probably by doing some math regarding TWR and optimal fuel consumption of air-breathing engines), then instead of taking a hit to the value of the recovery amount, allow it to be refunded for the full value of the parts (and whatever fuel remains from the calculation of fuel needed).\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn alternate idea to that is to have an option to simply refurbish and refuel (for a lowish cost). Of course, we don\u0027t want this to be abused with something that is just barely able to fly - That\u0027d just be silly. There could be a couple ways of doing this..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1: Variants. This is, essentially, saying that \u0027this craft is based off of this design, and anything extra is considered payload\u0027. This may be the most flexible option in most cases - Acting similarly to just plonking a payload in that\u0027s different each time. Any payload brought back would be refunded as normal, and launching a new craft that\u0027s a variant of the base hull just costs the amount for the payload and fuel (on top of the refurbish cost, of course). There would have to be limits, though, on what can be counted as payload, which would probably up the complexity a fair bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Tagging decouplers/docking ports. This idea could potentially be a fair bit more abusable than the Variant idea - But it might be better in some ways. Namely, shuttle-type craft could benefit from this quite easily (Tag the stuff in the bay and the external tank as \u0027payload\u0027 or \u0027disposable\u0027, whichever works better).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, yeah. Just an idea.. Looking for feedback, as this is one of those \u0027kinda tired, need to get this out\u0027 ideas that I had after derping around in KSP a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T03:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had an idea recently about these \u0022other side of the world\u0022 type recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not give the player the capability to deploy a recovery team anywhere on the planet? So from the tracking station you can position your recovery team, takes 24 hours to deploy or undeploy. Once they are in position they will show up as either an aircraft carrier if positioned over water or a landing pad similar to the one SpaceX recently used if position on land. You land your craft on the pad or carrier and you get 100% recovery, if you land close to it you get a high % recovery just like as if it was another KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis makes one of the most common scenario for recovery - down range - viable. You no longer have to fly the first stage or the carrier aircraft all the way back to KSC for recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rebelcommando1807","CreatedById":5892,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T03:15:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat works, too! Perhaps bit less time, though - Transit time (perhaps with an icon moving across the planet to the selected location), Deployment time (where it\u0027s deploying), Re-pack Time (Inverse of Deployment), and then another round of transit time. The deployment range and cost could depend on the player\u0027s tech level or the upgrade level of a certain building, along with a strategy. Maybe make it so it costs x amount per kilometer (fuel costs) - So if you\u0027re just recovering, say, a relatively cheap pod, then it would be better to eat the cost reduction. Recovering a Jool-5 capable SSTO mothership, complete with all landers, on the other hand, would net a far greater ROI with the deployed recovery team as opposed to the recovered funds reduction.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n..Would actually add an interesting dynamic, I think.
