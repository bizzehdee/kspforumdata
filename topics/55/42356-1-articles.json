Like fly a plane. I don\u0027t know how the resource system will work but if it works like kethane. You need to have a miner focused to mine kethane. Allthough there are probably other solutions to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is now I can ever only do one thing at a time. It is great that you can have multiple missions in flight at the same time. While they are coasting through space they don\u0027t need attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut a lot of things require a craft to be focused. Parachutes will not open if left unattended. Aeroplanes will fall out of the sky. And that aerobraking maneuver just missed because I wasn\u0027t paying attention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this could be solved with a multiple window option allowing the user to have several active craft at the same time. Perhaps even with their own separate physics thread to the cpu. It seems to me that this would be quite simple to implement as I can allready run two games at the same time. When done playing sync the game save files with a program like \u0022apples\u0022 which compares files and allow you to syncronise lines altered and new lines separately in an easy way. Allthough I only experimented with this it seems to work almost. Ive broken it a few times. But simple tests worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllthough it is probably hard to implement. Anyways would love to hear your thoughts on it. For me this would make this game so much greater \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. And really give me the feeling of a mission control like environment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso sry if it was allready suggested. Looked but didn\u0027t find.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
