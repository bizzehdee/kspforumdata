Maybe give the inline docking port 50 Monoprop and a light in it. A Mk1 Cargo bay, it can use the same texture as the Structural Fuselage but have hinges.

It\u0027s a cool part in theory, but it weighs far too much compared to just sticking a standard docking port (or heck, even a mini docking port) onto a spaceplane. (Granted, there\u0027s an argument to be made for aerodynamics.) I don\u0027t know about giving in monoprop, since I imagine it being a hollow tube that Kerbals have to go inside of. (So little to no room for monoprop tanks). That and Spaceplanes, that we generally want to be as small and slick as possible, it adds a lot of length to their profile at times. (Particularly larger ones)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if there was some support for something like connected living spaces, where Kerbs can only move through certian parts, there\u0027s no penalty to just putting a mini docking port, parking and fueling your plane that way, and EVAing them over to the station or vessel. (Maybe with Tourists who can\u0027t go EVA \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E connected living spaces it would be useful...?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could do with a texture pass though.
