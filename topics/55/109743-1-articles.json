The idea behind this is that to unlock the tutorial on how to land on the mun, you first have to get into a stable orbit around the mun (in your career/science/sandbox save), and then you would receive a message that you unlocked the tutorial on how to land. There could b other milestones as well for other tutorials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have an opinion on the idea, or a way that this could be done better?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T10:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer it be more like that you have to do them in order at least once, you can\u0027t just buy the game and go straight into an orbital rendezvous tutorial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
