I\u0027m quite surprise why it hasn\u0027t been handled yet.\n\nBut there is an easy solution that will make current balance still valid. Making an additional Part entry to the config \u0027basecost\u0027, this will work the intended way as a base cost, and still allow for the existing cost the persist.\n\nSo if a part doesn\u0027t have the \u0027basecost\u0027 entry it remains the same functionality, but if a \u0027basecost\u0027 exist it calculates the new way: basecost \u002B resource cost = final cost."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T20:23:11Z","Content":"I applaud the idea, but I see it being a huge amount of work.
