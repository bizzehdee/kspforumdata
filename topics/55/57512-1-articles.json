It would work similar to resource transfer where some resources(LF, OX, XE,...) can transfer only through parts that have fuel crosfeed set to true. Some parts would reciefe additional variable, something like crew crosfeed(?) and through those parts you could transfer your crew in exact way like in resource transfer: selecting two pods and clikcing on kerbals to (go) In/Out. Acually the crew hatch window could be used in the transfer with little edits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T21:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel crossfeed-inability of parts does not prevent fuel to be transferred around the ship. See image below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I would like to be able to transfer crew the same way, too. Right-click on one module, Alt\u002Bright-click on another, then just move crew members between the two assuming there\u0027s free space. Regardless what parts are between them. I am ok with imagining they go and exchange places on EVA while I\u0027m not looking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/N3PScED.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022N3PScED.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
