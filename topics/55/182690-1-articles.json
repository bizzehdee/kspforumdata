Timewarping out to Eeloo for 6-8 minutes would be fine, if we were actively doing something, but afaik you don\u0027t even change science biomes that far out so it ends up being a moment identical to waiting for the game to load. You can\u0027t do anything except look at your ship and pan around in IVA. Either skip to the chase and just have KSP reload at the set point (ie fast travel but in space) and have the game run all encounters and flybys of background vessels handled just like as if you were looking at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (not able to view them, but still moving forward with time) but just load with the vessel at the desired point in time. I\u0027d be ok with it, even if it took a loading screen (which would be no different than not having a loading screen and still waiting). Hopefully it can save time.
