Its the little things I find that count to a make or break experience for a video game. Now ive been playing for years so its nothing new to me. But I cant deny I was a little disappointed to hear... nothing. When I exited my capsule just that low wind noise is all I heard. (There was some kind of thud.. not sure. ) Not a rustle of the space suit not a clank as I descended the ladder and most of all no footsteps. So Squad by all means get some big clanky boots and record the sound they make on metal, grass and sand and put them in the game, please.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut beyond that id say theres far more that could be done. Suit rustling should worsen with sprint. There could be breathing that worsened with sprint and maybe even a max to where the Kerbal is out of breathe and cant sprint. Muffled crashing sounds ( like a football tackle ) when they fall over and an audible grunt. The severity of the sounds being coordinated with gravity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then why not while your at it add in persistent/permanent footprints and rover tracks while your at it!
