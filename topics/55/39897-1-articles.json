In reality, during the night, while the atmosphere does not get light from the sun and looks black, it still absorbs light coming from the sky. That means that stars and the milky way should pretty much disappear near the horizon. Also a little bit of fog would be cool. On the surface of Eve, the sky should not be visible at all at any moment because the atmosphere is so thick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ocean: Right now is just a transparent blue texture. You can see the bottom of the ocean a couple of miles bellow, makes no sense. It would be cool to have blue fog under the ocean so the bottom of the ocean is not visible but you could still see the bottom at the beach areas. Also, having some fresnel effect with a generic blue/greenish cube map would make the ocean look more like flowing water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Stars: This is minor but the background have little stars and they look a bit bloby. A cool solution would be to use point sprites with a star texture using carefully generated mipmaps. You can literally have thousands of dots in the sky from tiny 1 pixel white dots to big star like dots in a single draw call.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"providus","CreatedById":43660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T19:29:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t dare to say the \u0022new\u0022 stars look awful.
