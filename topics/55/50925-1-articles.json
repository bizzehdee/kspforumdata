But using them to get anywhere is a tedious process of pressing a button to accelerate and making sure you stay in the right direction. Is some sort of fast travel while using a rover possible? The fast travel should to be limited so you don\u0027t just travel from pole to pole, but shortening a one-hour drive into a few seconds could be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T11:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHolding alt while you hit the time accelerate buttons makes you go into physical timewarp.
