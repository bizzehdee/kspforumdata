That more than one player can control the same base and the same ship doing different things!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat a player can be taking care of the first stage while the second is taking care of the second and carrying in orbit or both doing things on the same ship! And in a space mission on some planet each one controls a character and does different things, but always free to do anything!\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe game is good today! But with coop of form officially without lags and problems would be perfect! Imagine people traveling through space with up to 4 friends can do everything!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI realize that the problem is in the matter of game time! But you have to have a solution to have a good experience with friends! It could be a DLC paid! But it has to be perfect in the coop!

You keep bringing these same issues up over and over and over again and then ignore any responses to them and claim the same issues once again.\u00A0 The only reason it wouldn\u0027t be viable is because adding it into a fully developed product is excessively difficult.\u00A0 It has noting to do with trolls, time warp, part counts or computer performance issues.\u00A0 Be honest with yourself, you don\u0027t want multiplayer so you don\u0027t want anyone else to have it either.\u00A0 It\u0027s as simple as that.\u00A0 There is no reason not to have it except you don\u0027t want it so everybody else shouldn\u0027t get to have it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not going to sit here and argue with you any further on the same non-issues we have explained.\u00A0 In fact, you have nothing meaningful to say that I would find interesting to read so you are just going go on my ignore list.\u00A0 Don\u0027t bother replying, or do, I don\u0027t care.\u00A0 I won\u0027t see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-01T18:09:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2017 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T03:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemember what I said about not making the discussions personal?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T06:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would you need a coop when there are no chickens?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
