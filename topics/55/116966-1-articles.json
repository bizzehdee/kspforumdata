Also, the textures are far from good. It\u0027s just enough to look at the water: you can see the same piece of texture being repeated, giving a sight like minecraft. \n\n![pmgJa7h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/pmgJa7h.jpg)\n\n.If you look at the left, you can have a perfect look at the mountains, that are far-far away. In real life, after you move further from an object, due to the atmosphere, you will have a less accurate, and slightly blue image of it. On the mountains at the back, you can hardly see the landscape. On the mountains in the middle, you can spot the trees. On the closest mountain, you can see the branches of the trees, the flowers, the grass. \n\n![kHraXhN.png](http://i.imgur.com/kHraXhN.png)\n\nIf the atmosphere in KSP would behavie such like that, low resolution textures could be used for distant objects, andhigher and higher resolution textures for the closer terrain, and, because very far terrain is not visible, the half planet shouldn\u0027t be loaded. This would not only make it look realistic, display the distance(good for landings!), and lower the system requiements, but really high, and diverse textures could be used for closer landscape, and it would look like awesome. \n\nCurrently in the game, I have observed that 3 types of texture resolution is used. The one you see from space; where the ocean is even blue;\n\n![uuiDkbs.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uuiDkbs.jpg)\n\nThe one you see from atmospheric flights, that looks like a creased paper;\n\n![1BiYrlL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1BiYrlL.jpg)\n\nAnd the one you see when you are closer to the landscape. This is what you see during low-altitude flights, and while walking on the ground. Altough the texture is terrible from close, this is used as many times at low altitudes, that it\u0027s homogeneous\n\n.\n\n![JUKhC1P.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JUKhC1P.jpg)\n\n![WAxDXpI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WAxDXpI.jpg)\n\n3 is not enough. Altough the fog would help it, we need at least 10 types of resolution.\n\nDue to the fog, the mountains at the left shouldn\u0027t even be visible, but a high-resolution, excellent texture should be used for the grass you are walking on. Of course, on higher altitudes, due to the rare atmosphere, even distant objects become visible. A lower-resolution texture should be used for the mountains, and the launch site too.\n\nI am waiting for your replies, if you find a problem with it, tell it me so I can update this thread."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:38:41Z","Content":"I support any improvement on the games graphics, you have my vote."},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:47:09Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t this what the \u0022Scatterer\u0022 mod does?

You will have a better sight, but increased requiements. There should be lower textures at distant areas, and very good textures at close areas. My aim is not to have fog, for realistic look, but to have higher texture resolutions, witouth the game going mad.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T12:42:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 12:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:38:22Z","Content":"How would having fog improve the game\u0027s performance?

Fog works ok on stuff like Tomb Raider, where the area around the player is a cave or jungle or something, but when you have literally an entire planet before you, fog everywhere doesn\u0027t make too much sense.\n\nMy vote would be for Scatterer and/or some procedural noise generator in the game textures to avoid the tiling effect. That said, I think Scatterer really only plays with the shaders and if you improve them, it becomes far less of an issue. Take a look at the WIP Scatterer water: \n\n![3ufu1pu.png](http://i.imgur.com/3ufu1pu.png)\n\n![N7w1xSS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/N7w1xSS.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"SquaredSpekz","CreatedById":124226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-12T15:52:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How would having fog improve the game\u0027s performance?
