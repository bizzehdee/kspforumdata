Also, the textures are far from good. It\u0027s just enough to look at the water: you can see the same piece of texture being repeated, giving a sight like minecraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pmgJa7h.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pmgJa7h.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.If you look at the left, you can have a perfect look at the mountains, that are far-far away. In real life, after you move further from an object, due to the atmosphere, you will have a less accurate, and slightly blue image of it. On the mountains at the back, you can hardly see the landscape. On the mountains in the middle, you can spot the trees. On the closest mountain, you can see the branches of the trees, the flowers, the grass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kHraXhN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kHraXhN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the atmosphere in KSP would behavie such like that, low resolution textures could be used for distant objects, andhigher and higher resolution textures for the closer terrain, and, because very far terrain is not visible, the half planet shouldn\u0027t be loaded. This would not only make it look realistic, display the distance(good for landings!), and lower the system requiements, but really high, and diverse textures could be used for closer landscape, and it would look like awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in the game, I have observed that 3 types of texture resolution is used. The one you see from space; where the ocean is even blue;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uuiDkbs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022uuiDkbs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one you see from atmospheric flights, that looks like a creased paper;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1BiYrlL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221BiYrlL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the one you see when you are closer to the landscape. This is what you see during low-altitude flights, and while walking on the ground. Altough the texture is terrible from close, this is used as many times at low altitudes, that it\u0027s homogeneous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JUKhC1P.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JUKhC1P.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WAxDXpI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022WAxDXpI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 is not enough. Altough the fog would help it, we need at least 10 types of resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the fog, the mountains at the left shouldn\u0027t even be visible, but a high-resolution, excellent texture should be used for the grass you are walking on. Of course, on higher altitudes, due to the rare atmosphere, even distant objects become visible. A lower-resolution texture should be used for the mountains, and the launch site too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am waiting for your replies, if you find a problem with it, tell it me so I can update this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:38:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support any improvement on the games graphics, you have my vote.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T11:47:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this what the \u0022Scatterer\u0022 mod does?
