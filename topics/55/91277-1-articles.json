Imagine just wandering through a dark cave as a kerbal, maybe finding a giant underground cavern or lake once and a while. It\u0027d also give more biomes for science\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-26T04:01:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74287-caves-caverns?highlight=caves\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74287-caves-caverns?highlight=caves\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87658-The-Moon-has-pits-how-about-some-Mun-pits?highlight=caves\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87658-The-Moon-has-pits-how-about-some-Mun-pits?highlight=caves\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emore discussions here too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
