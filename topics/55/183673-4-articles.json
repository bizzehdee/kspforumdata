Steam says i\u0027ve played just over 160hrs in ksp. And for me inflight action groups is the LAST\u00A0thing i\u0027d care to add. We have the opportunity to diversify the game. Terraforming planets or new planets or new parts. They were really onto something with the drill and ore converter bit. You could build a mobile base to fabricate parts and fuel to launch from. I feel like this adds a middle ground so that its not just build get science repeat. You send up the resource scanner and use other science to find deposits, you mine each that you need for what ever part you desire to create, when you have enough you make a craft launch into new planet, with different resources. I strongly feel its a good idea even if implemented in steps. Give players more to do search the solar system for resources send it back to kerbin or fabricate labs on other planets and send the science back as new discoveries.

Another Great feature I\u0027d love to see is not only weather such as rain or snow or storms for Kerbin which affect the conditions of launching a vessel (such as wind), but those conditions may only be for a certain region and launching from another location may let you have better conditions. (Another awesome thing for Kerbin would be seasons that would make the grass different colors such as white with snow during winter, and the rain being replaced with snow during winter.) There could be weather on other planets, such as salty rain on Laythe or Dust storms on Duna (Possibly if a dust storm occurs, we could see the efficiency of solar panels and the accumulated dust on them by right-clicking. Having an engineer have to clean them would be realistic.) Having these weather effects affect things such as taking tests with the atmosphere or using a thermometer could be a feature for showing off how amazing KSP can be with these features. Other things they could affect would be solar panels due to sun exposure from the clouds. Anyways, I understand this would be a huge thing to put on the devs, and that\u0027s why I\u0027d still be happy even if it was a 30$ DLC. I don\u0027t expect many of these features (such as the life cycle thing) to be implemented, be we can always hope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T11:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223587336\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555816578\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184353\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022XtraChrisP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/20/2019 at 10:16 PM, XtraChrisP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[sorting in\u00A0the tracking station]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...it just seems like such a simple and obvious improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, it is.\u00A0 As would the default sorting for parts to be by size or something.\u00A0 ...but here we are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T13:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not on the list but I would like the ability to share save files between friends so that a sort of \u0022pseudo co-op multilayer\u0022 could be achieved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo or more parties could build and launch and the save file would auto sync between computers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould love to build a space station with my friends like this...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T17:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223588269\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221555982660\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197033\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pultonium Tetrafluroide\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Pultonium Tetrafluroide said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother awesome thing for Kerbin would be seasons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would seasons be done on a planet with little to no inclination and axial tilt?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pultonium Tetrafluroide","CreatedById":197033,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-23T17:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223588553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221556042018\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would seasons be done on a planet with little to no inclination and axial tilt?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was just a concept if they wanted to add a tilt and make it more like earth.
