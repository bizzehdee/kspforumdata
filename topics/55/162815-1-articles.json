So I was thinking about a perfect option for that, which is to limit the visibility in map mode without a link. I would say that one will not be able to see beyond their current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003Esoi\u003C/abbr\u003E that they are in or beyond 1m meters, whichever is closer(this is so people could not see everything when they are in kerbol orbit). Another thing for this limited map is that the orbits will only show the same amount as the lvl 1 tracking station aka no patched conics or encounters. If this is implemented, then players will be more enticed to build a relay network, making the game more fun. Also, if there is a mod for this that works in 1.3 that you know of please point to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n322997am\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-02T18:43:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2017 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by 322997am\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-02T23:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nY u no reply\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
