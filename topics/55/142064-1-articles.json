I personally would like to see\u00A0both, however I\u0027ll get back to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, Kerbin has no clouds or weather patterns of any kind, which are a very real thing in the actual Spacecraft and Aircraft industry, launches are often cancelled or delayed due to poor weather conditions and planes have to take wind and turbulence into consideration when taking off and landing. Also I think weather would make a great visual difference to the game. The space center (and whole of Kerbin for that matter) always look the same, light or dark with the occasional sunset and sunrise, imagine what I\u0027d look like with rain and thunderstorms. I\u0027m not saying add tornadoes that damage your space centre\u00A0or anything crazy, just weather patterns which make for variety in every launch. The weather system could then be applied to all planets and moons with atmospheres, imagine a probe trying to make a pin-point landing through a Laythe thunderstorm, a rover in the thick of a\u00A0Duna dust storm, a probe measuring the intense winds in Jool\u0027s upper atmosphere, or even a space plane having to land on the KSC runway when dealing with freak wind conditions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd weather isn\u0027t the only thing planets could be enhanced by, geological features on far away worlds are what differentiate them from each other. Volcanoes on Io and Venus, moving ice sheets and subsurface oceans on Europa and Enceladus and aurora at the poles of Jool and Kerbin.\u00A0What I\u0027m trying to say here, is I think there should be more to do and more rewards for landing worlds far away, expending thousands of m/s of Delta V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027ve been talking a lot about enhancing the current celestial bodies, but there is also the question of adding new ones. For a while a second gas giant has been proposed for the Kerbol System, along with possibly another large terrestrial planet in the outer solar system. The second gas giant would be an analogue of Saturn and have rings and an extensive moon system. This was discussed a while ago, and I hope that Squad is still interested in this implementation. While planet-packs are great and interesting to play around with, a stable, In-Game Saturn analogue and Ice-giant analogue\u00A0I think is in order for a number of reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. A planet as far out as these two worlds\u00A0would further encourage players to learn the concepts of gravity assists, which would be mostly necessary because of the Delta V requirements\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. A planet that far out would also encourage players to establish more permanent fuel outposts and mining establishments. From my experience, manned missions to Laythe\u0027s surface and back are possible with SSTO\u0027s and a greater challenge for Delta V requirements would, I think, boost the number of people using space stations and mining bases.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Rings are gorgeous, and would add a great visual element to the game.\u00A0No-one can deny that a ringed gas planet in KSP would be beautiful and I think this planet would become the screenshot central of KSP\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Rings also offer more opportunities for Science gathering\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Two more worlds makes for more diversity. Those far away worlds make for a new class of long-haul mission that I think could be inspiring for new players and challenging for the older players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully acknowledge the planet packs out there that many people work long hours developing. I have tried them and had a lot of fun, but the stock planets, the ones which come with the game I download I think are incomplete in scope and in depth. I don\u0027t want just some coloured balls to plant a flag on, I want other worlds. Worlds which are wondrous, beautiful and unique. I want to send robots there to do Science, I want to set Kerbals on their surfaces so they too can take one more giant step for Kerbal kind. I know that Squad puts lots of time and effort into developing this game and every update has come with exciting things for me and so many others to enjoy. I have loved computer games before I went to school and\u00A0I love Science and Astronomy with all of my heart and seeing those two things combine has been an awesome experience for me. I hope Squad will read this and get something out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the forum user who has read through this whole thing (thank you), what is your opinion on this topic? Are the celestial bodies detailed enough? Are they numerous enough?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroAviation","CreatedById":104773,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T09:59:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would love this but I just fear that all these enhancements would drive my laptop off the edge and blow up in my face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"solarbearman","CreatedById":159439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-19T12:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe weather thing is very complex, my laptopotato will blow up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0I\u0027d love to see clouds.
