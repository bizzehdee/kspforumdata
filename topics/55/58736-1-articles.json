(Timers start counting)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After floating away for 5s (to give a little clearance) the sepratrons fire to clear it completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After 45s the chutes deploy so the falling empty tanks and engines can be recovered (assuming career mode money additions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlternate use\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could also then be used for remote deploying of small probes and rovers. If I have a main ship with multiple rovers I could stay in orbit and use the timers to launch them at the planet and have the timers retroburn the probe engines (assuming correct orientation) and deployment of chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERisk\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts with timers may no longer be within range of player\u0027s focus and then get unloaded from memory. I know models are only loaded when within range but I honestly don\u0027t know how physics, collusion etc work on out of range items if at all. It\u0027s possible that remote probes with timers just \u0022freeze\u0022 as they leave your range and crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow/Where\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to how/where this can be implemented, I\u0027d suggest on the staging list along the right in the VAB. Right clicking an item there shows a menu item \u0022Timer\u0022 or \u0022Delay\u0022. Selecting it just gives a text box where you can enter a number in seconds. This could then be overlaid on the icon like the symmetry count. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA zero second delay is instant and need not be displayed obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T19:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022edwardc\u0022 data-cite=\u0022edwardc\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut I honestly don\u0027t know how physics, collusion etc work on out of range items if at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t.

I usually launch with an escape tower at the top of my rockets. The abort button shuts off all engines, activates the tower\u0027s sepratrons, and separates the manned module. However, I have yet to find a good way to get the parachutes to fire once the sepratrons cut out short of spamming spacebar (since the chutes are usually last in the staging queue), and for low altitude aborts it\u0027s proven fatal a a few times where I couldn\u0027t hit it fast enough.
