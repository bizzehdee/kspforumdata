I\u0027ve noticed that docking can be really hard with the lack of a good camera sometime, so I was wondering if anybody had ideas to share about this. One I thought of, was you can send a kerbal on EVA with a camera and attachment line on him. He flies out to the other ship you\u0027re trying to dock with, turns his camera on and stays there. You go back to the ship, press a button, and hey presto - a camera screen pops up showing what the kerbal can see. You could even send out several kerbals for different vantage points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you all think about this idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T05:57:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou could use Lazor\u0027s docking camera mod, its very effective. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor multiple camera angles, use this mod which lets you place cameras anywhere on your ship and see the view. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-12T06:00:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2013 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tech Support\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T06:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know there\u0027s mods, but I really want to stick with the vanilla, soooo......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tech Support","CreatedById":89874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T06:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eohhhhh, can\u0027t help you there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T06:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I think vanilla should have what the NavBall Docking Port Indicator mod has.

If you insist on no mods, then your best bet is to make sure your docking ports line up with your control part and your thrust vector. Then, when the two ships are in range, use the navball to get them to face directly at each other, and then simply thrust forward with one until docked.
