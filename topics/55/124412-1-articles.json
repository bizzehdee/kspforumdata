It is difficult to impossible to use the standard docking ports to attach two base elements to each other with docking ports while on the surface. Attaching parts with the claw is easier, but tends to crash the game. Plus, the claw\u0027s dimensions make it hard to add radially to anything meant to be lifted in a cargo bay. I\u0027m thinking maybe a 1.25m part that has a covered docking port on the end and accordion extends out and can flex around to connect with other docking porst despite slightly uneven terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T07:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFuel hoses and 1.25m corridor sleeves, so it doesnt feel weird when transferring crew \u002B some KIS/KAS tools for kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T08:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be happy if you could transfer crew and resources around between any landed vessels that are a certain distance apart.
