The remaining fuel vapour in a fully drained tank can end up at the perfect fuel:air ratio for detonation from the slightest spark. It\u0027s something that\u0027s a well known risk in the aerospace industry, and bulk fuel handling industries. The risk can be negated by an inerting system, filling the empty tank space with nitrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ykrus","CreatedById":124999,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T17:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso, with this inerting system, is there a chance of explosion? because, in the game world we should presuppose that\u0027s built in the fuel tank by standard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T17:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with OP, most people might find that Murph\u0027s explanation is confusing although (I assume) correct\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JakeRocket","CreatedById":125042,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T18:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey should make more symmetries for spaceplanes (x4)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T18:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ykrus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ykrus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eso, with this inerting system, is there a chance of explosion? because, in the game world we should presuppose that\u0027s built in the fuel tank by standard.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a properly designed and functioning inerting system, the tank is protected from vapour explosion, although any liquid fuel remaining could still explode if vaporised in a crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inerting_system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inerting_system\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearly 20 years after TWA800, most non-combat aircraft still do not have an inerting system, and the FAA and industry are still debating the finer points of such systems. So, in the real world, it\u0027s more unusual to have an inerting system, than to have one, at least on planes.
