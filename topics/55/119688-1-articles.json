Right now they have only \u0027Start\u0027 and \u0027Stop\u0027 so if i want to toggle them via group action keys i have to waste 2 groups. If they would have a toggle option i could set this into the same group that toggles engines on my crafts.

Any other jet or rocket engine has a shutdown option, but rovers are missing it. I use shutdown to make sure all engines are off and it would be really nice if the same worked for rover wheels. It would be even greater, if 2 new key-bound standard action groups would be introduced, \u0027Power Up\u0027 and \u0027Power Down\u0027. Then it would be possible to set all start and stop actions that are usually used for a model into these 2 groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T21:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETotally agree\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-30T09:12:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut for me, there\u0027s something that can be even more important. There were about 2 suggestion threads about this before, it must be added. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor new players, you don\u0027t have to talk about action groups early, as you have buttons for the main action groups: Lights, Gears, Brakes. A button for solar panels would be more useful than the Brakes button. New players don\u0027t always know how to extend solar panels. Or if they know, they might find it too sticky. Also, adding solar panels to an action group is unnecessary micromanagement. Just like with lights, solar panels should have a pre-made action group.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
