Thus, this can be implemented to KSP as a new knid of contract work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as a sattelite contract works, it may demand a certain range, carry capacity, min. speed \u0026amp; altitude AND building fund so that you may be able to deliver X amounts of plane. And it may ask a test flight, for example \u0022Have the plane travel 10.000 km in a min altitude of 16.000 with a min. speed of 200 m/s, and land it in the X without any damage.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this feasible and does this excite only me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"legoclone09","CreatedById":142607,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T18:09:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is feasable, and that would be cool!

Personally I think that was a good idea for planes, why force people to do it one way? But it ended being a very bad idea for rovers because now you get a mix of surface and air/orbit targets making rovers NEVER the choice to use since they can\u0027t fly (usually). Sadly, rovers became useless again when the mod fell out of date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I get concerned when Squad says they are implementing a popular mod.
