For example: before the radial decoupler bug was fixed, if the boosters hit, say, an orange tank and made it explode we got a flashing explosion and the ship separated into two (or more) parts. The engine is now disembodied and there\u0027s a gap between it and the rest of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere did all that mass go? Where are all the little orange bits of metal and fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, should the engine still be attached to a different fuel tank, it would close the gap and press against the top, maybe even exploding more parts and making them vanish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not asking for procedural damage, like a scratch on the side after two ships bump into each other. I\u0027m thinking of the same effect we get when solar panels enter the atmoshpere, all the bits and pieces fly scattering everywhere but don\u0027t actually have any physics for them. It\u0027s just a visual thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a part explodes, it could be followed by bits of metal going in all directions that last a bit more than the explosion flash does. There needn\u0027t be a different effect for each kind of part, just a generic effect with a different magnitude based on part size\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T15:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProcedural damage would be cool though if they did it SH5 style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut then blowtorch staging wouldn\u0027t work:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://giant.gfycat.com/ConfusedVibrantAndalusianhorse.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022ConfusedVibrantAndalusianhorse.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Not mine, please do not rep me for the work of others)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SebLavK","CreatedById":77634,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut then blowtorch staging wouldn\u0027t work:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://giant.gfycat.com/ConfusedVibrantAndalusianhorse.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://giant.gfycat.com/ConfusedVibrantAndalusianhorse.gif\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Not mine, please do not rep me for the work of others)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the first time I see that!
