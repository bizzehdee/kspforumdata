So, after deliberating, I realized that I had about a thousand liters of unused (and now-useless) RCS fuel, and that if I could get rid of it, I could increase my delta-V by reducing my ship\u0027s weight. Therefore, I turned on ASAS and mashed WASD for fifteen minutes, until I had dumped two tons of monopropellant and gained approximately 200 m/s of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards, I realized that this was a valid tactic, and could be used to maximize delta-V where necessary; however, I really didn\u0027t want to mash my keyboard until my arms ached every time I needed to get rid of some monopropellant. So my suggestion is: why not include a button to vent/dump fuel? While the amount of situations in which this might be useful for liquid fuel is limited (landers?), it would be both useful and quite realistic in the case of RCS.
