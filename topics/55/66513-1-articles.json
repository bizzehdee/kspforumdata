Rather than having a selector for easy, normal, and hard make it so you pick what challenges you want in your game, but you can add in more as you play f you want more of a challenge or less if you are having trouble.

It\u0027s about trade-off, but I think the popularity of mods like remotech, TAC LS, and DER speak to the desire of [part of] the community to have more complexity in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think X-COM did a amazing job of allowing the player to tailor their experience by choosing the specific options they want to play with (I think they called it \u0022Second wave\u0022). The options were gated behind an achievement wall (accessible after beating the game on any difficulty) but there\u0027s no need for that in a game like this. Mods are important and fun, but a poor solution for game mechanics that should be core mechanics. Mods require on-going support from individual community members, and mod support \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E lag behind game development.
