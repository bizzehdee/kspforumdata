It would also make it more plausible why Mun or Minmus aren\u0027t blocking the signal - they aren\u0027t big enough to block all stations with line of sight on Kerbal - unless you are in orbit around one of them but thats the case for all bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunways and landing pads would be glorious but it won\u0027t happen anytime soon, I guess. If they would introduce these we should have to pay for them though - I don\u0027t think that should be the case for the other ground stations since they don\u0027t give you any advantage, either you have them all from the start or teh number just increases with sensor range upgrades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T11:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.
