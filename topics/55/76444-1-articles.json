I think you might be able to do some thing with the design and flight modes. Right now in the stock mode you are kind of in the dark unless you get out a pad of paper and try to run the numbers your self. The Engineer mod goes a log way towards putting actual numbers to your designs and orbital paths. But what if you could open up some kind of calculator that you could use as you build your rocket. One in which you could drop in the numbers into the real equations and watch those numbers change as you change parts around for the different stages. I\u0027m not sure exactly how you would go about it. Next to each stage a button. It opens up something that looks like a note pad. With the equations, elements labeled, where you could see what was going into that stage. Click on the corner of the paper and flip to the next page with graphs of what happens as the stage burns it\u0027s fuel. It would be nice if it could predict drag and elevation. It would be nice if you could set a power curve for it to follow and when to throttle up, so that you could see the change in over all performance, rather then just stumbling along through it guestimating when to throttle down and up. That\u0027s asking quite a bit more but it would be very helpful and I think it would teach people a lot about the give and take in a design. I for one would love to be able to plan a more accurate liner tangent launch trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELee\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pxi","CreatedById":78711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T21:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know very well that I\u0027ve learned various things while playing KSP, and I\u0027ll be one of the first to jump on the \u0022it\u0027s educational\u0022 bandwagon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, I have a hard time pinning down exactly how or where the game itself educated me.
