Habitation could be a really fun mechanic, but it should be so in its own right. When I say colonization I just mean needing to think about long-term habitation in space. Small crews on short journeys shouldn\u0027t really have to add anything, but if you\u0027re setting up a station or a munbase or sending 6 kerbals to Duna there should be some incentive for bringing purpose-built modules that keep them active and happy. The Hitchiker pod is fine, and maybe there should even be an MK1 habitation module to give players some flexibility on the lower end, but where it could really shine is supporting and incentivizing\u00A0decent size crews on long missions. I also think this should be on the carrot side of things gameplay wise. Maybe on hard mode crews might become despondent if left in too small a space for too long but the standard focus should be giving boosts to how fast kerbals gain experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T22:55:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile im still against LS in general, id love some sort of habitation requirements (because it makes sense, is realistic, but unlike LS, isnt time dependent and just adds a minor drawback to excessively long missions).\u00A0 Something akin to 1 month or less anything works, 1m-1year crew needs like 2 seats (and this doesnt count a pod like the mk1 or can), and anything above like 3\u002B years a kerbal needs 4 seats to remain happy the entire trip.\u00A0 Ofc it would have to be toggleable, and im not sure what exactly the penalties would be, perhaps loosing experience or becoming unproductive or so (so like becoming tourists in this case).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, i highly doubt my new warship would have any issues with crew happiness.\u00A0 Given that i actually took the time to model a full interior, crew quarters, recreation deck, briefing room, command bridge, engineering (reactor\u002Bengine rooms), walkways through whole ship, cryo storage, windows, and just about everything else a kerbal would need to enjoy their voyage through the stars (although said ship has so bad \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E i dont thing they\u0027d be visiting other stars \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NchsTD0.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/NchsTD0.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo crew space issues here \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
