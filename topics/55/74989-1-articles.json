Wheel tracks or footprints would need to keep disappearing rather fast though, or the game would choke to death under amount of memory needed to keep these permanent. Not mentioning save file size. There\u0027s a bit of difference between doing it for a few square kilometers and a whole planetary system. Not mentioning in that game you won\u0027t notice if they disappear while in KSP you\u0027ll notice it rather fast since all surface is initially \u0022pristine\u0022.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI totaly agree with you; chunking an planet in 1000 hex like kethane mod does is really challenging. But if we can load an savefile for the hex we landing to with some hex surronding him; i think we can do an fully destructive terrain for each planet. We need to load only few square kilometer then save them in many files for each region you have loaded. Like world of warcraft; you can run without any loading.
