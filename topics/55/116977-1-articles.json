I want something in space, but my launchpad won\u0027t launch anything but bottle rockets. U don\u0027t have any parts? I can lend you some, but you got to prove you can use them.\u0022 Wich follows a short series of usual testing contracts and \u0022kerbin firts RKS\u0022, ending in say reaching 80km and safely landing. Finnishing this, Jeb again, \u0022well done, tell you what, I\u0027ll let you buy every [engine], [tank], decoupler and small parachute you need from me for cheap.\u0022 Unlocked a few parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEntering Admin building, Boss von kerman goes \u0022well done, chief. We got noticed, and got some fresh-of-the-bench volunteer kerbalnauts ready to sail (hoping the proposed medic is introduced, this\u0027l either way be your orange suits), now as you know, this facility didn\u0027t come cheap, and tho that deal you struck with Jeb helps out, were still short on cash, and we need some sort of container for the lucky fools to curl up in if theyre going up there, preferably airthight. Am short on ideas here, maybe go see that Jeb fellow again.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Now the thought is that the major part builders can par as contractors, and their contracts are more testing and commercially based stuff (\u0022visual survey IN A ROCKOMAX POD\u0022, \u0022first 10\u0022 girder in polar orbit\u0022 it\u0027s just about tweaking the descripton for a lot the existing contracts\u0022), but having them gives access to a variety of their parts. Doing these missions counts towards being able to buy blueprints of their parts, or earning them as rewards. This will be were science comes in, the points being allocated to \u0022figuring out the blueprint\u0022, and a real cool twist here would be if spacestations could have a module to produce new small parts, if the science pod on the station can recieve the blueprint (via radio) and then being able to produce the part from resources. But mainly lowering the cost of, and being able to use parts without the builders contracts. They\u0027ll eventually fade away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you get the gist of it so far, were almost there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBases, stations and satellite contractors: Hoping it can be implemented in game code of course. Limit these contractors to two each kind within any SOI, but have them require upgrades and certain tasks performed from or within them. (Get crew from that station to that station, have fueled transfered, get to from minmus to that station) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pay in general would be lower, but not to far in game, so will the payloads, and eventually you will be able to start a station thats uncontracted, and completely in your hands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, on that note, contractors would want percentages on science done, so getting your own reasearch lab will greatly increase on the unlocking of late game items. Science brought home can be used for one-time uses of sciencecollectors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, ferrying and rescue contracts: Ferrying is where the major bucks comes in. Tourists will always be in groups, and won\u0027t pay loads, tho fair, and will only eve want to visit bases and stations, maybe a flyby (it\u0027s chartered, right), but not land on unexplored territory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVIPS will pay big bucks to land on specific sites (maybe crawl a said lenght on ground), visit an old satelite, stupidly close flybys, EVA-on-a-cable near some pole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue contracts should have the addition of sometimes just refueling their craft and leaving again, but on the other side come as maydays, not being picked up along the other contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it for today, sure i forgot something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kibbynought","CreatedById":148871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T15:10:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOooh, Vips could land on spots to survey for base locations, and be partially implemented to the continuous contracts\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
