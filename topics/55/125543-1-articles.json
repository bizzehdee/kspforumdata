Doing something closer to making an orbit than a sub-orbital flight, so you burn up longer in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s quite weird for me.

I see a lot of topics in the Gameplays Questions forum about this particular problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that a simple solution to this problem would be to bring the drogue chutes much more earlier in the tech tree. That would make them usefull, because for the moment, they\u0027re almost useless (except for Duna).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T17:48:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been wanting this as well.

Two tourists, yeah! But trying to re-enter that sucker is tough. It just doesn\u0027t slow down much, and the chutes don\u0027t get safe until 4km, 3km, sometimes 2km. You can hit the ground by then if you are in the highlands!
