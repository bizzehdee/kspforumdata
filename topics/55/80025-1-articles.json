Cool. So, my first orbital craft was unmanned. But the contract didn\u0027t complete. Unless this is a bug (if so, please disregard and move to the appropriate place), I am assuming this is because I used a probe to achieve orbit, as well as altitude achievements. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would ask that these be changed to reflect the intent. As such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Achieve X altitude with a manned capsule\u0022; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Achieve orbit around Kerbin with a manned capsule\u0022;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese more accurately define the contract fulfillment requirements. I am unsure of whether or not the orbital requirements around other bodies react the same way as of yet, I will test that and update if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
