When a spacecraft achieves orbit in real life, if left unchecked it can be pulled back into the Earth\u0027s atmosphere through a process called Orbital Decay. This happened to the Skylab and Mir space stations, and I believe would be useful in Kerbal Space Program. However, there would have to be some option for it (because if a player just makes a space station, sets time warp to 1000000 and lets it run, before they know it the space station will be destroyed). I\u0027m thinking of having an Orbital Decay option in the game settings, and being enabled by default on Hard difficulty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-03T23:23:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell.........

For that, you would have to have a system for automating that as well if you wish to cut down on the tedium. As KSP is not yet a true game (in my eyes, anyway) and is just a sandbox simulator (Career mode doesn\u0027t count and you know it), that\u0027s not gonna happen (any time soon, at any rate; maybe in KSP 2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you could record launch profiles you\u0027ve done manually, like refueling/-supplying a space station, and could set the game to use said profile in an automated fashion, then orbital decay could be a thing. However, for the sake of simplicity and gameplay, the lack of orbital decay is the right choice to appeal to the masses. For those who want more realism -\u00A0*points to Mod Section of forum* - You should find a mod that suits your tastes.
