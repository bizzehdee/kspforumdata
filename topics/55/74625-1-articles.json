Every game developer has their own speed that they want their game to progress. Squad themselves seem to be happy with the current pace of things, with multiple month cycles going between updates. I personally am fine with what ever speed means a quality product. But I also feel speed is a big factor in gaining momentum. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate .22: addition of a whole new mode, Career, science parts, development,biomes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate .23: tweaking of Career, new science parts, tweakables\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate .23.5: Asteroids, NASA Involvement, the SLS, and multiple under the hood modifications to improve overall gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last update took the most time, and .22 also took a large chunk of time. The next update has this so far instore:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate .24/.25: currency, reputation, contracts, recovery system, newer parts, and new UI features. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel the next update will easily be one of the biggest updates to the game EVER. This could be one of the most focal updates the game has seen and possibly will ever see, as the framework of Career Mode and thus the main game will be set. But once that is done then what? Would it be wise to dive right back into missing fundamentals that need to be addressed such as a new aerodynamic model, or go down to the little things and tweak more parts and add new ones. Or just do housekeeping on what is already implemented partially, such as biomes and tweakables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel after this update, which is bound to still be far away from being released, the Dev\u0027s should take a step back from the heavy updates. Instead, focus on what needs to be finished, rather than added. Not only has the last update sucked up A LOT of momentum, it also sucked up a lot of time. This next update is bound to take similar amounts of effort, depending on how far back the Dev\u0027s actually had people working on it. (they said they were working on it along with the .23.5 update)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless i feel the community would appreciate at least a small interval where updates would be more frequent, and changes more minor but much needed. Its one thing to implement large changes in large time frames, another to implement small changes in small amounts of time, and a whole new thing to switch between the two styles. As i said before many things need housekeeping. These things really aren\u0027t much more than half implemented ideas that show great promise, but aren\u0027t finished yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. IVA views\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Texture updates\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. SpacePlane parts touchup(goes with the Texture update)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. More Biomes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. more tweakables\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis goes along with changes that will defiantly be needed once the next update comes. Such as Currency tweaking, Reputation tweaking and more contract adjustments. Such minor adjustments would \u003Cstrong\u003Emake the game feel closer to finished, than further from it\u003C/strong\u003E. This all goes back to momentum and spirit of the community and their relation to the Dev team. We get the scope of the game still needs to increase, but hell we still only have 3 bodies with biomes???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not here asking for a new Aerodynamic model, or resources, or mining, or a whole new game play aspect. I\u0027m asking for some focus on what has been done, not what needs to be done. Getting the smaller things out of the way now and giving them to players will respond to what they have been asking for a while. Especially with things such as the age of the Space Plane parts, and limited Biome selection. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts time to pick up the pace and pick up some of the pieces, i still can\u0027t see out of my MK3 cockpit!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-09T23:24:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2014 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-10T11:03:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that there two ways of doing just about anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
