As someone who uses lander cans for rovers and fiddles with VTOLs, it would be really convenient to be able to switch this without having to resort to the docking port trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wouldn\u0027t mind seeing this as an IVA button for those of us who engage in Manley challenges (IVA only flight to Duna or Jool or wherever), but it isn\u0027t necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFailing that, what about allowing docking ports and pod \u0022control from here\u0022 options to be used in an action group?

And the orientation of that part is locked to its 3D model, so changing the orientation would require rotating the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked into this for exactly the reason you are and having done so, I did go ahead and add \u0022control from here\u0022 to an action group as the best work around I could come up with.
