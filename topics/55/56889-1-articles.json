This loses the bearing and and wastes critical monopropellant. Would like to avoid this. Would also like to avoid unsolicited camera changes on larger craft as likewise it screws up the orientation of the thrid person perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SofusRud","CreatedById":59276,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T16:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ejust don\u0027t have your camera set to \u0022auto\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T21:23:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have looked through setting but there is no way to avoid starting every launch set to auto. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears to be the default camera. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt needs a way to set another default, like free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
