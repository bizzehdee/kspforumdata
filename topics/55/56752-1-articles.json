The remedy comes from why real science missions don\u0027t always involve real people. You need \u003Cem\u003Elife support\u003C/em\u003E for the humans on-board, which costs weight, space, and most importantly, fuel. Therefore, I would like to start a discussion on how well a life support system would effectively shorten the gap between manned and unmanned missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
