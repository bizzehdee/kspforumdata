These parts specifically being parts of buildings (like apartment buildings, etc.). You attach the onto a docking port or claw of some sort of your ship, you fly over to a \u0027designated build area\u0027 then place the part of the building there, or you could just put a skycrane there and move it over. Anyways, once the building is completed and \u0027finalised\u0027, kerbals start to live or play in the building and you gain revenue every kerbal day for it. You could then make large areas of buildings to make makeshift cities, but of course you\u0027d probably have to buy the \u0027designated build areas\u0027 to expand your building. There would also be the problem of crashing your ship into the building, because if you crash a ship into the building, you need to pay for the building repairs and any sad, sad kebal deaths that occur during the crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDiscussion time!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnter your ideas or anything like this below.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T09:31:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.. merge KSP with Sims.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly... we need Peer review for suggestions..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T09:44:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMeh.
