And I am running Outerra at 45 FPS with just an also old AMD R9 280. By the way if you are interested you can download demo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n20GB is not THAT big, there are lots of games today that are even bigger then that. People download them all the time on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBUT Outerra comes with a very basic set of details. Once you install it you and start moving around it download the data on demand. It takes less then 5 minutes on my 1mb excrementsty internet conection, people with much better connection should get the data in 1 or 2 minutes. If you are in space the software can calculate where you will land and can start downloading before you even need it. For all the rest, it will use the basedata that comes with the game, which is suficient to render awesome orbital images. In case there is a problem with the connection, the software can just go along the basedata and display simple stuff like we are already used to with KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally for the sake of evolving digital culture (games and not only games), I think, the game community including mainly developers, for example X-Plane, KSP, Flight Simulator, Arma, Ship Simulator, Google, CMANO, and much much others should meet up and exchange idea on Procedura Generate World and decide for the best model or define the specifications for one future PGW that can be used for all and define one global standard, this way people around the world could help built a digital representation of the entire world and anyone could use that database to generate a world for its software. For example, I could look for Digital Elevation Models around my city, the best I can find and apply them to the database and then create 3D contents, for the buildings houses, etc. But you could buy X-Plane or KSP and while flying over my city or making a re-entry you would see my house or just land on my roof, because I made this update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis guy is doing just the opposite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe is making a KSP inside Outerra.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.outerra.com/index.php?topic=3062.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.outerra.com/index.php?topic=3062.0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-03T23:44:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2017 11:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by felcas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T23:47:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this can somehow be exported into height and texture maps like space engine, we could have a new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod (that costs you like 500GB).

It does not work in the same way we are used to see around, for example in Flight sims or even KSP. It is based on biomes, from those set of biomes there are specific characteristics that the computer is instructed to use to populate that biome. For example, for a desert biome, the computer must use a specific texture pattern, geometric objects like rocks or pebbles and specific vegetation. This biomes can be automatically set for example at a certain floor altitude to a seiling altitude, and then another and another. On the coast you can have beaches specifications between tropicals with more beaches near the equator and more rocky coast towards the \u00A0tropics, going toward the extremes would make beaches appear less to a point where it would find ice, but none of that is manually determined all is automatically done by parameters. That is why today PGW look great at high altitudes but sucks (compared to conventional scenarios) when you get lower and lower. It is an infant technology, but it is promissing because it is fully open to updates without conflict. And by the way even at the present suckiness level it is much much better then actual KSP scenario.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod could send just the data needed by demand like Outerra works one doesnt need to download all the data, only starting data for around the Space Center and low orbit flights. As soon as you accept a contract for a flight, software could ask you if you want to download the data set before flight, calculating all the datasets on the way to the designated area. I know, this is not easy, it is very complex stuff, but I think it is still a good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-05T10:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am fascinated by procedurally generated worlds too.

The developers could also give some or total degree of choice for the player to set the level of detail.
