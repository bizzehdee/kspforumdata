Some appear terrified, others delight at the extreme situation - but none really show the effects of extreme g forces applied to them. They\u0027re the same as in space or on ground.\n\nPerhaps some new, minimalistic animations to express g-force effects on Kerbals would be in order? Such as head tilting back against the back of helmet (when accelerating) or front (when decelerating). It\u0027s a little something that would greatly enhance the game\u0027s atmosphere!\n\nSome examples:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6d3CQ9tQuM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n(Well, I guess Kerbals don\u0027t need help there)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/xuqf_6oplMc?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n... then there are those badass guys... well, they still get affected!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjg6mRFzZzE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nHere\u0027s some more reference material!\n\nWe love to watch our Kerbals on missions. If they reacted to the environment changes other than by changing from terrified to elated and back expressions, that\u0027d be stellar! It\u0027s a little something that feels it should be there, like that smoke FX on launch/landing."}]}
