It\u0027s a solar orbit, and the altitude numbers are incredibly frustrating in the way they are presented.\n\nIt says \u0022Alt: 2725590016m to 2725592064m\u0022. Ok, now be honest, how easily can you tell if that\u0027s 2.725Mm, between Kerbol and Moho; or is it 27.255Mm, between Duna and Dres? Are you sure about that?\n\nNow try the same with \u00222,725,590,016m\u0022 and \u002227,255,900,016m\u0022.\n\nThis is a \u0022low hanging fruit\u0022, quality of life improvement, should be an extremely quick and low risk change, since there\u0027s number formatters already widely used elsewhere in the UI. It needs to change in the contract admin UI, and in the universal toolbar\u0027s contract quick reference UI.\n\nI was busy setting up a series of burns in one direction, trying to see how much \u0022free\u0022 dV I could find from slingshots, when I fortunately counted the digits forwards and backwards 5 times, while doing my best to avoid going cross-eyed, then realised that I was going in the wrong direction, fortunately before the first burn."}]}
