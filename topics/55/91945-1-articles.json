When you get close to the Lagrange point, you enter it\u0027s SoI, just like any other planet or moon. If your velocity is too different than the necessary one to remain in the SoI/Lagrange point, you leave it (just like a planet), but if its close enough, you get trapped in orbit around the Lagrange point. If the Lagrange\u0027s SoI is small enough, this is almost the same as being trapped in an actual Lagrange point...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, the lagrange points could be simulated as 1 m diameter spheres, which could serve as easter eggs for the players to find?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T17:48:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to tell you this but the SoI system cannot produce lagrange points, the things are very, very different and despite what you\u0027ve read, not stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease take a look at the other threads on this subject, a forum search will tell you a lot, also take a look at the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_Transport_Network\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Einterplanetary transport network\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, not possible with SoI\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClosing this one, it\u0027s WNTS anyway and stirs up too much backlash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really need to look \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68502-WIP-Principia-N-Body-Gravitation-and-Better-Integrators-for-Kerbal-Space-Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ehere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-04T20:12:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2014 08:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
