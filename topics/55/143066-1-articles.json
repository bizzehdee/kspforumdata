Or on Minmus! I haven\u0027t really thought this through - it\u0027s mostly a foundation for the idea but here\u0027s a roughing -\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCost based on various factors :\u00A0\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSize/Gravity of the body ( The further the deviation from Kerbin the higher the cost should be ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDistance from Kerbin ( Closer = less expensive, more distant = more expensive ( Mean distance, not current ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTime for construction to complete can vary based on factors. Facility may require engineers while being constructed, and those engineers will be left out of play while it\u0027s happening. The higher the level of the engineer, the greater the effect of them on the time and cost of the center.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou don\u0027t get to choose where the space center will be built ( static location for each body, for the sake of the programmers sanity - holy hell I don\u0027t even want to think about what would go into letting them be built anywhere ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have to ship all the necessary whatever to the site on the body ( I have no idea what should be required to allow the construction of a Space Center on an Extra-Planetary Body )\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMaybe allow players to build the facilities of the space center\u00A0separately? ( Launch Pad, Research Center, Spaceplane Hangar, etc. Research Center\u00A0requires a science lab, Spaceplane Hangar requires a tank of rocket fuel or something... I don\u0027t know. ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpace Center Facilities start at level zero ( same as Kerbin space center ). Cost for upgrades subject to same factors as the cost of construction.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nResearch Center research costs are the same, but if you want you can \u0022beam\u0022 unlocked tech from any space center to any other space center which currently does NOT have that tech unlocked to either just flat out give it to them ( if they are eligible ) or reduce the research cost. \u0022Beaming\u0022 tech from one center to another could have a cost ( either science or kerbits ( or whatever the currency is officially called ) or both, as well as time ( all subject to the mean distance from the body to space center beaming the tech ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExtra-planetary space centers should probably not spawn Kerbalnauts ( realistic approach ). The Kerbalnaut complex can be populated by shipping kerbals from Kerbin to the center in question.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nExtra-planetary space centers can spawn their own Kerbalnauts ( fun approach ).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPutting space centers on other bodies can unlock new missions!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPutting space centers on other bodies can allow for collaboration between space centers to do stuff!
