The only parts that should be giving drag is the cockpit, and the probe core on the back, but every single piece in the line is creating massive amounts of drag. Literally the only way to safely land this shuttle is by coasting at a 45 degree angle, and pulling up at the last second, hoping that the craft converts downward momentum to forwards before it stalls from drag and crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0hR05Mu.png\u0022 alt=\u00220hR05Mu.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cVO4V4L.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cVO4V4L.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Please, \u003Cem\u003Eplease\u003C/em\u003E fix this soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease ask me for a craft file download if you need one moderators/devs. I don\u0027t want to post straight it as I\u0027m quite proud of it\u0027s design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T04:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it is creating extra drag, wouldn\u0027t that make it easier to land it safely?

Is it possible that you\u0027ve simply got too much attack surface compared to its mass? Have you tried swapping the cargo bays for fuel tanks, or putting something heavy in the cargo bays? I\u0027d also suggest more wing surface, you really don\u0027t have much there.

A high angle of attack is one of the ways to enter a stall. Reducing the angle of attack, to level out, or even dive, is how you avoid the stall or recover from it.

If that\u0027s the case, you\u0027re either too slow, or have insufficient wing. From the pictures, I don\u0027t see very much wing at all, for the size of the craft. It looks to me like you\u0027ve got the wings of an Aeris 4A on a much larger and heavier craft. On the Aeris 4A, the wings are about right for normal atmospheric flight from subsonic to mach 3, including 50\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100m/s gliding and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be trying to emulate NASA\u0027s Shuttle, but that had quite terrible atmospheric flight characteristics (compared to a normal aircraft). It was often described as a \u0022flying brick\u0022, bordering on being unflyable. It basically had just enough flight capability to do a single pre-calculated direct approach and bleed off enough speed to land safely. There was no scope for a missed approach (expected result: crash), or a mis-calculated re-entry and descent (expected result: crash). The error margins were very small, and got progressively smaller as you got closer to the ground. If you want good atmospheric flight characteristics, do not copy the Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe red drag lines that you are seeing might be coming off the body sections of the craft, not the occluded contents.
