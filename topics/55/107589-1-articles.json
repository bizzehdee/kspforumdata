The only parts that should be giving drag is the cockpit, and the probe core on the back, but every single piece in the line is creating massive amounts of drag. Literally the only way to safely land this shuttle is by coasting at a 45 degree angle, and pulling up at the last second, hoping that the craft converts downward momentum to forwards before it stalls from drag and crashes.\n\n\u003E ![0hR05Mu.png](http://i.imgur.com/0hR05Mu.png)\n\u003E ![cVO4V4L.png](http://i.imgur.com/cVO4V4L.png)\n\n- Please, *please* fix this soon.\n\nPlease ask me for a craft file download if you need one moderators/devs. I don\u0027t want to post straight it as I\u0027m quite proud of it\u0027s design.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T04:43:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T04:44:13Z","Content":"If it is creating extra drag, wouldn\u0027t that make it easier to land it safely?

Is it possible that you\u0027ve simply got too much attack surface compared to its mass? Have you tried swapping the cargo bays for fuel tanks, or putting something heavy in the cargo bays? I\u0027d also suggest more wing surface, you really don\u0027t have much there. And then you might need more engine power for the increased load, but that\u0027s just part of flying Mk. 3 parts.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, I don\u0027t know, sorry."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T05:05:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The extra drag is causing the craft to fly so slowly that it stalls if you attempt to level out.

A high angle of attack is one of the ways to enter a stall. Reducing the angle of attack, to level out, or even dive, is how you avoid the stall or recover from it. It sounds to me like you\u0027re actually flying it right on the edge of a stall, if the nose is 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above horizon for level flight.\n\nIt\u0027s hard to be certain, but I\u0027m guessing you mean that it won\u0027t maintain altitude without having the nose very high? If that\u0027s the case, you\u0027re either too slow, or have insufficient wing. From the pictures, I don\u0027t see very much wing at all, for the size of the craft. It looks to me like you\u0027ve got the wings of an Aeris 4A on a much larger and heavier craft. On the Aeris 4A, the wings are about right for normal atmospheric flight from subsonic to mach 3, including 50\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153100m/s gliding and landing.\n\nYou might be trying to emulate NASA\u0027s Shuttle, but that had quite terrible atmospheric flight characteristics (compared to a normal aircraft). It was often described as a \u0022flying brick\u0022, bordering on being unflyable. It basically had just enough flight capability to do a single pre-calculated direct approach and bleed off enough speed to land safely. There was no scope for a missed approach (expected result: crash), or a mis-calculated re-entry and descent (expected result: crash). The error margins were very small, and got progressively smaller as you got closer to the ground. If you want good atmospheric flight characteristics, do not copy the Shuttle.\n\nThe red drag lines that you are seeing might be coming off the body sections of the craft, not the occluded contents.

It doesn\u0027t have most of the extra bits on the back or in the cargo bay, and I tossed in some engines because I don\u0027t even see any on yours aside from the SRBs on the wingtips. It looks like you clipped a Mk. 2 cockpit with a Mk. 3 to 2.5m adapter, but I didn\u0027t want to deal with that so I just slapped a Mk. 3 cockpit on it. I have the fuselage and wings basically the same as yours.\n\nHere\u0027s how it turned out for me:\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/iTSZU#0](http://imgur.com/a/iTSZU#0) (link in case the embed doesn\u0027t work)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/iTSZU/embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI didn\u0027t experience the craft falling at steep angles, rather it flew reasonably straight. What did happen, however, was that it flipped out of control at very moderate angles of attack. I had to add a Mk. 3 Monopropellant tank to the front just to bring the center of mass far enough forward for it to fly, but maybe that mimics whatever that is you had in the cargo bay."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T12:51:20Z","Content":"Alrighty I\u0027m awake again! I tried one last thing last night which worked surprisingly well. I added a set of [Elevon 3\u0027s](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Elevon_3) to either side of the nose and the gliding greatly improved. I find this interesting as I haven\u0027t needed to add frontal flaps to anything after 1.0 dropped.
