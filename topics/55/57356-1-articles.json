As oppose to hiring from the large list of potential astronauts, you hire from different divisions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2ldwy1f.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222ldwy1f.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EPilot/Navigator\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilots are a necessity to flying planes, and are the only ones able to do so (the mechanics would work just the same, a pilot is simply required to be in the command pod to control it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2j5b2o2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222j5b2o2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EEngineers/Mechanics\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese astronauts are necessary for repairing broken components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i39.tinypic.com/orv89g.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022orv89g.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EScientists\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientists will provide a more detailed and rewarding EVA report, resulting in a larger amount of science points to be gained.

When your Kerbals go for a roll down the surface of Duna, but \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E crash into a pile a dust, they won\u0027t be feeling too great. Kerbals sub-menu\u0027s will display their health reports. These doctors and nurses have the ability to patch up our injured adventurers and let them get back on their way!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach job role would allow for individual EVA reports, specific to their roles, eg: A scientists view orbiting Kerbin would be considering the effects of the goo, whilst a doctor may ponder what it would be like to remove his suit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is not to say a Kerbal cannot have training in multiple regions. When a $$$ system is added, you could spend time and money training up a \u003Cem\u003EScientist\u003C/em\u003Eto become a \u003Cem\u003EPilot\u003C/em\u003E, of course this means it taking away from your vehicle/mission budget. If you return him home safety, besides being a national hero, he can continue with his career and save you that extra bit of Kerbin currency on your next mission. In additional to all of this, you can assign a Commander to each mission, who oversees the entire operation. This has no purpose, just for a bit of role-playing fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
