So is Vesta, but it doesn\u0027t really have an equivalent in the game. Tuareg is correct, even the E-class asteroids in the game aren\u0027t massive enough to exert any meaningful amount of gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ the OP: From a game stand-point, the gravity in the game is really simplified using what\u0027s called \u0022patched conics\u0022, meaning any vessel is only affected by the gravity of one body at a time, unlike real-life. In the game, this is represented by \u0022spheres of influence\u0022 around each of the planetary bodies. All the planetary bodies are also \u0022on rails\u0022 meaning that they cannot be moved or influenced in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add gravity to asteroids, they would need an SoI around them, but from my understanding there\u0027s no way to do this without putting them on rails. And if this were done, you wouldn\u0027t be able to modify their orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there\u0027s really no need for asteroids to have gravity, and it would really muck up the physics system if they did.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T05:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the event that you were thinking of this because of the Rosetta mission, the comet is less than 4km across and has an escape velocity of 1 m/s.
