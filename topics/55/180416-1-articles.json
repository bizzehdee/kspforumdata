When you discover the location, I picture them as being neglected facilities that if you wanted to use them you would have to pay a minimal repair fee to get them to level 1. Once you had done that, if you landed and recovered near there it would compute your recovery funds based on the nearest operational facility you owned. Also, Gene could have a thread of missions to incentivize the use of your new alternate sites. Basically I was thinking that instead of being interesting scenery, the sites could have a story attached...AND, if you don\u2019t want to explore that part you should still have the opportunity in the settings to enable all the sites from the start or not use them at all.
