But a lock would be nice especially for those times when you get so involved you forget to save. Another option would be a timed sequential auto-save that you could set to say save a numbered copy of your ship (starting at 0) once a minute (and a way to easily delete the extra copies from within the program would be nice, like when you are finished or at a milestone you save the official version and click the delete all auto-saved copies button).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T18:29:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI feel your pain. It is altogether too easy to misclick and mess up something that took hours of work to assemble. And it does seem that the smaller the thing, the easier it is to mess up. I\u0027ve learned, very much the hard way, to save early and save often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure that you\u0027re going to see this functionality introduced into the core game, as it is a bit of a fringe case and is preventable with the existing save mechanism. Any reason a mod/plugin is unacceptable?
