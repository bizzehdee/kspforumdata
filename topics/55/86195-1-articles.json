Currently it is all just flavor added to the game, that can be turned off an off and increased or decreased at any time. By adding hit \\boxes to them you would force the player to either deal with possibly game breaking changes when they change the terrain scatters OR force them to choose the existence of them or not. (Optional terrain scatter hitboxes could add another element to this, but same issue apply.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m for and slightly against this. It would make the game pretty interesting, hell imagine a drill science part that is used to go drill on rocks. It would also make landing much more difficult. But i do feel adding this can open a Pandora\u0027s box of bugs. Imagine a planet of hit boxes that are randomly generated. It could make the game fun, but it could also open up a lot of ways to ruin a players experience. (land on a rock funky and BOOM kraken attack)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice, but there would be some challenges in the way of implementation. This would also be a save breaking new feature as something on the moon might just happen to be where a new colliding rock is and BAM explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T14:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI share MKI\u0027s concerns above.

The physics engine has to evaluate whether the moving objects have collided with each rock, and produce the result of the collision. There\u0027s a difference between physics collider shapes and visual polygons, which is why collisions often don\u0027t precisely match the visual model. The obvious way of implementing it would require adding a huge number of objects to the physics engine, or a constant performance-sapping churn of adding and removing objects to the physics simulation as you move over the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T00:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre the KSC buildings are represented in the physics sim? just do the various mun boulders in the same manner as the kcs buildings. or am i misunderstanding?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-07T01:06:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre the KSC buildings are represented in the physics sim? just do the various mun boulders in the same manner as the kcs buildings. or am i misunderstanding?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, the KSC buildings are part of the physics sim, but they should not require a particularly large number of collider objects.
