Then you spend all your new science points on new gadgets, start planning the new mission, calculate delta vs and what not, create a new craft and set off! During the launch of the new mission you accidentally realize you messed up this little thing, so you decide to start again from the launch... by hitting quickload. Which loads moments before the super hard landing from previous mission. YAAAAAAAY! LET\u0027S DO THAT AGAIN! And let\u0027s try to remember which gadgets we bought last time, if we want to still execute the mission we started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve done this twice already D: Am I the only dumb soul that could use a popup saying \u0022you are about to load the previous mission, are you sure?\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T05:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, KSP internally has no concept of \u0027a mission\u0027. The game doesn\u0027t know when what you consider a mission should start or finish, and you can have multiple missions going on simultaneously. So a warning of the sort you suggest wouldn\u0027t really be feasible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a work around for you to prevent this kind of thing, I suggest using Alt-F5 and Alt-F9 (assuming you\u0027re on Windows) to use named quicksaves. That way you can name the quicksave the same as the mission itself, and you always know where you\u0027re loading too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diegzumillo","CreatedById":4869,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T06:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESure, my suggestion was a bit tongue in cheek. In practice what it could do is detect whether the quicksave had the current craft active or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about alt key, I\u0027m on a very annoying laptop where all function keys have to be pressed with the fn key.

At least, I think KSP exposes the bindings for those keys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more I think about it, the more I do like your idea that quickloading give you a warning dialogue if the currently active vessel isn\u0027t active in the save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T09:51:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI once \u0022unloaded\u0022 the deployment mission of a satelite network for remote tech.
