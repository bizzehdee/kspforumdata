I wanted to see if it would be possible to provide an in-game warning when a user set amount of RAM usage is reached. This would be your sign to save and exit the game, or at least give you a heads up that a crash is coming in the near future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see a warning to notify me that I have hit 3 GB of RAM and should prepare for a crash that is coming soon.
