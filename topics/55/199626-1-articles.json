What I propose is that we implement various instrumentation parts, (i.e altimeter, airspeed gauge etc...) which would be able to be connected with the KAL-1000 controller. allowing the inputs to correlate to other actions such as pitch/yaw/roll\u00A0or throttle/rotor deploy angle. This would allow craft such as rovers, aircraft and boats to be automated.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EI would suggest the following parts;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EAirspeed gauge\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ERadar Altimeter\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EGPS\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ETransponder\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EForward looking Radar\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003ENow the first two are fairly self explanatory in terms of implementation -\u0022 keep x\u00A0airspeed\u0022,\u0022\u00A0stay at x\u00A0altitude\u0022.GPS is fairly obvious however in practice it would require a comsat array around the body you are on. The Transponder is no where near essential however it would allow you to mess with \u0022stay x distance from x vessel\u0022 and the such like. Now the one that i would see as being the most tedious thing to implement would be the Radar. This would entail having the terrain\u00A0in front of the vessel being \u0027seen\u0027 by the radar and give an indication of whether you are on a collision course with the ground or not.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003EAny suggestions / fleshing out of this idea would be much appreciated\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
