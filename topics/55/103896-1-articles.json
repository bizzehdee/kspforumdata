And both of them are in how jet engines are built in the game.\n\nThis is about the simplest jet engine nacelle one can build:\n\n![stockengine_zpsw657rlh7.png](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v119/pincushionman/ksp/jets/stockengine_zpsw657rlh7.png)\n\nThis is the shock cone intake (the heaviest intake), a full Jet Fuel Fuselage, and a Basic Jet engine (the lightest engine). Notice how far aft the center of mass of this nacelle is, even when the tank is full. It moves even further aft, obviously, as fuel is drained. Engines are the heaviest single component on KSP jets, and this is not dissimilar to the real world. But because the mass is concentrated in the \u0022engine\u0022 component here, this causes problems - the weight of the entire aircraft is unrealistically shifted aft. In the real world, the center of mass of such a nacelle would be close to the center of this assembly, regardless of fuel load.\n\nAs we all know, aircraft are very sensitive to the fore-aft location of the center of gravity relative to the center of lift on the main wing. As a result, it is far easier to build canard-style aircraft (main wing behind the horizontal stabilizer) than it is to make traditional aircraft, with the main wing ahead of the horizontal stabilizer. If it\u0027s a single-engine plane, the jet must be at the very tail end, and there are no good massive components to move the center of mass ahead of the main wing, resulting in planes where the main wing is at the back. If it\u0027s a double-engined plane with the engines on the main wing, the engine weight *will* still be aft of the main wing\u0027s center of lift. We still have the limitation of no good massive components to move the CoM forward, so we still end up with planes with wings at the back. I\u0027ve *seen* pictures of airplanes that fight this tendency to a greater or lesser degree (usually large ones), but I\u0027ve yet to come up with a satisfactory solution myself.\n\nAlso, we have no propellers. All we have at our disposal are high-power jets. Which may be fine for always making spaceplanes, but for actual aircraft to explore Kerbin, it\u0027s a real constraint.\n\n**So I propose a new paradigm for designing and building aircraft.**\n\nRight now, you need three components for your jet: (1) engines, (2) fuel tanks, and (3) air intakes.\n\nIn my proposed system, you instead need (1) engine cores, (2) fuel tanks, (3) outputs, and (4) air intakes. This is a little more complicated, but may or may not require any extra parts, as I discuss below.\n\n**Engine cores:** This is the component that engines are built around. They take **LiquidFuel** and **IntakeAir**, and produce a resource called **EnginePower**. *These* are now the heaviest components (usually) in the engine chain, but since they\u0027re in the center of the engine chain instead of the business end, we now have much greater flexibility in fore-aft placement, resulting in greater control of our aircraft designs. These usually look no fancier than the fuel tank in the picture. **They may or may not also contain fuel**, depending on model. They come in various types:\n\n. **Piston engines:** Smaller, lighter, cheaper cores found earlier in the tech tree, but are less powerful then their turbine cousins. Do not suffer from turbo lag.\n\n. **Gas turbines:** More advanced cores, offer more power for their weight and size, and can operate at faster speeds and higher altitudes.\n\n. **Electric motors:** Exactly what it says on the tin. Uses **ElectricCharge** instead of **LiquidFuel/IntakeAir**, but eats it like it\u0027s going out of style.\n\n**Fuel tanks:** No reason to discuss this, other than we need more sizes available.\n\n**Outputs:** The business end of the engine. These take **EnginePower** and convert it into **Thrust**. The basic models are lightweight, but more advanced **Nozzles** (see below) may offer other options like vectored thrust, afterburners, or reverse thrust. Various types of this as well:\n\n. **Propellers:** We sorely lack this. These are simple and relatively cheap, but more advanced models can be quite powerful.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .Limited to low speeds, less than 1/2 Mach. Allows for \u0022puller\u0022 designs, meaning wings can be moved further forward.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .Usually paired with piston engines, but there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t use a turbine to make it a turboprop.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .May or may not come with an integrated **Intake**.\n\n. **Nozzles:** Thrust comes out. These are the models that might offer the new options noted above.\n\n. . . . . . . .Usually placed in back of turbine cores, but piston and electric cores could be used to make ducted fans.\n\n. **Generators:** Produce **ElectricCharge** instead of **Thrust**. Why not? Not useful in space, but your part recovery rover will love you.\n\n**Intakes:** Are pretty much what we have now: Supply **IntakeAir**. However, more advanced intakes may also have a **ThrustMultiplier**, converting a jet engine from a turbo*jet* to a turbo*fan* and increasing thrust of any attached **Nozzle** for the same **IntakeAir** and **Fuel** (better efficiency), at the cost of weight, bulk, and, well, cost.\n\nNow, I recognize this would be a huge change from the system we have now, so a full swapout would be a save-breaker. Unless they\u0027re a new set of parts, making the existing ones (somewhat) redundant. But I think the flexibility we\u0027d gain in terms of fore-aft placement of engines would be a huge step forward for the flexibility or our airplane designs. Having an integrated tank/piston engine and an integrated propeller/intake early in the tech tree might make it easier for players to design small starter planes early on in Career for survey contracts while limited to the bumpy, crappy Tier 1 runway.\n\nPick apart!

If you want to model a spool that is just an internal number to the core which tweaks it\u0027s modifier a little rather than going all the way through the resource system.\n\nI suggested having the core create a virtual resource for a few reasons:\n\nOne, it seems an obvious way to force the user to insert a core into the assembly. With a null part, it would be just a flag \u0022does a core exist?\u0022 which may be opaque to the user. All other useful components list the type of resource they require and the rate they need it; if the part lists EnginePower, the user should be able to assume that they need a component that provides that resource. Without it, it may not be obvious that a core component is needed, or what it is.\n\nTwo, it acts as a way to differentiate between various engine cores of various capability. A piston core would produce power at a certain efficiency and effectiveness, and a jet could have different performance curves; a RAPIER core could switch from air-breathing to LO use. All with the same nozzle output. That way you could let the outputs handle what effects you get (thrust only, or add reverse thrust, add vector thrust, etc.). You\u0027d get more flexibility by mixing and matching, while keeping the number of parts to track more reasonable (you don\u0027t need to compare between ten different nozzles for efficiency and features; you only need three or four based on features).\n\nThree, it allows more flexible setups. Need more engine power? Add cores. This would make a lot more sense for piston cores than jets - a twelve-cyclinder engine is three fours stacked in series. An afterburner would essentially be a turbojet core with another core attached that\u0027s staged later or toggled via action groups. You could also run power from a single core to multiple outputs - with null parts it\u0027s not clear whether that would be or should be allowed (based on how the flags are checked), but a virtual resource would simply be split between all the outputs.\n\nBut yeah, ramjets wold be pretty awkward under such a system.\n\nNow, you said you\u0027ve \u0022worked something out\u0022 similar to this - did you intend to make a mod to implement this behavior?

From what I can make out from your notes in the OP you could attach an afterburning jet pipe to a piston core and it\u0027d be a viable combination?\n\nIf it\u0027s just an internal mechanism to transfer work between parts then sure, given it\u0027s an existing system that\u0027s a neat way to use it, but there need to be extra constraints somewhere.

So is there anything stopping me from putting my engine cores out on the wingtips, or directly behind the cockpit, while my actual thrust is generated elsewhere? Is this more realistic than the current system?\n\nThere is nothing, but that isn\u0027t a problem with my proposal, it\u0027s a problem with the resource distribution systems in KSP. I can currently put an intake, a fuel tank, a...girder? and a jet engine in line, and it will work. I actually think \u0022transmissions\u0022 parts to simulate, well, transmissions and thrust ducts would be a fine idea, with an EnginePower loss per meter to discourage liberal use of the concept. Anything should be possible, but at a cost. If we want to eliminate resource spamming, this suggestion ain\u0027t it, the resource system needs looked at instead.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 2. If thrust generation outlets are very light, won\u0027t I just use them like RCS nozzles to make silly-maneuverable craft? Why would I limit myself to only generating thrust along one axis?\n\nBecause they\u0027re not like RCS and don\u0027t act like it. The \u0022normal\u0022 jet outputs would look an awful lot like the \u0022jet engine\u0022 parts we have now. But that doesn\u0027t mean there couldn\u0027t be supplemental side-mounted small low-thrust nozzles available. It would be more like placing a bunch of RS-77 engines around a set of tanks to make a VTOL thingy...just like Squad did with one of the example crafts. If you want to make something that lifts off like a Harrier, and the available options allow it, why should this proposal stop you?\n\nNow, keep in mind, I\u0027m trying to propose something here that acts \u0022more like reality\u0022 *in certain respects only.* Specifically weight distribution. In reality, jet engines are finely tuned pieces of equipment, and you wouldn\u0027t ever grab this compressor, that combustion chamber, this other turbine, and that nozzle into an airplane and expect it to work, like you can drop a new piston engine or carburetor into a car. Engines are a Single. Unit. Even putting a different entire engine onto an existing plane is a gigantic engineering undertaking. This is *not* conducive to KSP play. In KSP, we need to Lego stuff together, and that means that you are going to be able to game any system to make some wacky stuff that would never be buildable in reality. I do not wish to stop that. I do wish, however, to have a system where if a user with not KSP experience wants to make an airplane that looks like a \u0022normal\u0022 everyday airplane, it *acts* like a normal, everyday airplane well enough."},{"CreatedByName":"marach","CreatedById":72245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T17:23:12Z","Content":"A long long time ago I was working on a mod where the nacelles produced bypass-air and exhaust-air the existing jets then used the exhaust air to convert to thrust with a reheat capability available as an extra version of each that relied on the bypass-air for an additional amount of thrust... unfortunately it never got passed initial tests since AJE launched...\n\nI also had it set to only allow inline designs but had a flag to allow things like [the Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Pegasus) to be possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T17:33:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 05:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by marach**"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrettKajmowicz","CreatedById":100570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T19:23:50Z","Content":"FWIW, this model would allow the use of a liquid fuel to turn a turbine to generate torque to power a propeller ... on Eve!

It\u0027s really simple. X mass {unit} is X weight {unit} in 1g.\n\nAhhh, the good old days, when everything was steam powered and we got five quarters to the dollar.

Jets are aircraft, not vacuum cleaners!) and little else.\n\nThe fact is that the rationalizations aren\u0027t particularly compelling, and I honestly don\u0027t see it being a must have in the stock game.

IntakeAtm is a resource defined in the community resource pack which a bunch of things use, or you can do it yourself, which you can set the intake module up to gather from atmospheres; you could call it \u0022InertAtmosphere\u0022 if you want, the name isn\u0027t important. You could make it sufficiently overpowered to run jets on but more sensibly it\u0027s a quite practical way of running already existing piston engines, like the RetroFuture ones.

Back on topic a bit more:\n\n@Scoundrel: you\u0027re missing the point of jet cores and the fact that stock jet engines are ridiculously too small for what they do - aside from large craft you should never be able to tack a jet engine as powerful as a stock turbojet randomly onto a vehicle, it needs to be designed into it with some thought. Currently they\u0027re even smaller than most rocket nozzles which is just silly. Maybe if they were all centrifugal flow, but not at 110kN thrust...\n\nThere\u0027s also a huge list of useful turbine powered devices which the discussion is trying to find a sensible and coherent method of integrating rather than recreating everything from scratch for every device."},{"CreatedByName":"Solarspaceprobe","CreatedById":125110,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T19:05:37Z","Content":"I love this!
