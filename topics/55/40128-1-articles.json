For example... I have a Saitek joystick which has multiple axis. Say I have a ship/craft that has VTOL and a main horizontal thrust. I thought it would be nice to assign the main horizontal thrust to the main axis, and the VTOL to another axis. That way I could have the VTOL at a certain percentage, say to hover, while I slowly add on horizontal thrust to start moving forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do y\u0027all think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cleisthenis","CreatedById":29412,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T02:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve spent all day trying to design a VTOL style rug/rescue ship to go grab Bill Kerbin from the water about 6 km out.
