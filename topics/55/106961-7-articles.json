I\u0027m not sure how good part occlusion in KSP is (so I could be entirely wrong here) but surely if the parts really are out of the airstream, they won\u0027t be contributing to lift or drag? So if they are causing drag, presumably they\u0027re not out of the airstream?

Sure - if your extra parts really are out of the airstream then they shouldn\u0027t contribute to drag or lift. Agreed.

We can turn down the drag value a notch or two. We can specifically reduce the drag of wing parts... see what I\u0027m getting at?\n\nPersonal opinion - adding structural parts without lift is OK - not every part of a plane is intended to generate lift.

But otherwise - it\u0027s entirely possible to build aerodynamic looking craft using wing parts - as wings. Using them to build panelvans, not so much. There\u0027s also big difference between looking aerodynamic and actually being aerodynamic. You can build a beautifully streamlined panelvan - chances are that streamlining won\u0027t be enough to compensate for the fact that you\u0027ve just bumped up the cross-sectional area of your aircraft by sticking a dirty great box around it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not a hack.

Even then, I am OK with (very) low levels of drag, as the current model would not take into account the placement of those same pieces.\n\nIn what way is a zero drag part not a hack? If something is forming part of the skin of your aircraft it\u0027s going to cause drag. Doesn\u0027t matter if its there for structural, lift generating or aesthetic reasons - it\u0027s going to cause drag. We can argue about how much drag it should cause and whether too much drag is too limiting - that\u0027s a fair discussion. Zero drag parts though are just a hack. Can\u0027t get the panelvan to fly because it\u0027s too draggy? Just switch off the drag! Presto - your creativity can fly unfettered. Except why bother.

They did not resemble flying bricks or whatever other presumption you might throw at me. Honest to god, I am also sick and tired of people who assume that the use of the wings was to exploit lift, *in spite of me repeatedly saying that this was not the case*.\n\nThe case was always: wing parts currently add too much drag individually. Let\u0027s fix that. Surely you can see the logic in adding at least a drag box for wings - otherwise I\u0027m not quite sure what you\u0027re doing here. You wouldn\u0027t then be interested either in realism or aesthetics. One poster got bogged down in resentfully hating on my suggestion of adding purely aesthetic parts with significantly less drag because I mentioned that a no-drag option would be simpler and not at all an exploit if the part was otherwise practically useless. But there wasn\u0027t actually a sensible counterargument to the former. So I guess we\u0027re stuck with wing parts for the job. \n\nAgain, I stand by my assertion that wing parts could be realistically simulated without making them drag chutes. I think people take the \u0022more wings\u0022 expression too literally - for the lack of parts better suited to the job, more wing parts does not translate into a riddiculous and random placement of wings across the fuselage in an attempt to get \u0027moar lift\u0027, it was one of the few ways to lego-style build planes into the shapes we liked. Now I\u0027d love to have procedural fuselages and wings, nuFAR-style voxel simulation, being able to mold the shapes into the form that looks most aerodynamic... But we can\u0027t. We\u0027re stuck with the lego construction style, which doesn\u0027t go well with the higher drag unless you like mashing together fuselage sections and severely reducing the wing part count.\n\nAt least *try* to construct sensible posts instead of attacking strawmen or the poster or using childish accusations of exploits.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So point me at the thread.

The superficial resemblance to a sci fi craft is also what bothers people. Numerous posters have said, \u0022I dont want x wings in the game/I dont want 80s cheesy sci fi spaceplanes in the game\u0022 - well, you can already have those, so why shouldn\u0027t I be able to add 30ish more wing parts that *are out of the airstream, actually make the craft look more aerodynamic, should not contribute to drag or lift, and are not intended to exploit the aero model*? I don\u0027t even want to build X Wings, because they look unrealistic. But I can. So why can\u0027t I build my more detailed and fleshed out spaceplanes?\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s because a few players feel like everyone should play the game in their way. They think aesthetics building is cheesy, or lame, or unrealistic (which as I\u0027ve demonstrated over and over again, it isn\u0027t)... and so think it\u0027s fine to limit creative freedom.\n\u003E \n\u003E Well, it isn\u0027t. Because we can have both realism and more creative freedom than 5-minute X-wings. We can add drag modules to wings. We can add structural parts without either lift or drag. We can turn down the drag value a notch or two. We can specifically reduce the drag of wing parts... see what I\u0027m getting at?\n\u003E \n\u003E And no one has so far managed to produce a good counterargument to any of those suggestions. Why? They\u0027re too busy accusing me and others of whining or being newbs or whatever.\n\ni completely feel this way, right now that SSTOs need basically a fuselage, intake, and rapier, with small control surfaces on back to well be able to control it, there is little reason to have any wings at all. Sadly, im nolonger able to use wings on a SSTO styled craft as aesthetic panels (and those structural panels are crap as they are both too small, a single shape that may or may not be useful for what you want, and heavy). I am all for more structural type things, larger panels (would make it possible to make a battlecruiser below 2000 parts), more variety (for example triangle panels), and in general perhaps the ability to check a flag saying i dont want x part to act as a wing, but just as a structural/for looks part (and perhaps make such parts lighter weight too).\n\nAs much as i wanted it not to, my SSTO Normandy SR-1 is dead, yes it still works, but its basically nolonger able to fly as i use wings for its fuselage and you know what that means from a drag perspective, even if its actually balanced with regards to the CoG/CoL.\n\nAlso, to anyone who insists on 100% realism, NOONE IS FORCING YOU TO MAKE SCI-FY! One argument i always make against those insisting that part clipping is cheating and unrealistic is that noone of forcing you to clip parts. if you deem a clipped control surface inside the fuselage a cheat or unrealistic, move it somewhere where it isnt deemed unfair to you, but there is no reason to make it unable to function there just because its quote \u0022unrealistic\u0022.\n\nI never understood the whole limiting creativity and must look and function exactly as a real life craft crowd. Please stick to your 100% realistic crafts and stop trying to impose extra limits upon creative designs, heck even sci-fi builds have their place imo. Im primarily a sci-fi builder, and i tend to use alot of SSTOs as the whole staged rocket isnt exactly as cool and badass as SSTLAB (single stage to laythe and beyond) concept. yes we all knopw no real single stage craft would make much if any sense past LEO, but hey, why limit us in a creative and fun game liek KSP.\n\nAt least there are always mods for us creative types.....\n\nAlso, i actually dont mind the jet nerfs, yes it sucks for SSTOs, but some realism is nice, or well i shouldnt say realism but plausibility, and its actually WAY harder to attain crazy performance outta craft. That said, id love to see some ways to give craft better looks (and perhaps even allow creating aerodynamic shells) without every part having major drag. Then again, drag model is extremely simplified. Occlusion ONLY works for parts stacked node after node, radial anything always suffers full drag, ect ect ect.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T01:15:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T01:34:24Z","Content":"I have a modest proposal.

What I see is a cross-section smaller than a Skylon surrounded not by \u0022BOX\u0022 but by streamlined INTAKE, realistically one would assume this spaceplane to be faster than other, in the game one would expect the needless Intake to -at least- not create so much drag, yet apparently they does.\n\nThe way I see it Aanker, Roflcopterkklol, Allmhuran and other did not complain that KSP 1.0/1.0.2 weren\u0027t realistic because they doesn\u0027t allow their aesthetic design.\n\nThey argued that the way KSP 1.0.2 simulate things now is much more finicky on what can fly without it being justified by realism.\n\nThe X-Wing and other \u0027bad\u0027 design were meant to show you can fly ridiculous contraption to orbit, but not design who were made streamlined using wing-part.\n\n(sorry for all the repetitions, I wish to keep it clear)\n\nPersonal opinion on this :\n\nI actually think this is a good news that you cannot easily exploit the system to make anything fly, giving the requested challenge/balance. (Now if only the Tech-tree didn\u0027t ....ed this up...)\n\nBut to retrieve the Aesthetic-aspect we LOST, something need to be done (drag-less structural parts/tweak...etc).

I\u0027ve been going off the pictures of pre-1.0.0 craft in this thread, and what they\u0027ve got in common is that the wings are bring used to encase the fuselage, or create a flying wing type structure. \n\u003E Like you said, in game design you work backwards. Those crafts should definitely be able to fly, but they can\u0027t because the every wing adds lift and drag. Adding a tweakable to wing parts would work, but what happens when you\u0027ve got 30 wing parts, and you missed one of them and don\u0027t know which it was? Sure, what I suggested is easier said than done, but if done right it would accomplish the same thing as tweakables while being less clicky. It\u0027s just coincidence that it\u0027s realistic\n\nI see what you mean, I guess I should have been more explicit that I think your suggestion will lead to unmanageable \u0022unexpected consequences\u0022. We are not actual Rocket-scientist, so the more complex you make a game-mechanic, the more likely it is going to be broken or exploited.\n\nThis is why realism-in-the-process isn\u0027t the best solution to obtain the illusion of realism.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Adding additional parts is pretty easy.\n\nIf you are talking of simple failsafe parts purely meant for aesthetic, I agree with you.\n\nBut many on this forum (as one of the post above mine) would imply/claim that with procedural-wing and an even more complex aerodynamic everything would be easier/better. Hence my remark.\n\nI do also hope SQUAD start mass producing parts (and a real tech-tree to go along) once UNITY get upgraded.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T07:07:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 07:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kegereneku**\n  \nfixing double negative typo"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:16:48Z","Content":"To be fair its a style preference, I actually put effort into making a nice SSTO and i do actually kinda like how it looks, in saying that id still rather be building something like white lightning, its more creative in my opinion.\n\n**The Nuclear Comet mk1**\n\n![XOHLykW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/XOHLykW.jpg)\n\n![it4k29D.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/it4k29D.jpg)\n\n![CivwyI5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CivwyI5.jpg)\n\n120kmx120km orbit remaining resources\n\n![5H9DjgQ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5H9DjgQ.jpg)\n\n**Low alt flight**\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/qypyCex6w7w?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Description:** \n\nCost: 216,566\n\nPart count: 243\n\nWeight: 126.2T\n\nQuite maneuverable in the atmosphere and capable of 1,000,000km\u002B orbits (More if you add more fuel in the cargo bay, less if you put a load in the craft other than spare fuel) the Nuclear Comet is about as good as it can get when it comes to single stage to orbit, With a choice of Nuclear or Rapier engines depending on how far out you need to go, once refueled this craft is an interplanetary explorer.\n\nAs an added bonus there are emergency parachutes for easy landing.\n\n**Flight instructions:** \n\nOn launch it is easiest to just let it fly off the end of the run way before touching the controls, once in the air pitch up to 40 degrees until 12km.\n\nAt 12km bring the pitch down to 5 degree and gain speed until 1200m/s, at 1200m/s pitch up to 30 degree until orbit, at 22km engage nuclear engines, at 24km switch rapier engine mode. once apoaps is at 100km you can kill the Rapier engines and use the nukes to orbit.\n\nIf returning to kerbin after orbiting without refueling you will need to move fuel into the forward most fuel tanks for stability.\n\n**Action groups:** \n\n1- Toggle Rapiers\n\n2- Toggle Rapier mode\n\n3- Toggle turbo jets\n\n4- Toggle Nuclear engines\n\n5- Toggle solar panels\n\n**Download link:**\n\n[**http://www./download/9q7m4i8s3ymdit5/Nuclear\u002BComet\u002Bmk1.craft**](http://www./download/9q7m4i8s3ymdit5/Nuclear\u002BComet\u002Bmk1.craft)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I went to my bank today.
