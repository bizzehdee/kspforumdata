So effectively, they\u0027ve sacrificed creative freedom for... nothing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee my earlier point. If wing parts have arbitrarily higher drag per unit area, then yeah - lets have some alternatives. But otherwise - it\u0027s entirely possible to build aerodynamic looking craft using wing parts - as wings. Using them to build panelvans, not so much. There\u0027s also big difference between looking aerodynamic and actually being aerodynamic. You can build a beautifully streamlined panelvan - chances are that streamlining won\u0027t be enough to compensate for the fact that you\u0027ve just bumped up the cross-sectional area of your aircraft by sticking a dirty great box around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not a hack.

If something is forming part of the skin of your aircraft it\u0027s going to cause drag. Doesn\u0027t matter if its there for structural, lift generating or aesthetic reasons - it\u0027s going to cause drag. We can argue about how much drag it should cause and whether too much drag is too limiting - that\u0027s a fair discussion. Zero drag parts though are just a hack. Can\u0027t get the panelvan to fly because it\u0027s too draggy? Just switch off the drag! Presto - your creativity can fly unfettered. Except why bother.
