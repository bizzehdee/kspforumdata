The reason as i understand it is that if they did then we would get some lopsided flights because you might only have a ladder on a single side of the ship. So my idea is that the parts have mass but they are added to the part they connect with rather than the part in question. For example, the command pod of choice has a mass of x, then the ladder has the mass of y. You attach the ladder to the pod, so then the pod has the mass of x\u002By. So you can have a realistic mass of your rocket without making the flight wobbly by having some mass off to the side. Unless im totally missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T15:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reasons for massless parts haven\u0027t been officially revealed as far as I know, but one of the speculations about it is it makes it easy to balance a ship with asymmetric part placement (ladders are often placed on only one side, for example). If the parent part of the ladder is not along the center of mass\u0027 axis, your solution would not eliminate such a balance problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I like where you\u0027re going with this idea, there shouldn\u0027t be such a thing as a massless part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T18:09:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...there shouldn\u0027t be such a thing as a massless part.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep. I think this has been suggested a couple of times, and I totally agree with it. I\u0027m not sure about the oft-suggested thing where you just add to the center of mass of the parent part, though. Realistically, the center of mass of the parent part should shift as well. I\u0027m just not comfortable with the idea that I could add fifty solar panels onto one side of a structural beam without unbalancing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I think that the official reason that this was done was to reduce the load on the physics engine of having to account for all of those insignificant little parts hanging off the side of rockets.

The centre of mass starting at 0 mass but adding each time you add something that is normally without mass. Treating it as a single object for the purposes of processing. Just a quick recalculation each time the part count changes either from stage separation or docking.

The proposed solution is good. Add to the mass of the parent part though. Masses at abstract points on your craft is asking for trouble I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens when such parts get torn off your craft? If you only add mass to parent part you need to change only the mass of that part. Should be doable, fuel tanks do that all the time. If you also shifted the center of mass than you need to shift it back. I don\u0027t know if the center of gravity of a part can be shifted during a flight or indeed at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T18:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesnt the engine always calculate the centre of mass after each stage or docking... or crashing and breaking off fuel tanks?

That way no special calculations are needed when a joint breaks. Of course you get in trouble if you connect a lot of parts with a lot of joints. Physics engines have mostly been made to blow stuff up, not keep them together. They also frequently treat moving the center of mass as something that is not necessary telling you to move the visible and collision geometry instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T18:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is this problem solved in real life equipment?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T20:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would think counterweights are the real life solution, or other parts that do other things that balance out in the end. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think in KSP that you could just add the mass to the command pod, but some ships have several so it might not work even then.
