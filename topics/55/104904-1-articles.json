The only place it really comes in is contract expiration, but those are usually so long they hardly matter. Do you think things should be added to make the timing of missions more important?\n\nI\u0027ll give you an example of what I mean. So, when I start out a career game, I do my first suborbital hops, then orbit, then hit Mun and Minmus, and by the time I\u0027m done with all of that, only a couple Kerbal weeks have passed. So then it becomes time to hit Duna, but I\u0027ve got to wait a while for a Duna launch window, so I time warp nearly half a year. Gameplay-wise this presents no problem, but I feel weird that my space program spent a couple of weeks launching like crazy, exploring the whole Kerbin system, then just stopped and waited for months. Then of course I launch to Duna, and while I easily can run other missions while the ship is in flight, there\u0027s nothing stopping me from warping and finishing that mission. \n\nSo actually, what I do is I try to only timewarp in short bursts, and run at least a few missions in between launch windows. I also try to run multiple long missions at once, and I try to hit every launch window I can. (eg. launch to Duna, warp to Eve window, launch to Eve, warp to Duna intercept, etc...). There\u0027s nothing in the game making me do this, but I kinda wish there were. I think it\u0027d be cool if features were added that incentivized running multiple missions at once.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n- Yearly budgets. In addition to contracts, you get a bit each year. Perhaps you lose it if you don\u0027t use it. Or maybe it\u0027s based on how much you did the last year.\n\n- R\u0026D time. Tech nodes could take a certain amount of time to unlock after you use Science to unlock it. Not long, but progressing as you go down the tree.\n\n- Construction time. Depending on the size/part count of the ship, it takes a certain amount of time after building to be able to launch. From the VAB you could choose to start construction and be able to take it to the launch pad when ready, or there could be a \u0022Construct and warp to Launch\u0022 button.\n\n- Science over time. I know we\u0027re getting some of that in 1.0 with the changes to the Mobile Lab. Perhaps more? Orbital scanners and things?\n\n- Life support. This could be a big one. If you\u0027ve got an orbital station that needs regular resupply, you can\u0027t just warp a whole year to the next Duna launch window.\n\nI don\u0027t think anything should be too punishing. There should always be ways that you can still run and entire Jool and return trip without interruption if you really want, but I think there should be incentives for not doing so. I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is that I like to play a weird way, and I want the game to reward me for it, and sorta force others to do the same. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T08:59:14Z","Content":"Welcome to the party.

It would be like a contact but longer and more complex with multiple objectives. It would open up multiple smaller related contracts.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - R\u0026D time.

Orbital scanners and things?\n\n if research stations needed life support and resupply science over time would work fine and could not be exploited. there could be experiment racks that need experiments delivered from kerbin. A geology lab that would need a supply of rock samples. by assigning a kerbal to a geology lab they would automatically venture outside and collect samples from close by. you could manually collect samples from further away for a science boost.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Life support.

If you\u0027ve got an orbital station that needs regular resupply, you can\u0027t just warp a whole year to the next Duna launch window.\n\n this is an important one and largely keeps the whole time management system in check. you would only need two \u0022resources\u0022. \u0022supplies\u0022 and \u0022refuse\u0022. crews would need supplies to stay alive and you could ether send them out with a mass of LS for the whole mission or resupply on the way. kerbals would slowly turn supplies in to refuse. LS stretching technologies would increase efficiency at the cost of electric charge. like a water reclaimer, LS garden, atmospheric processor. stations would still need resupply but would consume them more slowly."},{"CreatedByName":"JumpsterG","CreatedById":63396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T12:26:22Z","Content":"Have any of you done a mission to Eeloo or Jool lately?

This way, it could be set up to add extra sense of purpose to many space exploration type things that the game doesn\u0027t do very well.\n\nIf done well, it could provide players with reasons to go to places they\u0027ve already collected all the science points from, other than just doing contracts they\u0027ve been asked to do.\n\nThis blog post summarises an approach to time based budget I came up with, with those ideas in mind. \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3444-An-aproach-to-Time-based-funding](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/3444-An-aproach-to-Time-based-funding)\n\nA set budget that you can\u0027t go over per year could work too, though I do think the yearly payment approach would fit in a little better.\n\nEither way, what\u0027s important is how it\u0027s earnt.\n\nBudget could simply be tied to reputation, which could be made to decrees if there are long periods of inactivity, but I don\u0027t see that working to well with the current reputation and strategies system. Plus, it misses out on the opportunity to reward many more things in a more complex way.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think the idea of life support and construction time are interesting for a particular play style, but are quite damaging to others. If what you want to do is just run one single big mission to a particular location, then bring it home, then start on the next one, then these ideas are going to add a dimension to the challenge.\n\nI agree, but this is why we have different game modes. \n\nIt might be possible to play like that in this sort of game mode, if you\u0027re careful, and keep missions low cost.\n\nHowever, this mode will support a fairly different playstyle- for those that want a full space program experience, rather than just being designer and pilot.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Have any of you done a mission to Eeloo or Jool lately?

The fact that missions to outer planets take a long time is something real space program must face.\n\nIt\u0027s also a matter of balance- it should be possible to accrue enough funds in a reasonable amount of time, for a reasonable amount of effort.\n\nThe funding issue is something a successful space program must address. It\u0027s a matter of cost benefit- if the things you\u0027re doing are costing more than they are worth, it\u0027s time to change something. If a mission to Jool is not financially viable, then other options, like downsizing the mission, or saving up some more first make sense.\n\n These are all challenges we\u0027d need to face to become successful space program directors. \n\nPlus, it does make sense to do a few other missions while waiting for a Jool mission to arrive- if time is a factor you\u0027ll have a lot more reason to pace yourself, and make some use of your time.\n\n\u003E I believe there are solutions to this problem.

Whatever is done to bring more management to the game, the systems need to be fully fleshed out and not just impose a regular funds sink or hard penalty for neglecting flights in progress.\n\nI definitely agree. Lifesupport should be simple, and balanced so bringing enough is only a real challenge when you need a few years worth. \n\n[![5RViAPNm.png](http://i.imgur.com/5RViAPNm.png)](http://imgur.com/5RViAPN)\n\nMade this ages ago. Perhaps the amount of time lifesupport would last for should be higher. Air and water can be recycled, so the life support resource should be treated like food, if anything.\n\nAdd some ability to replenish life support using ISRU, and you could have bases which are self-sufficient, or even serve as supply centres for other missions.\n\nCollectors and recyclers should be heavy enough that they only become a the better option for big missions.\n\nCollectors should barely work in most places, work at low rates in others, and fastest on planets which are closest to habitable.\n\nI think the best way to do automated supply missions would be to abstract them completely. \n\nThis would avoid a lot of complications that arise the automated flights had to be fully simulated by the game.\n\nYou\u0027d have to demonstrate it was possible, ( save something like extra planetary launchpads being added, demonstrate that missions that don\u0027t start from KSC can be done with a reusable vessel.) \n\nBut then, every so often, a certain amount of resource (plus fuel) would disappear from a tanks on one vessel, (Or be purchased at KSC) and appear later in the tanks of another.\n\nTime taken, fuel needed, amount delivered, (vessel cost for KSC launches), could all be determined by your demonstration run, and the nature of available transfer windows. \n\n[![bsW59WS.png](http://i.imgur.com/bsW59WS.png)](http://imgur.com/bsW59WS)\n\nThis could be thought of as contracting out your re-supply missions to another agency, or perhaps you must set aside skilled pilots of your own to do it. Either way, there should be a fair payment needed to have a flight happen without doing it yourself. \n\nI also think it would be great to have more things that happen while you are warping- that would make the time you\u0027ve fast forwarded through seem a lot less wasted. \n\nFor example, kerbals in bases, stations could get offered contracts to perform research. Scientists left in one place for a very long time could collect small extra bits of science (up until a point) on their own. It wouldn\u0027t be worth much, you\u0027d get more leaving them in a science lab, but it would be better than them being idle all that time.\n\nBut there always should be reasons to go and do things yourself.\n\nLastly, I don\u0027t think any of this could really work without something like kerbal alarm clock. Otherwise, there\u0027d be too much to think about. \n\nYou need to be able to set some warnings for when a you need to pay attention to a ship, if something is finished, or if something is starting to run out of life support."},{"CreatedByName":"Instresu","CreatedById":119022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:17:27Z","Content":"The only time management I would love to see is slow motion.
