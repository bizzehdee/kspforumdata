I recently built a shell for an inline cargo tank out of large radiator panels f.e... i see constructions here on the forums, using undeployed\u00A0solar panels as \u0022equipment boxes\u0022, retracted landing gear,\u00A0air intakes and wings as part of a custom hull design and so on. This all looks quite nice, but in most cases,\u00A0noone wants the function, as some of them wont allow it,\u00A0to use KSP inputs as they were intended (or you just dont like it, like in my example... i dont want my cargo protection hull to heat up...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn option to select between \u0022functional\u0022 and \u0022structural\u0022 could solve this. \u0022Functional\u0022 would allow for intended\u00A0use of the part, while \u0022structural\u0022 removes all functionality from that specific part, being nothing more than a good looking part of a complex vessel (and by this, saving processing time and memory).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo we need this at all? Do we want such thing to be stock, or would that be something for a mod?\u00A0What do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T18:49:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027d imagine there is a small part mod that will satisfy your construction needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Vanilla Construction, I believe there is already Structural beams and other parts for building.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you decide to go out of the box, and use parts for their unintended purpose, it should be somewhat easy to clone the part and tweak the settings on your own game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the \u0022in your own game\u0022 - For me personally it makes no sense to have a utility for disabling heat on certain parts only (F12 menu can just disable the whole thing if i need), or a\u00A0duplicate set of parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i\u0027d say no, it is not widely needed, but i\u0027m sure a mod already exists with parts to help build complex structures..I do like the ability to save processing time, but i believe by definition making complex objects is going to increase processing and memory regardless (and there are already mods dedicated to this as well)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T21:01:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also would say no.
