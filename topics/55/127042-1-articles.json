This might come as nitpicking but I thought their drag was dependant of their canopies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/g1klz/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: oops, wanted to post this in the technical support forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-04T23:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2015 11:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by m4v\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redhaze","CreatedById":137633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T00:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmmh. interesting. For optimal testing, you might want to repeat that test, but this time with the parachutes on each arm a different orientation. That way you should get a balance-scales effect if the difference really is that big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T13:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can only do that without changing the lever arm with the radials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/WBgi950.png\u0022 alt=\u0022WBgi950.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T17:46:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the base part orientation also plays a factor in the drag (because the case itself has drag). Though I don\u0027t think it ought to be as big as what you are showing. So quite possibly there are some issues with the orientation code for the cubes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
