Personally I don\u0026#39;t have a problem with that in KSP; there are already a lot of impractical possibilities that can be overcome with Whackjob-level part count. If your design has to look completely ridiculous to do something ridiculous, well, that\u0026#39;s being Kerbal. And then we can all moan about people spamming electric motors with a 1.05 payload fraction to make 1000 ton infinite range lifters the same way we moan about clipped fuel tanks :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe the model to follow is the ion engine. Somehow it\u0026#39;s balanced enough in the game that there are very few large interplanetary ships that spam ions... I guess it\u0026#39;s that there are more practical ways to do the job, like with LV-Ns. So, if it were [I]possible [/I]to build a monster electric prop plane, but so [I]impractical [/I]that almost everyone would do biome hopping/circumnavigation some other way, then the electric Tupolev would just be a curiosity, a stunt for the amusement of onlookers, and no harm done.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nETA: Ninja\u0026#39;d by last two posts, but I think my argument stands as-is.\n"}]}
