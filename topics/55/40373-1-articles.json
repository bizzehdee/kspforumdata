Also I\u0027m under the impression that maybe there are some limitations to what you guys can \u0022record\u0022 of the game\u0027s state at a given moment and thus thats why quicksave works as it works (am I right?), but even so I feel that there might be some room for improvement over this matter. Can you shed some light over this matter?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I know we are all playing a WIP game, but losing a afternoon\u0027s worth of orbiting and docking (both time-consuming activities) because F5 was supposedly quicksaving (except it wasn\u0027t) or it won\u0027t work at all (bug reported on the proper forum section), can be a bit frustrating for the player, specially after an afternoon of something so tedious like orbit interceptions and docking, that besides taking forever to do, are also difficult to execute. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just killed 3 kerbals in orbit (canceled the flight) because I lacked the patience to play a painstakingly long rescue mission all over again! Those 3 guys are on you KSP dev-team!! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T00:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game saves whenever you quit from the space centre.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richter","CreatedById":74413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T01:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI meant \u0022In mission\u0022 save, the same as the \u0022full save\u0022, but from the stage/map views.

That would explain why maneuver nodes aren\u0027t saved (if I\u0027m not mistaken, that feature is even scratched from the dev roadmap), since the nodes may belong the map\u0027s state, which isn\u0027t saved (or something of the sort). That also adds up to the reason why you can\u0027t trigger quickload from outside the map/stage views. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve noticed that quicksave isn\u0027t all that reliable to record mission progress, sometimes it works, sometimes it won\u0027t. I\u0027ve also noticed that saving on the Space Center won\u0027t do any good in some conditions, such as saving your ship\u0027s position and condition before trying to dock (for example), sometimes you return to space and the ships have drifted away, because they keep moving due to game\u0027s realism, and that\u0027s correct but it sucks when you are a total n00b and want to save before you make a mess of your flight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that quicksave is meant to be of help with such game-saving needs, however what if I want to save my whole game \u0022as is\u0022 because, for instance I can\u0027t play anymore? I either risk it with quicksave or leave it knowing that the next time I will have to restart my maneuvers, the third option is to leave the game on pause (it has happened). I can\u0027t also keep the state of different flights or different moments on a specific flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus I figured that an \u0022In-Mission\u0022 full-save feature might be a good adition to the game, something that keeps a bit more data than the current quicksave and streamlines a bit the way we save and load progress inside the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I may elaborate a bit, it would keep current \u0022view\u0022 info besides all the other data, so if the player saved it on the map it loads back on the map, if it was on stage, it would load on stage (with the ship\u0027s status preserved of course), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T06:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI get the impression that the eventual planned style of gameplay is meant to be permadeath, which sort of flies in the face of having the ability to reload old saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaves are needed for now because it\u0027s still buggy enough that it\u0027s still unfair to enforce permadeath on you when half the time you died because of a clipping bug rather than because of your flying or engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
