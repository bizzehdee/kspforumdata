All the information is both technical and precise. The filtering helps a little. As does the \u0022progress\u0022 bars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of \u0022do I need to go back to [x] for more science?\u0022 it\u0027s relatively handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ability to sort by Value to see which science still needs to be completed is also handy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach science experiment has maximum and a current value... so show those. In effect, simplify things by replacing \u0022Current Data Value:\u0022 and \u0022Science\u0022 with a simple \u0022Collected: x of y\u0022. The \u0022Data Value\u0022 is one of those fields that has significance to the programmers and background calculations, but as players I\u0027m not convinced we really need to know it. And whilst \u0022Science\u0022 as a \u0022how much so far\u0022 is simple enough, it\u0027s biggest use it by comparing it with the overall total. For example, I can sort by \u0022Science\u0022, but sorting doesn\u0027t really give me any new, useful information. Even sorting by experiment name isn\u0027t that useful, since the names all start with the type of experiment. As I say, accurate but not all that helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see experiments that haven\u0027t been started yet. Perhaps show them grey\u0027d out, etc. But if people are going to have goals, those goals need to be presented to the player within the game. So whilst I may not have done a surface sample at the Mun Polar Crater, it would be nice if the game let me know I could/should. Without going outside the game to wiki\u0027s, etc. Not least because right now, the game has no way of letting new players know what biomes are available. Plus little stuff, like \u0022did I forget to do a lower atmosphere experiment around Minmus?\u0022 or \u0022now that I have my Gravity Detector, where should I go use it?\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, some of the Biomes aren\u0027t unique. For example, my current archive include TWO \u0022Kerbin\u0027s Shores\u0022. I thought I\u0027d seen other examples, but I restarted recently - so I\u0027m not 100% certain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a tiny comment. Right now, there\u0027s no way within the game to know what biomes exist and where to go looking for them. I realise this is something for the far future, but I wanted to highlight it mainly because it\u0027s one of those things that needs to be at the back of your minds. It can\u0027t be an afterthought. I suppose at the heart of it, it\u0027s the difference between a single player campaign and a sandbox game. Sandbox players, especially early adopters are happy to refer to wikis and youtube videos. Future campaign players are going to want everything that\u0027s relevant to them to be within the game. Right now, that\u0027s not the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny chance we could we get a \u0022hide complete\u0022 toggle for experiements that are 100% complete? Although tbh, that would only be of use if experiments that hadn\u0027t been started were shown by default. Otherwise you\u0027re into the confusion of \u0022is it not shown because its complete or unstarted?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a bit of feedback about the diminishing returns nature of experiments. In my experience so far, the 1st experiment generally gets you to about 75% complete. The 2nd to about 95%. Then the 3rd to 100%. As someone who likes to see things completed, it\u0027s a little disheartening. Firstly by the nature of needing to do everything 3 times to be 100% complete. Secondly because the 2nd and 3rd science rewards are fairly trivial compared with doing \u0022something new\u0022. It\u0027s not quite right, although I\u0027m not sure how to fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-30T14:21:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2013 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Queeg\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atoning Unifex","CreatedById":58766,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T14:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree that we should be able to see all the possible experiments (and maybe their science values so we know how important they are). It would be nice to know what to actually aim for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe the biomes, I\u0027ve not noticed any duplicate names yet personally - although I\u0027ve not really looked at the archives, because there\u0027s not much point seeing what I\u0027ve already done TBH!!. What I would like to see, though, is some way of identifying where the various biomes are so I can more easily decide where to land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also totally agree with your comments on the diminishing returns on experiments. I can sort of see why they did it - to make it so we don\u0027t get everything at once - but it just introduces grind. I simply don\u0027t bother with the \u0027small change\u0027 gathered by the 2nd or 3rd attempts usually. The grind is exacerbated by the fact that when I unlock a new science device I then have to re-visit all previous ones to use the new device at that location. One way to reduce this is to bundle science devices together in the research tree so that you unlock several at once, and only occasionally. This would require you to revisit locations but only when you have a new bundle of tools to use. As for the diminishing returns, well I think they simply should just give 100% research for 1 visit!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"justidutch","CreatedById":99185,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T17:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings from a newbie and first poster! Started playing when .22 was released, and only ever in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI initially found the diminishing returns thing annoying also, but after thinking about it, it does reflect \u0027real life\u0027 (whatever that is) more accurately. We don\u0027t always get everything 100% accurate the first time, so confirming a scientific experiment\u0027s results is useful and necessary. Therefore, I think it should stay in the game. Why not save your 2nd and 3rd iteration for when you unlock the new devices? Then take two of the new devices, since they are tiny anyways, and boom, you\u0027re done!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotally agree on the need of an in-game biome map and clearer understanding of what remains to be discovered.
