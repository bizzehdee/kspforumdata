So I was thinking about ideas for parts, that are only useful on or nearby specific bodies. What do you think about the idea in general? What do you thing about the parts in detail? Do you have ideas for more special body parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurthermore I include a list of ideas for such parts that might be edited if ideas or comments in the thread show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Oxygen filter: Can produce oxygen out of intake air; just on Kerbin and Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Fuel component extractor: Can produce liquid fuel out of intake air; just on Jool and Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Xenon filter: Can produce xenon out of intake air; just on Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Magnetic field harvester: Produces little amounts of energy in strong variable magnet fields. That is only the case with Jool. The closer you are at Jool, the more energy you get. At Laythes distance it is a little bit more mass efficient than the PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. Does not work so good on Laythe itself, as the variable magnetic field is blocked by the much weaker magnetic field of Laythe\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Hard radiation ground interaction experiment: (Heavy) scientific experiment that can be used only on Moho\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Wave energy harvester: Produces energy as long as it swims (Laythe, Kerbin, Eve)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T10:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kaos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded Fuel component extractor\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the planets can be made special easily, after their whole terrain is rebuilt detailedly, and new landmarks, weather, and dynamic terrain is added. These add a whole new array of opportunities to specialize planets, and make them cooler. The problem is that the current system can\u0027t handle it. It has to be more efficient (better part loading, better terrain loading, fog in atmosphere, ect.). Unity 5 might improve that, but it will also bring new bugs. I think things like new parts shouldn\u0027t be added until every bug is fixed (I mean the new bugs after unity5). After that, such parts shouldn\u0027t mean more problem than not being so useful. Solar panels solve every problems with power gen. Even at Jool, I can use solar panels to power my electrics witouth problems. That xenon thing is a bit wild, but the oxygen filter is useless. Why would you want to mage oxidizer from intake air?! To power your ROCKET? If you have intake air available, you should better use jets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T16:07:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only one I\u0027d want to see is a part for harvesting xenon from Jool\u0027s atmosphere.
