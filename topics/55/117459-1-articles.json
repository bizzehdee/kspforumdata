So I was thinking about ideas for parts, that are only useful on or nearby specific bodies. What do you think about the idea in general? What do you thing about the parts in detail? Do you have ideas for more special body parts?\n\nFurthermore I include a list of ideas for such parts that might be edited if ideas or comments in the thread show up.\n\n\\* Oxygen filter: Can produce oxygen out of intake air; just on Kerbin and Laythe\n\n\\* Fuel component extractor: Can produce liquid fuel out of intake air; just on Jool and Eve\n\n\\* Xenon filter: Can produce xenon out of intake air; just on Duna\n\n\\* Magnetic field harvester: Produces little amounts of energy in strong variable magnet fields. That is only the case with Jool. The closer you are at Jool, the more energy you get. At Laythes distance it is a little bit more mass efficient than the PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. Does not work so good on Laythe itself, as the variable magnetic field is blocked by the much weaker magnetic field of Laythe\n\n\\* Hard radiation ground interaction experiment: (Heavy) scientific experiment that can be used only on Moho\n\n\\* Wave energy harvester: Produces energy as long as it swims (Laythe, Kerbin, Eve)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T10:37:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 10:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kaos**\n  \nAdded Fuel component extractor"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T15:46:24Z","Content":"I think the planets can be made special easily, after their whole terrain is rebuilt detailedly, and new landmarks, weather, and dynamic terrain is added. These add a whole new array of opportunities to specialize planets, and make them cooler. The problem is that the current system can\u0027t handle it. It has to be more efficient (better part loading, better terrain loading, fog in atmosphere, ect.). Unity 5 might improve that, but it will also bring new bugs. I think things like new parts shouldn\u0027t be added until every bug is fixed (I mean the new bugs after unity5). After that, such parts shouldn\u0027t mean more problem than not being so useful. Solar panels solve every problems with power gen. Even at Jool, I can use solar panels to power my electrics witouth problems. That xenon thing is a bit wild, but the oxygen filter is useless. Why would you want to mage oxidizer from intake air?! To power your ROCKET? If you have intake air available, you should better use jets."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T16:07:32Z","Content":"The only one I\u0027d want to see is a part for harvesting xenon from Jool\u0027s atmosphere. A ship that orbits barely outside Jool\u0027s atmosphere and dips in occasionally to gather xenon for processing is a really cool sci-fi idea."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-02T19:39:05Z","Content":"One can surely make the planets special with other methods. The suggestion is just an additional method to make it special.\n\nOxygen filter is not useless at all: You can combine it with ISRU unit to produce cheaper fuel than with ISRU alone; intake air works also for stationary objects. So you can reduce the costs for refueling, or you could use it as source for fuel cells. If you are not technological advanced enough for ISRU and Nuclear propulsion, this is even more useful, as then this would be the only method to reduce you weight for the flight back. I think it is reasonable to assume that extracting oxygen out of air is technological simpler than to convert ore into oxygen and liquid fuel. Of course, this is no game-changing thing, but the goal was to give just a little addition.\n\nFiltering xenon out of the upper atmosphere of a gas giant is not very realistic, as it is heavy and would sink down.\n\nI hope my response to your response is not too negative, I still want to thank you for sharing your opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:01:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One can surely make the planets special with other methods.

Oxygen extracting would make Laythe an ideal fuel-refinery. I would also like that you could collect ingredients for LF and RCSfuel in the Joolian system, wich are much-much-more efficient than ore. Maybe from air intake from Jool, or by sucking up a liquid from Vall, stb. This would be better than an expensive ISRU system, but would also force you to perform several missions for the fuel\u0027s ingredients, rather than just setting up your base and timewarping.\n\nSorry if my first response was too negative.![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T10:36:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) I just frogot that ISRUs can produce only-LF.
