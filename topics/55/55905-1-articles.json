Its certainly nothing game-breaking, but it does bother me after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible (if it isnt already) to allow the nav ball UI element to be scaled individually from the other elements (such as staging lists and the altimeter). Or even if each could be exclusivley scaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it would be a nice change to make a non-gameplay suggestion for a change, mix things up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
