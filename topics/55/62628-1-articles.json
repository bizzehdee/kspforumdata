Everytime I try to use those parts I end up with an unbalanced ugly plane that has no purpose. Plus, I think the cockpit looks ugly from the interior, (so does the Mk2, there is a mod to change the Mk2-3 cockpits). I think this cockpit and fuselage need a little bit of work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Cargo bays? The cockpit is based off the space shuttle after all\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Rocket fuel versions of these could make them more useful for space planes and even rockets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
