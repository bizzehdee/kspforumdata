For some reason, in the VAB the mouse wheel moves the view up and down rather than in and out, and the plus and minus keys control zoom. It is an annoyance that catches me up every time. I tried looking through the settings.cfg file to find a setting that I could change for this, but had no luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that you probably do not want to change the \u0022established\u0022 GUI settings for such a commonly used screen, however, would it be possible to add a mapping in the settings.cfg file that would allow set the mouse wheel in the VAB for zoom and some other controls for altitude?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Selecting objects to view in the orbit map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is very frustrating that whenever I am on this screen, I must select between viewing either debris, probes, stations, ships, EVAs, etc, but I cannot look at multiple selections. E.g. I need to see where all the debris is in relation to my space stations to tell from which station I should launch a \u0022sweep-up\u0022 mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould the selections at the top of the screen be changed from a \u0022select one only\u0022 radio-button style to a multiple-selection toggle style? Please!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) When we switch from one craft to another, would it be possible for us to choose whether we go to the staging view or the orbit view. Quite often I want to adjust the orbits of several craft and I am not particularly interested in seeing the craft itself. It would be nice to be able to switch from the orbit view of one to the orbit view of the other without having to wait for the craft to be rendered on the screen and then immediately switch to orbit view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope those make suggestions make sense (both as in \u0022I hope you understand\u0022 and \u0022I hope you see that these suggestions should be put at the top of Squad\u0027s priority list\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-27T14:59:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2013 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by cpottinger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FEichinger","CreatedById":58255,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T15:10:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor 1) you can use Shift \u002B Mouse Wheel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 2) Right Click helps you out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T15:35:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) In the VAB you need to be able to quickly move up and down, while zooming is less important.
