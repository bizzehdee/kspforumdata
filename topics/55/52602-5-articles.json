But for those who can\u0027t invest the time into games like Orbiter in order to get their realism fix (which is so much more restricting in relation to KSP, simply because of gameplay mechanics), more features in KSP that add to realism lets the experienced player play harder, while hardly affecting the rookie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExcept that it DOES force the player to deal with the mechanic, even if not directly, as you have outlined in your post.\u003Cp\u003ESo, for most people it wouldn\u0027t add anything aside from a forced timewarp session, \u0022realism\u0022 isn\u0027t really a factor and I don\u0027t think this game should have \u0022realism\u0022 on a higher priority than \u0022fun\u0022..and being forced to deal with rocket building using in game time, etc...isn\u0027t sounding FUN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeriously, how would it detract from the game\u0027s fun? It doesn\u0027t just add realism, there\u0027s more depth added to the game (many players want more things to do already), things to plan for if you so desire, and an easier way to multitask for those who want to run a more realistic space program. Time passing (or not passing) holds many negatives for us, sure, that part of reality sucks a whole lot. However, we\u0027re the player, and we don\u0027t have to wait for the Kerbals to build their rockets, and instead we can go straight until it\u0027s ready, or do something else (which is the key aspect for me) while waiting for it. It\u0027s like playing Angry Birds while riding the bus somewhere, you don\u0027t want to ride the bus and then play later, that\u0027s too linear and isn\u0027t a good use of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuilding a craft for one mission, sending it on its way, and time warping to the destination with no missions being run in the meantime is quite boring to me, and often time KSP gets boring as a result of that. There\u0027s nothing preventing that with the feature we\u0027re talking about, due to the ability to warp directly to the launch, so this will not affect the players who want to play this way (aside from needing to know if their desired launch window will pass while the rocket is being built). The fact that I have to time warp to my launch windows 90% of the time already makes that a moot point though; if you want to go to Duna right now, you will warp until the phase angles are correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to run a proper space program, and take on some of the responsibilities of one (like planning your launch windows), or actually playing the game on several different levels at once, this feature would make the game realistic enough to want to do so. If you get to the \u0022end\u0022 of the career mode and notice that it takes you 50 in-game years, on your next go-around you might want to try to get that lower, perhaps down to 25 years by multitasking with your launches.

I haven\u0027t been trying to force this feature or anything, simply stating how any user can get by with it on, if it happened to not be an option), and I believe it will add much more to the game, as I\u0027ve been trying so hard to show. I\u0027ve also explained my reasons several times to even more length, and expanded on them more each time you\u0027ve called me out on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fast and loose\u0022 is one of the ways for somebody to play the game, but not the only one. Never have I even attempted to say how the game should be played, I just mingle with the hardcore crowd and am a member of it myself, and so I can see what quite a few people want from that side of the game. There will always be the hobbyist/amateur side, and the hardcore side. Even then, with so many mods that add realistic rocket parts, physics, resource management, and a billion other things, it\u0027s hard to argue that people don\u0027t ever look for more realism or things to do. That\u0027s the beauty of KSP, a player can enjoy their dab of realism here, or smidge of crazy unrealistic parts there. I once played with Mechjeb, and I enjoyed it greatly, but after a while I didn\u0027t see a need for it so I dropped it. There will be those who see this feature as the best thing since sliced bread, and those who could care less, but it\u0027s incredibly difficult for me, even after so much discussion and taking in all of your opinions, to see it as a terrible feature. I even bet that those against it would enjoy playing with it at least once, before deciding whether to turn it off or leave it on to play how they enjoy the game the most. It needs lots of balance, it needs ease of use, and needs to not hinder the player aside from being a gameplay mechanic. Those are all things I\u0027m going to attempt to accomplish, and hopefully I\u0027d even be able to win over some of you skeptics XD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who blow up rockets more than every other launch, it would definitely be a hindrance and I\u0027d like to try and work on that aspect as well (I blow more rockets up than I make into orbit too!), but at the same time, that would be more motivation to make your rockets better the first time, right? It\u0027s the same problem with currency being added to the game, and it\u0027s no question that that\u0027s coming, so I\u0027m sure there will be ways to solve the problem. Perhaps the Kerbals really enjoy fireworks (or have amazing insurance), so you get 80% of your money reimbursed for explosive launches. At the same time, your engineers have lots of spare parts from making that last one, and being motivated to work better, will pump out another rocket in no time at all. Don\u0027t be so Negative Nancy about it and instead tell us your ideas to actually make it a decent feature \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a miniature solar system to explore with realistic physics and rocket building/science is the biggest feature of the game; I\u0027m not advocating for a simulator, simply more things on top of the already \u003Cem\u003Equite realistic\u003C/em\u003E game that would mimic reality and not detract from immersion (I know I\u0027m not the only one, even out of the ones here against this feature, that has noticed how strange it is that the Kerbals pump out rockets like the VAB is a broken fire hydrant).

Those that don\u0027t like it.... such is circle of life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Danish_Savage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Danish_Savage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce very several years you mean.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWord!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jfjohnny5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jfjohnny5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I just want to say a huge preemptive \u0022Thanks!\u0022 to Ekku Zakku for undertaking the task of turning this idea into a mod. I certainly didn\u0027t expect this thread to be quite as impassioned as it\u0027s become, but it is GREAT to see all the discussion. I think the (hopefully) eventual mod will help refine and test a lot of the ideas that are coming up. The more I read about Ekku\u0027s vision for it, the more excited I get to try it! (and I\u0027ll certainly help test if you need it!)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I wish I had read more of the thread before chipping in my two krones as a lot of that was already suggested in one form or another. Is there a dev thread yet Ekku?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WafflesToo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WafflesToo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust my two cents, I\u0027m for it so long as it\u0027s optional.\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t something that will impact most gameplay, BUT I can see two scenarios where it would. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#1 when something unexpected comes up (the aforementioned \u0022rescue mission\u0022) and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 when you start getting orbital infrastructure in place and timing between missions starts to become important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeck, I could see leaving a spaceplane sitting on the runway just in case could become a sound strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I could see a storage hangar for pre-built aircraft/spaceplanes and sub-assemblies to speed up builds. Having pre-built orbital rescue craft waiting in the wings would be a very good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
