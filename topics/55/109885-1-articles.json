I would love it if others out there would add to this thread by describing theirs!\n\nI think most of this is beyond the scope of what you could ever hope squad to do (so dont get your hopes up).\n\nHowever, i do agree with some points/fundamental issues with the game:\n\n(1) there is no clear victory condition.\n\n(2) exploring planets/moons gets boring since they are all basically the same (see \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GXFzMnCWBs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n)\n(3) rovers are pointless (other than fun) since (a) on small planets/moons where you could conceivably drive to new biomes, you have no traction and its easier to just hop around (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) on large planets/moons you arent going to be driving to more than two biomes\n\n(4) mining is not really needed\n\n(5) satellites are not really needed\n\nHowever, you got me thinking. I like the idea of finding and recovering artifacts, like you mentioned. These artifacts could be placed on random planets (or one could be placed on each body, though this would be hard since one would be placed on Eve...), and would either have to be spotted visually (they could be their own part that is REALLY shiny) or using a satellite to locate it. I think doing this basically resolves all of these issues (and it should be easy to implement with a mod):\n\n(1) The objects would always be placed randomly. This resolves issue #2 since it gives you something new to look for each time you play. I think this is a good compromise since squad cannot make planets themselves more interesting, since it would take forever to create all the terrain etc... (all planets/moons must be procedurally generated). \n\n(2) It resolves issue #3 since once you spot the artifact you must recover it. Unless you can target land perfectly and grab the part with a sky crane, you are going to need a rover to drive over and pick it up. \n\n(3) it resolves #4 since it gives a purpose to mining, since you might have to fly around the planet/moon a bit until you can find the object\n\n(4) it resolve #5 by giving purpose to satellites which can locate said artifacts (if you enable that option or maybe that is only unlocked later in the tech tree)\n\n(5) I dont think finding them shoudl give you science boosts. But i do propose, as a victory condition, bringing all of them back to one mothership\n\nIn all, i think you might be able to hope for someone to write a mode for this. It would be relatively simple. \n\nYou would need:\n\none SHINY part to find-- the artifact\n\na dll to randomly place them at the start of a new game\n\na UI to tell you how many you have found\n\nperhaps a satellite component to scan (which would be much more complicated).\n\nEDIT: The more i think about it, the more i think the shiny artifacts should contain a new resource called \u003Cinsert something=\u0022\u0022 clever=\u0022\u0022\u003E. Each artifact, depending on where it is (what planet/moon) etc... will have different amounts of it. Once you collect 100 you win the game. There could be more than one per planet (to make them easier to find visually).\u003C/insert\u003E\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T02:28:23Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 02:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T02:28:10Z","Content":"The idea of a campaign mode based around anomalies/artifacts has actually been mentioned many times already (and I think it\u0027s a great idea for the record, especially if the locations were randomized for each new game).

Finding interesting stuff is the perfect way both to make the planetary surfaces less boring and to give some greater sense of purpose to the exploration contracts. Also, as to your point abut the surfaces having to be procedurally generated, that is of course true, but they could still do a lot more with procedural terrain. How about some rivers on Kerbin, for example? Also, the various artifacts you have to hunt for could come with their own more elaborately designed terrain overlays that could be procedurally integrated into random locations within certain terrain types on whatever body. That way, they could be in a different location every game but still have more depth to the terrain modeling than the generic procedural landscape. As to what resource the alien artifacts might have associated with them, I think that it could perhaps be a special sort of science that allows you to acquire special alien techs with special capabilities. Things for example that would let you create super-efficient engines or autonomous probes to search for resources, etc. The ultimate FTL engine could be some gigantic thing that would be challenging even to boost into LKO, and around which you have to build a great big ship with lots of specialized resources, etc. on board. It would be something like building the space ship in Civ, except you\u0027d actually get to fly this one!\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Didn\u0027t NovaSilisko plan to add *sort-of campaign* to KSP with SSTV signals and some other stuff to discover and explore on a planets?\n\u003E [edit] for those who don\u0027t know: he is a former dev, probably best known for having plans to add second gas gigant into KSP along with cryovolcanos on eeloo ([link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/29807-Planet-Ideas-And-Names-For-The-Future-Of-Kerbal-Space-Program?p=447959\u0026viewfull=1#post447959))\n\nWhile I am in awe of all the amazing things that various modders have accomplished, I think that a real campaign, with the sort of depth that would create a truly immersive game play experience, would ultimately have to be implemented by Squad.

Now that they have the sandbox more or less finished and a rudimentary career/campaign mode in place, I think that Squad pretty much has to go in this type of direction if they want to turn KSP into a full-fledged franchise. Either that I guess, or they have to turn it into a Minecraft-style multiplayer sandbox universe, with users acquiring plots of land to develop within the vast spaces on all the different planetary surfaces. I guess there\u0027s no reason they couldn\u0027t do both, but I think the former would be significantly less difficult.
