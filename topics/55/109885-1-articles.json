Finding interesting stuff is the perfect way both to make the planetary surfaces less boring and to give some greater sense of purpose to the exploration contracts. Also, as to your point abut the surfaces having to be procedurally generated, that is of course true, but they could still do a lot more with procedural terrain. How about some rivers on Kerbin, for example? Also, the various artifacts you have to hunt for could come with their own more elaborately designed terrain overlays that could be procedurally integrated into random locations within certain terrain types on whatever body. That way, they could be in a different location every game but still have more depth to the terrain modeling than the generic procedural landscape. As to what resource the alien artifacts might have associated with them, I think that it could perhaps be a special sort of science that allows you to acquire special alien techs with special capabilities. Things for example that would let you create super-efficient engines or autonomous probes to search for resources, etc. The ultimate FTL engine could be some gigantic thing that would be challenging even to boost into LKO, and around which you have to build a great big ship with lots of specialized resources, etc. on board.

I guess I didn\u0027t read that second bit too good. Anyway, it\u0027s good to know that this sort of idea was at least on the table at Squad at some point. Now that they have the sandbox more or less finished and a rudimentary career/campaign mode in place, I think that Squad pretty much has to go in this type of direction if they want to turn KSP into a full-fledged franchise. Either that I guess, or they have to turn it into a Minecraft-style multiplayer sandbox universe, with users acquiring plots of land to develop within the vast spaces on all the different planetary surfaces. I guess there\u0027s no reason they couldn\u0027t do both, but I think the former would be significantly less difficult. Either way, I think they have a whole lot of people out there like me who would be happy to plunk down another $25 or whatever to see this incredible canvas they have created get populated with some new content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T15:06:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
