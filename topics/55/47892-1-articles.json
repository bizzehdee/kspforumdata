How is the Tech Tree, or R@D Tree going to look and function. I know in the recent video released previewing many of the R@D updates. It showed a sporadic, root-like \u0022Tree\u0022.

Then to the Top Center. To the Middle, Then finally to the Bottom Middle. Now disregarding the Red Line and the box isolated to the Middle Right. You could put any number of KSP Parts in those blue boxes and sum up how or what order you would unlock them. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EThis logic usually encourages \u0022Grinding\u0022. I\u0027m sure most of you have played MMO\u0027s. And any MMO fan knows that if you want the best gear or items. You are usually going to have to Grind out long hours doing the same thing over and over again. In KSP this could mean Multiple Moon landings for instance. Which I have no complaint about. I find grinding to be fun 85% of the time and a learning experience to refine techniques.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EBut what about when the Player has Grinded to his wits ends, what tasks/parts has he left to achieve/unlock.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EWell what if in the Tech Tree there was Items that needed special prerequisites to unlock them. Looking back at the graphic we notice that the flow from box to box is very consistent. With the except of the Middle flowing to the Middle Right. We notice that there is a boundary, or red line that separates the flow.
