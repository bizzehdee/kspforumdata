Reducing the settings to almost the lowest values improves my performance a bit, but it\u0027s still much lower than in Windows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a comparison of Linux and Windows at the same settings. The drop off is huge, around 50%. Bugle was giving me errors when I tried to load the x86 version (some missing 32 bit .so file), but I didn\u0027t notice much of a difference in my brief test of the x86 version loaded from Steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/CPU%20Test/linux1.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022linux1.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of GPU do you have Maeyanie?

This further confirmed that 0.22 did nothing for performance. But the Surface did surprisingly well considering that both the CPU and the GPU are a bit weaker.
