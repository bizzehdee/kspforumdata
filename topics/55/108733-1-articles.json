In all the games that have the option, I have to toggle the \u0027reduce input lag\u0027 option to fix it, and if that is not an option then \u0027use system cursor\u0027 usually is, and again it fixes the input lag. Please consider this simple toggle in the settings. This will appease both sides of the \u0027system/precision\u0027 and \u0027stylized/immersive\u0027 argument. Alternatively, supply the steps to disable/revert the cursor in the config if at all possible. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T08:24:40Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shaggygoblin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporo","CreatedById":110800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T10:42:55Z","Content":"Input lag? I haven\u0027t noticed anything like that. I would agree with a setting to toggle between the custom and system cursor, but I\u0027ve never noticed the new cursor slowing inputs, nor have I seen anyone else mention it. Unless you\u0027re trying to build ridiculously huge crafts that lag your PC down to the Marianas Trench. Then, I\u0027m not surprised that it may create a noticeable reduction in performance.

It should really just read \u0022System cursor\u0022 or \u0022Custom cursor.\u0022\n\nBut, yes. Most games have an option to turn off custom cursors, and it seems like an easy thing to set up, so I would agree that a \u0022use system cursor\u0022 setting would be nice.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T10:52:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shaggygoblin","CreatedById":138214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T11:30:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Input lag?
