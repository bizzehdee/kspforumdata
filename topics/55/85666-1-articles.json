While it is possible to simply place an engine gimbal module into an RCS/Vernor part file without any heinous errors being thrown, the engine does not seem to register that it is in fact able to be thrust-transformed or utilize that during SAS/RCS thrust calculations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original attempt was to modify a Vernor engine so that its thrust exhaust could rotate within a 90-degree cone (up to 45 degrees off center) to allow the vessel to be controlled more efficiently and effectively. I doubted it\u0027d work from the get-go, but it was still worth a shot, and I, personally, think it\u0027s a fantastic idea if it can be pulled off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am frankly shocked that no one else has bothered to suggest or mod such a thing (that I could find).
