For example, the real-world voyager or cassini probes were festooned with gizmos. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to have one or two more parts .. say, an infra-red imager and/or a doppler-shift analyzer, or something ... that maybe only functioned in space within SOI distance (or maybe \u0022high orbit\u0022) of the \u0027target\u0027. Just one or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking is, not only would it provide another fun way to get some science points, but it would make it more motivating to use the ion engine and the tiny sized parts/engines more often. As it stands, having played through career mode a bit (maxed out the tech tree in 2, working on a third where I\u0027m focusing on some specific goals rather then just completing the tech tree) and I\u0027ve found that I just can\u0027t justify doing anything with ion engines, RTGs, or some of the other smaller parts. Sending a probe to orbit/visit eeloo (or wherever), only to net less than 100 science from the trip, just isn\u0027t a strong motivator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
