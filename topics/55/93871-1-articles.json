There\u0027s no way they can avoid it for a lot of them. But having to accept them as contracts doesn\u0027t really make sense, especially not with limited contract space in the early Mission Control building. More to the point, it\u0027s very easy to lose out on one of those contracts or have your early Mission Control contract list polluted with them and no way to cancel out of them, locking you in a situation where you cannot make the Funds necessary for a launch to even achieve them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution is easy enough: desginate them as \u0022special\u0022 contracts, separate from the normal contract list, and have them all be accepted at the start of the game. But when listing them under the accepted contracts, only list the ones that the player currently has progressed far enough to know about. This would preserve the intent of these contracts (to push new players to attempt those big goals), while neither cheating experienced players out of them nor tripping up new players by getting \u0022contract locked\u0022 and unable to proceed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T19:34:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter doing some testing and confirming that it\u0027s very easy to get this to happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/contract_locked.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022contract_locked.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ...I\u0027m going to have to bump this topic back up.
