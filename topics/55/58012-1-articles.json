The engine has an attachment point that only accepts drive-type parts, where parts could be different propellors, air or water-optimised ducted fans, and/or water screws, and a drive shaft part (think a strut or fuel line with extra logic) which could transfer a torque value coming from the engine to linked drive parts. Problem of course being that some kind of block would be needed to pin a prop or fan to, in order to strut a drive shaft between them if drive shafts were being used. Of course this might not be such a problem, if this means the engine can be in one area of the construction, and the prop (or fan, or.. hey, why not include some rover wheels in the system) can be in another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn advantage would be that the prop part needn\u0027t necessarily spin as far as physics goes.
