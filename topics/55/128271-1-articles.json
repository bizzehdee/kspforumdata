I dont know why, since when i usually share my thoughts, i end up upsetting someone. Maybe thats why i do it.

It is mostly due to my inexperience with making spacecraft, because i know people sucessfully make trips to Jool etc. with loads of equipment. I however, not so much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this doesent change the fact that i think leveling up parts could be fun. For example taking an engine to an orbit around Kerbin gives x amount of XP. and at level 1 it will have various increased stats. Perhaps you could even chose which stat to level up. ISP, reduce weight, increase thrust, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar things with solar panels, even batteries you name it. With enough thought put into the concept you could have a myriad of options for leveling up parts. I might add that leveling up parts is a bad name for the mechanic, since you dont actually level them up, you improve upon them, from experience. From using them, you learn how to improve them. Its important tho that a part is recovered before its experience counts. But i there should be some kind of cap or balance so that people cannot send a heap of parts to Jool, and then get level ups too easy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-20T18:37:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2015 06:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by abowl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T18:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-20T20:03:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a concept it sounds fine, until you realise that the big issue with improving the specifications\u00A0of a particular part as the game progresses is that there is no constant...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe LV 909 in thge VAB will perform differently to the one on the ship in orbit, and to mine, so ship comparisons and sharing will be all over the place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way I can see this working realistically is by creating successive \u0027models\u0027 of the same part with a slight graphic change for a visual clue and it replacing earlier versions in the editors. \u00A0Which I don\u0027t think is a very practical solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current tech tree system, although not\u00A0perfect, does in effect allow you to use your\u00A0experience, by collecting and spending science,\u00A0to develop newer and\u00A0better equipment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
