It will have the full resolution (as for the viewing distance) and look like a perfect HD image, without increasing CPU and memory load.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd about the higher-distance textures: the biggest ones (land shapes, etc.) could be just a little bigger, so they will look HD while not as high as needed to lost the sight of geographic shapes (well, it won\u0027t be much more memory than 3-4 textured parts, so it won\u0027t be a problem) and then (at a lower altitude) the point directly below the ship will slowly start being replaced by the procedural terrain and random noise textures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(of course I don\u0027t mean ugly random noise from CRT TV, but properly calculated one, to resemble natural grain)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the random rocks, trees, cactuses, grass, etc. could have a HD resolution using this - which, connected with randomization of their shapes and sizes, with decreasing details when the distance to them is bigger (which will cut out lags caused by them), would greatly improve visual side of the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for taking it into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-07T02:12:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2013 02:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"halosos","CreatedById":17271,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T10:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat idea, I can \u002B1 for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
