Pressing \u0022left\u0022 affects the control surfaces, rotation keys, up, down, all also affect the control surfaces. Now... the keys also use the magical reaction wheels which apply a direct force rather than shifting the CoM; this causes oddities in how the planes fly and make smaller planes act crazy. I think you can turn these off so it should help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as SAS, with the amount of computer aided control with the fast moving or heavy planes we have, that seems a strange mention. KSP planes move fairly fast, they don\u0027t always glide quite as well and require tapering the control surfaces; CoM can change rapidly as tanks empty... it\u0027s actually not that great of a system. But those small periodic changes to keep things stable, don\u0027t modern pilots rely on it? Concentrate on the flying, not the tapering?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-24T23:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2015 11:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hcube\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hcube\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKnowing what you usually do with SSTO\u0027s, I wonder what dark magic of spaceplanes \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou\u003C/strong\u003E will pull of with those new wings, intakes and aerodynamics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m tempted to set up parallel design threads, one for stock and one for FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:31:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m tempted to set up parallel design threads, one for stock and one for FAR.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u0060\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah do that please! , it would be awesome (guess what, i don\u0027t use FAR \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T23:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewago95, your wish has been granted!
