E.g., you could say you want your nuclear rockets to start firing at 1% throttle, and be at max at 50% throttle, and then have some more powerful rockets that start firing at 51% throttle and be at max at 100% throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T20:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI belive it\u0027s not a good idea to set that directly to the throttle, but allow you to have different throtle settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea if any mod allows that, but possibly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T21:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027ve heard, earlier versions of KSP \u003Cstrong\u003Edid\u003C/strong\u003E allow variable throttle settings per rocket, but then it became difficult to control rockets in tandem.
