I have an more elegant idea that would require a revision of the existing adapters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://oi62.tinypic.com/2mmddap.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222mmddap.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is, you replace the multiples fairings that would normally encase each engine separately by a structural fairing that behave exactly like a cargo bay. A part (2.) that would encase the engine cluster, attach to the adapter above (1.) and be jettisoned by a decoupler (3.). The engines would then no more be a part of the rocket\u0027s structural integrity, allowing a much greater rigidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Meanwhile, when you are testing this concept, a simple cargo bay self destruction button would do nicely \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave a nice day, MsieurDionne\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T21:06:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, stock interstages.
