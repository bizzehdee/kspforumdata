I dont mean making mods by recompiling it (this woudl probably happen to) just knowing how it all works woudl be very usefull.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T02:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei gotta bring up freespace 2 again. it was not an overnight success when it came out. it ended up paying for itself over the years because of how long the community kept the game alive. initially through mods and later through the source. i doubt they could have done that to the extent they did without releasing its source code. reason is just because you handed over the source to the community, did not mean they had the right to distribute the game\u0027s assets. this made ongoing sales of the game possible on sites like gog, since you needed the game assets to play many of the mods. its a way to get a little bit more profit and a lot more life out of something that would otherwise be lost to gaming history.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nao","CreatedById":23462,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T03:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei gotta bring up freespace 2 again. it was not an overnight success when it came out. it ended up paying for itself over the years because of how long the community kept the game alive. initially through mods and later through the source. i doubt they could have done that to the extent they did without releasing its source code. reason is just because you handed over the source to the community, did not mean they had the right to distribute the game\u0027s assets. this made ongoing sales of the game possible on sites like gog, since you needed the game assets to play many of the mods. its a way to get a little bit more profit and a lot more life out of something that would otherwise be lost to gaming history.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey showed source code because the studio was disbanding if i remember correctly.
