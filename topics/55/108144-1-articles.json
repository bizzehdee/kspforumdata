Since they can never expire or be terminated after accepting and the Contract building is limited till you max it out. Which again requires a lot of Funds to do. It is also why I dislike it when I noticed it was rep based and still is. The Explore Contracts should be available regardless of rep. As I could be selling the rep in KSP 1.0.2.
