Anyways i thought of something cool that i think would be great for the game. It has to do with the upgrade tree. I was thinking what they should do is add different tiers of upgrade trees. Each time you go up a tier you unlock a completely new upgrade tree while keeping the old. I was thinking of something like 4 tiers, 3 main tiers and one last pretty much \u0022super hard\u0022 \u0022beat the game\u0022 type of tier. These tiers would also be locked into different science experiments you could do. These tiers though would have to do with how far you have gone... in the galaxy. I know this sounds crazy but space engine did it but this is much different the galaxy would not even be even close to real life size. It would compose of lets say 100 stars and only about 20 to 30 of them have a decent amount of planets probably much less than the local kerbol system. the rest would just be things like red giants, main sequence stars, maybe even pulsars or neutron stars. This distance could be shortened too in between. In the center of the galaxy there could be a black hole too with many stars around it maybe like 20. Everything is already smaller in ksp so a \u0022miniway\u0022 could be pretty cool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways with the tiers it would work like this. First teir would deal with going around the solar system with liquid and solid fuel rockets and ion thrusters which are the basics. To complete this tier you would have to go do experiments on all of the planets. Then the next tier would have the better nuclear rockets and orion nuclear pulse engines. In this teir you would explorer other stars and solar system. The third you would get anti matter power which you would use to do experiments like going to dangerous things like white dwarfs, neutron stars, using special equipment from orbit to do science things with them. Then the last would be a warp drive which you would unlock by gaining orbit of the black whole in the center of the galaxy would be extremely hard, not to mention extremely expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if non of this stuff is ever added a challenge or some mods could be made. Im pretty sure squad planned different solar systems though so that should be helpful. Anybody else got ideas for ksp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T20:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Suggestions and Development Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-02T23:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is having multiple smaller upgrade trees different than having 1 big one?
