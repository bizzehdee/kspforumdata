This gives your height above ground on your current position. This would let you plan a retro burn at a specific altitude to get a good landing rather than a look and guess your altitude and when to retro burn for the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note I currently use something inspired by the dam busters setup for judging my height above the ground. 2 lights pointed at the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETom\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T15:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of the manned capsules have a radar altimeter on the dashboard. You have to press C (or is it V? can\u0027t remember) to change to the cockpit view, then it looks like a dial with numbers around three quarters of the circumference.
