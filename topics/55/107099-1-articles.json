These clean, modern-looking green boxes just don\u0027t fit with KSP\u0027s UI style. At all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think they should add some sort of visible and audible warning near the altimeter when your ship overheats, similar to FTL\u0027s warning boxes (for those who didn\u0027t get the reference, it\u0027s another game). Mousing over the warning will outline overheating parts in red. Once they get to 75% overheat they\u0027ll be outlined in a brighter color, even without selecting the warning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
