That\u0027s a bummer for many players who enjoyed having some control over the contracts accepted by declining contracts until one that fits their goals shows up. Sure, constantly clicking \u0022decline\u0022 can get old really fast, but having to do certain types of contracts (such as repeating suborbital tourist contracts over and over) can be even more boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if ending the \u0022decline\u0022 click-fest is the design goal, I\u0027d like to make a suggestion: \u003Cstrong\u003EContract Focus\u003C/strong\u003E. In the Mission Control screen, the player would be able to activate a \u0022focus\u0022 (or more than one) that would cause only a certain type of contract to be offered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if I just completed the basic \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract, I might be able to activate a focus related to the Mun, such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#696969;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMun Exploration:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E offers contracts for landing, planting flags, setting up bases and stations, extracting ore, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#8B4513;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMun Science:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E offers science contracts, surveys, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMun Tourism:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E offers tours, rescues, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach planet or moon would have a few options that could be activated as soon as the planet/moon was visited. Maybe we could even have a difference between orbital and surface focus, for example: \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003EJool Orbital Science\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, or \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEve Surface Tourism\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (good luck with that one).

You can set it to zero. I strongly agree with you that the game shouldn\u0027t force the player to take contracts that aren\u0027t fun or interesting for that player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I seem to recall reading in a forum post somewhere that it\u0027s possible to customize the mix of contracts you get by tinkering with a config file somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally: I really like what they\u0027ve done with the \u0022World First\u0022 achievement series in 1.0.5. It means a mix of rewards for just doing new things in new places, and they\u0027ve also offered a new strategy type that boosts the rewards for world-first achievements in exchange for getting lower rewards for other achievements, the idea being that it\u0027ll appeal to self-directed players who just want to go off and do their own thing. I haven\u0027t actually tried it yet, so I don\u0027t know how useful it actually is in practice. However, it shows that Squad is at least thinking about the issue, which is an encouraging sign. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Either it\u0027ll work well, or if it turns out that it\u0027s not tuned quite right, they can tweak it in an upcoming patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnecdotally, the funds mix seems a bit more forgiving in 1.0.5-- either that, or it just agrees better with my play style, I can\u0027t tell which. I\u0027ve just started a new 1.0.5 career and haven\u0027t gotten any farther than a manned Mun flyby and a single unmanned Mun landing, and already I\u0027ve upgraded the astronaut complex, landing pad, mission control, and tracking station, with a reasonable chunk of cash left and I\u0027m within shouting distance of upgrading the VAB. I\u0027ve done a few contracts, yes, but nothing that I\u0027d call a serious grind. It seems to me that pre-1.0.5 I had to do a fair bit more contract grinding to get to the same point, financially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighly unscientific and based on my admittedly fuzzy memory of the last couple of times I started a new career, which were months ago.
