I should provide an argument, but the video speaks for itself. No more ram issues as this system \u003Cstrong\u003Eonly loads the mod if it is enabled in that specific save.\u003C/strong\u003E Might mean you have to spend longer waiting if you hop in between saves a lot as it would have to reload some mods, but frankly it would be worth it. Also no more giant parts list for those who have many mods installed. Mods would auto update like any patch on steam, .craft files on the workshop, auto downloading the needed mods when firing up a published save file, if a mod does not work, the game gives the option to load anyways, but delete the offending parts, keeping ships and worlds loadable.... Using mods in SE is so easy now, you would be hard-pressed to find a stock purist. I\u0027m not sure how hard this would be from a coding standpoint, but unless there is a serious issue that makes it too difficult to add, I think it would be a great idea. Not to mention sharing .craft files would be so easy, so no more drop box or mediafire hassle.

Or alternatively, a limit of 5 tags plus the user defined ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWatch to (3:00)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=UUiIu5_NeaCkv3Nt8R5u7pNg\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
