I\u0027m not complaining about it since it\u0027s the very first implementation and telecom is probably something like a \u0022cherry on top\u0022 for most people but in some expeditions this aspect had crucial roles for example in the galileo probe the high gain antenna didn\u0027t open so they had to use a low gain antenna to transfer the data at a much lower rate and they were able to salvage a good portion of the experiment data but they had to sacrifice some of the most data heavy experiments (mostly photos).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than having a more complex model for data transmission, one that varies the speed and energy cost of transmission based on distance and antennas used, what we really need is something which forces us to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome real world examples would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Temperature measurement, this is just a bunch of numbers and would likely occupy just a few Kb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Videos and photos, these can take several Mb or even Gb (think for example a very high definition photo of a space telescope or a video of a landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are orders of magnitude of difference between these two kinds of data, we need that so that if we want to send a probe to measure a bunch of numbers we can probably get away with a small and light antenna, if we want to take HD pics of other planets then we should need to put high gain antenna otherwise it would take an insane amount of time to transmit (weeks or even more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope this aspect of the game doesn\u0027t get overlooked in the final product.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mirimus","CreatedById":73476,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T05:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, just .... yes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T06:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grumman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grumman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps instead of changing the penalty, it would be better to change the power consumption?

I\u0027m using the example of a rover on the exact opposite side of Kerbin, with distances measured in millions of meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radius of Kerbin is 600,000 metres, so the rover is 1.2 megametres from the KSC. This gives a multiplier of 1.2^2, or 1.44, multiplied by whatever effect the blocked LOS has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you have a trio of communications satellites in synchronous orbit you could instead send the packet to the nearest, which then bounces it to the one nearest the KSC, which then sends it down.
