Make each tech node an object that can be moved in\u00A0relation to other nodes. Drop the automatic assignment of parts to a fixed tree position. Allow a default in the parts.cfg as normal but that can be\u00A0overruled in the tree GUI though a look up table. Of Partname = newnode. As an extra bonus.
