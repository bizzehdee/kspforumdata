So I suggest adding the \u0027close\u00A0game\u0027 save to the list of quicksave games rather than storing it seperately, so it can still be retrieved if f9 wrecks it for you. \u00A0If the No Quickload option is used then it just uses the latest save on the list on startup and (as long as you use f5) you don\u0027t lose progress if you didn\u0027t get chance to close the game properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T19:05:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo \u0022terrible\u0022 in the title?

Kudos for approaching this subject with an actual (sane) proposal instead of just a complaint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the core idea; I just don\u0027t think multiple dated saves are needed. But still having crash protection even on a hardcore game is awesome! If I\u0027m not mistaken, f5 overwrites your \u003Cem\u003Eauto\u003C/em\u003Esave, too. If that\u0027s the case, you don\u0027t even need to change the load process for hardcore games: if the game crashes, you reboot it and it will load the autosave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EThe problem with f9 is another one and should be addressed separately, although every thread on the subject becomes aggressive. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0I think I have a possible solution to that one, and I\u0027ll probably make a topic for it in the same spirit as this one. I\u0027ll just wait till I get home and check out the save folder structure.\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cem\u003ENah, never mind that. You\u0027re proposing changes to the Quicksave mechanic, and Quickload is the other side of it, I\u0027ll just say it here. \u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe all the grief would be gone if, by pressing f9, the game overwrote autosave.sfs \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E loading quicksave.sfs, and not the other way around. That way, if you find out you loaded a two-month-old save, you simply hit alt-f9 and load autosave.sfs (which will work as a quicksave of sorts in this situation, taking you back to the moment \u003Cem\u003Ejust before\u003C/em\u003E you hit f9).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou still live with whatever failure led you to hit f9 in the first place, but at least you don\u0027t lose who knows how much time on your save. Plus, it all relies on already-in-place stock mechanics; the only change is the order that autosave is written and quicksave read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-30T19:14:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2015 07:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by monstah\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T10:24:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, I\u0027m not familiar with how the current system works under the hood.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut yes, \u00A0a single \u0027saved games\u0027 file seems a logical \u00A0solution. \u00A0By keeping a few (maybe 5?\u00A010 max) that can be identified, by time or whatever, then it gives a bit extra backup in case one gets corrupted, or just got saved \u0027too late\u0027 or at what turns\u00A0out later to be an \u0027inconvenient time\u0027, without storing a lot of unneeded data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
