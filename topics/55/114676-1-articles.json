This would normally not be a problem, but with the way progression works, I\u0027m spending more time flying around kerbin gathering science near KSP in my little plane with a service module carrying several science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would **REALLY** like to see is moving the lower tier ladder down to the same unlock as the first landing gear, as being able to easily get into/out of the cockpit of the plane would make this aspect of the game a lot more fun, as I\u0027m not terribly keen on being forced to recover planes and pilot separately for a contract that needs EVA science on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T19:45:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 07:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RyanRising","CreatedById":79932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T19:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about this.
