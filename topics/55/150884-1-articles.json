The Kerbol system has some jokes I really like, and as to the planet is eatable. But I think a Kerbal mythology and some optional objectives or story line would do this game good. I think it\u0027s easy do-able from a mechanic perspective, but the actual story would not be so simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about we ask the players for help about coming up with a good story?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course I think it should be optional to choose from when playing, and it\u0027s purpose is to give players of KSP not such a hard time with coming up with a objective in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s really weird that objectives are such a big part of many games, and ksp doesn\u0027t have any!
