For example sample return from a specific spot on a specific planet etc. Of course these should be options that you can circumvent if you want to (if it\u0027s too difficult at the moment), but they would unlock the nicest parts if you can do them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T14:22:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be okay with that, I suppose.

Unlocking research with specific missions is a good idea. An alternative might be to unlock new items by doing specific research (like researching rockets in a vacuum unlocks new engines which have a high ISP in a vacuum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again.. this specific research can be a mission itself!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
