Yeah, you can achieve the same thing with the regular fixed panels, some clipping, and some patience, but the time and part count gets very high very quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it could be done with a surface mount anchor point on one corner, then just click and drag to to the appropriate dimensions with the panel conforming to the existing structure underneath. Calculate the overall area then multiply by whatever efficiency factor the other fixed panels have. For the purposes of determining exposure, just assume a regular arc bounded by the Y and Z axis (since rockets are predominately circular in cross section), and math it out from there. That won\u0027t provide 100% accuracy, but it\u0027s certainly close enough for gaming purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould also be great for large surface bases, especially with the new \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-lite\u0022 engineer abilities. Mount the corner piece on the base, then spread out the solar panel over the planetary surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKoS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NH04","CreatedById":207713,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-18T01:10:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see this too, as a stock update, of course, not just a mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
