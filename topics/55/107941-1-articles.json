It would work like a cross between the mining drill and a claw. When an engineer activates it it extends out perpendicular to its mounting, it could look a bit like a multi segmented landing leg. Then if it contacts another object it attaches in the same way as a claw to allow fuel and electricity etc to flow through it. \n\nI realise part of the difficulty is to do with the modelling and dynamics. So, if it\u0027s a rigid pipe then no droopiness needs to be modelled and like the drill it could have a set length, say 3 Metres max. therefore avoiding the need to cater for odd lengths so a drill type model could work (retracted state and extended state with set animations between) Your target \u0027vessel\u0027 must also therefore be parked close to the source for it to reach.\n\n It may look a bit odd having a pipe poking into one of your ships though, unless it is easy to model an end cap at the point it touches the target or stop the tubes extension on contact."},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:35:26Z","Content":"Logically, it wouldn\u0027t make much sense (is the pipe drilling into the fuel tank? lol) but I\u0027m all for it as a solution to hoses.
