I had three fuel tanks radially attached to eachother in a row of three. The one in the center had a liquid fuel engine, and the one\u0027s on the outside had jet engines. The side fuel tanks were empty and the center fuel tank had about 160 fuel. I wanted to put 80 fuel in each engine, close as I got was 83 to 77. It doesn\u0027t seem like that big of a difference but it does have an effect on flying. Landing is difficult when your ship is unbalanced.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:06:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI \u002B1 this..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirJodelstein","CreatedById":62251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T19:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyep, here is another \u002B1!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T00:32:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgree.
