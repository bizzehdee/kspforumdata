Since dV is shown to you when you make a node and it calculates a burn, why not have it shown in the VAB/SPH while building? Yes trial and error is part of the KSP way, but spending 2 hours on a mission just to be a little dV off from being a successful mission is somewhat frustrating and off-putting. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdmittedly I have found myself shutting down and not opening it back up again until the sour taste has left my mouth. I love the mods and all, but I prefer to play stock due to overall performance feeling way more fluid. I don\u0026#39;t expect this to get very much traction. After all like I said, this has probably been brought up in the past, I just missed out on the conversation. So please don\u0026#39;t flame me too hard. :sticktongue:\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T01:02:09Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u00273viL_M0nk3y\u0027]after skimming the first few pages on this forum section I didn\u0026#39;t see anything about adding a stock dV display[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStrange, this is suggested once every few days, if not more.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEach time the majority of people agree, but it is never implemented.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T01:13:40Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u00273viL_M0nk3y\u0027]a stock dV display[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly surprised this isn\u0026#39;t on the WNTS list.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"3viL_M0nk3y","CreatedById":104263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T04:31:06Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027ObsessedWithKSP\u0027]Honestly surprised this isn\u0026#39;t on the WNTS list.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWNTS...
