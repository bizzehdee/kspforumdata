My current setup is a daisy chain: I have a pair of speakers connected to my computer by 3.5mm jack, and then I have the base station for my wireless headphones plugged into a 3.5mm port on the speakers. To switch between speakers and headphones, I just plug or unplug the base station from the speakers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem that this solves is that USB and Bluetooth sound devices are registered with the operating system as separate sound cards, and neither Windows nor Linux handles switching back and forth between different sound devices well, making workarounds like SSD necessary. By daisy chaining everything, I keep my motherboard sound chipset as the sound device in use at all times, and just switch physically between the speakers that that sound device is outputting to being either my speakers or my headphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ezfox","CreatedById":85056,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-04T06:40:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u00B4t use any USB or Bluetooth devices at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe monitor speakers as well as the HiFi-system (Video Receiver) are attached through HDMI/DP cables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo i dont have any chance to daisy chain or replug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
