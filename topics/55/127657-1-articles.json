Even having something simple like the island runway would be nice. Having small areas like this would be great for recovery, and would also be nice if you could spawn smaller craft from them (sort of like how the lower tier buildings work). It would be nice, when wanting to go flying or driving around, to be able to spawn in other locations. I suppose those other locations could also be chosen to give the player some new challenge to flying or getting to orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T03:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222321245\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127657\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221450036680\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100668\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Claw said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be nice, when wanting to go flying or driving around, to be able to spawn in other locations.

Some locations, such as runways and minuscule launching facilities on remote islands/ deserts, can serve as test grounds for military projects (ICBM series, fighter series, combat simulation training projects) that can take part in the game. Meanwhile, other locations that are more public can serve as airports (NASA contributes to civilian travel, ya know) or spaceports. Also, Kerbin can be divided by simple boundaries that abide by simple politics. Flying over another \u0022country\u0027s\u0022 airspace may give a player a penalty of some sort. Flying over military airspace boundaries in civilian aircraft will also bring penalties, as will jettisoning/ deorbiting ships onto other countries (skylab?), etc. That political aspect of the game may be way too overboard, yet I just added that for the sake of interest to make this discussion more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n073198681.
