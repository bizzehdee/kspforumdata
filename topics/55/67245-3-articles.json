As for the rings\u0027 implementation, they would probably not be implemented as individual objects, because it would be very difficult to render so many objects. IMO, it\u0027s more likely that rings would be implemented as some kind of static particle effect (unlikely) or some kind of non-collidable surface mesh (more likely). BUT I fully acknowledge this is wild speculation outside the scope of this thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be awesome to take the best of both worlds: have the vast majority of the rings be a particle effect/surface mesh, but have an occasional larger piece (or 10) of debris spawn in the ring area, similar to how asteroids are going to be implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T05:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder why NovaSilisko has yet to reply to this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my believe he is a big fan when it comes to thinking about new planets and he has some awesome ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T05:40:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder why NovaSilisko has yet to reply to this thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure what exactly I could really do...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-01T05:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder why NovaSilisko has yet to reply to this thread.\u003Cp\u003EIn my believe he is a big fan when it comes to thinking about new planets and he has some awesome ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t blame him for not responding.
