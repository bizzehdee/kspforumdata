But the rules for protovessels are quite the same as for crafts or subassemblies. Each craft has a root part, and other parts are attached to it (never the reverse) or to one part already attached; so a craft definition is actually similar (topologically) to a tree, new parts branch out from existing ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the system has a few limitations: one, as discussed, a tree can only be \u0022planted\u0022 by its root (I can reiterate, but am sure you agree, it would be absolutely terrible for performance to allow nodes on other parts be active while joining a section). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother limitation exists IMHO: only one node effectively joins a part to an existing tree, is not possible to have a part joining multiple times (generally, with a number of different other parts), in what would be considered topologically a \u0022loop\u0022. There are advantages in certain situations using closed loops (most notable with joints, only one is effectively keeping a vessel together with any single part; if you are familiar with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70161\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EConnectedLivingSpace\u003C/a\u003E you probably found you can\u0027t make a looped living space), so I would like to see them implemented, however I guess most of KSP internal routines would require a deep revision (e.g., the one that checks for fuel available to engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, back to your case, I can only recommend to use SelectRoot. Sure you need to plan in advance, define the subassemblies and change their root parts, then you can build the vessel from the main section and join each subassembly in turn. I never had an issue with that add-on, and when an add-on is such good, IMO Squad could directly use that. And however, let me tell there is no need to suggest to have that feature (back to the OP, now that the case is pretty well defined): Squad already has plans for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout how Squad implements things: everybody here has an opinion, you tell the ENB is better, but you rank among the seasoned players. Squad looks at how to make features intuitive for new players too, and certainly the navball arrow is more so and less confusing to them than the ghost markers used by ENB. But besides opinions, KSP is good for being so moddable: if any feature can be improved over the stock ones, some modders will do. SelectRoot (possibly with some updates) may remain a valid add-on, if the same feature was worse implemented in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin Kerbice","CreatedById":101695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T20:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@diomeda: ok thanks.

Believe we can scratch that as accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, back to what seems to be involved in your consideration: from a player standpoint, stacked or surface-attached should not make a difference. Certainly that consideration did not bother me much, and I did not get it as your goal before. So, thanks for showing what it was in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a bit of experiments to see if tweaking the attachment rules for those tanks and DPs used in the showcases above could provide the ability to surface-attach a tank to the back of an existing DP, but to no avail. Perhaps it could be achieved by modding stack nodes with the DP, but I feel the end result would not be as desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it really seems like to obtain what you suggest, a different rule/attachment mechanic is required. But with that, I\u0027ll let developers (or modders) to consider how best to implement it, and avoid to get myself into further technicalities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
