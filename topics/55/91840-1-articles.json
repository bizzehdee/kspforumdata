However, we could use a little something for larger landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is basically a jet that works in atmospheres without oxygen and even outside of the atmosphere. It\u0027s a combination of jet and rocket technology, usually called an air-augmented rocket, or ramrocket. It takes in air like a jet, and the exhaust from an internal rocket nozzle compresses the air, greatly increasing atmospheric thrust and efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn-game, the ramrocket part would need an intake to work to its full potential. It would work without one, but not very efficiently at all. It would have better efficiency than the aerospike engine inside of an atmosphere, and its efficiency would gradually decrease as air pressure got thinner, eventually reaching a somewhat low minimum efficiency similar to that of the half-size rockets. It would be somewhat heavy and would take up quite a bit of space, similar to the RAPIER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a good suggestion, or just another vague thought that I had?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T02:50:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would probably be easiest to simpy make it a rocket that has better atmo ISP (say, 800, to make it comparable with the NERVA) but crapp space ISP.

The thrust and Isp of the engine will change not only with altitude but with speed, and will certainly be affected differently by different atmosphere compositions - for instance, you could run it on only liquid fuel low in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and use the local O2 as oxidizer, or, in some environment like Jool with lots of ambient hydrogen, run it on only liquid oxidizer. In places like Eve (maybe; Eve\u0027s atmosphere isn\u0027t reactive enough for rocket burning, is it?) or Duna, it\u0027ll need both fuel and oxidizer, using the ambient air only as a inert propellant mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the very least, this sounds like a cool idea for a mod, if one doesn\u0027t already exist. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-04T10:36:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy only question is how does it compare to he Rapier?
