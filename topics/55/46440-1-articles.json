Right now navball is more suitable for aircrafts, most of which never fly sideways, nor bank more than 30 degrees. But spaceships need normal and radial vectors very often, and right now navball lacks these important indicators.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if you are on an inclined circular orbit, prograde and retrograde markers are some degrees off 90 and 270, and constantly moving, so finding radial direction is hard. If you are on an elliptic orbit, both normal and radial are hard to deduct and catch. I have to add expendable maneuver nodes to find where to aim at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould be great improvement in orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T20:26:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean something like this? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/enhancednavball/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/enhancednavball/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kulebron","CreatedById":80231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T20:28:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExactly, thanks!
