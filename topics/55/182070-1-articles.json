I\u0027ve been playing for quite some time and reasonably good at making sophisticated ship and vehicle designs, but something that really causes problems or limitations for me in particular designs is locked autostruts I cannot disable! It would be so nice to be able to do this please, I understand locked autostruts are good for keeping certain things firmer when one is new to putting parts and certain designs together but I\u0027d rather make the call as to what gets strutted or not if I so choose as I understand the interactions of them very well.

My biggest issue is the wheels because by far most of my time in KSP is spent making and toying with wheeled vehicles, something of a specialty of mine, and the big problem with wheels is they all are locked to heaviest part strutting, and for me, that is bad! That causes the entire vehicle to be rigid when I don\u0027t want it to be, I\u0027d rather change the strutting method to grandparent parts for instance so they only are rigid relative to the axle part I attach them to. I want my vehicles like longer trucks or buses to be able to flex more along their body as an example, and there\u0027s several benefits to this strategy such as less physical shock when wheels hit something that can cause them to burst by allowing the vehicle to form to the ground or whatever it\u0027s riding over. It just seems like such a simple thing that should exist to be allowed to override this locked strutting, it\u0027s frustrating for me as much as I love making advanced wheeled vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd lastly as an example of why one might like to be able to turn this off, is the instance of space stations exploding due to unsafe strut combinations, such a wheeled vehicle getting added to the mix there with locked heaviest part strutting. I however haven\u0027t had this example happen to me personally but I\u0027ve heard all about it and is just another reason we need more control over this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: and by engine plates, I mean they cause parts attached to them to become locked, but it also strangely seems inconsistent as well and is not always the case? weird.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-11T10:20:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/11/2019 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Dirt The Space Dirt Fox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eaddendum\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aeroboi","CreatedById":186653,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-11T10:15:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223538234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022182070\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549825518\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only things I know that have locked autostruts are landing gear/wheels.
