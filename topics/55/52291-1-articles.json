I was thinking there should an asteroid belt out in deep space, this would lead to random mission pop ups of an incoming asteroids that have been knocked out of the belt and on an impact course for the planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mission put a rocket / rockets into orbit and change the course of the incoming asteroids to save Kerbalkind. I think it would lead to orbiting stations ready to go intercept an incoming asteroid and and change there orbit. If you good you could put the asteroid into a stable orbit and mine it for resources to return back to Kerbal. (once mining is incorporated into the full non-addon game) If the asteroid is smaller than a certain size you could have it \u0022loose mass\u0022 as the mining operation takes place, less mass means less gravity making it harder for you to land / mine on the next trip, but easier to change its orbit / trajectory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T00:03:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile asteroids would be cool, they are on the what not to suggest list.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T12:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be hilariously annoying. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*On Duna trip*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOL ASTEROIDS FIX IT OR DIE!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T13:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs has been mentioned, asteroids are on the [thread=36863]What Not to Suggest List[/thread].
