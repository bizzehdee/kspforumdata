It\u0027s a great tank for fine tuning fuel content, it\u0027s an eye pleasing design, it works great for rover jump jets, it has a ton of uses. Now, it will apparently have Xenon. I would like to see them reconsider this change. What do you think?\n\nEDIT:\n\nSuccess!\n\nMax announced on Squadcast that there will be a new Xenon tank and the Round-8 will remain unchanged!
