In your game Physics is the game. When you mess with the Physics you are changing the rules of the game. I am a member of a small community of players who love your game, and I\u0027m the only one who is currently playing it because of all of the problems with the physics that have been introduced. In 1.02 you changed the Drag. This made half the rockets no longer work, and you were supposed to change it back in 1.03 but you didn\u0027t we still have to go into the cheat menu and turn the drag from 8 down to 4. Now in 1.03 you added a broken heat mechanic. My rocket that I launched to minimus before the patch now just blows up on the launch pad before I do anything, and when I rebuilt it and got it to minimus, it then blew up when I left the ship to spend some of the obtained science, and came back. Hours of work blew up, and I\u0027m forced to either go get mods to edit the freaking save files or start all over. I understand you have a whole list of features you want to add. What I\u0027m telling you is that the majority of us are not Scott Manley and we don\u0027t freaking need more physics we need more to do with the existing physics that we understand. Give us more planets, further out, more game options, a bigger universe to explore, more science to research, etc. Don\u0027t give us more physics problems to solve!
