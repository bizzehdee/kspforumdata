Drones have this ability today. The ship does just that - hovers until fuel runs out. With physics warp, it is put on rails but uses fuel 4x as fast for 4x warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 10000x warp, it uses fuel 10,000 times as fast but stays perfectly still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to land on it, the drone will instantly adjust the thrust of engines to stabilise the landing zone like a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Pipes which can pump ore and process it at the top, turning it into fuel for the hovering landing pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I think landing on artificial aircraft carriers should be a thing, but I\u0027m not really sure how to go about this.

It\u0027s conceivable you could trat it in the same manner as landed, but we do have the problem of the \u0022ground\u0022 (jet) reactions changing as the mass changes, which changes the rate of change of mass, which is a little more complicated than true ground reactions. But not insurmountable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the biggest thing you would need would be a compelling reason for the developers to add and support such a special case.
