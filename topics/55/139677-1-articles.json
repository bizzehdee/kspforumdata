At that moment I realized I had to alt-tab to a browser to look for Kerbin\u0027s distance to other planets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP now has KSPedia but shouln\u0027t it have astronomical an physical data (like diameter, altitude from Kerbol, inclination,\u00A0minimal\u00A0speed to achieve\u00A0orbit,\u00A0stationary orbit altitude, etc.)\u00A0on the celestial bodies (moons included)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found this other thread proposing a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/135091-the-delta-v-map-in-kspedia/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EDeltaV map to KSPedia\u003C/a\u003E, I agree it would be invaluable, but many commenters had valid points not to do it. Even so, I think these data would help players to infer the DeltaV needed to a mission...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the devs think it would be some kind of spoiler, they could (maybe) make new sections of KSPedia available as the Tracking Station were upgraded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-13T17:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of locking KSPedia pages that contain stuff you haven\u0027t discovered yet. \u00A0They could show the headings and info on what the pages contain, and what you need to do to unlock the contents.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course in sandbox (as it is now) everything would be visible, but in career and science modes it could work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
