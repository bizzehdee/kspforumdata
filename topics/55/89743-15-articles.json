It can\u0027t be too open either. Tech tree is very helpful to guide a new players through the game. It should be build in mind of being helpful for them, especially at a very beginning. The one-part-per-node is a complete opposite of that idea. Sometimes you might want one-part nodes, eg. with LV-N, but it cannot be a fundamental principle of the tree. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENO\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. I totally disagree with that. Starting node is an essential part of the game experience. Eg. with the tech tree by Sherkaner you\u0027d be able to \u0022loose\u0022 the game before even building a single rocket by just making bad decisions at a beginning - it\u0027s unacceptable.

Not only interdependency makes sense in many cases but also adds to the requirement of otherwise very powerful and too easily accessible parts (eg. LV-N, though that one IMHO should be an end-game tech so more people would know how to make an interplanetary missions without LV-N addiction, cause it\u0027s perfectly doable but noone is bothered having such a capable engine in a mid-late part of the tree) \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#8b4513;\u0022\u003EYes, but only \u003C/span\u003Eif it doesn\u0027t mean spamming player with dozens of useless parts very early on.

So yes, my tree has \u003Cem\u003Eenormous\u003C/em\u003E balance issues; it was meant as a proof-of-concept to spur discussion and hopefully to show that you could create a mostly per-part tree and it wouldn\u0027t be a nightmare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately some still consider it a nightmare, but I am glad it\u0027s spurring some discussion finally.

I think with some good tutorials, and maybe some trial and error (I don\u0027t see why a player\u0027s first career has to be guaranteed to be successful), a player should feel \u003Cem\u003Eempowed \u003C/em\u003Eby the fact that they selected an R\u0026amp;D path of their own that suited their program and wasn\u0027t pre-ordained to guarantee a \u0022good\u0022 flow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do think that if I were to do it over again, I would probably condense some of the nodes a bit.
