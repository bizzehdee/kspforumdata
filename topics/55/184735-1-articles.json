I mean like we got the Modding Community for stuff we don\u0027t have, I heard they were adding Robotic stuff for the next Update (and DLC i think). But before that we have to Use Infernal Robotics which was sure fine. But the thing was, We can\u0027t just be like \u0022Here\u0027s Some payed DLC for you! HERE SOME\u0027S PAYED DLC FOR YOU! EVERYONE GET A PAYED DLC!\u0022 like no. If we keep adding DLC that kill\u0027s some mod (not really but still), That would be just idk a way to make the Modding Community disappears slowy but surely. Yes, there is some KSP Plugin that fixed some Stock game, but what happened to the Part Mod? Will they will just gone because there is too many DLC (if Squad decided to make a Booster loads of DLC). Now look, what if we just add something to the Vanilla game like what Minecraft Did, they weren\u0027t perfect, but i wouldn\u0027t mind (Except the 1.9 Combat system). Adding New parts to the Vanilla Game without making a new DLC. It\u0027s easier, and can Help KSP player who can\u0027t afford DLC (like good ol\u0027 Mukita).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this doesn\u0027t makes any sense, Just say it.
