So the 48-7S IMO is a needed engine (for small landers on Mun and so on) even if overpowered. Maybe the Isp could be lowered a bit too?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter, the LV-1 probably needs a bit of a boost. It has bad TWR \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E unimpressive Isp... it probably needs a slightly better vacuum Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-16T02:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-1 seems to get a boost in .24, according to the more recent Squadcast.

There seems to be a 1300% gap in thrust between the current LV-1 and 24-77, and an even larger percentage up to the next stack 0.625 metre engine, the 48-7S. The LV-1 is 300% the ion\u0027s thrust, which gives you an idea of the disparity in probe-size engines. As it seems the LV-1 is being changed in the next update, we\u0027ll just have to wait and see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the 48-7S is definitely overpowered. My idea for new stats for it would be 20kN thrust, 250s-300s I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E and 0.066T mass, to keep it at its current TWR.
