This would make it a lot easier to both identify which tech tree nodes I need to unlock and which mods need to be installed in order for a part to be available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, this list needs to be able to grow a scrollbar. I\u0027ve already seen one list that was so long the \u0022Ok\u0022 button had been pushed off screen and the only fix was to kill KSP and re-start.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
