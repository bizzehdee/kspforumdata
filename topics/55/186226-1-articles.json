That\u0027s actually the back. So, if you intend to use a probe core as a rover, or side-mount it on a ship and still control the ship correctly, you must make sure the name is facing the back of the ship so the blank part of the probe core - the actual front - is pointing the correct direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m bringing this up here because I simply cannot make myself post a bug report for it.
