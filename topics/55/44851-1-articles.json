That\u0027s reasonable, but then if that Kerbal right clicks the flag and picks \u0022Take down flag\u0022, the kerbal still doesn\u0027t have a flag. The flag is now gone and can\u0027t be re-planted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t expect this behavior. I was just trying to take it down in order to move it a few meters and now I have no flag to plant after all that long rover travel. (I\u0027m not near the landed capsule so I can\u0027t just enter the capsule to get another flag. The capsule is 40 km away by rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking down a flag should add 1 flag to the Kerbal\u0027s flag inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(EDIT: This should be changed to a bug report instead of a suggestion I guess, because I just returned to the game and discovered that it *DOES* return the flag to the kerbal\u0027s inventory, but only after having used the \u0022ESC\u0022 menu and then come back to the same kerbal again does it appear when you right-click the kerbal. Just after having taken the flag down, the kerbal is flagless unilt you leave and come back to it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-03T19:35:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2013 07:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spectrhz","CreatedById":69106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T20:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor me when I pick one back up I need to move the kerbal a few steps before it shows up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
