For example: engines still decrease fuel flow and keep thrust the same as they transfer from an atmosphere to a vacuum, instead of increasing thrust and keeping fuel flow the same. ISP doesn\u0027t get reduced when pressures are above 1 atm.

Let\u0027s start with the latter: Build an orbital station that has power and an antenna, and support for 5 Kerbals. If I have two such contracts, I can satisfy the requirements of both with a single station. Once I have established an orbit and satisfied the first contract, I can then take the same station and move it to a different orbit to satisfy the next contract. This exploit could be overcome by not automatically completing the contract, but actually clicking on the contract to hand over control of the active vessel to the agency, at which point you no longer have control over it - or if you destroy it or move it, you lose the credits and science points you received for the contract in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInsular contracts - this has been mentioned before. Making the contracts build on one another. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Create an orbital station around Kerbin, that has power, an antenna and a docking port. The station must be able to support 5 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Upgrade your orbital station to support 10 Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Upgrade your station to include capacity for 20k LFO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Refuel your station with at least 20k LFO. Difficult to do without SSTO but still possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Upgrade your station to include a docking port Snr, so it can be used as a staging station for missions to other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of the contracts, you now have a station that you can use for staging. The next contract involves assembling an interplanetary transfer vehicle with xxxx delta-V, and make the contract very difficult indeed to accomplish without assembling the parts in space. Again, the IPTV can be formed of multiple contracts, or a single contract in multiple parts. For my last mission to Duna, my IPTV consisted of a core and two fuel pods, and my lander had 3 engine nacelles, all of which were assembled in orbit. This, however, only works if the pieces don\u0027t get stuck together with the docking port bug, which I previously reported.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe career mode serves both as a motive to do things you wouldn\u0027t try if you were just playing around with the sandbox, and also as a training tool. On this point, I think the contracts and the tech tree do a good job - trickle feeding you parts and giving you contracts that can be accomplished with the parts you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of the contracts are just whack - why would anyone care if an SRB works on an escape trajectory from Kerbin?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame-vessel collisions: I make ample use of quantum struts, and I don\u0027t feel that I\u0027m cheating with this. In the real world, if I put a 300 ton pod into an SSTO cargo bay, docked at one end, the pod does not fall through the floor of the cargo bay. I would have rubber blocks on which it can rest until it gets into orbit. The only way to make this work at present is with quantum struts, because as soon as a sub-assembly becomes part of a ship, all of the parts of the same vessel are able to move through one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre they ready for 1.0? They\u0027ve all but met their targets in .90, and given some work on the contracts and a few bug fixes, I think it\u0027s ready. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think some more thought should be given to how the mods are to be included in the game. There are a lot of mods out there that are exploits, but many of them I think should be included. B9 I use extensively, so I do with MechJeb, procedural tanks, FAR, TCA Fuel Balancer, docking port navigation camera, and NavHud, since the kerbals, having discovered space travel, have not yet figured out the intricacies of a compass. I\u0027d be inclined to say we need sub-contracts to develop certain parts or part packs, which are looked up from online resources. B9 Aerospace offers to do some development for you, at a cost. If you accept, you pay them and you have access to the parts pack. However, the parts that are offered as part of the game need to be moderated, such that the obvious exploits do not offer easy cheats to the serious player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T07:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*statement above may or may not be true\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T08:46:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E* RPM or equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* EVE or equivalent (clouds!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Kerbal Flight Data or equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Bug-free plug and play joystick support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T13:08:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMemory leaks need some fixing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T12:46:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow that we\u0027re getting a better aero model, there\u0027s no excuse not to allow external seats to control vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T20:33:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SaturnV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SaturnV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELocalization\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could probably do a Spanish one themselves, to test how things will work out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T23:25:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe damned bug that happens when you hit a kerbal in a command seat.
