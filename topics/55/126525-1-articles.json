They could easily have contracts that would require you to locate and possibly recover the black boxes and maybe use it as a reward based thing. For example I locate and recover a dead probe on eve and as a reward I\u0026#39;m granted \u002B5% to a specific science reward.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuranon","CreatedById":154117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T12:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea...but its a lot of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou would need \u00A0voice actors, chatter triggering mechanics and - most importantly - lots of recorded lines.
