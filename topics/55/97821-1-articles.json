I think that if you have a prebuilt space shuttle it might take some of the fun away from the player (they may think that if one is already built there is no point in them making one). An example of what I mean is that they could make a simple orbit rocket that the player could improve by adding boosters or docking capability. I think that the ships should teach the players somthing but not teach them everything so they can feel a sense of achievement in making the ship better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T19:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny decently designed rocket (I won\u0027t speak to spaceplanes) should do fine in 1.0---and by decently designed, I mean looks and is balanced like a real rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose Squad could always pick a few, throw them around 1.0 themselves, and tweak if they really like them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FishInferno","CreatedById":106219,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T20:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, and I had a similar one myself.
