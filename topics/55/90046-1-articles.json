For example, you might have a space station in Kerbin orbit, that needs supplies for life support every six months. If you then send a mission out to Jool, you then have to do 4 supply missions to that space station before you even arrive at Jool, let alone the journey back. Which if you\u0027re doing a Jool mission for the first time, isn\u0027t particularly fun. Expand to say, a Kerbin station and a Mun base, and suddenly you might doing 16 \u0022routine\u0022 resupply missions while still trying to do a Jool mission, and the further you develop your infrastructure, the worse the problem becomes. Limiting a player\u0027s ability to do things like this isn\u0027t really fun either. Electricity is different - it rarely gets thought about after the craft is built. All you need to do is put enough solar panels on, and maybe about how the craft is rotated before you time warp. It doesn\u0027t require active \u0022juggling\u0022, and you near enough forget about craft in terms of electricity while your flying other missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-11T21:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@GluttonyReaper\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not wrong, but that has much more to do with the fact that the devs took the conscious step of making atleast some electrical generation parts to be in the low part of the tech tree, while by some reason people always put the tech support as something esoteric that has to be in the top echelons of the tech tree ... and let\u0027s be honest, it doesn\u0027t have to be that way.

I suspect HarvesteR is viewing life support as a resource that (mostly) cannot be generated. As in, not able to be generated until the very late stages of the tech tree, and even then not self-sufficiently. The type you are proposing (which can be generated entirely at an early stage, if I understand you correctly) seems illogical to implement - it\u0027s basically just another form of electric charge, you could just make all command pods drain electric charge as \u0022life support\u0022, and get the same result.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is pretty much my point, but I stress: electricity as it in game is also under a heavy idealization and if it was implemented in a minimally realistic way it would suffer the exact same issues you are pointing out about a realistic life support: batteries self discharge, ships have baseline consumptions, solar panels degrade, radioactive decay generators lose efficiency and the task of replacing any of those components \u003Cem\u003Ein situ\u003C/em\u003E is in the same order of magnitude of difficulty than reliable life support in far away places ( in other words, we have neither in RL ) and it is actually harder to make batteries and solar panels than ladders in RL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E In spite of that, we have the electricity we have in game ...

Saying what he said ... well, it doesn\u0027t make sense.
