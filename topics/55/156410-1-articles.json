The narrow vertical space makes this worse. So I propose a mk2 fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can enlarge the fairing like a normal one, but it is in the shape of a mk2 segment. This means you can have the fairing fit snugly or on the end of another mk2 segment without needing a mk2 -\u0026gt; 1.25m adapter, then a 1.25m fairing, then another adapter to join to another mk2 part, which adds unnecessary weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your payload is too large for a mk2 cargo bay, the fairing allows for that tiny (or large) bit of extra room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
