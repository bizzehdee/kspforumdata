I feel that, once Kerbal has released on all playforms (or maybe before?), Squad should create a DLC or spin-off called \u0027KSP:GW\u0027, meaning Kerbal Space Program: Galactic Warfare. Mods on KSP have already attempted to create things like this, but it never tends to work out so well. I have a vision of a solar system, maybe players sharing planets and meteors, maybe on their own. They start like science mode (or career, never played career), but players must develop and create ships and weapons while researching yet more, while making bases on planets with others playing on, and forming allies and enemies. Could be like \u0027Civilisation\u0027 if anyone is familiar with that game. This would be so fun, firing missiles at opponents and forming armies and strategic attacks and defences. Imagine if it was official. If this way on Xbox One or something (almost like an MMO, but individual game-based, it wouldn\u0027t be good with it going forever!), it would be a huge hit, and most people would know about KSP. Worth a shot, right? Who agrees? Post your opinions and suggestions for a mode like this! Would you pay something like \u00A310-20? Would you want it to be free? Share. I know I would pay a little for this.
