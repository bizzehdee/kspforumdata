The options are that the capsule is broken and shouldn\u0027t be able to store such data (so the message is correct), or the capsule is supposed to be able to store this data (and thus the message shouldn\u0027t be displaying). Both options have interesting implications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume that capsules are broken, then what we\u0027re supposed to have is only the mobile lab being able to store Goo and Material data.

It\u0027s going to be essentially impossible in the stock game to just spam Kerbin, the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus biomes with a metric buttload of missions in a few game-days to max out the tech tree; you\u0027re going to have to take time to consider how much each mission costs you for the science gained - and the cost will be more tangible than just time in the VAB and then executing the mission. When each goo canister and material science bay costs a significant fraction of the mission budget, you\u0027ll have to try to economize and optimize your mission plans when you head out to Duna/Ike and Eve/Gilley, let along Jool. So then, when the financial costs come into play, the value of the Science Lab will become more obvious. \u003Cp\u003EAs it stands now, I see it as more \u0022something to do\u0022 rather than just being the best way to get the most Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh - then it all hinges on the cost of the goo and science cans, doesn\u0027t it?

Is that what you are talking about?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, I\u0027m talking about something else. The scenario was as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d sent a big mothership containing the mobile lab to Duna and back, which had 2 Goos and 1 Material on it that had been exposed and stored in high and low Duna orbit. But this mothership had no ability to land, so when it got back to Kerbin, I sent up a capsule to recover the crew. Once the capsule was docked, I EVA\u0027d the Duna crew to the capsule. On the way, they collected the data from the Goo and Materials and brought it to the capsule. When they boarded the capsule, I got the message saying the capsule could not store the data and I\u0027d have to dump it go board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there was no other way to get the Kerbals home, I selected \u0022board anyway, dump data\u0022 and figured I\u0027d lost it. But when I landed the capsule and hit the recovery button, I still got the end-of-mission report on science earned, and it showed the Goo and Material data from Duna orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe capsule had zero science parts on it. It was merely the pod, a docking port, and just enough RCS and rocket to rendezvous, dock, and de-orbit. It had no data of its own to start with, so this wasn\u0027t a case of bringing in multiple copies of the same data. The only data I recovered when it landed came from Duna. So obviously I kept the data that the message said I had to dump to board the capsule. This data included both Goos, which were from different altitudes. And that was it, nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo like I said, something\u0027s broken here. Either it\u0027s cool for capsules to store Goo and Material data and we shouldn\u0027t be getting a message saying they can\u0027t, or capsules are broken and are storing data they shouldn\u0027t be able to. If it\u0027s supposed to be that capsules can\u0027t store Goo and Materials, then you\u0027d need the mobile lab for that, and would have to recover it instead of/along with the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the game got confused because the capsule was docked to the mobile lab. As I understand things, that makes them part of the same ship for various game mechanics. Because mobile labs CAN store Goo and Material data, the ship as a whole has that ability. Then perhaps the routine that stores data doesn\u0027t care which part ends up holding it, while perhaps another routine only checks part data capabilities when you go through the hatch and tosses up the warning, but doesn\u0027t actually have any power over the fate of the data.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceToast","CreatedById":97389,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T14:46:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can suggest is do a test without the lab - minmus or the moon (since it\u0027ll only take 10mins of playtime to do).

Considering the overall low cap on science earned by transmissions now, I think the use cases for the science lab are relatively low. They exist, sure, but they still aren\u0027t huge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think to rebalance it, SQUAD needs to change the mechanic so that the max science earned with a lab is 60-75% of the total, instead of the same 40% cap that transmissions have. THAT would add a large benefit to having a lab. Just my 2 cents. Otherwise I don\u0027t see many instances where it makes sense to have a lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only time I think it does is rather low gravity moons, like Minmus or future ones like Ike, Bop and Gilly if they ever gain Biomes, because the dV cost to get to those moons is high, but the dV cost to travel to different spots on the moons is low. So having to schlep half a dozen materials bays and goos along is much more prohibitive than a lab, one of each and then just redock with the thing several times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething like the Mun, Duna, etc, even with Biomes, you are possibly better off just carrying everything with you, extracting the science through EVA and then returning a small craft back to Kerbin with all the experiments on-board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I like the balance of science in the update, but I do wish that either transmissions could get a slightly higher percentage of the overall, especially for things like Thermometer readings, or else the lab allowed for a higher overall percentage of science by using it. As it stands, transmissions seem to only be worth while for places where return missions are very prohibitive, like Eve\u0027s surface, Tylo\u0027s surface and Laythe\u0027s surface and maybe some out of the way places like Moho and Eyloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich again, it would be nice to have labs allow a somewhat higher max science value for transmissions in this case, because a 40% cap is a little low when you are using a full on lab (yes, I realize that if the experiment transmits, say, 40% normally, you\u0027ll get 55% total with the labs \u002B15% bonus, but that doesn\u0027t help things like the materials bay which is only 20% transmision to begin with, because it still caps at 40% total).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reicht","CreatedById":97211,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T15:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo offense to anyone, but if you\u0027re not going beyond Minmus then yes the Science lab is kind of a bit more work than is necessary to get the Job done, but once you\u0027re talking 2 interplanetary trips then the time, resources, and challenge starts to sway back in favor of the lab.
