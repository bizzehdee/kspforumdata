SOLVED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids in orbits can serve as refueling stations for vessels. You can either treat the asteroids as big fuel tanks already containing fuel and oxidizer, or add the water resource and provide an electrolysis part to split it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could even be used in the ARM pack to use the asteroid \u003Cem\u003Eitself\u003C/em\u003E to generate the fuel that is needed to push it into kerbin orbit instead of impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think the volume of resources in each asteroid should be random, but set would also be fine. And if what is summarized \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68894-Newest-Squadcast-Highlights-lots-of-new-info-about-24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E is accurate, you\u0027re already allowing \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E random generation into the system, so random shouldn\u0027t be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo require more research, the base grapple may not allow fuel cross feed/transfer. A separate part that would grapple \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E allow cross-feed/transfer could be added. Or a ship/probe has to dock before the amount(s) of available resources are revealed. It\u0027d also be great if this could be extended to other ship resources (e.g. monoprop) or to the planets\u0027 surfaces, but at this point, I\u0027ll take just about \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut back to the point:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis fix simple.
