No tumbling or nothing. It\u0027s freaky! As a matter of fact, the mod that fixed the absence of clamshell fairings when fairings were first introduced by Squid, that mod had them tumbling through space as you would realistically expect. So what I\u0027d like to ask is a simple thing, which is to do a \u0022jazzing up\u0022 pass over the stock fairings and re-introduce this tumbling behaviour, maybe even with a little bit of a camera shake effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom an older version of the game, but this is the sort of thing I\u0027m talking about.
