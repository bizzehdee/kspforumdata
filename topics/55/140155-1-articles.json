In many cases this is useful for things such as control surfaces... but if I just want to apply brakes on one side to assist with turning on the ground, its horrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI seem to recall (but need to check with the recent update) that parachutes placed with radial symmetry don\u0027t behave like this, If I want to tweak the opening conditions for the chutes during flight (ie after leaving the VAB), I needed to click on each and every one... which can be annoying. Other times, I\u0027d want to actually have each one tweaked for slightly different opening conditions (for example, to stagger opening for less opening shock, but opening shock is much less of an issue now).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically I want a toggle to apply part tweaks to just the individual part, or to the part and its symmetric parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be really nice and give me much more control over my craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMainly this issue came to frustrat me when trying to turn a larger SSTO that lacked steerable gear (because there are no larger sized steerable gear)... I wanted to put the brakes to full(200) on for my right rear landing gear(and 0 on the left) to help it turn right while it was rolling, but it just applied brakes to both gears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried again after stopping, intending to fire up an engine on the left, with the right brakes on... the engine worked fine, but the brakes toggles were stuck symmetrically and the turning radius was horrible as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-20T23:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny change you make, all parts in symmetry will change.\u00A0 It\u0027s the same for all part types.\u00A0 Your best solution right now is a mod called StripSymmetry.\u00A0 There is a recompile at the end of the thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72894-10-stripsymmetry-remove-symmetry-v16-2015-04-28-2020-utc/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;page=3\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T11:56:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, thats not exactly true.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I can accept that for tweaking the brake strengths...
