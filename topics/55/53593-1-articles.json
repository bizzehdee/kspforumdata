Science will be earned the way it is earned now, with scientific missions created by the players. If the player wants to earn more money, they will need to complete assigned missions. Scientific missions use up money but don\u0027t gain it, so you will need to complete missions to fund your scientific missions. Examples of missions are to put a pre-built payload into orbit or land it somewhere, or land a kerbal in a certain place. If you want to gain money and science at the same time you can take scientific equipment on your missions to get some science from wherever you are going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T00:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really hope we don\u0027t get missions where I have to drop some pre-defined payload somewhere that jacks up my active flight count and lags out my game for no good reason.
