Speaking of which, on to my next suggestion: bigger RCS ports/jets for 2.5m interplanetary stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uui8457","CreatedById":96312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T10:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m imagining the 3.75m tank to look like a thin strip, sort of like the other versions of up scaled parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETR-XL Stack Separator, Clamp-O-Tron Sr. Docking Port and Z-4K Rechargeable Battery Bank.
