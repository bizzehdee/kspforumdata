It would be great if we could scroll through the various lists with the arrow keys or WASD, select an item for consideration with Enter, accept with just one quick keystroke, decline with a different keystroke, quickly return to the Space Center screen with ESC, that sort of thing. It struck me as I was repeatedly rejecting contracts to find one I would like to do that the whole process felt very cumbersome with the need to click on the contract, move over to Decline, then move back over to the contract list and select whatever new contract had popped up to assess (and then inevitably have to mouse back over to the Accept/Decline area no matter what I thought of that contract). Just something to consider. Thanks for your time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T03:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
