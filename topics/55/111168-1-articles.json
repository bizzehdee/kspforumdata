I started quicksaving after it happened the last time, but when I am designing a new plane, driving it several times, switching to the tracker (which also triggers autosave just like everything else I mentioned before), landing a plane and afterwards something goes wrong I don\u0027t want to hit load to see I am reverted 3 hours in game time, because my autosave disappeared magically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could start by auto-backupping since the persistant slot gets overwritten so fast or sometimes is so old it doesn\u0027t work as a failsave. From my view my plane crashlanded and since I was at the tracking station after my first landing I couldn\u0027t revert the flight after my second landing anymore and I loaded persistent and it was something massively old (like 10 hours old). It is especially dumb since I couldn\u0027t quicksave midflight this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love a notification window that says something like: \u0022This save is from ww years xx days yy hours zz minutes ago, are you sure you want to continue?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:36:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a pretty good suggestion, for the autosaves to rotate names (or something like that).
