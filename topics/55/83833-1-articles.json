I imagine Eve in particular having an atmosphere rich in Propellium. What this means is that, with a specially designed engine, no liquid fuel is required!

This is what makes them so much more fuel efficient. You don\u0027t need to have a stoichiometric amount of oxidiser, you can react it with some proportion of the intake hydrogen to run a high-bypass turbofan engine, and greatly increase your fuel efficiency that way (although, as you rightly pointed out, not nearly as much as running it the other way round, by carrying fuel in an oxidiser-rich environment)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T21:48:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI said volume when I meant mass.
