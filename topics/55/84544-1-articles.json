But with this improvement, clicking \u0022in\u0022 on tank Y while you have your other 2 tanks \u0022alt(or mod, as the KSP wiki calls it) clicked\u0022 will take equal percentages (or amount, you devs can decide because of the fact that larger tanks drain more fuel, faster) from X and Z and put them into Y.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the consideration of this idea, and good luck developing the game everyone is watching!!
