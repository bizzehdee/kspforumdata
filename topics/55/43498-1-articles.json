I\u0027ve bound these to my x-box 360 controller, and it works great when I turn on RCS, but I really want to be able to walk around with the same controls, as I would in a game for the consoles. As it is, I have to set down my controller and use the keyboard whenever I want to walk around. Ideally I should be able to bind the WSAD keys to something other than movement controls, and I did so for all vehicles, but I\u0027m still stuck with WSAD on foot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T08:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be correct bindings for walking.

They seem to randomly change, no idea why, but sure it has something to do with me modding the mod code \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
