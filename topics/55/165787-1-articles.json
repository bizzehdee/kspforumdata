The problem is, when you use it once, you never want to play without, mainly because of the procedural tanks which offer so much design possibilities. I really wish this mod was integrated to the squad part, or something similar, and at least the tanks. Like this, every game update will support this functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this was so obvious for me that it was necessary for improving the game experience that I wondered if there is not an technical or philosophical reason why they haven\u0027t done this already..
