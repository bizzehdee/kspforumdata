Right now everything in KSP is referenced of surface speed, which is absolutely meaningless for aerodynamics and engine performance. Assume surface speed equals true airspeed and convert to equivalent airspeed. This alone will probably solve the vast majority of KSP\u0027s aerodynamic weirdness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T03:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E:/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really.

It\u0027s not your speed relative to the ground at altitude zero AGL underneath you. - it\u0027s your speed relative to whatever \u0022part\u0022 of the planet is at your altitude right now. If you\u0027re not on the ground, then it\u0027s your speed relative to the \u0022airy\u0022 part of the planet (i.e. atmosphere) that surrounds you, which is \u0022glued\u0022 to the ground, so to speak. If your radius to the center of the planet is bigger because you\u0027re at a higher altitude, and therefore the circumference you travel in one Kerbin day is bigger, and thus the planetary speed due to rotation is bigger, then all this *IS* taken into account in calculating what is reported a \u0022surface speed\u0022. What the game calls \u0022surface\u0022 speed is really your speed in the planetary rotating frame of reference as opposed to your speed in a frame of reference glued to the space around the planet (the orbit speed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T07:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEasiest way to fix KSP aerodynamics....\u003Cp\u003EUse Ferram Aerospace Research plugin (FAR).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR is not \u0022more realistic\u0022.

The real problem is the simplistic drag model, which makes drag proportional to mass and does not take shape or frontal area into account. The aero model definitely needs some TLC from the devs, hopefully they\u0027ll look at it when career mode is feature complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
