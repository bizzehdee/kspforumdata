For this example I direct your attention\u00A0to\u00A0the navball left side controls and the tooltips that display when you mouse over\u00A0them. Placing the mouse over the Prograde control, I can read \u0022ograde\u0022 rather than \u0022Prograde\u0022, and when mousing over the Target control a read \u0022rget\u0022 rather then \u0022Target\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a new player I would guess this could be quite frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems there needs to be a bit\u00A0more thought about the\u00A0placement of the mouse over info dialogues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
