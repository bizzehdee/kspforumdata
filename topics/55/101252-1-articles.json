Surely it has running costs? Admin, electricity bills etc, or do all the staff just go into hibernation?\n\nShould this be simulated? Does anyone do something to \u0022fake\u0022 the costs?\n\nIt doesnt seem right to me that we have the same money after 2 years when all we have done is wait!\n\nThis might also encourage career players to run a space program rather than a series of missions back to back."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T21:13:00Z","Content":"Running costs would just increase the terrible grind of career mode right now.

Moving the thread to the appropriate place ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI personally like the idea of adding time-based components to funding, as I think that a lot of the grind other users are complaining about comes about through the *very* steep prices for facility upgrades. I think that replacing those with permanent monthly operating costs while at the same time enabling contracts that provide constant income over a long-ish duration (though still needing periodic replacements) would go a long way to alleviate that, as it would reduce a good bit of the burden on players to do absolutely *everything* manually.\n\nOf course, I\u0027d have to sit down and actually work out the details to fully do the idea justice."},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T00:58:38Z","Content":"My first thought was, \u0022Kentucky Shock Chicken!\u0022 The new way to fry!

I\u0027d rather see payments over time to create time as a thing that matters. Have a mission to build a station and maintain it for a year. Instead of a bulk payment upon placing the station, you get paid 2000 funds a month. When that expires, it might make the contract/mission system create a new mission to add on tot he station, resupply the station, rotate the crew, etc. (creating a new revenue stream dealt out by the month). Other missions might deal out the money as larger sums in fewer months (remember a Kerbin month is only ~6 days as I recall)."}]}
