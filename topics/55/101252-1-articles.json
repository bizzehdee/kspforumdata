I\u0027d rather see payments over time to create time as a thing that matters. Have a mission to build a station and maintain it for a year. Instead of a bulk payment upon placing the station, you get paid 2000 funds a month. When that expires, it might make the contract/mission system create a new mission to add on tot he station, resupply the station, rotate the crew, etc. (creating a new revenue stream dealt out by the month). Other missions might deal out the money as larger sums in fewer months (remember a Kerbin month is only ~6 days as I recall).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
