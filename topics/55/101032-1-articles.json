I think it\u0027s simply crazy and those shouldn\u0027t be controllable since you have put those in correctly orbit. And obviously this speech extend to space stations, you should have control only when you put it in orbit or when you add more modules. Absolutely not every time.\n\nWhat do you think about?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T19:58:43Z","Content":"I think this has come up a few times. It\u0027s a tough call of game play balance.\n\n- One concept of contracts is that you are contracted to do this one thing, and when it\u0027s done you should be completely un-involved after that. (i.e. You turn over control of the satellite/station/base to the \u0022agency\u0022 that contracted you.)\n\n- The other concept is that contracts are used as a means to pull (or encourage) the player along to build or do something specific, but still allow freedom to do it in their own way.\n\nYou are correct, leaving the craft in the hands of the player sort of ruins the \u0022put craft X in orbit Y\u0022 contract philosophy from a real world standpoint. Because I can tag that contract then go do whatever I want. In essence, \u0022stealing\u0022 it back from the agency that issued the contract. (Which feels \u0022wrong.\u0022)\n\nBut from a gameplay standpoint, the major disadvantage with \u0022handing over\u0022 a craft to another agency is that it creates a situation where by the player is disincentivized to do anything beyond the bare minimum. If a contract says put up a lab with a docking port and power, that\u0027s all that will happen. Not only does it encourage building only the minimum, but the player will be penalized for adding anything extra or spending time to make it look cool. Because the second that thing is establish in orbit, it\u0027s completely gone and can\u0027t be used as part of a growing infrastructure. \n\nI don\u0027t know what the \u0022best\u0022 way is here. There are advantages and disadvantages to both, but personally I tend to lean toward the \u0022give freedom to the player\u0022 side of things.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Daze","CreatedById":57997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T20:01:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I think this has come up a few times.
