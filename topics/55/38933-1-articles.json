I\u0027m sure you know about this, but I\u0027ll write it to be sure - when you time accelerate when a parachute should open, it won\u0027t open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. please, make it that when you scroll with the mouse all the world is zommed and not just the ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, if I\u0027ll recall some other suggestions I\u0027ll post them here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know if you do something about the things I wrote up there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour simulator is great, thank you,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bobert577","CreatedById":72153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour first suggestion is good, but what do you mean when you say \u0022all the world is zommed and not just the ships\u0022 do you mean in map mode, or when you are flying a ship?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T18:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh, that\u0027s just the realities of scale. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Your ship is tiny compared to the planet.

The thing is, physical time warp makes thing unstable, you even get a warning once you go pas 2x. And when you open parachutes at that warp speed, they tend to rip off pronto. So that\u0027s where your problem comes from. Just unwarp before the parachute opens and you\u0027ll be fine. And for the second, as said above, it\u0027s a matter of scale. The zoom scale is exponential, so at the beginning, you don\u0027t notice the difference, but far enough, the planet will start getting smaller too because you\u0027re scrolling out faster.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexanderB","CreatedById":17544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T19:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWelcome to space!
