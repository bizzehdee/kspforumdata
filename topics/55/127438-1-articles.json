A button to set the timewarp back to 1x (aka cancel timewarp) with only one click/press.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the moment to cancel timewarp you have to press the decrease timewarp button multiple times before you reach 1x and it has happend more than once that I ended up with 2x timewarp and unable to control my vessel because I didn\u0027t spam the button often enough. As the max timewarp is depended on your altitude above the planet it is not intuitive on how often you have to press the decrease timewarp button until you reach 1x. Only solution is just spamming this button to the destruction of the keyboard to make sure all timewarp is canceled and your vessel is contralable again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA button that can be pressed once to cancel all timewarp (even if it would step trough all steps under the hood) would really improve reaction time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(If this has already been suggested, please forgive me, I really suck at searching forums.

AFAIK you can not time warp when throttled up, so the X key has no use while timewarping.
