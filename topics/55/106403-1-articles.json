Kerbals should be re-orderable at the astronaut complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; I use an absolute throttle control (on a Logitech flight stick), and it works fine except on launch, the throttle is always set to 50% instead of the current position of the throttle; I have to wiggle the throttle to get it to update. If an absolute throttle control is available, it should set the initial throttle from the position of the control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; The error margin on placing satellites in orbit is way too generous. As soon as I get anywhere near the right orbit, the last one accepted at maybe 5 degrees off. the guide disappears as the task completes and I\u0027m left unable to fine tune the orbit further, if I so choose. On hard difficulty, it should require a lot more accuracy, maybe a 0.001% error margin! A setting for this is requested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; This last one is more a personal opinion, but on hard difficulty the science income may be a little too reduced (at 60% science income.) Generally it makes science more of a grind, rather than hard. Of course this can be adjusted when starting a career, I just thought I\u0027d mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; With a level 1 tracking station, there is no way to switch control targets via the map. So it is an annoyance that you have to go ship\u0026gt;space center-\u0026gt;tracking-\u0026gt;ship, due to load times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5a\u0026gt; You can\u0027t go directly to the Tracking station from flight/map, you can\u0027t hide objects on the map like you can at the tracking center, and you can\u0027t set a body you\u0027re near as a navigation Target.
