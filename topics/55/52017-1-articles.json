Instead of having all the addons being jumbled together on one tech tree, we could just have each addon have it\u0027s own tab! The tabs would be at the top-left of the R\u0026amp;D screen. When you open a tab, an entirely new tech tree appears that is just for its designated addon. And each tech tree wouldn\u0027t be available for research until a certain node on the \u0022Main\u0022 tech tree is researched. If you\u0027ve ever played modded Minecraft, you could probably see that this is similar to each Minecraft mod having its own tab on the Creative Mode screen. I hope Squad seriously considers this idea, and please give feedback on how you think this could work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T21:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat?
