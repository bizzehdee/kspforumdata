We don\u0027t know a lot about what\u0027s coming, but its fair to guess there are a whole lot more experiments coming our way, and even now its a little tedious cycling through 6-8 different readout screens when we\u0027re collecting science. I\u0027d love if it were possible to condense all that onto one clean dialog box.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst off, I don\u0027t see a special reason why recovering any individual experiment at Kerbin couldn\u0027t yield 100% of its value. You could of course process that to get more, but I don\u0027t see a strong reason to incentivize multiple collect-and-return missions to the exact same site for diminishing returns. Just resolving that\u00A0helps clean up the UI quite a bit:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00221KNK9aC.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022236\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1KNK9aC.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022400\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe could further reduce science grind by making all samples non-transmittable (process only), and making all other data non-processable (transmit only). If we went down that road we\u00A0could combine all of our\u00A0current experiments as line items on one dialog box and place larger buttons at the bottom to store all, transmit all, or process all. If worthless, repeat experiments were automatically dumped you wouldn\u0027t even need a reset button:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00226sia1LQ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022298\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6sia1LQ.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022484\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EThere are surely a number of other less invasive ways to streamline things.\u00A0Just a thought on how to keep everything as easy to use as possible.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EPretty pumped about the new DLC!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-07T23:53:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2019 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-08T17:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh and the other big one to reduce clicking and grind would be a stock \u0022new science available\u0022 indicator, and honestly a \u0022Gather science\u0022 standard action group button up by the lights and brakes\u00A0wouldn\u0027t hurt either.
