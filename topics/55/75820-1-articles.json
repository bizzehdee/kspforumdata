That is, factors you can adjust when creating a new save. The factors should include (but not necessarily be limited to) the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Multiplier -\u003C/strong\u003E A basic multiplier that affects the value of science rewards. This would affect the total amount of science available on each celestial body, for each experiment type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Transmission Factors -\u003C/strong\u003E Adjustable factors to the maximum % science gain that can be attained from transmitting a given experiment type. I.e. some players might reduce this to 0% for all experiments- making transmission useless- or set it to 100% for all, so they never have to return experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECost Multiplier -\u003C/strong\u003E Works on Budgets. Would multiply by some number (could be less than 1 to REDUCE costs) the final cost of spacecraft built in the VAB/SPH. Could also be used for more \u0022realistic\u0022 costs when combined with a higher Fiscal Reward Multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFiscal Reward Multiplier -\u003C/strong\u003E Similar to Cost Multiplier, but scales rewards for completing contracts. This would be more an alternative for flavor, since the effect would be nearly the same. It might allow players to create a harder or easier \u0022Start\u0022, though, by making starting cash (I assume there must be such a thing- and any allowances provided for \u0022free\u0022 over time, if they come to exist) less or more valuable, when combined with a commensurate Cost Multiplier (for instance, cutting both costs and rewards by half would make the starting cash twice as valuable)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERocket Scale Factor -\u003C/strong\u003E Adjusts the relative size of rocket parts (using the Rescale Factor already on parts). Want a rocket that\u0027s realistic-size, or on the same 1/11th scale as Kerbin, instead of the default 64% scale? Go ahead! Affects difficulty by affecting the ease of finding suitable landing sites- and affects drag (larger objects have better ballistic coefficients) once a realistic aerodynamics model is implemented, or if running FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanet/System Scale Factor -\u003C/strong\u003E Adjusts the relative size of the planets and Kerbol system (including distances from the sun and orbital velocities) by the selected factor- with the currently used 1/11th scale being the default (for simplicity, 3-4 settings could be available: Default/Fun, Miniature/Easy, Kerbal-Scale/64%, Realistic). Probably the most significant way players could adjust the difficulty- and allows KSP to satisfy both casual gamers and realism freaks, without having to take sides like the devs currently do on the side of having a \u0022fun-sized\u0022 Kerbin and Kerbol system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EISP Scale Factor -\u003C/strong\u003E Adjusts ISP ratings of rocket engines, within a certain limited range- allowing players to uprate ISP by 5-10% for easier gameplay, or down-rate it by 5-10% for a level more appropriate to Apollo-Era technology (current ratings closely match modern-day technology). By preventing a more than a 5-10% tweak, the look and feel of KSP can still be maintained within relatively tight bounds...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuel Realism Toggle -\u003C/strong\u003E Switches the current stock fuels (assuming they are not replaced) with more realistic fuels- that is, Liquid H2 (LH2), Liquid Oxygen (LOX), Kerosene, etc. This would probably be a feature added later than the other difficulty factors, but would go a long way to satisfy realism nuts, without forcing the devs to take sides...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERe-Entry Heating Factor -\u003C/strong\u003E Increases or decreases the production of re-entry heat (once implemented) or part heat tolerance ratings by a certain %. Like ISP Scale, probably only within certain limited bounds- say 15-20% up or down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERocket Build Time Toggle -\u003C/strong\u003E Implements build-time for rockets, the default being \u0022Off\u0022. Probably not worth adding due to coding complexity except as a post-1.0 release (although it\u0027s already been implemented in some mods, so it can\u0027t be *THAT* hard to get right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that a difficulty system like this would go a long way towards making KSP appeal to a wider audience. It would allow more experienced players to turn up the difficulty (an in many cases also the realism- as with Planet/System Scale) to challenge themselves, while simultaneously allowing newer players to turn down the difficult while still learning. The realism-orientation of many of the difficulty factors would also allow realism nuts to set realistic values for the different facts, and be satisfied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know of \u003Cstrong\u003ENO OTHER\u003C/strong\u003E game that doesn\u0027t have at least some kind of difficult factor. Even other Indie games, like Faster Than Light, have at least an \u0022Easy\u0022 and a \u0022Hard\u0022 mode. As well as Sandbox games like SimCity (it affects your starting cash, Demand for growth, and the incidence of natural disasters, mainly) and the Civilization series. I think the devs ought to at least CONSIDER adding difficulty factors for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E I make no secret- I consider myself a \u0022realism nut\u0022, and would appreciate more of a challenge in KSP. That is, I would GREATLY like to see more realistic scale, aerodynamics, etc. in KSP, and would probably play with up-rated cost factors. But I don\u0027t actually PLAY with any of the realism mods because they have too many bugs (Real Solar System, I\u0027m looking at you- and your ground that Kerbals sink straight through), which could easily be resolved if the realism factors were designed into the stock game as a \u0022hard mode\u0022 in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-24T20:04:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2014 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-24T02:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is an unneeded thing.

Stock games should differ as little as possible in craft physics - if I have a stock game, and you have a stock game, and I send you a craft, it should work exactly the same for you as it did for me. IIRC, the specific reason that Squad doesn\u0027t want to do randomly generated solar systems is literally to keep the game experience unified - everyone knows about what it means to land on Eve, but everyone would *not* have a sense of your specific setup. That immediately implies zero variation on planet scale, because that would produce the exact same problem. The \u0022keep experience unified\u0022 actually applies for all scales (that should never, ever be changeable within stock), and also, IMO, to things like engine ISP. RealFuels shouldn\u0027t be in stock at all; in a game played with aliens in a solar system mildly based on our own, but with significant differences, there\u0027s literally no reason you should assume that the fuels are the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T04:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 04:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T04:41:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI personally think it is horrible that they will not have a built in mechjeb by 1.0.

I do however disagree with you on the claim the functionality of mechjeb does not need to be in stock. I think it SHOULD be in stock. I am an RC Pilot and I also have spent way too many hours doing the old MS Flight Sims set to 100% real settings, AND have flown real aircraft. That being said, i know the value of the information alone in mechjeb from TWR and DV to all the other basic information that Squad intentionally leaves OUT. NOT being told how much our vessel weighs in is just plain bad designing. NOT being told what our DV values are or our TWR values again, just plain bad design. Now, ugh I cannot believe I am going to do this...makes me feel dirty...BUT... IF we have say scaled difficulty factors, and lets say, they give us the options for perma kerbal death and destructive reentry heat and damage, NOT having automation will result in death after death after death after death and where pray tell is the fun in that? If you put up a science station into orbit and you go to land your experiments that you have spent, lets say 5 years \u0026lt;game time of course\u0026gt; doing and now you want to LAND that research, and you have the \u0022suggested\u0022 factors added in, and have set up the game to make re-entry 100% realistic and kerbal death 100% permanent. NOW, lets say, you do not have automation, and your station is in orbit halfway between kerbin and the mun. This makes for an exceedingly FAST orbital speed as you hit entry interface. Now, given no automation, and you crash through the atmosphere at 2-3km a second, how long before you go boom? Well, not long if you are ballistic, longer if you are an SSTO. Lets say you cant slow down, and you forgot to quicksave prior to returning to kerbin and you die in reentry for the want of automation. How does that help? it doesnt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou go to add in hard mode, you NEED automation, pure and simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T09:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUgh, this thread isn\u0027t about MechJeb or adding it to stock, let\u0027s talk about the OP\u0027s suggestions and leave that for another thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this where I post \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80928-I-don-t-want-realism-I-want-believability\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emy \u0027realism vs believability\u0027 post\u003C/a\u003E?

Most games use both simulative and abstract game mechanics, so in practice we call a game a simulator, if it uses far more simulative than abstract mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously a simulator can mean different things in other contexts, but those contexts are not relevant to the discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T08:32:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not really the definition you linked to and you miss the context in which I answer \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83967-Scalable-Difficulty-Factors?p=1231582\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1231582\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENorthstar\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what you mean by abstract but there is no scale for how abstract something is, and having a physics engine doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll be simulating real physics.

For examples of those games, you can go to Steam and see, which games are listed with tag \u0022Simulation\u0022. (The last time I went there, the first thing I saw was an ad for KSP.) This is probably the primary definition of a simulator, because it\u0027s the one most commonly used in the last couple of decades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn science and engineering, simulators are basically computational experiments. Because time is expensive, computers are slow, and memory is scarce, the usual goal is to make simulators as simple as possible, while still capturing the relevant phenomena. In some of my papers, I\u0027ve done experiments with simulated DNA. This basically means taking a real DNA sequence, duplicating it, and altering the sequences with random mutations that make some statistical properties of the collection similar to those of real DNA sequence collections. In one of my favorite papers from other fields, people investigated altruism and tolerance from an evolutionary perspective. In their simulation, xenophobic altruism and tolerant selfishness were viable combinations, while evolution kept the populations of tolerant altruists and selfish xenophobes to a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the above examples, the simulators were relatively simple programs that arguable captured relevant phenomena. They definitely didn\u0027t try to simulate the underlying processes as accurately as possible, which apparently is what simulators should do, according to your definition.

Nowadays even FPS game can simulate physics with relatively good realism just to have a fancy background (like waterfall and object falling).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I said KSP will \u0022never be a simulator\u0022, it\u0027s in the meaning that it is not meant to be more realist than fun. You have Simulator which have the intent to be as realistic as possible but simplify their interface to compensate the lack of a true cockpit/driving wheel/gearbox/pedal/MFD/force feedback/autopilot.

Its goal was not to make a Simulator like \u0022training simulator\u0022, it\u0027s to make a video game that deliberately simplify the less interesting aspect of rocket-science to make its fun more accessible.
