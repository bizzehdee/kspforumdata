My dog got tangled in the charger and got scared, and she ran and flung the laptop across the room. I went to Best Buy to get a new one, and I decided to talk to the head of the Geek Squad (group of people at our best buy who help with technology issues as their job.) I asked him why some games that run on Unity have horrible stability on their 64 bit versions. I also told him that Linux seems to work fine with both 32 bit and 64 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe says a possibility is that whoever made the coding may have coded the linux 64 bit correctly, but not for the windows/mac 64 bit version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps squad or the makers of the Unity engine could take a look at the Linux 64 bit code, then look at the windows or mac 64 bit code.
