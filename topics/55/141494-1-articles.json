We send probes to planets, and try to return as much science as possible. But what do we get from it? Just some points, which we can convert into money. There is no fun in that. Science should bring knowledge don\u0027t you think? Right now our ultimate goal in science/career mode is to get every possible experiment from every available biome on every celestial body. That is ok, that is fun, that is challenging, but still nothing comes out of it. Instead, I would like to have some feedback from the game, something I can learn from doing science. So, here is my suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would be good to have in-game Wikipedia about the world kerbals live in. But in the beginning, there is almost nothing inside it. But you can open new information about the universe as you do flight, experiments, science and so on. For instance, you got a contract to know what Minmus is, and in the Wiki there is only something like - \u0027Minmus is a little mint ball in the sky\u0027. So you fly there, and do experiments, once you bring them back, the wiki starts to fill with new information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that now we have something like this in the science archives, but it rather not organized and just gives you an idea where and what you did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T18:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. I think telescopes and cameras could be great for this. You could observe distant stars, nebulae, clusters and galaxies while getting info about how far they are and what they consist of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad_Scientist","CreatedById":145581,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-10T20:17:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYear, your right. Like making your own observations which are going to your \u0022journal\u0022 of research. I think Squad is going into some direction close to what I like - for example, new milestones. They are just great, although I still could not find the way to see the ones I\u0027ve already done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
