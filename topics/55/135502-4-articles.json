I think Squad has said they don\u0027t like how many people see KSP as merely a zany rocket disaster simulator. Adding a d/v display would go a long way towards helping people do more serious engineering, if they want to, without getting in the way of inefficient seat-of-the-space-pants designs (presumably you could turn off the d/v display if you don\u0027t like it). So why is this still a mod-only thing? It wouldn\u0027t be \u003Cem\u003Etrivial\u003C/em\u003E to implement, because nothing that requires programming is ever trivial, but it would be less complex than most of the other things they\u0027ve added to the game over the years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTWR would also be nice to have, though it\u0027s not quite as important. Most of the engines are so powerful that it\u0027s rarely an issue unless you\u0027re launching from Eve or trying to be perfectly efficient. A d/v map isn\u0027t really necessary, since you can figure that out by trial-and-error, and it doesn\u0027t change when you build a new ship. (Transfer d/v can be determined by fiddling with maneuver nodes. D/v to orbit is roughly the low orbit speed, somewhat more if there\u0027s an atmosphere; so once you\u0027ve reached orbit and made that realization, you can do it more efficiently the next time.) But the d/v of your vessel is the fuel of orbital maneuvers, and it\u0027s weird to not have a fuel gauge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T00:50:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222486268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022135502\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221459465293\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe, but to me when you\u0027re doing simple rockets having a dV calculator isn\u0027t really something you need.

I tend to think you could leave the calculator locked until you upgrade the VAB and SHP to tier 2, but once you have it should be multi-stage.

Maybe I should try writing my own dv plugin...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-01T21:45:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2016 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FunnyBunny14\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-02T20:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe, to keep the try\u0026amp;error approach, have a readout for the dV spent in actual flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John JACK","CreatedById":161340,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T02:12:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello everyone! Played since .22, singed in just now to add my 5\u003Cbig\u003E\u20AA.\u003C/big\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe now have article about \u0022deltavee\u0022 in KSPedia. There is explained that is a delta of velocity and mentioned some \u003Cem\u003Eequation\u003C/em\u003E. Also we had dV value in maneuver nodes since forever. And the game is sorely lacking of 1. explanation of the \u0022deltavee\u0022 stuff and 2. \u003Cu\u003Esimple\u003C/u\u003E display.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn KSPedia there must be a page telling that delta V is and how it\u0027s calculated. Basically, amount of velocity that vessel can gain by burning all the fuel depends on proportion of fuel mass to craft mass, and on engine ISP. Less basically, just spell Tsiolkovski\u0027s equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple display may be not so simple to program, that\u0027s absolutely and undoubtable correct. Thought considering all and every possibility of craft being Kerbal is not necessary. Stock delta V readout is most valuable to new players, early in Career mode, when resource transfer, docking and even fuel lines are not yet available.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst readout can just take single-stage craft wet mass, dry mass, engine ISP, The Equation and display number.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext stock staging mechanic can be accounted. Game knows parts are still attached to rocket at any given stage, what engines are burning and how much fuel they have access to. Engines have ISP and fuel has mass and we have The Equation, so we can calculate delta V for all stages.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRight, there are many ways to kerbal it. But \u003Cu\u003Ehere\u003C/u\u003E comes \u0022trial and error\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, delta V can be pretty easy calculated manually in VAB/SPH. I do that for estimating monoprop thrusters dV, because KER do not. Detach anything that would be staged, Engineer Report shows wet mass. Empty all relevant tanks \u2014 Engineer Report shows dry mass. Look in parts list for ISP. Then get your slide rule, ask someone for right value of \u0022g\u0022, multiply, add all stages, repeat all above when change any part. Implementing \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E in code really should be not that hard, but will spare me couple of minutes some hundred times. And when player overgrows simple rockets, they always can install a mod, make a spreadsheet, or make staging not to mess with calculations. But to new player even simplest dV readout will be a great help in understanding rocket science!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTWR readout by stages or just at launch will be easier \u2014 just add all lower stage engines thrust and divide it by gross mass. But IMO it\u0027s much less necessary than dV, because adding all engines together is simple, and lack of thrust is amended by MOAR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlackboard with cartoon rocket going to space or not going to space may seem simple, but really is not. You need not to calculate dV first, but consider all stages thrust, aero, poor piloting, and after all that compare result with some empirical value to get \u003Cspan\u003Ego, no go, or maybe go.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EDelta V display is absolutely not about trial and error. It\u0027s about noob-friendly, to learn difference between bad and good rockets. And it\u0027s about quality of life for not-so-noobs, that can \u003C/span\u003Ecount all fuel tanks and get a slide rule, but why should they when it can be done by computer in millisecond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, SQUAD, please, add dV readout in stock. No need to make it correct for every situation, a simple display for simple staging is good. That will make game easier where it can be easier, and leave more player time to actually have fun making rockets and flying them where they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T13:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk if calculating DV is so easy give me the pseudo code that can calculate the DV of a craft with x stages y engines and z tanks. \u00A0 Don\u0027t forget to account for thurst limiter and any engine can be used for any stage or stages\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-03T13:36:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said before, this has already been done successfully\u00A0at least 3 times in different open-source mods, so no need to start this from scratch again.
