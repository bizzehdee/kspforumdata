Unfortunately, they don\u0027t put out much heat and light. Any planet orbiting close enough to be habitable would also likely become tidally locked (unless it was itself orbiting a bigger planet, such as a gas giant).\n\nA habitable tidally locked world would need to be close enough to it\u0027s parent star to make the daylight side inhospitably hot. If the daylight side were temperate, the night side would be so cold as to become a trap that would freeze out the planet\u0027s atmosphere. In either case, space based sunshades and mirrors could be used to improve the habitability of such a planet."},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T11:50:00Z","Content":"And if none of the above things turned out to be so, it sat at some perfect goldilocks zone that you didn\u0027t freeze out the atmosphere or burn it off, and the planet had a dynamo that was still spinning somehow or generating a magnetic field another way so the stability of the atmosphere staying in place wasn\u0027t an issue.\n\nThe winds on that planet would be utterly terrifying and you\u0027d want no part of it.

With enough greenhouse gas like CO2, it\u0027s possible the night side will not be a frozen wasteland - case in point, Venus is a pretty darn slow rotator, yet its night side and day side are essentially the same temp at the surface.
