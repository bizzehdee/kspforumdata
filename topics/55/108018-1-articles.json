But at that point it should have been KSP .95 \u0022Coming in hot!\u0022.\n\nWhy? All the new systems you added were never subjected to a proper public beta. Thus your untested new features required 1.0.1, 1.0.2, and very likely will get 1.0.3. This is a result of the decision making, and is by no means the QA/EXP teams fault. Again, this not the testers faults. The last release should not have tons of brand new content.\n\nYes I also understand that many games have patches and bugfixes post 1.0. The point is it was not ready for that.\n\nThis most recent update should have been your Apollo 10. A dress rehearsal before the real deal. Then once everything has been assessed, tested, polished, balanced and bugfixed, then you can do your Apollo 11.\n\nBut more than a few view this as more of an Apollo 13. Sure you fixed/are fixing it, and everyone will make it home safe eventually, but what was supposed to be a crowning achievement has been tarnished.\n\nKSP is still fun, we love the game, and everyone here will still play it, but you cant take back what I view as a bungled 1.0 launch.\n\nJust wanted to say my piece on this, goodnight all."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T06:01:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But more than a few view this as more of an Apollo 13.\n\nNo, Apollo 13 was a minor defect that resulted in a disaster that nobody could have predicted. \n\nI was watching a documentary last night on the US space program and I couldn\u0027t help but think this is more like the Challenger disaster where you had many people reporting a problem and issues warnings that where ignored by the people in charge who where more concerned with deadlines and budgets than with stopping and listening to what people where saying. \n\nI\u0027d say more, I was actually just about to start a thread just like this, but I\u0027ve said what I wanted to say many times in the other thread and I\u0027m burning out on this so I will just say besides replacing the apollo 13 analogy with challenger, I agree with everything r4ptor said."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T06:03:53Z","Content":"What is really so \u0022bungled\u0022 about it?

This was fatal to the missions. \n\nParachutes where invincible and could be opened at any speed or temperature and even in their partially deployed state causes craft to almost instantly slow at even very high altitudes\\* This is contrary to how they worked in some previous version where they would be torn from the pods if deployed at too high of speeds.\n\nAtmosphere was very thin, allowing jets to hit mach speeds before the end of the runway and shortly after reach speeds so high they burned up and exploded. It should be noted that some airplane flyers thought this was a improvement, but this caused:\n\nPods that did not deploy parachutes at high altitudes would not slow to terminal velocity before hitting the ground on most descents and would either burn up or still be traveling at very high speeds at low altitude and could only be saved by deploying parachutes at completely unrealistic speeds.\n\nNone of these are what I would call bugs but rather fairly egregious gameplay failures given that every one of them could be (and was) discovered on a players very first suborbital flight. They all also represent a radical departure from .90, which we where told was the game with all major parts in place.\n\nHeating:\n\n1.0 introduced heat as a new component to be managed. In theory this was a good thing but it was poorly implemented. \n\nThe LV-N, the most important engine in the game once players begin to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI overheated very rapidly with most builds and still fairly rapidly even when designed around. If this was just one random engine this wouldn\u0027t have been a big deal but as the only practical engine for interplanetary flight in the game this suddenly made the Kerbol system exploration very tedious as you now had to make all your transfer burns in very short bursts to avoid overheating. This was both unrealistic and un-fun. (Some people have tried to say that the game balances realism and fun and that is why everybody can\u0027t be happy but making things BOTH unrealistic and not fun is not the solution, if something is not fun it should be at least be realistic and vise versa) Unlike many other parts of KSP, this was not a challenge as there was no way to design around it as there are no heat management parts (unlike the mods with parts that need cooling) It was simply a big nerf back to the stone age. \n\nThe ISRU mining system overheated very quickly, reducing its yield to almost zero. This was unrealistic and useless as a no matter the heat level a player could simply warp speed through the extraction, making the heat system irrelevant as anything but an irritation, much like the re-entry model.\n\nNumerous bugs and crashes which I will not mention as those are not really the heart of the matter except to say that gamers used to expect more out of a 1.0 release. My game does at least load much faster which makes recovering from a crash less of a chore than it used to be....so yay?\n\n1.02 brought some fixes but also some new problems. \n\nLV-N\u0027s no longer overheat if properly mounted, but they only consume liquid fuel and so can now only be practically used with spaceplane fuel tanks, severely limiting the design freedom we once had, this is very odd because again, these are an extremely important engine in the game and should have had a whole new array of tank parts to go with them now that the way the work has changed. \n\nMining heat has been completely removed....yay? or not depending on how you feel. One hand a problem is gone, on another a potentially interesting challenge was removed. \n\nThe air is now thick enough for a realistic re-entry, and parachutes are destroyed by high speeds and heat...but, re-entry heating is such that now you don\u0027t need a heats shield or to really every worry about most parts overheating on re-enty as only a few small parts are really effected by heat, so again, what could have been an interesting mechanic was nerfed to oblivion instead of actually being fixed. As with everything else, this is something that careful testing should have been able to balance but which it seems was just thrown in as an emergency fix to a problem that shouldn\u0027t ever have existed. \n\nThe following are cosmetic problems but which seem to be widely disliked by most players and have yet to be fixed or even addressed. \n\nFairings explode in a confetti like cloud of parts that is unattractive and unrealistic. \n\nFunctional Space planes, I am told, now look like hotdogs. (I don\u0027t personally care but some people are really upset about it) \n\nI\u0027m sure their are other problems, and there are countless bugs, but these are the big gameplay decisions that it seems where never tested.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This. 1.0.x is out, for good and for bad, time to move on.\n\nThats what we are trying to avoid. Moving on from a broken game would mean moving to a different game. We still want to play Kerbal, we just want to play the *real* Kerbal and not this broken beta thing we have right now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T06:53:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 06:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aerindel**"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T06:53:02Z","Content":"Oh good.

Not sure what caused that, but I\u0027m not especially pleased by it, it was fatal. Was mucking around with a fairing the night before, and the craft started nullref\u0027ing magically, causing lots of lag and nearly destroying that craft file. Later ran into an issue where parts couldn\u0027t be added or removed from a craft at all. Had one craft just randomly explode on the launchpad (re-launching the same craft did not result in an explosion the second time either). The 1.0 issues with parachutes and heat-shielded craft not re-entering correctly was pretty embarrassing, especially as DRE and FAR had already dealt with problems like that historically and come up with decent solutions. Still not enjoying how you can\u0027t make maneuver nodes without a quickload from time to time, or the fact that the Mun overrides Minmus intercepts even when the Mun intercept happens afterwards, or the fact that the timewarp downshift is broken.

It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s also the biggest update to the game we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve ever done, and contains many new and updated features, plus improvements to just about every game system, which we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re sure will appeal to both newcomers and seasoned veterans.

No, that doesn\u0027t mean there won\u0027t be more bug fixes but it means that fundamentally, this is what they want us to have. \n\nSo I ask you now, does anyone here feel that Kerbal is fundamentally finished? That it is a complete game that only needs some bug fixes?\n\nI don\u0027t think many do. I think that most people feel this is just another pre-release update. The difference between the camps seem to be wether that bothers people or not. Personally, when the Devs say something is done that means they are planing on walking away. Maybe not all at once but it means its basically over, they are happy, fix a few bugs and move on, and if this is where kerbal ends I find that really disappointing especially when just another month or so of community wide testing could probably fix all the gameplay issues.
