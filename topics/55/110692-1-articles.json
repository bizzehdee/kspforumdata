Either have some way of telling MM where your tech tree icons are so that it can change their location in GameDatabase ([like so](https://github.com/DMagic1/Orbital-Science/blob/master/Source/DMConfigLoader.cs#L316-L327)), which I borrowed from Waypoint Manager), or distribute a plugin that does the same thing."}]}
