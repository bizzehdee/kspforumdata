I\u0027ve been pondering this for a few days, so I\u0027m going to outline a few thoughts I think could make the gameplay way more fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst - TL;DR = Make planet stats discoverable, give sensors a purpose, probes unlock manned missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) First and foremost, probes should be an entry level component along with the four main science parts and the single solar panel. The driving force being a space program is the desire to learn more detailed information about distant worlds. It\u0027s arguable that Kerbal scientists would have need for these types of sensors for testing their parts, so in theory, the space program has access to that level of tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) With all the science sensors available, you can now hide the planet/moon stats such as mass, atmosphere height, surface gravity with the \u003Cstrong\u003EFog of Jeb.\u003C/strong\u003E I feel this could create a scenario where probes must conduct a fly-by to collect x,y and z \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ebefore\u003C/span\u003E you can send manned missions. NASA sent seven probes (two did crash...) with the Surveyor program before sending the Apollo missions (remember, Apollo 8 only went into orbit and Apollo 10 got to within 8km of the surface, but didn\u0027t land). While I don\u0027t want to stress such detailed realism, I think probe landings would be a nice way to convey a sense of legacy for the gamer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) So how would discoverable stats appear in-game? Let\u0027s imagine you are launching a probe to Minmus for the first time. You conduct your transfer burn and see your flight path enter the SoI for Minmus. The flight engineers at KSC have a rough estimate for the mass but can\u0027t predict your flight path with any certainty. So you cross into the SoI and from your ship you see a \u0027projected trajectory\u0027. Think hurricane path projections, but in three dimensions. Specifically, it would be a cone with a small angle and the radius of the cone increases, giving you a circular projected area where you would leave the SoI. You would exit the SoI and re-enter Kerbin\u0027s SoI, but your exact position would be unknown since the guys at KSC couldn\u0027t plot an exact flight path. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Giving each sensor a reason for being there other than \u0027doing science\u0027 would make their existence crucial to gameplay. A quick breakdown:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGravity sensor\u003C/span\u003E - Flight paths and mass - Gives the cone of projected flight path\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAccelerometer\u003C/span\u003E - Surface gravity and radius - Discover \u0027orbit hazards\u0027 like Mascons on the real Moon (they mess up orbits, could be fun)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EBarometer\u003C/span\u003E - Atmospheric structure and pressure - Gives data on re-entry angles/speeds if that became a game mechanic (which would be wicked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThermometer\u003C/span\u003E - Temperature and atmospheric content - Adjusts life-support systems, efficiency of coolant systems, EVA approval from KSC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAltimeter\u003C/span\u003E - I would love to see this become a core science component since all stock pods come equipped with a radar altimeter in the cockpit. The tech exists within the game world, so I don\u0027t think its a far stretch. SCANsat has been a lot of fun, especially the biomes mapping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) This last part I imagine would be hard to implement, but I think it would be fun if KSC \u0027highly recommended\u0027 probes before manned. To keep it simple and require only two successful probe missions. First, fly-by probes could unlock manned orbit and second, soft-landing probes unlock manned landing. Perhaps the Kraken could guard the doors, so to speak...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Finally, probes should give the engineers at KSC a \u0027rough estimate\u0027 of the values and give a small value of science while manned missions provide a greater accuracy of measurement and have a high science value. For this, the best I could come up with would be that probes give erratic/large-error measurements for surface speed, altitude, pressure etc. I think it would be dead funny if your first probe landing became an experiment in lithobraking (but still yielded data required to unlock manned before telemetry was lost) because the probe sensors weren\u0027t sensitive enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t troll the forums, but I know that the role-playing aspect of having your very own space program. Progression of knowledge of the universe gives a player a sense of skill building and mastery of abilities. I wish I could sit down with the devs for a left-handed cigarette and ask them about their plans for astronaut stats/ranks/medals. I would love a system of creating programs similar to Mercury, Gemini and Apollo (plus a mission patch creator!) I hope I\u0027m not the only one who would love to see more RPG elements added to the Kerbals themselves, but I do like that quote that\u0027s been floating around \u0022If you want to make your Kerbal go poo, go play the Sims.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS - Radius = sqrt( (G x Mass)/g ) so between the gravity sensor and accelerometer, you could calculate the average radius. A final thought, I know many people find the density of the Kerbal Universe to be preposterous, so why not have G change. Interestingly, fundamental constants (i.e. proton and electron mass) could change by 4% and still function in the Universe we known.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JiWint","CreatedById":78150,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-04T09:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnknown flight paths?
