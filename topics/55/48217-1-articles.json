You can see what you haven\u0027t unlocked and can thereby choose where to spend your acquired points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this is a fairly obvious way to implement such a feature, I worry that it turns \u0022science\u0022 into \u0022economics\u0022. Players will be motivated to find the most efficient way to earn science points quickly, regardless of what that way entails. If anyone has ever played an MMO (I confess I played WoW for a few months) you\u0027ll know the drill: find some mechanism that quickly accrues XP, and then farm the ever-loving !%\u0026amp;@ out of that. It\u0027s not much fun, but it gets you \u0022maxxed out\u0022 rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if, perhaps, a more directed approach would be more interesting and rewarding for players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If I launch a jet and manage to fly it all the way around kerbin, I should learn something about making jet engines efficient, and unlock technology that reflects this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If I manage to take a really heavy plane up to 10,000m, I should learn something about making better wings by doing so. Perhaps this makes all wings slightly stronger, or have slightly more lift, or unlocks a new wing entirely, thus making it easier for me to do the same thing next time, or letting me build an *even bigger* plane next time if I want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If I get a rocket into orbit, I should learn something about how rockets work in a vacuum (and perhaps boost vacuum ISP for all rockets)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it stands it appears as though I could, say, launch a mission to Duna, earn some generic science currency, then come back and spend it on air intakes - which makes very little sense. Exploitation of the currency mechanics is also a larger concern when trying to use generic \u0022points\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess this is both a suggestion and discussion. My suggestion being: make science more directed. The game already tracks certain \u0022achievements\u0022 in the log, and I\u0027m sure it wouldn\u0027t be too hard to come up with others, like I have above, that give a sensible, logical reward for achieving certain milestones, which would also encourage players to explore the game and reward them for doing so.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T14:20:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T14:40:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree.

In that proposal, parts are still unlocked with Science, and are just improved with Engineering points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s another way to approach an Engineering system, though: What if all parts are unlocked and improved by Engineering Experience Points (EEP) which can only be gained by launching craft? EEP aren\u0027t applied to a generic Engineering slush fund, but to specific parts. The tech tree is basically the parts list: every node unlocks 1 or more parts, and that node can only be unlocked by using the parts in the node(s) that precede it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a lot of jets?

So I think Science should be directly tied to the finances of your space program: maybe Science \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E money, directly, one-to-one. You don\u0027t keep \u0022Science points\u0022 in a generic slush fund to unlock chunky nodes, you are paid for science as it comes in. The diminishing returns would still be there - you have to keep going further afield to generate enough science to keep your space program funded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, Kerbal Congress could give you missions and funding in advance based on doing science in specific places - maybe some Kerbal gives a speech about going to the moon in this decade, and if you accept that mission you immediately get a million KerBucks and a mandate to do at least 1,000 points worth of Mun-based science before a certain date. Maybe until that date, Mun-based science is worth double the Kerbucks.

It takes man-months of dev work and debugging time. Changing the order and content of tech tree nodes is easy. It takes man-hours using a text editor. There is no appreciable difference in terms of dev time required to produce a tech tree like we will see in 0.22, and a \u0022flat\u0022 tech tree like you propose.
