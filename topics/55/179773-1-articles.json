One turn would equate to a X amount of ingame/real time and would only allow a limited amount of launches. Both players would be playing in a possibly modified career and would gain points for doing missions with more difficult missions such as interplanetary missions giving more points. The players would be competing to reach a certain threshold of points or to gain the most points in a X amount of ingame time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe host would be able to set the settings like how many points are required for victory, how long the game lasts and etc. Because ksp is a slow game the game could possibly be played over several real days\u00A0(the amount could be set by the host)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA possible problem i thought of is that doing turns over several days might be is that players might stall their turns resulting in anger and frustation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-13T22:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMultiplayer KSP is very, very unlikely, but this would be a fun mode.
