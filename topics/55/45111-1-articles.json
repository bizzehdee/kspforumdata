When you get busy moving things around and trying to see from different points of view or move the whole build up or down to attach something, the build ends up getting moved off center of the \u0022Circle\u0022 map on the floor. I spend much time trying to get them moved back. A keyboard command to automatically center the build in the target circle would go a long way. Not a priority, more a nuisance removal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LeadMagnet","CreatedById":43256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T13:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup...this was suggested a month or so ago.
