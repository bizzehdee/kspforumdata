Have them peppered around every 1/2 kilometer or so.. have a small \u0022arm\u0022 system that would allow you to grapple them with a rover and return them to your ship to be placed in a bin to take home for some bonus science points. Then you would have a reason to go exploring with your rover! Would greatly enhance rover gameplay!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Update: Decided to try to make a mod that does this...

I think they were discussing stuff like that but I\u0027m not up on what they are doing. It would be nice. If they add enough stuff to the game I want to go for a big exploration ship with lots of drone/rover abilities to aid in various functions around the SS.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-02T04:45:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2015 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T15:30:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea... though they would need to fix rover wheels first so we can do things like drive uphill and not flip when we brake. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
