One thing I don\u0027t like about mods is that, since they\u0027re made by different people who envision the game differently, they can change the nature of any given challenge. Some can make a challenge easier, like a powerful \u0022future technology\u0022 engine mod with high thrust and Isp. Some can make it harder , like DRE.

Several of the mods that have been implemented ended up lackluster by comparison. There is however a difference in mods. Plugins and Parts. The part mods that have been implemented usually go off without any issues at all, because they are identical, so I\u0027m not going to discuss them. Plugins are another story. Some have been successful implementations (Fineprint), others were less than stellar implementations (Enhanced NavBall), and others were less well received and have virtually destroyed the original mod so we had no choice (Toolbar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I agree that sometimes Squads vision of what a mod functionality should be differs from ours, there are very few of them that do not work once Squad implements it. Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar lost out because once the native one was added, many mod developers dropped support for it (not all of them, it still exists with much more limited usability now). That isn\u0027t Squad\u0027s fault, it\u0027s the developers that didn\u0027t want to support both. Fineprint was good enough it didn\u0027t need to be continued.
