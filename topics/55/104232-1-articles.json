Just to point out how hard texture streaming really is, [this mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73236-WIP-Loading-textures-only-as-required) finally achieves it... by using low level programming and a wrapper to bypass the limitations of C# and Unity.\n\nExpecting SQUAD to fix REAL bugs instead of \u0022feature suggestion bugs\u0022 or \u0022change something to appease me bugs\u0022 should, of course, be the true priority... but rather, it seems people are more focused on how SQUAD should be putting x mod into the game.\n\n[A poll of fun!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/poll.php?pollid=1250\u0026do=showresults)\n\nLet\u0027s just point at this for a second, it is pretty definitive that 40% of the people who voted did NOT want KAS or FAR/NEAR to become stock (remember, multiple choice poll). Living in \u0022the real world\u0022 instead of an imaginary \u0022majority rules\u0022 society, burning 40% of your customers is a horrible business move. [Not commending SQUAD for implementing FAR anyways, though I think the dev notes indicated that they would be providing sliders to adjust difficulty].\n\nThe ONE THING people agree on is bug fixing and optimizations... things that mostly only SQUAD is capable of... but then we have other things people \u0022want\u0022 to be pushed upstream despite a mod existing to fill that functionality... and **not EVERYONE wants that feature added in.**\n\nI complained in the past about the broken nature that the small universe had on the game... and even came to agree that the small universe was better after making test changes to see how it would change. But then came Real Solar System, **should we take how successful one mod is as an indication of what EVERY player wants?** How about how much flack people gave BEFORE the mod about adjusting the universe to meet the standards? Despite people occasionally talking about it, it would have seemed that releasing the mod would have resulted in hostility or shunning, not the acceptance it has today. **Even things people SAY they don\u0027t want... they sometimes do.**\n\nNot even Kerbal Alarm Clock is 100% wanted! And the thing is, for the people who use it... Kerbal Alarm Clock WORKS! \n\nWhat I\u0027m getting at is; people are very fixated on trying to push mods that THEY like upstream; **and are apt to complain about what SQUAD implementing not being as good as the mod they copied.**\n\nLet\u0027s take a look at the iPhone 1 (mostly the marketing). On a whole, the iPhone 1 WAS the most useless piece of junk you could possibly buy... except \u0022there\u0027s an app for that\u0022. The iPhone 1 NEVER marketed itself as a complete system, it has promises of features, good directions here and there... but utterly reliant on third party markets to fix the device into a workable fashion... and THEN reliant on secure APIs (rooting) to gain further features on the device. But how many people who bought the iPhone 1 threw it away because \u0022I have to download third party software to make it do what I want\u0022.\n\nRelying on \u0022apps\u0022 has become so transparent in our society that people even talk about how they cannot afford to change brands due to all the apps being locked to their current cellphone brand. \n\nWhat is wrong with \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022? Why MUST we push it upstream and force everyone to have it rather than have the choice ourselves?\n\nIf anything, SQUAD should only add in enough for mods to take over and create NEW things that people will claim NEEDS to be in the core game; improve the API, give us easier access to things we probably shouldn\u0027t be messing with. The imaginations of modders is infinite! It hardly does justice to only point at mods with high downloads as there are many mods that lay relatively undiscovered or forgotten. And mods can be modded, everyone has their own ideas of how things should be done; changing how a mod works by modifying the source is easier than breaking into APIs and guess and check to see if what you did did anything productive."},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T04:55:17Z","Content":"KSP is like pizza, everyone likes it, but with different toppings.\n\nI agree with you mostly. There is more than a basic framework that needs to be in the stock game though. Just the same way that every pizza has the crust, sauce, and cheese. Exactly what it needs to be a base pizza is up to debate but I think Squad has it about right.\n\nMy two cents."},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:06:28Z","Content":"Stock player here (and I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not alone). One of the main ways that I personally enjoy video games, in general, is by overcoming challenges (not like the KSP challenge forum, but I mean the challenges the developer puts in the game). One thing I don\u0027t like about mods is that, since they\u0027re made by different people who envision the game differently, they can change the nature of any given challenge. Some can make a challenge easier, like a powerful \u0022future technology\u0022 engine mod with high thrust and Isp. Some can make it harder , like DRE. Some change the challenge so it\u0027s an apples-to-oranges comparison with the original -- FAR/NEAR can do this.\n\nI just don\u0027t get that same dopamine rush when I overcome a challenge with the help of a mod that makes it easier or different. Hm.. how can I best describe it... it\u0027d be like bowling over 200 in bumper bowling. Not the same as 200 in regular bowling with open gutters.\n\nHere are some additional reasons I play without mods:\n\n- They vary in quality tremendously. While some are clearly made by experienced programmers, others look like they were made by someone with a passing interest. Mods tend not to be play-tested by professionals and so it\u0027s hard to find those gems amongst a sea of, to put it bluntly, utter junk.\n- Modders don\u0027t have access to the core game code. They sometimes have to turn to inelegant hacks to get their stuff to work, the end result being something that is buggy, or looks ugly, has a less than stellar interface, or all of the above.\n- Even very popular and successful mods (DRE is a good example) are abandoned and picked up by new modders. Often times this happens because the original modder no longer has time, or because they lost interest in the game and have moved on to something else. The transition isn\u0027t usually proactive -- it happens only when the original modder isn\u0027t seen for months and months and people start to notice the extended absence of updates.\n- Mods can make your game less stable.\n- Some mod combinations conflict with each other, because you can\u0027t anticipate what other modders are going to do and coordinate with them, whereas the official developer has an exclusive team that works together.\n\nSo as I\u0027m sure you can imagine, I\u0027m happy that most game developers focus on completing their vision and narrative for their game, instead of just giving the community the tools and effectively having them build the content for them (unless that was the actual goal of the game to begin with.)"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:15:16Z","Content":"The thing is, that mods make the game behave in unexpected ways occasionally (because modders don\u0027t have access to the core code, as mentioned above).\n\nI get what you are saying, and for the most part I agree with you. Mods are certainly not a bad thing.\n\nMy greatest wish would be to have all of my mods become stock, but I fully appreciate they won\u0027t be, because not everyone has the same taste as me. \n\nSpeaking from a developers point of view, you can\u0027t please everyone... the best thing to do (IMO) is stick to your vision, and do what YOU feel is best for the game. Of course you should listen to your players, but honestly, sometimes the vocal minority is just that. (there came a point, where it seemed like every single thread got hijacked onto implementing FAR for some reason)"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:34:16Z","Content":"In my opinion there are some elements that mods implement that should be implemented, and for good reasons. \n\nAs an example, KAC, which has a very useful feature - warp to maneuver node. I can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve missed maneuver nodes due to warping through them, because I don\u0027t want to wait minutes\\hours\\days for the ship to arrive there. The rest of KAC is icing, like the transfer windows. Harvester has recognized the need for this warp to node function, which is why it will be in 1.0.\n\nAlso, I comparing KSP to the iPhone 1 is kind of like comparing apples to oranges. The iPhone is hardware, designed to make phone calls. If it couldn\u0027t do that, I doubt anyone would have bought it. \n\nKSP is software, designed to run on hardware. It\u0027s job is to simulate(?) building and launching rockets, landing on other planets. It must for that reason have the minimal features to do that, without annoying users."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T05:50:22Z","Content":"Keep in mind that it had been said for a VERY long time that the current aerodynamics were a placeholder. Regardless of FAR and NEAR, this one was coming. I think reentry heating may fall under that same category, regardless of DRE.\n\nHowever I do agree with you. Several of the mods that have been implemented ended up lackluster by comparison. There is however a difference in mods. Plugins and Parts. The part mods that have been implemented usually go off without any issues at all, because they are identical, so I\u0027m not going to discuss them. Plugins are another story. Some have been successful implementations (Fineprint), others were less than stellar implementations (Enhanced NavBall), and others were less well received and have virtually destroyed the original mod so we had no choice (Toolbar).\n\nWhile I agree that sometimes Squads vision of what a mod functionality should be differs from ours, there are very few of them that do not work once Squad implements it. Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar lost out because once the native one was added, many mod developers dropped support for it (not all of them, it still exists with much more limited usability now). That isn\u0027t Squad\u0027s fault, it\u0027s the developers that didn\u0027t want to support both. Fineprint was good enough it didn\u0027t need to be continued. Enhanced NavBall still works just fine, I use it. As for the ones being implemented now FAR, Procedural Fairings, and Karbonite will not be affected by this. Kethane seems to be dead regardless, I still hope not, but it isn\u0027t looking good. We have yet to see what role the Deadly Reentry mod will fill post 1.0.\n\nAs for \u0022pushing\u0022 mods to be upstream, the poll you linked was just in good fun. Most of the people treated it as a \u0022What is your favorite mod poll\u0022. You shouldn\u0027t be reading too much into that. There are some mods, however, that I would venture a guess most players think should be in stock, but those are usually simplistic ones that just make life easier. SelectRoot for example. Have you heard any complaints about the Root Gizmo? I haven\u0027t. There are other simple mods like this out there that should be implemented I think. For starters, Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix modules. It would be nice if Squad would just fix those bugs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T06:00:35Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 06:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T06:05:11Z","Content":"A very well-thought-out post, Fel.

The mk1 landercan says in the description that it cannot possibly survive reentry. That it can means that according to nothing but KSP itself, reentry heating is a \u0022must have,\u0022 and past that, either the mk1 landercan must be incapable of reentry, or the description changed. Same with reasonable aero---from the start I added nosecones, and never built crazy looking rockets, I made rockets that looked as much as possible like rockets.

In general, the play modes should be well thought out, in other words, or just cut them loose, and let the modders have at it (as long as they provide the ability to mod those parts).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T15:28:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 03:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T16:01:25Z","Content":"I would like to point out that Squad advertises KSP as a rocket builder, space exploration, and space agency management game.

Were they not, you\u0027d wiki the best location, then always land there, if you were of a mind to do that (no need to scan or otherwise locate the resources). I\u0027d personally think that both science and career modes would benefit from exactly THIS kind of random with respect to \u0022science.\u0022 In other words instead of generic \u0022science from orbit,\u0022 you might need to scan a world a certain amount. Then perhaps most of the \u0022biomes\u0022 (terrible word choice by Squad, as almost all are lifeless) could in fact be randomized in some fashion---or made less important. Say instead of X \u0022biomes\u0022 on the Mun, each of which gives you 120 science for a sample return, they only give you a small fraction of that amount of science. Then add a new feature, \u0022unique\u0022 or \u0022important\u0022 geology that can be scanned for, but is random. You\u0027d then locate those regions via photo-mapping (scanning), then land and EVA/collect for the higher points we think of for each \u0022biome\u0022 now. Might create some novel situations where you have to land places that you might not otherwise go if you want the big science payoff."}]}
