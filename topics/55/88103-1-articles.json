It will be critical in parts but I suspect there are things I can do in addition to suggestions for how the game can get better too. I suspect some of what follows has been talked about before and I have missed it so I apologize for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when the Career mode hit 0.24 I loved it. Played it a bunch; unlock nearly the entire tech tree and had a nice space station built around a Class-C asteroid orbiting Mun. 0.25 comes out and I start over. For my first run I started on normal mode and after playing with the new administrative building I unlock the entire tech tree an never left LKO. It was anticlimactic to say the least. I have started over again on hard with a couple minor concessions (reverts and saves). This is better but I am now finding the contracts I need to survive to be boring and repetitive. In the previous version I could do what I wanted for the most part and pick up contracts that fit with what I was doing etc. Now on hard you have to be on contract or starve. That would be OK if there was some more structure/goals to the contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo first up tell me some things I can do with the existing features that might put some more life back into career mode for me. To this point I have not install any mods to KSP. I have resisted that but if you can make a convincing argument I might give mods a try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext some of my suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Have contract story arcs. A larger goal that you would accept like a contract, (ie land a Kerbal on Minmus) and then have a series of logical and connected contracts that build up the needed tech/spacecrafts to achieve that goal. Obviously it could be as simple as put a science satellite in orbit to much more difficult missions like a base on one of Jool\u0027s moons. Incorporate doing specific science tasks into these missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) More rescue missions. The Kerbal rescue in orbit is fun but how about a crashed craft on a moon or planet that you have to go and rescue the crew from. Or a crippled vehicle that is adrift headed for danger (crash into a planet escape the system, etc) if you don\u0027t get there in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) In addition to the story arc contract there could be later contracts to maintain those. Say an early contract story arc had you build a base on Minmus you might be required to deliver something to the base as a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T15:02:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d just like to remind everyone that \u003Cem\u003Ecareer and contracts are not finished\u003C/em\u003E, pretty much no balancing took place, Squad just got the functionality in with basic values and intend to do the balancing in later updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes it\u0027s currently an easy unbalanced mess, this is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the final form \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T15:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm, Fine Print for more varied contracts - add to it Dmagic Orbital Science and SCANsat, and you\u0027ll even get some anomaly hunting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life-Support for various supply mission and having to keep your missions on a schedule. running out of food, water or oxygen is - as they say - not an option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThough the goodieness of KSP is what you make it into yourself.

Something that\u0027s not just \u0022oh, ok, I\u0027ll get to you some time in the next five years while you orbit in your space suit\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like some with more mystery and/or challenge, not just \u0022do this random thing\u0022. Mini-scenarios that introduce new challenges and build new skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like least-time or least-fuel orbital rendezvous / orbital insertion / transfers necessitated by time constraints or fuel constraints on supplied vessels. Manoeuvres without full navball assists introduced with missions where you take control of an existing ship that\u0027s had gimbal lock / display failure / etc. Out-of-resource and system-fault scenarios where you can rescue the crew *or* for better results, repair/refuel the vessel and let it carry on its mission. On surface recovery missions in variously challenging environments and going from recovery of a lone crew member to recovery of a whole disabled lander. Search-and-rescue missions where the exact target location isn\u0027t known.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus points for keeping the missions goofy and based on Kerbals doing incredibly silly things to get themselves into absurd situations that\u0027re still fun and challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal on EVA on a big highly elliptically orbiting asteroid forgot to secure their lander. In other words, they forgot the parking brake. They bumped the throttle while reaching back in to lock the controls and it boosted away from the asteroid, leaving them and the extended-life-support rover behind and only a little bit charred. They\u0027re going to be taking a very long trip to the edge of the solar system and it\u0027s going to get awfully lonely. Then they\u0027ll get fried by the sun on the way back in a few years. Their ship\u0027s nearby in a matching orbit, but the post-it note they wrote its location down on was stuck to the lander so they can\u0027t just use RCS jets on their suit to reach it. Rescue them. Bonus points if you dock with their lander and bring it back, then fly their lander to their ship and dock it so they can continue with their mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA recent launch of a space lab has failed to reach a stable orbit after premature separation of the final stage on the circularising burn. I didn\u0027t hit the wrong button, really, it just fell off by its self. The lab is grazing the atmosphere slightly on each orbit and you don\u0027t have too many orbits before it begins re-entry. Rescue the Kerbals within - or for a bigger reward, dock with it, boost it to a stable orbit so you get to keep using it. (It\u0027s a fancy lab module with a bunch of nice equipment on it and a couple of docking ports; a really attractive thing to rescue if you\u0027re in career mode once resources start to actually matter in the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting dude has only two days of oxygen, better get to him soon. He kinda forgot to fuel up his RCS before going EVA and he only noticed when he pushed off to fly around to the other side of the module. Um. Help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbiting dude has only two days of oxygen, better get to him soon. Nell and Jessie were really annoying in that tiny little can so I decided to go outside for a breather. The next thing I know we\u0027re boosting and I\u0027m tumbling away. It\u0027s nice to be away from them at last, but it\u0027s getting stuffy in here...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kerbal on EVA around Mun had their RCS jam on and they\u0027re now on a highly eccentric orbit that grazes incredibly close to the surface. Rescue them, but don\u0027t plow into the Mun in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lander module\u0027s gyros failed and it went into an uncontrollable tumble orbiting Mun. Grapple it, stabilise yourself, and EVA-rescue the crew within. Or get the crew to EVA while it\u0027s tumbling and hope they don\u0027t get smashed by the tumbling ship then go catch up with them and rescue them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship\u0027s engine failed to shut down and burned to fuel exhaustion, causing it to reach Kerbal escape velocity - but only just. Go fetch. Better be quick!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kerbal on the Mun (or your body of choice) got too excited flying their lander around and forgot to keep an eye on the fuel gauge. Bring them some fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal ejected from a jet after engine failure. They\u0027re stuck in the mountains. How are your VTOL jet/rocket skills?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal got lost on EVA on the Mun and they aren\u0027t responding on comm. Locate them (get within say 2km and their marker appears) then rescue them. You can use a rover. You can use a crater-grazing low orbit module for visual search. You can build a probe with a camera scientific module (want want want!) and transmit photos to base for analysis to find them. You can hop around with a lander. It doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA kerbal decided it\u0027d be fun to land on a big asteroid using just the RCS jets on their EVA suit, but they used all their fuel on the way down. There\u0027s just one problem... they don\u0027t know which asteroid they\u0027re on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Joseph promised he knew how to fly this thing. It turns out he doesn\u0027t. Please help us. He\u0027s trying to put us down on Minimus but we\u0027re pretty sure he\u0027s doesn\u0027t know how and he\u0027s not listening. (Meet up with a craft that keeps on boosting directly at right angles from its current orbit around Minimus at some particular point, changing the orbit angle but not its altitude, then rescue all the crew except Joe, who refuses to leave, via EVA. Or for bonus points dock with it and then land it and yourself on Minimus. Intact.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Fred and Karen were arm-wrestling because they were bored and one of them kind of hit the stage separation button by accident. So we\u0027re on a high suborbital trajectory and we could really use a hand, \u0027cos this thing isn\u0027t made for re-entry\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo crews were playing docking-chicken and they both lost. Meet up with each damaged, uncontrolled crew capsule and rescue the crew. (One of them will collide with an obstacle in a while, but the game doesn\u0027t point that out; you need to prioritise them yourself.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew decided that Minimus looked boring and they\u0027d rather go to one of the planets, but it turns out they didn\u0027t bring enough fuel for the orbital insertion. Save them and chastise them. Bonus points if you can instead transfer enough fuel to get their craft back home ... with a competent crew, this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship\u0027s electrics failed while it was boosting, sending it on a wild tumble up out of the ecliptic in orbit / at escape velocity without the ability to shut down the engines. Meet up with them and either fix (via EVA) and refuel the ship, or just rescue the crew for reduced points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship is leaking atmosphere and it\u0027s not going to make it back to re-entry and landing. Or rather, the ship will, pity about the crew. Go fix or rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA crew went on a mission to explore a planet. They got bored on the way and detached the lander module so they could fly some loops around the ship, but they forgot about it while they were having lunch and now it\u0027s gone. (Take control of the errant crew\u0027s ship at mission start, and EVA one of them out to the lander, or boost to meet it and re-dock).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge mission: A ship is on an excessively steep re-entry course after a miscalculation and it\u0027s out of fuel now. Help them. (You can go meet them in a new launch if you\u0027re quick, but there\u0027s not much time and if you screw up your docking you risk re-entering right along with them. The better solution is to detach the landing capsule and burn all its RCS fuel on a puny prograde boost so it re-enters at a better angle, but the game won\u0027t tell you that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship miscalculated its boost to Mun (or whatever). Badly. It turns out that those letters have different meanings, you can\u0027t boost on the z axis if it says x. It\u0027s on course to loop out past Minimus. Take control of the ship (becomes available at mission accept) and put it in orbit of Mun. Be careful, there\u0027s not much fuel left to correct the crew\u0027s mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe had a fight about who got to do the EVA and we couldn\u0027t agree, so we all went out. Then Fred realised that he\u0027d left the airlock on auto-secure and we\u0027re locked out of the module. We\u0027re all hanging on to the ladders ... er, kerbal transfer assistance devices ... and we could really use a hand getting the ship to a station. It\u0027s kind of embarrassing. (Dock a one-kerbal tug to a larger vessel and perform gentle manoeuvres to match its orbit with a station; mission only triggers once you have an orbiting station that has no manoeuvring capacity of its own. Be careful not to manoeuvre gently or they\u0027ll lose their grip on the module.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship is on a collision course for an asteroid and the crew have freaked out. Take control and bring it to rest relative to the \u0027roid. (Could be done by rendezvous or by granting remote control).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur probe seems to be due to impact the Mun, not orbit it, and we\u0027re not sure what we did wrong. (Correct high velocity impact vector into a nice circular orbit by taking control of a craft. On success a message in the contract completion text chastises the engineering team for using krebs instead of meters).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA ship\u0027s nav assists failed when it was due for an orbital insertion burn and the crew have no idea how to orient without the pretty icons in the navball. Help them. (Challenge mission, do an orbital insertion with no navball retrograde/prograde icons etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther challenge mission: The ship\u0027s gyros have failed (gimbal lock). Do an orbital insertion with visual orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of possibilities, especially with putting ships you take control of into difficult scenarios and introducing easy fault conditions that don\u0027t require engine changes (or, in the case of navball restriction challenges, only require options that already exist).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T03:52:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo have a poke at the \u003Cem\u003EFine Print\u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9 thread.
