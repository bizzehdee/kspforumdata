KSP, however, is a very CPU-heavy number-cruncher; on the weak CPU of a Nintendo Switch, it just isn\u0027t going to be able to practically keep up with all the physics calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn effect, for most video games, there are three sequential bottlenecks: the CPU, the GPU, and the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach \u0022tick\u0022 of the game, the CPU runs all* of the physics, takes player inputs, and essentially runs the game forward by one tick. It then sends a package of rendering instructions to the GPU, telling it where all the relevant objects are, what textures they\u0027re using, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Unless you are using some sort of OpenCL/CUDA physics acceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GPU then renders the frame, producing the pixels that you will see. This tends to be a lot of very simple but repetitive math, which is why GPUs are basically giant bricks of hundreds to thousands of floating-point arithmetic units. The more complicated the rendering instructions, the higher resolution frames to render, and the more effects you try to run, the more work the GPU has to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe GPU then sends the frame to the monitor, and tells the CPU \u0022I\u0027m ready for another frame\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor most games, turning down the graphics settings works because the physics, AI, etc, are very simple, and are easy to run in 1/60\u0027th of a second (the refresh rate of a typical monitor). What\u0027s limiting you is either the speed at which the GPU can render the frame, or the refresh rate of your monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP, however, is a hardcore physics simulator, with vessels consisting of hundreds of parts interacting by rigid-body physics, plus other fun stuff like aerodynamics, thermodynamics, checking the communication network, checking the orbits of unloaded vessels, etc. The graphics probably wouldn\u0027t even need to be turned down to run on a Nintendo Switch; it just doesn\u0027t have the sort of CPU that will semi-gracefully handle all the physics calculations coming its way. Even the more powerful CPUs of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One are marginal for running KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could maybe play a limited version of KSP on the Switch with a bit of optimization and strict caps on things like number of parts, but I can tell you this: turning down the graphical glitter won\u0027t change the fact that KSP is a very CPU-heavy game that you are hoping will run on what is essentially a smartphone/tablet CPU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T19:50:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@Starman4308 They were already planning a Wii u version which is less powerfull than the Switch (in docked mode) so it must certainly be possible. \u00A0Technically it has that same power in mobile mode but it would drain its already terrible battery life quickly so it might not be wise. \u00A0Regarless, it must be capable of running the game because the Wii U was and external batteries can be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-30T19:53:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2017 07:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T20:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223040318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493581811\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n24 minutes ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@Starman4308 They were already planning a Wii u version which is less powerfull than the Switch (in docked mode) so it must certainly be possible. \u00A0Technically it has that same power in mobile mode but it would drain its already terrible battery life quickly so it might not be wise. \u00A0Regarless, it must be capable of running the game because the Wii U was and external batteries can be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople talking about a Wii U port does not necessarily imply they actually would have been able to pull an effective Wii U port off.
