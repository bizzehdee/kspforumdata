This is a new feature where you can either put a probe on a rocket and then fly it with the same path to orbit by putting the data from the probe on a new rocket or identical rocket. The other way you could use this is set up a probe on a rocket and give it a flight path or destination and the rocket will attempt to make it to the destination.\u00A0 There are more possibilities but I want to discuss this with other to refine the topic Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-03T03:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice idea in practice but it should cost funds\u00A0to use a preprogrammed track and the guidance system is heavy.

It would encourage making one style of rocket and then you have a set payload weight and size like in real life but you still have the Kerbal style and you can imput new paths that you haven\u0027t flown but you do have to get an initial data bank to do it. Thanks for helping refine this topic. Also it would open access to players like me to even a little automation. And you could put margins of error in this so it will also encourage the less experienced players to learn how to fly and use the probes. There are many possibilities to use and that is why I love the feedback.

You will have as physical parts added, New\u00A0probe attachments. These attachments would come in different sizes and the bigger they are the more of other hardware would be required. The larges probes would be for you full rocket on the pad. For these rockets you would require a medium to large black box or other data storage system, as well as an FTS and an\u00A0active data probe (to improve the flight path to be more efficient). A passive data probe (to improve the flight path but for the next rockets) would be recommended but the data from the black box would have to be recovered and then you would require an update to the data you already have for the information to help improve each launch. All of this would be used to help encourage a standard rocket design for those who want to use these probes but as well as discourage newer players from using this because of the weight, cost and inefficiency which would all be better and easier for them to build and fly their own specialized rockets. This would also require standardized fairings for proper flight. The medium probes would be for if you wanted to only record your data of the second stage and payloads transportation system and no FTS would be required. The probes would also have flaws for early flights with the rocket including possible inefficient flight paths, higher delta V requirements and possible loss of signal and vehicle the more you use the probe and same system the better the flight path would become. This would also mean that the original flights to the outer planets would be done by hand because it would be so much easier. The\u00A0reason for FTS (flight termination systems) is so that if your large probe on your beginigng stages that are very large would help create a safe way to destroy the rocket without wasting time and data on a bad flight. You could also make a system of stalights around a place much easier. Next, are black boxes there would be small to large versions of these. You would have choses between more data or higher tolerance for destruction. This would mean that you could have one of these survive reentry and impact at 300m/s but less data or a black box that can only survive 25m/s impact with much more data. The next big part would be verification of newer flight paths. These would be where the manual and automation would mix because you would have to watch the flight path and correct the inefficiency from it if there are large processions. This would also mean that if you just wanted plain KSP you could either deactivate a DLC or you could have it so that these probes are not required for flight at all. I would want the update where these are nor required but useful. Finally you would have the possibility for large scale relay systems that you could launch using the system and there would be possibility for a fully automated system where you would have a separate launch pad and then you would set a number of rockets to launch from there with set destinations using your previous data and attempts you made. And as always thank you for your time and patience with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-04T20:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223949044\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617560589\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210967\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbalEngineer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, KerbalEngineer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223948612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617461859\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/3/2021 at 3:57 PM, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding to that, KSP is less of a rocket sim and more of a space sim.

This also means that in sandbox you still have to collect data for your missions. Data will be just like building the craft because you have to fly it at least once to have the autopilot kick in and have the right equipment. The margin of error could be small to large whatever seems to fit and burning in the atmosphere would be a situation you would have to plan for so this would discourage players to do it but the benefits of doing it right would be worth it to some of the better players and that is my goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-05T04:50:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically the game already had this, look at the KAL-1000 which can be used to automate flights by setting it to perform actions, eg, light engines, change fin deploy angle, activate rocket for attitude control, ignite engine again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalEngineer","CreatedById":210967,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-06T19:56:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not simple tasks though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-30T14:39:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like maybe it could be made to preform preplanned manuver nodes, or driving around on a planet without player input, but otherwise, I feel like this would kill the point of the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-13T19:16:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223948612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617461859\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/3/2021 at 8:57 AM, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we add an autopilot to vanilla there\u0027s no way to avoid newbies looking up autopilot tutorials and bypassing that incredibly important aspect of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do that anyway, so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good argument against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack Mcslay","CreatedById":208257,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-13T19:19:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll I want is the ability to tell probes to report and transmit a given science experiment repeatedly unattended so that we don\u0027t have to watch polar satellites doing repeated polar orbits until it gets above the spot you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-13T21:15:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223971785\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221620933362\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222511\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Corona688\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Corona688 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223948612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221617461859\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/3/2021 at 3:57 PM, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we add an autopilot to vanilla there\u0027s no way to avoid newbies looking up autopilot tutorials and bypassing that incredibly important aspect of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey do that anyway, so I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good argument against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP does not have any way to automatically set a rocket on a certain orbit to my knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
