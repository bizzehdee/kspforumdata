That would encourage the players to set up their own communication sats instead of paying for the Deep Space Network. The players would simply be able to select one of them and pick \u0022Close this facility\u0022, or something like that and the monthly upkeep would decrease.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T09:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a really good idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
