I need to use a magnifying glass to read the text in the user interface because the characters are a bit under 1/16 inch tall! My system has an Ultra HD4K display running at 3840x2160 and the game\u0027s only available text size for the user interface is simply too tiny. Normally, I\u0027d set the game to run in a different resolution, but that just put it in a smaller window. I wish there was at least one more option for user interface size, double or even quadruple of the default would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the other graphics look great and scale beautifully, but if there is a way to change the user interface size, it has resisted all of my attempts to find it. I do not have perfect (or better) vision, so the game either requires a magnifying glass (which is VERY ANNOYING) or causes a physical headache from the eyestrain required to squint at unnecessarily tiny text.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh behalf of all very high resolution and/or vision impaired users, I sincerely hope this suggestion is worthy of consideration.

I can adjust the size of the flight navigation interface ... why not the user interface text, too!
