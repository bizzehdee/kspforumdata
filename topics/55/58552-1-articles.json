If a three-way-symmetry array of struts is connected to a single stack, that might break the logic all too easily.

That\u0027ll quickly get messy on larger craft (see: Whackjob). I\u0027m thinking have two modes -- one displays the fuel flow regardless of whether the tank is visible or not, and another display the fuel flow at the same depth as the tank it\u0027s showing (as in, if the tank is hidden behind something else, that segment of flow doesn\u0027t show either). Fuel flow should (in my opinion) be displayed as a line textured with arrows pointing in the direction of fuel flow. Selecting an engine should draw the lines along all available paths of fuel flow for that engine, but also conversely, selecting a fuel tank should indicate which engines will draw fuel from it. When an engine is selected, each fuel tank should be numbered in the order that they will be drained, first to last (thus those with the highest numbers will be drained last and will generally be close to the engine or directly connected).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my mind, that would be the most intuitive way to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T11:04:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETweakables could be used.
