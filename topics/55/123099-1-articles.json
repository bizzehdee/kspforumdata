My suggestion would be to have a flag preview above or off to the side that would show the current selected flag at a significantly larger view. This would be useful for all places in the game where you can choose a flag (VAB, SPH, Runway and Launch Pad, New Game Setup). For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dwhwJAq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dwhwJAq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
