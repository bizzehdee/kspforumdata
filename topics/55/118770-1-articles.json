As I started playing KSP in the fall of 2011 (and rediscovered it in the summer of 2013), I remember the horror known as Parts folder and all the files from mods dumped there. Story is now little different but my question remains: Squad, why are there empty folders?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E No bad thoughts, just curious:D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/291fdwp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022291fdwp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T17:39:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of that got moved to GameData so it\u0027s basically an artifact of older versions.
