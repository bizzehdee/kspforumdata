They would get an unhappy face and collapse, with no control. You have 1 second to put the helmet back on. They don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Edie\u003C/em\u003E, they just become unconscious. Another Kerbal can then put the helmet back on, and he\u0027ll wake up again. This could also implement life support in a fun way. If you run out of snacks, this would happen. If you run out of snacks inside a ship, your Kerbals would KO, and the command pod would cease to provide control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe great thing is that the player can fix these problems. They could send a rescue mission to feed their Kerbs or just bring them back home. You could even send rescue missions for stupid helmet removing kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, KO\u0027d Kerbals would have a constant drain on your reputation. On Hard-mode they would perish after too long KO\u0027d.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there should probably be a benefit to removing the helmet. On Laythe and Kerbin, removing the helmet would allow you to bypass your own oxygen system and survive without using up your space-suit\u0027s air.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
