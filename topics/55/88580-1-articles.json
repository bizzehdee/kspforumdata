I\u0027m finding however that these don\u0027t have enough torque in the yaw dimension for my needs. While I understand that while flying in atmosphere you generally need more pitch torque than anything else, in space I\u0027m finding the lack of yaw authority problematic. It\u0027s especially a problem around jet flame-out, when I tend to have a sharp yaw event if one engine cuts out sooner than the other. So my suggestion is could we either increase the yaw torque on the exisiting pod or create an SAS unit with equal torque in all 3 axes like the regular SAS units? The aesthetics of using regular reaction wheels inline on a Mk2 fuselage are really dorky!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
