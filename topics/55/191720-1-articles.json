suck, they are bland, look like plastic, and the textures are actually seamy (look closely at orange variants, you can actually see a break in the normal mapping on em).\u00A0 Next goes to the mk1-3 pod, its got a bleh texture (not 1 scratch), and worst of all they didnt even fit the ONE biggest issue with that damn pod, the top hardpoint being the wrong physical size making it impossible to asthetically mount anything to the top aside from a docking port (main reason i never use that in any of my designs except in the rare case of when i know i want a docking port on the nose to be integral part of the ship design).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022zcGSyP1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022

been rediculous from day 1, i dont know why, but someone made the decision when the model got revamped to maintain backwards compatibility and in effect guaranteed that i would never use this part without restock installed as it looks like trash with like anything attached to the top node that isnt a docking port (which is actually too small radius to look right on many things for that matter itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth mentioning is that alot of the \u0022new\u0022 revamps have unoptimized and broken textures.\u00A0 There are missing mipmaps on a handful of them (orange variant of fairing, all the new nose cones, 3.75m fuel tanks, ect), and many of the new revamps (3.75m fuel tank comes to mind and its nose cones) are using .PNG textures!!!\u00A0 I thought the game went away from .PNGs for optimization reasons, and seeing new parts come out using the older style .PNG textures (with no mipmapping for that matter) makes my cringe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SaYsPjx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022

even noticed yet and using outdated .PNG textures (use .dds plz) and have broken mipmaps (not even sure if .PNG supports mipmapping, but if it doesnt you shouldnt be using it as a format especially given most unity games ive played use .dds internally as its more efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso another huge annoyance i have with one of the stock parts (which has driven me nuts enough to disable normal maps on that part in particular) is the fairing normal map bug where the direction of the normal map seems to randomly flip itself depending on how you orient the ship.\u00A0 Essentially when you flip a ship around the parts of the normal map that are supposed to stick out (as in the effect makes the feature appear to be convex) then changes and becomes concave or sticks in like a valley.\u00A0 This is show in the screenshots below, i made a very dead basic ship (just a pod with a fairing atop it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MPvLEWU.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/MPvLEWU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis bug just drives me nuts, and used to be present also on the 2.5m tanks (that appear to have been fixed lateron).\u00A0 Basically in this screenshot the arrows point to features that are clearly either sticking out or sticking in (based on the sun\u0027s lighting).\u00A0 A feature that sticks out (such as the long seam going lengthwise down the fairing (labels 1 and 2 which point to the same thing just diufferent spot on model it continues) would be expected to both either stick out (like the yellow arrows), or stick in (cyan), but of all things they should not be altering themselves from one going in and one going out (breaks any sort of immersion to see this in game).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00229KpjGTE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022

lacking mipmaps which make teh game render the full res texture always and not switch to a smaller lew high res texture as you move the camera away from it like every other game does as it should since super high res far away becomes overly sharp and pixelated that even antialiasing wont compensate for properly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ja6pFGf.png\u0022

doesnt care all that much (ive been using restock since like 1.7ish and havent gone back except to see what a bone stock new release looks like when i get a new update), but im getting the feeling that the whole revamping effort (while a good idea and hugely demanded by many people in the community including myself back b4 i used restock at least) is starting to be backburner focus with little regard given to quality of stuff coming out of it.\u00A0 No offense to the artists (its a new style that not everyone may like) who seem to be trying hard to improve the game slowly as it is patched, but you guys should really focus on quality control and stop releasing broken textures that make some of the old terrible parts from back in 0.90 look better then the new ones from a texture and quality perspective (even if they were terrible 3d models and had styles that didnt fit any uniform theme).\u00A0 The desire to improve is there, but for whatever reason (i suspect the constant push to release updates on the new release every so and so months schedule), quite a few oversights are getting past the QC team and it really makes it feel rushed despite being such a nice game in like every way otherwise...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-19T09:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

got revamped to maintain backwards compatibility and in effect guaranteed that i would never use this part without restock installed as it looks like trash with like anything attached to the top node that isnt a docking port (which is actually too small radius to look right on many things for that matter itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso worth mentioning is that alot of the \u0022new\u0022 revamps have unoptimized and broken textures.\u00A0 There are missing mipmaps on a handful of them (orange variant of fairing, all the new nose cones, 3.75m fuel tanks, ect), and many of the new revamps (3.75m fuel tank comes to mind and its nose cones) are using .PNG textures!!!\u00A0 I thought the game went away from .PNGs for optimization reasons, and seeing new parts come out using the older style .PNG textures (with no mipmapping for that matter) makes my cringe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

parts i havent even noticed yet and using outdated .PNG textures (use .dds plz) and have broken mipmaps (not even sure if .PNG supports mipmapping, but if it doesnt you shouldnt be using it as a format especially given most unity games ive played use .dds internally as its more efficient).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso another huge annoyance i have with one of the stock parts (which has driven me nuts enough to disable normal maps on that part in particular) is the fairing normal map bug where the direction of the normal map seems to randomly flip itself depending on how you orient the ship.\u00A0 Essentially when you flip a ship around the parts of the normal map that are supposed to stick out (as in the effect makes the feature appear to be convex) then changes and becomes concave or sticks in like a valley.\u00A0 This is show in the screenshots below, i made a very dead basic ship (just a pod with a fairing atop it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/MPvLEWU.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MPvLEWU.png\u0022

fixed lateron).\u00A0 Basically in this screenshot the arrows point to features that are clearly either sticking out or sticking in (based on the sun\u0027s lighting).\u00A0 A feature that sticks out (such as the long seam going lengthwise down the fairing (labels 1 and 2 which point to the same thing just diufferent spot on model it continues) would be expected to both either stick out (like the yellow arrows), or stick in (cyan), but of all things they should not be altering themselves from one going in and one going out (breaks any sort of immersion to see this in game).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/9KpjGTE.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg

broken mipmaps since im discussing the fairing issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/3YR2JtZ.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external

game render the full res texture always and not switch to a smaller lew high res texture as you move the camera away from it like every other game does as it should since super high res far away becomes overly sharp and pixelated that even antialiasing wont compensate for properly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/Ja6pFGf.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge

cleaner (you may need to zoom in to see details).\u00A0 Both this and above screenshot have been taken with the same camera i just changed part texture variant).\u00A0 \u003Ca

given that its present on this fairing (some textures missing normals, some dont).\u00A0 Specifically, the files missing normals at least for this part (fixed with 2 minutes in any image editor that can save .dds files provided you check the generate mippmaps feature): FairingBaseNormals, fairings_diff_orange, fairings_grey_normals, fairings_orange_normals, fairingsCap.\u00A0 All the rest are ok

really doesnt care all that much (ive been using restock since like 1.7ish and havent gone back except to see what a bone stock new release looks like when i get a new update), but im getting the feeling that the whole revamping effort (while a good idea and hugely demanded by many people in the community including myself back b4 i used restock at least) is starting to be backburner focus with little regard given to quality of stuff coming out of it.\u00A0 No offense to the artists (its a new style that not everyone may like) who seem to be trying hard to improve the game slowly as it is patched, but you guys should really focus on quality control and stop releasing broken textures that make some of the old terrible parts from back in 0.90 look better then the new ones from a texture and quality perspective (even if they were terrible 3d models and had styles that didnt fit any uniform theme).\u00A0 The desire to improve is there, but for whatever reason (i suspect the constant push to release updates on the new release every so and so months schedule), quite a few oversights are getting past the QC team and it really makes it feel rushed despite being such a nice game in like every way otherwise...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, someone analysing the new parts. I agree with you all the way, I don\u0027t see why they\u0027re replacing the \u0027placeholder\u0027 textures other than them being \u0027placeholders\u0027.If you look at all the teasers and trailers (other than the KSP 2 ones), all the kerbals look like plastic and the environments just look dull, bland and empty. The people doing the \u0027art\u0027 seriously need to start doing a better job, because so far there\u0027s many modders doing a better job at revamping the art than the developers of all people. I can see another \u0027out-pizza\u0027d the hut\u0027 meme incoming, and that\u0027s a bad thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
