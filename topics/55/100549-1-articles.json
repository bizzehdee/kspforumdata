I\u0027d like to ask for a small change in it\u0027s work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now in 0.90 if you accept a part testing contract with a non researched part that is highlighted on the part selector inside VAB/SPH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHIS option is pretty usefull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll I\u0027d like to ask to make a different distinction for the already researched parts to. Because IT IS make the actual part finding reasonable easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo maybe a different color, green or purple or whatever... Or just a mid noticeable frame/border around that part should be neat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHistory on this: I reported it as a bug about this effect not happening with all the parts, so sometime it is higlighted sometimes not...
