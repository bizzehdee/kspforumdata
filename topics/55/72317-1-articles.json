It is truly a realistic and marvelous simulator. I do have a problem though, and that is science. Do not get me wrong, it is quite balanced indeed right now, but the goo canister and the material bay get a bit repetitive. It would be quite revolutionary if rover, EVA and \u0022timed science\u0022 could be added. First, rover science, additions like cameras, surface drills, and objects like scanners could be implemented so that rovers have a better use (instead of just running around with the goo canister \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough the tools would have to be reusable and not reset after you transmit the data, and the amount of science received would depend on the information you\u0027ve gathered (minerals found, surface density, etc.) in order to balance it. Then E.V.A, simply tools the Kerbals can carry around to do research while on E.V.A, which could encourage the player to do more while on E.V.A. Finally \u0022Timed Science.\u0022 The Lab Module could house experiment brought to it and not only reset the goo canister and material bay. But it could store repeated experiments, such as repeated material bay reports/experiments that have no further value, as samples and using those samples the Kerbals could experiment with it. This would provide a certain amount of science after a certain amount of time. OR EVEN, this could provide I.V.A interactions and let you take control of a Kerbal inside the Lab Module and be able to interact with the sample and experiment with it (Grabbing it, applying different chemicals to it, seeing what happens when you crush it, etc.). Hopefully, this suggestions can be useful for something in the future, as it could add another layer of realism in career mode. Yet, the game with or without these elements is and will still be amazing! I love KSP! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
