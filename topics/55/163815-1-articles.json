The exhaust sound comes from left speaker if your exhaust is on the left side of the screen and from the right when the exhaust is on the right hand side. While looking at the craft you will not notice is as it sounds natural. The sound appears to comes from the location it should.

Setting \u0022spacecraft\u0022 volume to zero does nothing for either flaming reentry or \u0022wind\u0022 sound on launchpad and before splashdown.
