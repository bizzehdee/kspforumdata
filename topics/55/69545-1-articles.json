I was thinking about the biomes on the Mun as I attempt to rescue the brave crew who got stuck after my 6th landing. It seems to me there are \u0022too many\u0022. Arguments I know go back and forth over the merits of science grinding, but I think there are an awful lot of biomes on the Mun that don\u0027t provide too much additional gameplay value. Usually, when you\u0027ve done one, it\u0027s a rinse-and-repeat to get the rest. In my mind, you could on each body get away with just three:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEasy Biome - typically flat landscape, near equatorial and low in elevation when the body has an atmosphere. These would be the easiest to get to and the usual target of the first landing. This biome would be the majority of the body\u0027s surface most likely..\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHard Biome - typically hilly landscape, much higher latitude and more elevated. This would provide more challenge and probably require an upgraded craft. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPinpoint Biome - could be anywhere, but very small - no more than 100m across. The motivation for these is to provide a reason to use a rover (which always seemed a little pointless to me?) to drive the last km from your landing point. Alternatively, if you hate rovers, you could use it to justify a hopper craft or a most excellent precision landing. These \u003Cem\u003Ecould \u003C/em\u003Ebe found marked by anomalies, which in turn would be found by a mapping mod or good old fashioned anomaly spotting. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo balance the reduced number of places to do science, the points for each would be increased accordingly. Three (or some other similarly small number) of missions would be enough to get all the science from a body, but would nonetheless provide increasing challenge and difficulty, rather than the fairly repeated missions we do now. With more bodies getting biomes, this would seem even more important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts on reducing the number of biomes?

Mostly, we need more science modules. I\u0027ve thrown in mods to add tons of extra science gear, none of it being overpowered, just odd at times, and it still takes an eternity for me to get anywhere. Half of that is my love of spaceplanes and as such, I have to decide between inefficient and rarely effective suborbital hops and pray for a new biome to grab from, or trying to get my wings and then explore with suborbital hops and gliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, planes lead to my hilarity of trying to lug that Science Lab with me. Personally, I preferred 0.22\u0027s science-spam to 0.23\u0027s \u0022bring arbitrary part to continue science-spam\u0022 strategy. Is it more realistic? Probably. There are still many experiments that shouldn\u0027t need the lab. I\u0027d love to see (and have installed a mod that gives these) multi-sample science cans. You know, so that I can store multiple goo samples and materials lab studies. Sure, transmission is down the crapper, but I can collect three or four biomes worth of goodies, bring it back to Kerbin, and sail along the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the biggest problem with Science right now is the lack of instruments. I mean, to an extent, I\u0027d like to see more simplistic things added as well as highly profitable big experiments. For an example, I think it\u0027d be cool to get 1 science point for having a ship where you\u0027ve installed a solar panel and noticed power output rising the closer you are to the sun, and an additional point for watching it fall below Kerbin optimal numbers. Or a point for having a rover experience an eclipse and momentary power loss. Give the probe cores some method or another of making a bit of science, even if it\u0027s something as simple as \u0022The probe\u0027s onboard camera records some low-resolution images of the landing site.\u0022 and offers a 25% transmission rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for transmission costs, I\u0027d like to do something along the same line as the solar panels to the sun. The further you are from Kerbin (and, for the sake of giving comsats something useful) and your nearest relay satellite, the more electricity it will take to transmit data. So transmitting on Kerbin would cost almost nothing, but transmitting from Eeloo on the opposite side of the sun with no comsats would be rather, shall we say, energy inefficient. That, and make the antennas different other than just by saying this one transmits faster for more electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought on the antennas? The default Communotron 16 should be a highly efficient close-range-antenna with moderate to high transmit speed, though low quality. That big dish thing, the Communotron 88-88, should be more efficient at greater distances and a good relay antenna with high transmission speed and quality, though a high energy cost as well. The Comms-DTS one should flip the scales, offering low energy consumption and low transmit speeds, with exceptionally high signal quality. The trade-off being whether you\u0027re willing to wait 5 minutes to get 100% of the quoted transmission rating, or you\u0027re willing to blow 500 electric charge a packet to get 90% and transmit in 20 seconds, or whether you\u0027re just starting out and you\u0027ll spend your usual 15 EC/Packet, get 60% of the rating, and transmit over 60 seconds. It\u0027ll give a reason to use more powerful, better antennas, as I\u0027ve not seen much incentive to use anything other than massive Communotron 16 arrays. Maybe budgets will stomp that out, but there\u0027s not, currently, much reason to use the other antennae for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and adding more science gear in both the low and high ranges of the tree, should help out. Then you can make the tree bigger, add more parts, and just generally flesh out Career mode further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T18:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to development discussions.
