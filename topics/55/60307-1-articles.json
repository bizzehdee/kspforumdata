I was hoping there\u0027d be a bit longer before this came up again. Long story short, the Kerbals are not intended to be male. The devs have stated in the past that Kerbals are intended to be entirely genderless, and until they explicitly say otherwise, that is basically where this issue stands. This has been discussed \u003Cem\u003Ead nauseum\u003C/em\u003E so many times here before, and as it seems you don\u0027t really have anything special to bring to the table on the matter, it probably shouldn\u0027t be brought up again. You can run a search for \u0022female Kerbals\u0022 on the forums and you will find pages upon pages of arguments both for and against this idea, the majority of which are quite poorly put (on both sides, to be sure) and lack a great deal of substance. While people do tend to get very heated on this matter, it is often without purpose in the end, really. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince there isn\u0027t anything really new to discuss on this subject, and also in order to prevent an awful mess, I\u0027m going to have to close this one. Sorry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a footnote... this is indeed on the [thread=36863]What Not to Suggest List[/thread] (which you might want to read). While we do sometimes permit \u003Cstrong\u003E[Discussion]\u003C/strong\u003E threads of items on that list, we will draw the line where it is merely a thread designed to attract opinions; i.e., \u0022Do you think this should be in the game?\u0022; \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E when the thread does not in itself bring much to discuss. This is because the very fact that they are on the WNTS list means that they are either a topic that causes a great deal of contention, and/or they are things that get suggested so often that the forum would be flooded with a large amount of duplicates of the same suggestion. There is also little point in creating a thread purely to ask people\u0027s opinions, as that is not very much of a \u003Cstrong\u003E[Discussion]\u003C/strong\u003E at all, really; a \u003Cstrong\u003E[suggestion]\u003C/strong\u003E topic with a poll would be better, if the topic is not on the WNTS list.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-18T10:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2014 10:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vexx32\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
