Im not sure if this is true, but i believe KSP counts each segment of the fairing as its own unique part. Ive modded the fairings to allow infinite length sections and to have less petals in general (the 3.7m ones have 3 petals instead of overkill 6 as before). Its a bandaid fix but it at least makes them useable in the lag department (which is already bad enough when your ship is 300 parts not counting the 300 part launcher to get that heavy capital ship to eeloo or wherever you want).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and whoever said they are unpractical is correct for all but the most unaerodynamic payloads. The fairings seem to add ALOT of drag, and the only thing that makes them worthwhile is if your playload has alot of flat things facing the air direction (such as structural plates that are facing forward, exposed fuel tanks without nose cones, or is extremely weak and prone to being destroyed by aero forces (which are honestly a minimal concern with teh stock game). The only other use is to shield something with alot of wings on it (say a carrier or something with hull made of wings) if its pushed atop a rocket (my personal solution is to have side boosters that pull it kinda (as in payload is well below CoM). Looks awkward but it works great in practice. Then another thing about fairings, is that they seem to be EXCESSIVELY wobbly, needing ALOT of struts between the bottom and top to keep the payload from going all over the place (luckily you can actually have struts go inside a fairing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey really need to optimize the bloody fairings to make them less laggy. Actually 1.0 as a whole needs massive optimization (hopefully U5 will be at least a bandaid fix), KSP has too much lag in general, and too much unoptimized stuff (resource flow, atmo and aerodynamics, ships above 1000 parts, ect).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only good thing i can say about fairings is that they add to immersion (more realistic to have a rocket with fairing around payload). That said, being a primarily sci-fi designer, i really do not care about what is deemed 100% realistic.
