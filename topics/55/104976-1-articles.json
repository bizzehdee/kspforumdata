That way you only need one cloud to make it look like there\u0027s scttered clouds everywhere.\n\nSeriously, I\u0027d like to see clouds implemented. I\u0027m not big on making things look pretty, but I was rather surprised how much having clouds increased immersion for me when I tried a mod that added them."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T18:09:49Z","Content":"I hate to be condescending but this has been suggested dozens of times and discussed to death.
