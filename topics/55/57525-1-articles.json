The one problem I see is that biomes currently translate all the way into orbital science (i.e. if you take a gravity scan from orbit over the Mun\u0027s farside crater it is a separate experiment to taking a gravity scan over the Mun\u0027s lowlands). While this might not be a big deal if the Easter Egg biomes are really small (such that you can\u0027t really find them in orbit), it doesn\u0027t make much sense that taking a gravity reading over a temple should be a separate experiment from taking the reading 20 meters away in any direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m really trying to say is: I suspect it would require a different system than the current biome function to make this work properly.
