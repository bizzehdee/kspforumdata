Actually the nodes can be set on the orbit but the information at the navball (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E, distance, heading indicator) doesn\u0027t show up. Always had to go to space center and return to craft to be able to plan nodes again. After returning to the craft the half-assed nodes actually were gone as if they never existed (unlike correct nodes which are saved). Obviously after an EVA there is something not correctly set or initialized when back in the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP Version 1.2.0, Windows 64-bit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods: chatterer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually needs to be moved to technical support forum modded installs although i doubt it has anything to do with chatterer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-13T23:43:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2016 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DocMoriarty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
