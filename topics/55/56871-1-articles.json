Currently, while you can change the root part by isolating the command pod you want to switch, deleting/replacing it, then building the rest of the rocket around it, that is a lot of effort to go through if you\u0027ve built a sufficiently complicated rocket around it. Furthermore, and more importantly, it might not always be possible to reconstruct the same rocket from a different root because the nodes you want to use aren\u0027t available or some such. I\u0027ve run into situations myself where I could build a rocket using one command module as a root, but when trying to rebuild the same design from a different module incorporated into the design... Couldn\u0027t do it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
