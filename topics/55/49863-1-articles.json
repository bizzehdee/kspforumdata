I feel like the game needs some form of \u0022here are the things you can do\u0022 for the planets/moons you have visited/unlocked. For example, a new player would automatically see Kerbin in this list with of each biome and their \u0022accomplishments\u0022 in each. For other planets/moons, this could be as simple as \u0022High Orbit\u0022, \u0022Low Orbit\u0022 and \u0022Surface\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Building upon my previous point, it would be really nice if we had a way to view our progress of discoveries for each planet/moon. When unlocking new science equipment, it\u0027s difficult to remember where I have used what!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Antennae should remain in the open position if they have been manually extended; currently, every time you send a transmission, it is automatically retracted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) I love the concept of returning ships to Kerbin for maximum science gain, but it seems possible to achieve similar results by making multiple radio transmissions. A player can repeatedly send these tranmissions and get a lot of science data, but the process seems clunky. I get the overall idea with making sending data back less valuable then bringing it back, but my suggestion would be to streamline this where a player can gather ALL of the data at once, then the transmission of said data be sent in multiple batches depending on available power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Now that we have science equipment that appears to gather meaningful data, it would be awesome if we had metrics. Sure, there are add-ons that do this, but I feel pretty strongly that the core game should at least have some more native functionality for stage-based Delta-V and TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) It would be awesome if we could setup maneuver nodes from the launch pad so we can intelligently launch into the plane of our target and AT THE RIGHT TIME -- right now it\u0027s an incredible waste of energy to launch 90 degrees and then change planes ... and THEN time accelerate and create your maneuver nodes in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Finally, can we please get some stock payload fairings? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for making such a great game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EasyAce","CreatedById":62958,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T14:47:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice thread!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see the developers to change the tech three to a more logical one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no reason to not being able to put together a simple plane from the start.

I can\u0027t wait to see these rolled out to every celestial body. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow for the bad stuff: like many other players, I have some problems with the way science is implemented. I\u0027ve seen many other threads expressing similar concerns. Here are the most frequent criticisms, all of which I agree with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u0027s too easy to spam-transmit science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. All experiments happen instantaneously. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

There is not enough visibility on data collection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. The tech tree somewhat unbalanced and illogical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my suggestions for solutions. I\u0027ve ordered these by my estimate of how much work they would mean for the devs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Move fuel lines further down the tech tree\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you understand how to use it, asparagus staging turns the game into a cakewalk. Fuel lines should be a tier 4 tech. Arguably they should even be in a newly-created tier 5. (This would correspond well to the real world, where asparagus staging is still in the experimental phase.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Make the back end of the tech tree far more expensive\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the criticism I\u0027ve seen focuses on the early part of the tree. These critics fail to understand an important real-world consideration: the early game MUST be kept simple, so new players are not overwhelmed. This is very important to maintaining SQUAD as an economically viable developer, and to ensuring a continuing stream of new players into the KSP ecosystem. (Anyhow, the fact that Kerbals invented rockets before ladders makes a perverse sort of sense to me.) On the flip side, though, the back end of the tech tree does not have to be friendly at all. In fact, it can be downright fiendish! Tier 4 techs currently cost 550 science a pop. I\u0027d increase that by a factor of ten. Maxing out the tech tree should feel like an accomplishment, not an inevitability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Disallow repeat transmissions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the most commonly proposed idea, and I totally agree. Even if you bind your instruments to an action group, pressing the send data button 144 times in a row is neither realistic nor fun. Instead, each experiment should have one maximum transmission per zone. Data-based experiments like the thermometer, grav detector, barometer and crew report should each immediately give 100%. Materials-based experiments like Surface Samples, Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 and Science Jr. should give 20% once, with full points only available on recovery. This is probably the most important fix and also one of the easiest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Require a data-collection period for certain experiments\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like Seismic data collection and Science Jr. should take days, weeks, or even months to complete. This encourages the establishment of bases and other permanent presences in space and on planets. Returning live Kerbals back home after long journeys should give us science too \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 i.e., the physiological effects of long-duration exposure to deep space and other planets should count as an experiment in itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Nerf the antenna\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic Communotron 16 unit is totally overpowered. It can transmit flawlessly to Kerbin from the far side of Eeloo at maximum distance with the Sun in the way. The more advanced antennae are actually inferior, offering only increased transmission speed at double the electricity cost. (Transmission speed is almost never an issue.) This problem can be fixed by introducing a maximum transmission distance for each antennae, with exponentially increasing power requirements and line-of-sight considerations taken into effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E6.

That is you can min-max mission design for maximum yield with early and later parts, the most extreme of this being cases of Tier 0 Minmus and Mun flybys in one mission. Min-maxing and any other optimization will always happen and in every game, no matter how good the balance is (also it falls into the area of being knowledge-based challenge, while knowledge-based challenge in games is not really challenging as it doesn\u0027t test skill, but I digress), however I think \u003Cstrong\u003Esome science components and the materials bay in particular are too light\u003C/strong\u003E. Doing these large research vessels with multiple materials bays or goo pods is simply too easy by the time you reach the middle of the tree. Also the tree should possibly change with difficulty settings, with parts swapped around a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course science parts being expensive or other limitations added in the future may kill the science combines that can easily be sent to Duna or Eve. However what should be kept in mind is that the tree should not be a grind, it should simply nudge the player towards going into new places and trying new things, without railroading him into specific missions at specific locations and stages of the game. The openness of the system in how you want to get science (and what to research) are what makes it great (more superlatives and what is good stuff saved for the end of this post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Data transmission is good in principle but needs new mechanics to better flesh out its advantages and disadvantages. Antenna strengths, range and other factors being non-issues for now is the obvious one, as is the fact that the only penalty for not opting to return data is the tediousness of having to click more assuming you have enough power (bar time constraints like transmitting while falling through the atmosphere) to drain the science pool. The most commonly suggested solution is doing a separate total science available pool for returning samples where it makes sense (for goo canisters, soil samples and materials bays) which I support myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Probe missions versus manned missions. This bit is quite schizophrenic now (no offense to actual schizophrenics meant). On one hand manned missions can do more experiments, although in some cases those could be done with probes with new kinds of parts (cameras for reports, sample scoops for soil sample analysis). On the other there is the issue with transmitting benefiting probes more, as indeed does experiment return in the cases where it can be done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Kerbal skills added, like obvious geology, physics or other science skills, you could have a bonus to the science gotten from experiments made by kerbals themselves, derived from that skill, in addition to base science value. Of course this bonus would not drain the available science pool from an experiment case, only the base value would \u003Cstrong\u003Eso that overall doing science with Kerbals would yield more science as it requires more effort\u003C/strong\u003E. A geologist will pick the best rock sample, he can after all study the rock in more detail before picking it up than a scoop with robotic cameras can. Being on site has advantages to looking at limited resolution still photos that took minutes to reach Kerbin. The same could apply to having a physics PhD Kerbal or an engineer mess around with a Materials or Goo pod in orbit. With a skill system you can have those kerbals improve in their skills over time, this doesn\u0027t need to even be more than one variable increasing with use \u003Cstrong\u003Eto make people not only want to use Kerbals but also to get them back home.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Long versus short term study. All experiments are instant now, but it doesn\u0027t make sense in the case of some. Of course the thing is you can time warp over any waiting element. I mentioned it in another topic, you could have two experiments on a sensor, the instant one and long-term study. Both would have different science pools and yields, but the idea is to have the latter be a smaller but still noticeable amount given after a long period of time since it began. So that most players don\u0027t feel terribly forced into time warping for it (some always will). I already said this would need a system for tracking events, kind of like the Alarm Clock mod works, to alert you when you got results you can send back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Spaceplane (parts) feel awkward in Career mode\u0027s current form. This can be fixed by adding electric propellers (possibly with balloons) and biomes to other planets, the latter will of course happen but the former would really give incentive to try them out when the biomes get added. Without biomes their only use is on Laythe. This issue also applies to rovers to an extent. Now the other issue would be aerial probes being better than rovers, but airless moons and planets would still give rovers a niche. Also propellers or balloons could be further up the tech tree. Both are IMO very fun concepts of exploration. I think it would be very educational to have them and show that yes, even a balloon and an old tech like a propeller can have a use in space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Space Stations also feel awkward, there is another topic about that so I\u0027ll just say that while they should have a science function it should be a secondary reason to get them, with using them for resupplying or refueling the primary one.

Too much of a good thing, I guess. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase 2 probably needs a non-fuel line oriented fix anyway, and assuming we get a fix like that, I\u0027ve got a solution for case 3. Two levels of fuel lines. One that can only connect tanks within the same stage (not separated by decouplers/separators/etc) which would be useful for case 3 but not case 1, and full on as they are now fuel lines that could be used for case 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase 3 could probably also be handled by making liquid fuel and oxidizer flow between stacks like all the rest of the resources but not across any of the decoupler-type items. This way you wouldn\u0027t need fuel lines to deal with this, but you\u0027re still not draining fuel from one stage to feed another except by deliberate action. I actually like this idea better than my first suggestion, but I\u0027m not as sure that it might not have unseen consequences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMany of the better player challenges impose exactly this restriction.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed. Personally I think that asparagus staging is the natural adaptation of 100% reliable infinite flow fuel lines combined with lower than realistic TWR so I don\u0027t have a problem with that, but I still like knowing that I can get away without it (or even knowing that I can\u0027t for my really huge payloads).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe issue of balance affects any modern developer, and there are no easy answers here, I know.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEspecially when you\u0027re dealing with a sandbox game where there is no difficulty setting and the only way to make something harder is with artificial restrictions or doing more ambitious missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, we agree in theory, if not implementation. Everyone understands some kind of fix is needed here. This is a critical point.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is definitely what I see as the biggest issue in the current science implementation, and I think most people are of the same opinion. Personally, I think any of the three changes here would be an improvement. Which would be the best improvement would depend on just what effect you\u0027re trying to have. I obviously have my favorite because it pushes the player towards return missions without punishing early one way trips too much, but it does little to curb multi-SoI missions that get huge returns by doing a little science all over the place. The \u0022charges\u0022 on the science equipment is the only proposal short of eliminating transmitted returns on at least some of the experiments that I\u0027ve seen that would curb that. Then again, not sure that it would feel that abusive if we have decent limits in place that cover the single SoI or single biome missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOK, you\u0027re right. What I actually want is a high-value science experiment that requires yearly or even monthly manual servicing. I\u0027m not sure what this would look like (space telescope with a busted lens?), but the key point is that you must master orbital docking or precision landing for it to have value.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, I think it would be an interesting mechanic, I just don\u0027t see how to achieve the desired result. Obviously you don\u0027t want to just let them ship all the needed resupply parts/whatever along in the original mission, because then it does become \u0022time warp towards science.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kerm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis would be balanced against an overall increase of the required science points for advancement.
