There should be no warning, simply an option to remove. You will learn quickly that Kerbals cannot survive in a vacuum.\n\nActually, you can survive vacuum exposure for over a minute, and remain conscious for around 10 seconds, assuming you don\u0027t try to hold your breath - if you do, the pressure differential will almost certainly cause fatal lung trauma - fortunately an astronaut would probably be trained to empty his/her lungs in the event of a decompression. This means that if a Kerbal removed his/her helmet, he/she would have about 10 seconds to put it back on (although it would take time for the suit to repressurize, meaning loss of consciousness is inevitable) and another Kerbal would have a window of 30-60 seconds. This is assuming kerbals have mammal-like metabolism; if they have a slower metabolic rate, they might survive hypoxia for longer periods.\n\nSource:\n\n[http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html](http://www.geoffreylandis.com/vacuum.html)\n\nAnyway, it seems like a silly thing to add to gameplay. At best, only give Kerbals the option to remove their helmets on Kerbin with pressure over 0.50 atm."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T11:29:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They wear their suits even in kerbin, I guess the astronauts ones are born with them\n\nWow!
