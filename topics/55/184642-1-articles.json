Make courage and stupidity actually mean something, and if we\u0027re being real here, shouldn\u0027t kerbal engineers be the only ones capable of using your K struts idea? Of course if k struts becomes a thing so should rigidly attached fuel pipes from kerbal inventories. Also I dont think engineers should be the only ones to pack parachutes.
