Again, there are a few problems with this such as seeing through the ship when it \u0022bends\u0022 apart so it could be an option in the menu or something for players who need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I really don\u0027t know programming and stuff so forgive me if I\u0027m trying to eat soup with a fork here or if I\u0027m breaking the really broad, unspecific rule on \u0022changing part loading\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarVision","CreatedById":44592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T00:41:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wouldn\u0027t really work. Those textures that you\u0027re talking about are in the same image as the outside of the part. I do however think some optimization is required in the textures department.
