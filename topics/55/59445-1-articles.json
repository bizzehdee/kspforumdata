What about adding some city graphics to make Kerbal look more alive?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What about adding weather to Kerbal for a little more realism? I live near NASA and there are times when flights ares scrubbed due to weather etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Adding paint and decals to the rockets?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Promotions for the Kerbal pilots? Once your hire them they would gain credentials and rank as they do missions and return safely. This would put a little more at stake if you send a seasoned pilot on a dangerous mission and could possibly loose him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T19:55:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood day, just a Friendly mod reminding you to read important topics that have been set to be stuck up the top of the thread lists such as the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhat not to suggest\u003C/a\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-09T21:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are good ideas though.
