Strategy converts Science or Rep into fund, but the return is rather low so it\u0027s fairly pointless. People have a beef with contract grinding as the contracts are rather arbitrary method of getting your space program to do stuff for fund. Logically there\u0027s little reason why a company would pay you to put up a space station for YOURSELF then pay you for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne method to inject some life into career mode is to introduce a macguffinite economy. A \u0022macguffinite\u0022 in this case refers to some valuable substance that can only be obtained in space away from Kerbin which provides a motivation and income source for the space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn many ways ore is already a macguffinite. It\u0027s an incredibly useful resource that can be converted into LFO and monoprop, which can then be further converted to electricity and delta-V. Unfortunately the only people who really need electricity and delta-V is you yourself, and understandably returning full ore tanks back to Kerbin for recovery produces very little profit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of ore, we could have another resource that may or may not have direct application in the space program but is in high demand on Kerbin and can only be obtained in large quantities in space. It can be anything: blutonium, helium-3, magnetic monopole, room temperature superconductor, anti-hydrogen, tiberium from Magic Boulder, even a cure for male pattern boldness. Whatever it is its price on recovery makes it worthwhile to harvest it and return it to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming the macguffinite resides in regolith just like Ore does, the current ISRU equipment could then be made to do dual purpose and be used for macguffinite mining. Survey scanner for example would have a toggle to switch between Ore and Macguffinite overylay, and ISRU converter would also be able to convert raw macguffinite ore into refined macguffinite. All that\u0027s needed is a new set of tanks to store the macguffinite. Although I would suggest we could also make use of a set of low tech extraction and refining equipment that is rather inefficient and must be manned by engineers and scientists to do work. I believe the current stock resource system is already setup with this in mind and it\u0027s trivial to add another resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe don\u0027t have to be restricted to one macguffinite either, it could be something interesting like there are two macguffinite, one tends to accumulate on worlds closer to Kerbol (eg, helium-3), while the other tend to accumulate on worlds away from Kerbol (eg, monopoles) with Kerbin SOI having a bit of both but not particularly rich in either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA player driven economy like this would make career players really \u0022own\u0022 their space programs instead of feeling like a grind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T03:11:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 03:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T08:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Logically there\u0027s little reason why a company would pay you to put up a space station for YOURSELF then pay you for it. \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretend its a government, or they get to use it for research,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Strategy converts Science or Rep into fund, but the return is rather low so it\u0027s fairly pointless.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt 100 funds per science, and a lab filled with 500 data over time makes 2,500 data, and one trip to duna gets me enough data to refill the lab many many times, and a trip to a new body easily yields thousands of new science poitns from all the various scans... with tthat strategy I can budget missions with costs in of hundreds of thousands of funds without worring about contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, if possible i can also take a couple tourists along too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you develop the tech you need to have cheap acces to LKO, its easy to make missions profitable just by taking a lab along.
