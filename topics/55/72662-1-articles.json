Lets say you have a 3.75 meter tank but you want to put 4 or 5 mainsails on it. Sticky engines is the answer to this. Basically what happens is first you put down the sticky adapter which has a size adaption for all tanks (.5-1, 1-2.5, 2.5 - 3.75). For this it would be a 3.75 to 2.5 then what happens is that it gives you 4-5 places to put your engines. If you put 4 engines you can use the middle for a decopuler to allow another bottoms stage or you could put a 5th engine there. The thing is when you put your 4 engines together they form a engine cluster where the edges are rounded to be like 1 3.75 m part. The only thing is if you take 1 engine off it reverts. Adding a 5th middle engine will just have it clip in there with extra power. Also right clicking any engine will allow you to disable this feature. I thought this idea would be great for ship builders and modders alike for a more modular way to add your engines \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Does anybody else think this could have any use because i really could for building my rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T11:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat, like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TVR-400L_Stack_Quad-Adapter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/TVR-400L_Stack_Quad-Adapter\u003C/a\u003E ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T12:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rvGwV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

What im saying is when you put the 4 engines on this special plate they will round off on the engines and form what looks like to be a engine cluster but it will seem to be more like 1 part instead of 4. Once you place the 4th engine it automatically undergoes this transformation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T16:38:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea, but more something for a mod I\u0027d say.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T16:47:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure Procedural Fairings added just such a device (called a \u0022thrust plate\u0022 or something like that) in it\u0027s recent 3.0 update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T17:55:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, surface attach could be enabled on engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 Mainsails don\u0027t actually fit under a 3.75 tank without engines sticking out the sides, so getting fairings around those would be tricky. Otoh if an engine cluster does fit flush with the sides of a tank then the ends of the fairing only need to fit the bottom of the tank to which the cluster is mounted, and the top of a properly sized decoupler below the cluster. That\u0027s not all that different from the automagic fairings of the stock engines, except that it would have to be a function of stack decouplers instead of engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedPine","CreatedById":95532,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-24T08:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe OP is awkwardly worded but I get what he\u0027s saying.
