Stereotypes make people feel like they have to fit into those stereotypes, cause they are a social animal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T04:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kibble\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kibble\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s profiling, even if its not explicit. In English, you can\u0027t talk about somebody without saying \u0022he\u0022 or \u0022she\u0022 or \u0022Mr.\u0022 or \u0022Ms.\u0022, and so gender immediately becomes the first trait the listener knows of said person. When things are passed along in everyday conversation, they become important to public perception, subconsciously or not. \u003Cp\u003EWhen the first trait anybody knows of anybody is gender, it feels like you don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eknow \u003C/em\u003Ethe person until you\u003Cem\u003E know their gender! \u003C/em\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9And that is sexism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you know the English language uses almost no gender for words? I don\u0027t really understand why this bothered no one until now. Also, I don\u0027t know where that should be sexism as long as you don\u0027t explicitely exclude a specific gender.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I couldn\u0027t even find the word \u0022crewed\u0022 in any dictionary I have here, although it lists the word \u0022manned\u0022 without referring to any gender.
