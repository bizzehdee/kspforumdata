As you retain ownership of the sat and you\u0027re not bound to keep it there for any time bigger than 10 seconds\u00A0( other thing that could be done is to enforce stabilty for more time ...\u00A0say, a year or two ) you\u0027re in your right to do two contracts with the same sat ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo , in other words: IMHO you could either ( or both ) put predelivered by the contract company sats to orbit ( and then lose ownership ) and/or keep the current contracts, but enfoce stabilty for more time. Both would adress your point without major fuss \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-03T00:27:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2016 12:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-03T00:30:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hate most of the pats tests, and many are note remotely reasonable.
