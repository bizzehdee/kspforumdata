I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a long time (probably not as many hours as many of you - whatever) and I constantly have this problem.

We already have blue highlighting on parts that we\u0027ve not unlocked but are available for testing, but those we HAVE unlocked have no such highlighting. I would like those highlighted as well.\n\nAnd when you right click them (for the extra stats) there should be a little \u0022contract: Test this part traveling between 1200m/s and 1500m/s at between 50m and 53m altitude.

Ultimately, I want an easier way to see the contracts I care about during flight. Even if the contract window remembers which contracts are collapsed and which are expanded on a per-ship basis, this would help a lot. Since the contract window is so small in-flight, a more extreme solution would be to only carry certain contracts on a certain flight, but you\u0027d probably want the ability to change your mind - view any other contract - in flight, so it wouldn\u0027t have to be that permanent."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T19:50:30Z","Content":"**[MOD - Changed thread title for clarity.]**"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T21:31:13Z","Content":"I wouldn\u0027t be opposed.
