And some address it well... It\u0027s the feel for so many mods. For me the game simply isn\u0027t enjoyable without some mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deadly Reentry: I still can\u0027t understand why this isn\u0027t stock. The impact on difficulty is negligible and the contribution it makes for challenge, realism and fun is huge;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Engineer: If I kept myself within Kerbin\u0027s SOI I could manage without it but for me it\u0027s unthinkable to try a planet transfer without at least KE. Not to mention building rockets would be dull without a real-time dV output;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal Attachment System: EVA is a gimmick without this mod. It gives depth, purpose and fun to going on an EVA;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Station Science: Again, gives further depth to the game by giving variety to space stations and more ways to collect science;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- TAC Life Support: This gives extra depth on planing longer missions;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Remote Tech: This also gives extra depth on planing longer missions;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonorable mention for: Docking Port Alignment Indicator and NavUtilities as Without them I\u0027d spend most of the time spamming F9 while trying to land;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion (this is personal ofc), these mods expand the very basic list of features the game is lacking. DR, TAC LS, RT wouldn\u0027t even necessarily need to be integrated as-is. They could be tweaked (for example: instead of food, oxygen and water there could just be a \u0022life support\u0022 resource) to conform with Squad\u0027s vision of the game and be toggled in the difficulty options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR, KE and KAS are mods that I can\u0027t imagine the game without. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEVA has no depth at all\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. The only thing engineers can do is fix flat tires and solar panels if I\u0027m not mistaken... How this can be considered a completed feature is beyond me. And the amount of trial and error required for inexperienced players to do anything meaningful would be daunting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAnd I feel I have to say this again... When I list a couple of mods I don\u0027t mean they all have to be included as they currently exist. I just mean the general features provided by them\u003C/span\u003E (simple life support (just one resource), simple differences between antennas (just range and ignore block, shape, delay, etc), simple EVA activities (other then \u0022situation report\u0022, plant flag and collect sample), etc) make the vanilla game feel \u0022complete\u0022. Without them the game feels incomplete. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I play in a heavily modded game (I won\u0027t even talk about the lack of a proper win64 version because I know it\u0027s not ) so I have plenty of other mods. I don\u0027t need mods to enjoy the game. Most of them I can easily live without. It\u0027s just that these make the game feel complete as it still lacks a lot of features. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing gold without some (or all) of these features means declaring a unfinished and unpolished game as \u0022complete\u0022 which, as much as I love KSP, it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know there\u0027s still a new update and maybe by then the game will be fully polished and balanced and tweaked.

If that makes me less authoritative, well, I\u0027m at a disadvantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also largely agree with the broad sentiment of the first post, which I take to be (so you can see what I\u0027m agreeing with), \u0022Squad has created a masterpiece of a game that has oodles more content than we have any real reason to expect, especially when compared to other games. The game as it is right now, along with the promises made for the 1.0 release, will be a fully featured game when it\u0027s released.\u0022 I freely recognize (and applaud) that Squad has gone above and beyond in making KSP one of the best games there is and single-handedly setting the bar for the genre. (Possibly even creating the genre.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy concern over the 1.0 release has very little to do with wanting more features. Oh, sure, I\u0027d love a few more things - like reentry heat, life support, an extra planet, etc. - but I recognize that, as it is now, I have no real right to expect those things, and a company must necessarily cut a product at some point. They have to say, \u0022All right, this is it - from here on out all new releases are for support; this is the \u0027final\u0027 product,\u0022 or they\u0027ll never get it out the door. That\u0027s one of two ways for software to die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy concern is over the other way for software to die: being released to a bad reception. I want to hold the 1.0 release off just a wee bit longer - not to shoehorn in more content, but precisely because they are going to shoehorn in more content. 1.0 is a monster of a release. It\u0027s going to have a lot of bugs, and there\u0027s no telling how many bugs there will be without fairly extensive testing; testing that, I can tell you as a former QAer for medical software, just plain won\u0027t be extensive enough due to the nature of the development cycle. (Not Squad\u0027s development cycle, which I know nothing specific about. But truly new features like this - especially this large - do best if they get a round or two of \u0027beta testing\u0027 - that is, give the software to real users and ask them for detailed and specific feedback. And Squad has a whole community here, many of whom I\u0027m sure would be willing to give that feedback.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Squad releases a game that has enough of any: bugs, strange workflows, poorly written tutorials, features that feel \u0027incomplete\u0027 especially to the uninitiated, arcane or difficult controls, poorly explained controls, glitches, visual \u0027holes\u0027 (like missing IVAs), poor user feedback, lack of user feedback, misleading user feedback, or gross instability (whether ultimately their fault or not), then chances are good the game will get a bad reception. This is difficult to evaluate by current reviews, for two reasons: one, because reviewers are probably more favorable to KSP while it\u0027s in early access due to the understanding that it\u0027s not complete, and two, because reviewers aren\u0027t KSP\u0027s target audience. They\u0027re a lossy metric.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if KSP pans, Squad quite likely will drop the project. (They are, after all, in this to make money. I couldn\u0027t blame them in the least for this reaction.) And I love KSP. Furthermore, I want other people, who aren\u0027t yet in this community, to love KSP, rather than be turned off by any of the problems I mentioned above. Sure, if Squad fumbles and drops KSP, it\u0027s no skin off my nose personally - I\u0027ll still have the final release version of their software, and whatever mods I need to make it what I want it to be. But I want Squad to succeed, because I want them to be rewarded for this awesome thing they have done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T19:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe have already had an official response.
