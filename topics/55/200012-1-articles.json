The non-spherical nature of Gilly makes it a really bad fit for the time-warp stopper, as you call it. But at least you can burn through it with a little fuel\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe map view problem is a real nuisance, though. I don\u0027t see any reason for it to be like it is. Things parked on the surface of Gilly look like they\u0027re floating in map view. Even on much larger planets, the difference between an object on the surface and the surface itself is sometimes apparent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
