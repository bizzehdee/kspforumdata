I wanted to see what everyone else would like to see going forward, and there thoughts on my suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe got a content boost with the NASA pack, some bug fixes and it looks like .24 will include more gameplay updates with contracts and other things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that being said, I really like our mod community and I think the developers have done a wonderful job supporting mods so early in the development. But, some people still struggle with installing mods, getting them to work, and crashing because they have too many. As well as mishaps, bugs and many other user errors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really appreciate some work done towards the goal of a more elegant system for mod loading in-game. Either through the launcher or some other in-game process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso some built in error checking for mods. As well as a way to prevent the game from crashing when there are too many mods (out of memory) or there is a conflict from a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it has already been put on the list of future features and I am not asking for this to be done by 0.25 just that it be put up on the board and some open discussions take place and actually start planning it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to see my Kerbals inside my ship from the outside, and also chairs to have an IVA first person mode.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T18:49:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot to be \u003Cem\u003Ethat guy\u003C/em\u003E or anything....but 0.24 isn\u0027t even out yet...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manuelasa1999","CreatedById":10304,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T18:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greenfire32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greenfire32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enot to be \u003Cem\u003Ethat guy\u003C/em\u003E or anything....but 0.24 isn\u0027t even out yet...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat doesn\u0027t matter for talking abaut 0.25...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see the GP2 andGP3 in the 0.25 or an life support update but with little differences from the mods, maybe they can add a new resource to the manned pods called Life Support that decreases depending of the number of kerbals, life support recycler and the best important: Making kerbals need electricity for beeing on the capsules, they shouldn\u0027t die but the spacecraft should be unmaneubrable\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T19:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Life support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Reentry heat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) MUCH better sound effects\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Kerbal construction in orbit (astronaut building in space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Weather\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Maintenance for reusable craft and turn around time for each ship\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Launch towers and gangways\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T22:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, yeah, generally we wait until each version is out before going on to discuss the next version.
