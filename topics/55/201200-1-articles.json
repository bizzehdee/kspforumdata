Which is fine and all, and makes it easy to eventually find what craft your looking for. However, once you have dozens or\u00A0hundreds of craft, it becomes very unwieldy. To solve this problem, I propose a very simple solution: folders. Give the select craft window folders. If a player has 15 variants of a rocket, they can put all 15 into a folder which takes up a single line, and not have to scroll past all 15 every they want to access a craft in the back half of the alphabet.\u00A0That way, players can group up craft and organize them much better in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilding on the above, once players start putting craft into folders, it\u0027ll be easier to lose where you saved a ship. So, if folders are implemented, it would probably be a good idea to add a search feature too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noah Foloni","CreatedById":209396,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T01:02:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nY e s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T11:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, yes, yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has been suggested several\u00A0times before.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the same system should be applied to the Tracking Station for vessels in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T19:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several mods which have addressed the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GuessingEveryDay","CreatedById":203507,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-24T19:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223944607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616613233\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are several mods which have addressed the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm...
