I\u0027d like to see, alongside courage and bravery, two more attributes: Science and Prestige.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA percentage of science earned by a Kerbal on a mission is added to his total; he gets some of the science for ship-wide experiments, and all of the science from his EVA reports and soil samples and other future EVA experiments. After a (relatively low) amount of science, the Kerbal can be assigned a \u0027Mission Science Specialist\u0027 role; this means that the Kerbal will be a specialist scientist who gets ALL of the science from a mission; that is, if Jeb and Bill go up, and Bill is set as a specialist, he gets all the science points. This makes Bill more valuable more quickly, and gives you a reason both to send him into space and to keep him alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving earned that science, Bill now needs something to do with it, otherwise it\u0027s just an arbitrary number like Courage and Stupidity. Well, one issue we have at the moment is that there are not many science experiments, and as such they are all a bit overpowered to make up for it. Having a Kerbal with a high Science score on board should unlock \u0027new\u0027 experiments on the same science equipment parts. That is, with just Jeb on board, there would only be one right-click option for science; with Dr. Bill on board, there could be lots. This means we can earn more from science, but also means that science experiments can start off worth a bit less; at the moment it\u0027s possible to max out the research tree within a few hours of playing. This would make it harder to do that, and give Dr. Bill value and purpose. An alternative, if that\u0027s too difficult to code, is to just simply make the same experiments worth more when run with a better scientist on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about poor Jeb, non-specialist? Well, astronauts should also get a percentage of the prestige points towards their score. Completed a docking? \u002B1000 prestige for Bill and Jeb. Now we can set Jeb as our Mission Commander, since Bill already has his role. All of the prestige points will now go to Jeb; earned in the usual way. Again, Jeb becomes more valuable and gives us a reason to send him up and to bring him back safely. Jeb can also earn some individual Prestige points like Dr. Bill can: prestige for time spent in EVA, prestige for fixing parachutes, landing gear and solar panels; prestige for planting a flag, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can we do with Jeb\u0027s prestige points? Well, what does having an expert pilot do? Makes it easier to fly the craft. Some ideas for this are things like better indicators: radar altitude, docking alignment indicators, landing prediction indicators, perhaps setting hard limits on things like fuel level (so we don\u0027t accidentally burn away the fuel we need for re-entry while trying to dock), or even functions that currently are the preserve of MechJeb like hovering or rendezvous maneuver-node calculating (this will make it both easier, if a player is very good at everything *except* hovering, so they get punished less for that; and harder: rather than just installing MechJeb, people can work towards getting these functions in a way that suits the game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this system would deal with budgets in a way that keeps the game fun, and give astronauts a purpose beyond planting flags.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-28T04:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2013 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by GavinZac\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T04:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is probably one of the best budget-related suggestions I\u0027ve ever heard.

Originally he planned to focus on budgets, money and the economy, but the idea now is to polish up science, fixing the obvious issues with it and fleshing out the related mechanics more so that the system is as complete as it possibly can be at this stage of development. So budgets will be in 0.24 probably. Why? Well he said that science polishing is not the only thing that will be in 0.23, he did say that a feature that kept getting pushed back too much will be the other focus of 0.23 development (not resources). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaxmaps or C7 also mentioned in the last squadcast that the next update will take a bit longer to develop than 0.22 IIRC.

My guess is it will be re-entry heat and possibly an aerodynamics rework since those will change how we build crafts a lot, and such a change would require a part cost or income re-balancing if it was added after an economy. But that\u0027s just speculation on my part, there could be some other feature that got delayed a lot and is needed now that I may not know about.

However, having to do repetitive things encourages you to set up an infrastructure to make it easy to do those repetitive things.

Government missions are funded based on prestige, and can be supplemented by your own cash reserves, are usually science-oriented and don\u0027t necessarily earn cash but they do earn a lot of prestige for successful completion. These could even be thought of as the \u0022main quests\u0022 in the game. On the side, there are private sector missions that are entirely funded by your cash reserves, usually don\u0027t earn much science, but earn cash as a reward.
