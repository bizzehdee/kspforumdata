Ditto for things like girder segments or hitchhiker modules or maybe even wings and fuselages. Like I said, I don\u0027t know enough about how these things work, but it would be cool it did to reduce part count and strengthen joints and the like."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:34:24Z","Content":"Have ou checked out PartWelding?"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T14:35:26Z","Content":"UbioZur Welding is a mod that does it, but it seems to be broken since 0.90.\n\nThis would definitely be helpful, mostly for space stations. Need 10 orange tanks for your mega-station? You can save 20 parts on each individual orange tank just by merging each dockingport-tank-dockingport assembly into a single part!"},{"CreatedByName":"mattssheep4","CreatedById":146984,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:17:32Z","Content":"I\u0027ll check it out, thanks."}]}
