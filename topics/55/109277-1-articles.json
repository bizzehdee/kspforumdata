I am also aware that work is supposed to be commencing on porting to Unity 5 now, but this is for in the meantime.** ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAlright, so over the last week and a bit, I\u0027ve been experimenting, and from the title, you can all probably guess exactly what it is that I\u0027ve been experimenting with. Yes, I\u0027ve been looking at that prototype x64 player that\u0027s been bundled with the last few versions of Unity and saw a brief but sadly marred service with KSP. Well, I wasn\u0027t all too happy when support for that mode was withdrawn, what with me using some hefty mods in my copy of the game, so I set about getting my own x64 version up and running for 1.0.\n\n*\u0022What? Are you mad, mate?! There\u0027s a reason we left that dead and buried!\u0022*\n\nWell, yes, like I said, it had a marred stint of service with KSP. Bugs galore. CTDs. BSoDs (well, I never actually heard of BSoDs happening with x64, but people like exaggerations, right?).\n\nThe point is it was rough and tumble for most of those who elected to use it. I was one of the luckier ones, and didn\u0027t actually have all that much trouble. Sure, I had problems, and 0.90 was about the worst it got for me, crash-wise.\n\n*\u0022Why are you telling us this? What\u0027s this thread even for??\u0022*\n\nHush. I\u0027m here to tell you about the results of my experimental KSP 1.0 x64 edition. So, without further ado, here\u0027s the rundown.\n\n-----\n\nThe setup was identical to the original method identified all the way back in 0.23.5/0.24. [**See the original thread here.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82118-KSP-64bits-on-Windows-%28this-time-it-s-not-a-request%29) The only difference was that KSP currently uses Unity 4.6.4, not 4.3.3. From there, it was just starting up the game as normal. Module Manager confirmed that KSP was running x64, so that was a good start. I\u0027d loaded up all the mods I have that still worked from 0.90, including the very RAM-hungry [**Astronomers Visual Pack: Interstellar**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102145-0-25-Astronomer-s-Visual-Pack-Interstellar-V2?highlight=astronomer) for EVE. That was the biggy; x86 KSP couldn\u0027t handle it even when it was the only mod installed.\n\nSo, all the assets loaded up fine, and we get to the main menu. I\u0027m not sure how many of you experienced this in 0.90 or earlier, but the x64 versions would actually pause for a moment on the main menu screen before all the options came up. That\u0027s gone in 1.0; it\u0027s instantaneous once the little solar system loading icon has vanished. And obviously, it hasn\u0027t crashed by exceeding a memory limit, which is good; that\u0027s the entire purpose of x64, after all ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNext up was to load a save. This is where things would go wrong for me in 0.90; I\u0027d try to load my save and it would crash the game, so I had a workaround that left me loading a scenario every time I started the game just to give it a kick-start. That\u0027s also gone in 1.0; I can load my save just fine now.\n\nWe are now at the space centre screen. Sometimes, x64 would crash if you tried to enter the VAB or SPH, or any building for that matter. This hasn\u0027t happened to me at all in 1.0.\n\nWe\u0027re looking a lot more stable already, huh? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThat was the limit of my problems with x64 prior to 1.0; I never encountered anything else, but it\u0027s my understanding that the x64 version would often crash regardless of the circumstances. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve not experienced a single crash at all when playing with this modified version of the game.\n\nOf course, it isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t perfect. I did have to get a fresh install sorted out when I realised it was neither Universe Replacer nor Texture Replacer that was causing the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Positive\\_X\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 skybox texture to not load (with neither mod installed and just using the stock skybox, everything loaded fine), but that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s fixed now. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know if it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll happen again, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not happening now.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure if this next one is a problem inherent to KSP regardless of whether or not it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s x86 or x64, but the game can (not always) also develop a bit of a frame stutter when piloting a craft that can get to be annoying, but it doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t completely freeze up. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s solvable about 50% of the time by exiting to the space centre and then returning to the flight. It is also possible for there to be some freezes that last for a few seconds at most, but the game just continues as it was before the freeze.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nThat\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s it, actually. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s all the bad stuff I can think of. No crashes, just annoyances.\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWait, wait, wait, are you saying x64 got BETTER??\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\nWell, yeah. Here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my summary.\n\nFirst, the positives.\n\n1. Much higher RAM limit, as expected (duh).\n\n2. Absolutely no crashes on loading.\n\n3. No pause or delay when entering the main menu after watching the \u0027little solar system loading icon\u0027 (technical term).\n\n4. No crashes on starting a save.\n\n5. No crashes upon entering buildings.\n\n6. No crashes in flight.\n\nNow, the negatives (that I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve encountered).\n\n7. Potential for frame stutter, sometimes pretty bad, but usually solvable by exiting to the space centre then returning to the flight (about 50% effective). The more extreme but less common variant of this is that the game will freeze for a few seconds instead of a few milliseconds before resuming.\n\n8. Potential to interfere with the loading of some assets, though only with those of mods.\n\n**Basically, the prototype x64 player is actually in the most useable state it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been in since we first found out about it.** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd to think that Squad went and dropped it before testing it out themselves. Tut tut. Leaving the dirty work to the players. Well, player. Singular. Just me.\n\n*Actually*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\nThis is where you guys could come in. As with any scientific experiment (and believe me, this is *very* scientific), there need to be repeat readings, which I have tried as much as possible, but there also needs to be verification from others to increase reliability. So, I\u0027m asking anyone who\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s willing to test to download the [**4.6.4 version of Unity (select \u0027Unity Editor\u0027 from the drop-down lists)**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). Refer to the original x64 post linked above for instructions on what to do with that download (when you get to the Mono.dll, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d also install the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 folder that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s alongside it).\n\n**OBVIOUSLY, do this on a separate install!** Get [**Module Manager**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219-1-00-Module-Manager-2-6-1-%28Apr-27%29-An-ode-to-code-duplication) installed too to verify that you are indeed running x64, then cram a load of hefty mods into the Gamedata folder to check the RAM limit. Once you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re sure that you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got an x64 version up and running, start testing it out. Hopefully you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll also come to realise that this version is vastly superior to any previous version we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d been offered.\n\nIf you made it this far down the page, then well done, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not quite finished yet.\n\n*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat?! How much more?!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2*\n\nNot much. Basically, I want to compile a list of known issues here **(see below)**, if there are any more to be found. Should you encounter anything that\u0027s any degree of bad (from mild bee sting to global armageddon), post it, and I\u0027ll *try* to keep tabs on what\u0027s happening. With a little luck, this thread will garner some attention from Squad provided the overall result of this new x64 player is good, and that can only be determined by your testing! So get out there and test, I\u0027m not paying you by the hour! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\n*\u0022You\u0027re not paying us at all!\u0022*\n\nNuh-uh; **Rep points for all who provide valuable input!** This is a little bit of \u0027work\u0027 I\u0027m asking you guys to indulge in, so I will offer a little something for your contributions ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThanks for reading.

Potential for frame stutter, sometimes pretty bad, but usually solvable by exiting to the space centre then returning to the flight (about 50% effective). The more extreme but less common variant of this is that the game will freeze for a few seconds instead of a few milliseconds before resuming.\n\n2. Potential to interfere with the loading of some assets, though only with those of mods.\n\n3. The \u0027right-click bug\u0027. The one which can sometimes leave you right-clicking on a part a million times before it opens its menu, and then a million clicks before it closes again. Also affects the middle mouse button, which is noticeable after you\u0027ve shifted the camera around with that MMB function. Not an overly serious bug, but it can be very annoying. I don\u0027t know whether or not this is inherent to KSP or just the x64 player, so I\u0027m listing it on the off chance it\u0027s x64.\n\n4. (Reported by Thiagobs) Potential GUI issues on scene changes (e.g. KSC to VAB). Persist for longer if more RAM is in use. Menus from other scenes will appear momentarily, most notably the astronaut complex.\n\n5. (Reported by AlphaAsh) Possible issues with building tiers not functioning correctly, showing a fully upgraded facility despite being a lower tier. Apparently solvable, at least temporarily, by exiting to the main menu and reloading the save, OR by loading up the VAB/SPH and then returning to the Space Centre view.\n\n6. (Reported by ObsessedWithKSP) (Very minor) Left click doesn\u0027t work properly after exiting the game. Right clicking after exiting should instantly fix this.\n\n7. (Not really x64) Some mods will still disable themselves if they detect that they\u0027re running on the x64 version.\n\n8. (Reported by John FX and myself) Reverting to the VAB/SPH can sometimes cause the parts and sub-assemblies to just disappear, requiring you to exit the editor and then returning to it in order to fix it. Relatively minor, but still an issue.\n\n-----\n\nThis thread isn\u0027t the only one, it would seem.

I\u0027ve never used PreciseNode, so I can\u0027t comment on that...\n\nAll in all, don\u0027t look at this x64 experiment as a \u0022hey, let\u0027s use x64, it works well! Ditch your x86(x32) and use this instead\u0022... Always assume it will be broken, and even if it isn\u0027t, assume it will break eventually, so don\u0027t go playing with your main save on this."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T14:57:24Z","Content":"\\*sees this thread\\* Yisss!!!

According to the log, EVE\u0027s lack of exception handling that usually doesn\u0027t cause an issue, finally killed KSP. Considering how out-dated the last stable build of that mod is, I\u0027m not surprised or bothered.\n\nThere is some stuttering in the kerbal-cam windows, just like the last hack but it isn\u0027t as severe. There is some strange rendering of the astronaut complex between scene switches. This time around it\u0027s appearing almost kerb-cam like in the top right, rather than full-screen. It\u0027s only for a moment.\n\nI\u0027m also using the latest dev-build of MechJeb and that does seem to interact badly with KSP intermittently, in that I can lose control of a vessel until I switch back to KSC and then back to the vessel. It\u0027s a minor thing.\n\nI haven\u0027t confirmed whether the unreliable level of KSC\u0027s facilities is due to Kerbal Konstructs. I\u0027ll get that done for the next update for this thread. I\u0027ll compile a list of mods I\u0027m using for the next update as well.\n\nI\u0027m happy to continue using x64 KSP on Windows.
