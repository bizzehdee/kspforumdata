Like the 3.75 meter parts, the 1.875 meter parts will be made by a new spacecraft company.

And then, at last, but not least, the Kerbworks-45 Engine, which has MORE POWER and thrust, and fuel consumption than a LV-30. But it has thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, there would be a 1.875m SAS module, and a remote guidance unit, called the RC-002M ATV Core. Of course, for looks, there would be a 1.875 meter-to-1.25 meter adapter, and a 1.875 meter to a 2.5 meter adapter. And, just for fun, there would be a 1.875m command module called the Kerbworks \u0022Adagio\u0022 Command Module, that can contain two kerbonauts. and at last, but not least, there would be a 1.875 meter hitchhiker module called the PPD-05 Mini Hitchiker Storage Module that can maintain three kerbonauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and for stations, there would be a 1.875 meter docking port called the Clamp-O-Tron Teenager.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-29T22:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd why would this be a good thing for KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying it\u0027d be a bad thing, but I honestly don\u0027t see the point of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sylandro","CreatedById":80729,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-29T22:53:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor people who want a happy medium between 1.25 meter parts and 2.5 meter parts.
