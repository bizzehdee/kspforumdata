Folks who\u0027ve been playing this for quite some time. They know every nook and cranny of the Mun, Minmus, Kerbal, and all the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s fine and good for them, but I fear that I\u0027ll know every inch of Kerbin myself by the time the game is finally \u0027released\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m both wondering if and suggesting a remake of Kerbin before release, or as I began to type this a procedural generated Kerbin. That way, while the planet is very similar the actual biomes of the planet would be different. ... Of course, then the thought went to that each planet could go that rout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, Suggestion, Question...

However, they\u0027d talked about having \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E solar systems potentially be somewhat randomized. But the reason they want all the planets we have now(and any future planets or planetoids) to be as they are is \u0027cause it creates focal points for communal experiences. Or something like that. Basically, we\u0027ve all launched our first rocket and many of us had it explode. We\u0027ve all tried to get to the mun and some of us succeeded. At some point, all of us are going to go to duna or moho or jool and so on and we\u0027ll be able to relate to each other very specifically because the planet\u0027s always the same distance, the gravities are always the same and what-not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there was talk quite a while ago about faster than light travel or warp drives....and the ability to jump to other systems far beyond Kerbol. I think it was hypothesized that those would be randomized to an extent...because that would be the deep unknown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, that was...I think Harvester just thinking out loud about something he could see happening in the far distant future for KSP. I think they\u0027ve pretty much canned that idea for the time being, so don\u0027t go looking forward to it or anything. Like those resources...I want them still so bad T_T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I think it\u0027s fine that some people know every inch of every planet, moon and whatever else might be out there. I also think it\u0027s fine that someday before release, I may well know the entire planet of kerbin like the back of my hand(though that\u0027s unlikely for me \u0026gt;.\u0026gt; ). You could always do what some people do and just not play until the game\u0027s more feature complete. I know I\u0027m still holding off(kinda) until career mode\u0027s just a little more fleshed out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
