Of course, KSP on PC already has this feature with the latest versions, but I play on console, which is still on 1.10. But yeah, seems like it would be really useful, but unfortunatly the KSP teams have lied to everyone, since they said it would be out by the end of last year, and of course there\u0027s been absoulutly nothing. NOt even a delay announcement! or even a cancellation! or litterally any recognition of what they\u0027ve done wrong! So we\u0027re still stuck on 1.10, and we don\u0027t have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E in stock... but it would be nice if we could have that, like everyone else does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richmountain112","CreatedById":211175,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-23T03:26:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOuter Planets Mod!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need to give the outer planets some love, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Iapetus7342","CreatedById":233205,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-05T22:53:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChatterer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestock (original and plus)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNear and Far future technologies\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOPM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nany interstellar pack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and Scatterer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEditor Extensions Redux\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny mod that gives kerbin rings\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny colony pack\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter burn time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-05-28T14:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe are missing a great \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E mod for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
