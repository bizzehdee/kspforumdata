It seems that if you\u0027re trying to mess with textures outside of what KSP is doing on its own you might be setting yourself up for problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not using ATM myself (and didn\u0027t in .90 either), upon updating Texture Replacer last night where it no longer tries to do texture compression and such, my memory use went down 500 MB. Yeah, went from barely able to run (yeah after 30 min to 1 hour, I was at 3.4 GB), now I hover around 2.6 GB for hours. My install is reasonably heavily modded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stable version of EVE is from .25. I know I\u0027m getting quite a few nullrefs from it and the overhaul isn\u0027t quite ready yet, so, that could be an issue as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:27:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I\u0027m still on KSP 0.90 waiting for all of my favorite mods to get updated to the new version, but in the meantime, I\u0027ve begun wondering if the new version has alleviated any of the memory issues from the previous versions? Being the type to run a heavily modded game, I\u0027m still looking forward to the day that I don\u0027t have to babysit the memory monitor to play a couple of hours at a time.
