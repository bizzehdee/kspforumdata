of my own designs per say (everything i have now uses shock cones on the front of every stack since its the lowest drag option available), but there are enough options that would be ruined by this.\u00A0 That and the whole realism discussion makes no sense to me, its actually less realistic to limit the ability to feed air throughout the plane imo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example placing engines on nose cones that are attached to wings.\u00A0 While extremely unpractical, who says that it is impossible to bleed air from the fuselage and feed it through the wing (air ducts in there) to the engines.\u00A0 While it may not be practical (and there is a reason virtually all planes have intake in front of the engine), who says it is impossible to rout air through wings, or structural parts?\u00A0 If you really think about it, it would be less realistic to impose this limitation since there is no physical law that states you cannot feed air throughout the vessel with air ducts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pegasus_eng.jpg\u0022 height=\u0022213\u0022 src=\u0022http://www.turbokart.com/images/pegasus_eng.jpg\u0022

nozzles.\u00A0 There is absolutely no physical reason you could not extend the ducts in length and perhaps feed them through the wing to the wingtip.\u00A0 Im not claiming this is practical on any level whatsoever, but it is perfectly possible to both feed thrust to other parts of the plane, as well as feed intake from any part to any other part of the plane via ducting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow as for adding penalties for not stack placed i think i would agree with (provided it doesnt waste any dev time since bugs are way more important then some minor mechanic like this), such ducting would considerably increase the drag and resistance to airflow, limiting the air moreso then a classic stack mounted intake, but it should still be possible to have air move from stack to stack as desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
