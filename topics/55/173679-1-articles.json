They seem random and repetitive at the same time. I know how it sounds but once the game recognizes you like a certain kind of contract you get spammed with it. Anyway, it\u0027s not good. What would make it good is a simplistic mission designer:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. You pick the first node and it\u0027s a \u0027body\u0027 node. It defines around which body you will need to do stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. To the \u0027body\u0027 node you attach other nodes underneath like \u0027test\u0027, \u0027perform\u0027, \u0027build\u0027 and whatever other objectives there are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gamedevtycoon/images/d/d3/Action-Sliders-991010.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130502140355\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAdjust reward slider.\u003C/a\u003E Pick how much reputation, money and science you want to get for the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach node would have its own reward or percent of reward (that could diminish after some usage because otherwise it would allow you to grind the same mission all the time). The UI would be simpler than mission builder. There would be no node-to-node connections. Just stacking them under the main \u0027body\u0027 node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen some people suggesting DLC should be partially free. I think this kind of contract builder would be a nice showcase of what mission builder is capable of. It would also greatly enhance career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-09T09:45:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2018 09:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Wjolcz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
