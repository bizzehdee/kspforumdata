Perhaps even have more powerful telescope cameras which could be used to earn science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally the RSR or remote situation reports could allow the user to take a \u0022crew report\u0022 of an unmanned ship, obviously this crew report would actually be made at the KSC so would require vast amounts of power compared to transmitting something small like goo results or thermal reading, since data would need to be transmitted both too and from the probe. Also the science gathered would be only 40% of the data received from a normal crew report, also prerequisites would need to be achieved for RSR to take place, this would include at least 1 remote camera and the obvious power requirements \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T13:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll these things can be easily done with mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Surface sampler: Scoop-O-Matic (uses stock surface sample experiment), DMagic Orbital Science (has own experiments)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rover camera: Panda Jager Laboratories has a Mastcam (It can also generate crew reports), use Hullcam mod to make your own camera.
