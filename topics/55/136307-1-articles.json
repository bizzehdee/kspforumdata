Just strip the reaction wheels, Monoprop storage and batteries\u00A0off the lander can, and adjust its weight accordingly, and we would at least have a part that fits in the visual style of all other 1,25m / Mk1 circular parts. For example, if we make this part the same weight as the Mk1 crew cabin but have only a capacity of 1 Kerbal, it would not become worsely balanced than it is now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the record: The Mk1 Crew Cabin *does* have hatches, in fact, it has one at each bulkhead end (at the attachment node). So if you want a super light exploit, slap a probe core on the side of the Mk1 crew cabin using cube struts or radial fuel tanks, leaving one end free after decoupling, and you can do exactly the same as the proposed part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-10T14:46:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2016 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Stoney3K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enceos","CreatedById":110725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-10T17:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/88466-xraylima/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002288466\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/88466-xraylima/\u0022\u003E@XrayLima\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0What you\u0027re looking for are the structural hatches from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/82833-105-stockalike-station-parts-expansion-06012016-105-update-and-bugfixes/\u0022\u003EStockalike Station Parts Expansion\u003C/a\u003E mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has two airlocks both surface and node attachable:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022GCnYlJu.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GCnYlJu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also some small\u00A0service airlocks in the UKS Kolonization mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of them have\u00A0space for one crew member.
