Each player is more or less assigned a Kerbal, as opposed to his/her own flying session. Reason for clarifying this was, while yes, Multiplayer is on the WNTS list, it\u0027s an entirely different concept NOT constrained by the same reason that doomed multiplayer to the WNTS list in the first place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T00:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, Telemachus extreme?

Mission control would be the only player that has access to the map screen and manoeuvre nodes and would thus be responsible for coordinating the mission. Any nodes they planned would still show up on the Nav ball of the other players. On the ship itself, there probably isn\u0027t enough to do on any given command pod to be worth splitting between players. But when a ship has more than one command pod, you could assign one player to each. So you could have one player in the mothership and one in the lander, for example. Or one controlling the ship and one handling the satellite probe it launches. The problem I forsee is that whoever is playing Michael Collins doesn\u0027t have much to do while he waits for Neil and Buzz to return.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scootersoup","CreatedById":92366,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T08:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn more advanced rockets you could have one Kerbonaut running science experiments once they become more complex (either in vanilla or through mods) and/or monitoring resource usage.
