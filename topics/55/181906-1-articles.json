So it occurred to me that instead of cluttering up the part descriptions with usage instructions, perhaps the part descriptions could have a link to a\u00A0KSPedia page about that part group, e.g. engine plates, fairings, decouplers/separators, or any other parts where the usage is not completely straightforward (and some things that might seem simple may seem confusing to new players). Even with things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s and heatshields, it could be useful to have the \u0027pro tip\u0027 available \u003Cs\u003Ethat they can be tweaked to reduce thrust, propellant load, or ablator (saves mass).\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0explaining what the tweakables can do or help with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnster_Space_Program","CreatedById":187334,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T00:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, that would be an improvement to what we currently have.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T03:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent idea! Having it interact with the part descriptions would be a great start, although I still want to see the engine properties in the part menu for quick reference.

It\u0027s far to compartmentalized in my opinion. There should be full tutorials in there that are more in depth for those who want to drill down into specifics. The quick overviews are fine, but they are just quick-start introductions at the moment. And now that there is a delta-V tool in the game there is no reason not to include a stock delta-V map and transfer window graph in there also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-02T04:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223533355\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022181906\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221549077176\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n, although\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003E I still want to see the engine properties in the part menu for quick reference.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh absolutely, I wouldn\u2019t take anything away from the part menu, just add a clickable question mark to it that links to a KSPedia page for more detailed information,\u00A0like how to use it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
