That also factors against this, I think. On the other hand, the pressure of Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere could be the trigger. How much pressure would it take to compress 433g of Pu-238 to critical mass? I know the shape affects critical mass as well, but only know that the heat units had cylindrical masses rather than spherical, but don\u0027t know the measurements. Depending on whether the RTGs maintain minimal structural integrity to this point might also be a factor, as having other plutonium masses nearby would help the plutonium reach critical mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENSA Disclaimer: Not trying to create a bomb here, the environment of Jupiter would probably be more difficult to create on Earth than a conventional nuclear bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ninja\u0027ed and derailed.

It isn\u0027t the pressure that \u0022releases a lot of energy\u0022, the pressure causes the plutonium to go supercritical. As radioactive materials decay, they release particles that bump into other plutonium particles causing them to decay and then they send out particles and so on. It\u0027s a chain reaction and it produces huge amounts of energy. But if the plutonium isn\u0027t at critical mass then it\u0027s not densely packed enough to cause a runaway chain reaction and nuclear explosion. Of course, getting it precisely right requires engineering, and as you\u0027ve been told simply putting some dynamite next to some uranium isn\u0027t going to do anything apart from get radioactive mess everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-28T15:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2013 03:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Person012345\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chri","CreatedById":62741,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T14:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...Here in America, we\u0027re really good at blowing stuff up and less good at knowing where the pieces land\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Neil deGrasse Tyson\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T15:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brody_Peffley\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brody_Peffley\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like this idea.
