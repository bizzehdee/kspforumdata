This is super annoying when it\u0027s the only thing that doesn\u0027t survive on a spaceplane that you want to be 100% reuseable, and iirc the shrouded ladders have the same heat tolerance as the static ones, which doesn\u0027t make a lot of sense to me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Kelvin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKelvin\u003C/a\u003E is the SI base unit for temperature.

For physics purposes, retractable parts should be considered to be flush with the surface. No drag, and no more heat than the parent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also should apply to folded solar panels, landing gear, and radial chutes.

I don\u0027t know if having a panel that can open and close to shield the parts inside should have zero effect on airflow, but there should be a dramatic difference between parts that fold away and those that just sit on the outside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T13:54:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed on all counts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
