From what I have heard squad say, it sounds like they see 1.0 as a sign that says \u0027this game has all the core features implemented\u0027 not \u0027this is a finished game\u0027. When they say they are leaving beta for 1.0, I recognise that they don\u0027t mean they are finished by any means. If they continue with their plan to go into a 1.0 release I imagine there will be updates focussed on bugfixes, optimisations and tweaking the systems that are in the game at the moment (e.g. Science) to both make the game more enjoyable and more stable. I also imagine that the game would be updated to unity 5 when it is released, whether or not the game was in beta.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy worry is not that the game will not improve but that public opinion of the game would drop as 1.0 would not be a release worthy of its title.
