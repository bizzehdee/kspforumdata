If you for example select only the 2.5 m parts, only these will be shown in the assembly as well as all adapter parts with a 2.5 m node. I don\u0027t know how to categorise the wing types, maybe the sorting can be used for canards/small wings/big wings?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think of this idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T15:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.90 will apparently overhaul the part category system and if I remember correctly, will enable you to create custom part categories so you can do that yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
