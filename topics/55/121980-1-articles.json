Maybe you\u0027re doing a multi-port connection for a stronger construction, or maybe you\u0027re self docking, or, well, any number of reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy, right? Action groups to the rescue. Just assign an action group to \u0022undock node\u0022... or... wait... should that be decouple node? And which of the docking ports should you assign to the action group? After all, a docking connection takes two ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, there\u0027s the rub. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any way to know which port will need to be \u0022undocked\u0022 (or \u0022decoupled\u0022). And, unfortunately, if you assign *all* the ports to undock (and decouple?) via the action group then it doesn\u0027t work, because *some* of the ports can\u0027t be undocked, and this seems to cause the whole action group to fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short, I think the undock/decouple action should be merged (there does not seem to be a good reason to have two functions that seem like they should be one), and also, please, please, allow the action group to undock whichever nodes can be undocked when multiple ports are put into the same group.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-29T18:50:22Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
