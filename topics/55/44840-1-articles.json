Other than the lag problem being fixed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see at least material collection and researching new technologies. Meaning if you go to the Mun and land maybe have a feature were you could approach the rocks and take a \u0022sample\u0022 to bring back to Kerbin for study. Have the space stations you build actually serve a purpose like unlocking new materials or technologies. But here is the best idea of all..... studying those monoliths to unlock \u0022alien technologies\u0022 or \u0022alien navigational maps\u0022 that take you on a journey through space to find the \u0022source.\u0022 Like in space oddyssey the very idea they were based on. The potential this game has is staggering and these ideas aren\u0027t all that extreme at its core all I\u0027m suggesting is basic object manipulation, adding some lines of story script and a some new models. The physics of the game doesn\u0027t have to change and you don\u0027t have to add any new planets or a new \u0022race.\u0022 Traveling outside the system to search for the \u0022source\u0022 can be in K.S.P. 2 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cheesy.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_cheesy.gif\u003C/a\u003E .

Then you could use this stargate-like orbital structure to warp to another solar system. Then I guess from there, you\u0027d have to find an already built stargate to get to the next one or possibly to get back, I don\u0027t know. But warping between solar systems is the planned endgame for KSP. There\u0027s supposed to be a few solar systems that\u0027re prebuilt so everyone\u0027s first warp adventures will be more or less comparable...then beyond that there\u0027s supposed to be procedurally generated solar systems. Of course, they could always dump that idea in favor of something more simple. I guess I wouldn\u0027t know about that. Would be really sad, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther people have suggested doing special science stuff at the munoliths and things like that, just for a nice boost to your science data and we already know that we\u0027ll be able to collect rock samples for whatever.
