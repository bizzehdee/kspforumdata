Some of the most galling offenders are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nrendezvous two vessels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ndock two vessels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntransfer crew between vessels\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nreturn from\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n...which have nothing to do with exploration. The first three are dull and mundane tasks dressed up as purposeful. If you\u0027re going to return, you\u0027ll return. If you\u0027re naturally sending a multi-part vessel, you\u0027ll do some docking. If you\u0027re just doing a one-launch\u00A0mission, none of these things may happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also suggest that once a player has achieved orbit around a body, then\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0moons of that body become viable options for the explore contract generator,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one other un-visited planet where available. This would result in the target of the explore contracts actually changing, since there would be a significant pool to draw from. As it stands, it\u0027s all too easy to get stuck with \u0022return from orbit of Laythe\u0022 while your probe is happily touring all the Joolian moons. I\u0027d sure have thought the news networks would be interested in sponsoring a landing on Pol or Bop, but apparently the only thing they want is a piece of the probe that orbited Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-28T17:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could read that contract as \u0022jump through these hoops then go home\u0022.\u00A0 You can also read it as steps\u00A0 3, 5, 7, and 9 of an Apollo-style landing.\u00A0 Or \u0022leave something neat in orbit on the way home\u0022.\u00A0 You are not limited to doing \u003Cstrong\u003Ejust\u003C/strong\u003E what the contract pays you to.\u00A0 Think adventurously and selfishly.\u00A0 What can you do with the money they\u0027re willing to pay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStation contracts are especially awesome like that.\u00A0 You can send any pile of anything as long as it has 1000 fuel, 6 kerbals, and 9 science instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for opening up other bodies for exploration, that actually used to be a problem. \u00A0The contract generator does not understand that some destinations are harder than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-28T17:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2017 05:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
