I\u0027d wager, many people are simply getting bored of collecting science, since it seems like the only thing to do in career mode, right now. The rest of the grinding complaints, I feel, come from trying too hard to get all science from individual biomes before moving on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, filling out the whole tech tree does not require sucking each biome dry. I don\u0027t have the numbers in front of me, but there is way more potential science around the Kerbol system then the total needed to complete the tech tree. You\u0027re probably most efficient if you only do 1 mission to each biome since each mission is bringing back the maximum points per trip. Once you\u0027ve exhausted all options for a first mission, then start revisiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, if you find it grindy right now, it\u0027s maybe because you\u0027re collecting from one biome at a time and that biome is exponentially decreasing in value each time you visit. The first 50% or so science points can be collected in just 2 missions, whereas to get the rest will take at least 4 more. I need to run the numbers to back this up, but you can see that those 4 missions are better spent visiting 2 new biomes than squeezing the first.

A good way to prevent boredom is to unlock more parts. I don\u0027t want to have to send out multiple copies of the same craft to say, 10 places, whether biome, moon, or planet in order to unlock the next node. I want to be able to improve my rockets with new parts fairly often depending on how well I fly. For instance, in my first 3 or 4 missions I went to minmus, the mun, and eve (didn\u0027t return from eve). That was my choice. Having done so, I was able to unlock parts I wanted. If I\u0027d done that and still didn\u0027t have much of anything unlocked I\u0027d feel like there was nothing to do but grind by repeatedly sending spacecraft out desperately looking for places I hadn\u0027t been to yet. It should take more than one mission to completely exhaust the information it is possible to gather from an area- but repeating a mission gives less and less science and is not infinitely repeatable. That makes going somewhere else more feasible but if you aren\u0027t able to then you can hit the same ones again a couple times so you have that part you need to go further. We do more than one mission to a place in real life. As for only a lab being able to process data, when the astronauts landed on the moon you can bet they were talking about what they saw to mission control and they didn\u0027t need a lab to describe what the rock right in front of them looked like. They couldn\u0027t do a complex analysis of its chemical make-up, but that doesn\u0027t mean they couldn\u0027t transmit what they could observe. Eva reports should be transmitted because the kerbal should be answering questions asked by KSC and is actually currently in the environment. Crew reports are more of a write-up after the fact where it\u0027s only by memory but there\u0027s more time to think and describe better. These should be worth almost as much transmitted as not because the bonus of a vessel having gone somewhere and returned covers the interviews on return, but should take a semi-long time to transmit since they\u0027d be either a long essay needing error prevention due to slow analog communication (or some other excuse) or the kerbal needs time to speak to mission control if they are to transmit. (better excuse)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway a thermometer or any of those other simple sensors is not something which needs to be returned or processed. If it\u0027s -160 degrees it\u0027s -160 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austincurr","CreatedById":31939,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T16:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Themohawkninja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat\u0027s kind of how it works right now.
