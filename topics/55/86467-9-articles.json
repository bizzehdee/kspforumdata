Not sure if someone suggested it already, didnt see it. Then have the old wings not hold fuel, since they are too thin. So we still have the choice, but they are functionally different so that its no longer a case of duplicate parts. If you dont want fuel in the newer wings you can empty them. That would be my simple solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETed of course is right in saying that the Great Spaceplane Part Overhaul is still ongoing so things might change and make (mostly) everyone happy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T22:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ted\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ted\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegarding the old parts being released as a legacy pack by us. That is something we\u0027ve discussed internally and do want to come back to the idea at a later date. However, as the Great Spaceplane Part Overhaul is still ongoing with the help of Porkjet we\u0027d much prefer to gather them all up and put them up for download when it\u0027s completed, if that\u0027s something we do decide to do. I do agree it\u0027s a great idea though and thankfully some folks have stepped in a provided them for download in the meantime. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey thanks for the response.

Fueled wings are about as realistic as you can get, and now with tweakables you can just empty them anyway. My favorite thing about this is that it helps keep the COM centered as the fuel drains. Now we are sticking fuel tanks all over the place, and crafts COM moves all around town as fuel burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-02T22:54:48Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2014 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JMBuilder","CreatedById":30493,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T23:33:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI still want the old parts back! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T23:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JMBuilder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JMBuilder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI still want the old parts back! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95792-0-25-Mk-2-Redux-Pack-v-3-01-All-of-your-old-craft-can-still-be-saved%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95792-0-25-Mk-2-Redux-Pack-v-3-01-All-of-your-old-craft-can-still-be-saved%21\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you\u0027re talking about the parts being stock again JM, but just in case you didn\u0027t know, this is a mod I helped out on that has all the old parts.
