\n\u003E I have PPFX off (I forget why - no GPU support for it maybe)\n\nI found this interesting, because this is also used for the glow effect in the temperature gauge overlay, so I re-tested the save from [my earlier post](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118658-New-Heat-System-causes-memory-leak?p=1902401\u0026viewfull=1#post1902401) with PPFX turned off: memory usage still goes up, but much slower than with PPFX on. So it would take a much longer time to hit the 4 GB crash barrier. With PPFX on, it takes about 6 minutes from loading the save to the crash.\n\nEDIT: It seems that, with PPFX off, the memory usage increases due to something else, not the heat gauges. Maybe it\u0027s just the PQS rebuilding the terrain mesh during re-entry. Stationary tests show memory only leaking with PPFX on. Sorry for getting that wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-14T12:02:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/14/2015 12:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlmostDifferent**\n  \nFact checking revealed a mistake.
