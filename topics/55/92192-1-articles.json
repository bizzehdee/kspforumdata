The reduction in thrust, should techincally go to this. But I know KSP acts kind of funny when an engine has high gimbal ranges. But this is also the main point of the engine. The KS-25x4 is better in terms of thrust, and bang for your buck. At the cost of being heavier. Both are fairly effecient as base level engines, with the biggest difference coming in gimbal ranges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the whole point of this engine is to carry ANYTHING on a straight path into space. Nothing more, just like the KS-25x4 does for Rockets, this should do for spaceplanes. So this engine should be able to handle Asyemetric designs and movements in fuel easily, all with its gimbal. It also should find worth in being able to be returned compared to most average SLS designs. Obviously, like the KS-25x4 this engine should prevent anything from being attatched below it. Its a first stage engine, nothing more ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know most dedicated Shuttle engine mod generally have engines bent at an angle, which could be done with this engine, but I personally do not care to much.

Its a large reason for why their is an ISS, its recognized accross the word as a space faring vessel. It took hundreds of Men and Women to space. In truth it wasn\u0027t very effective in the end, and this also will be mirrored in the game (an SSTO would always be more effective in terms of money than a Shuttle System) but it was invisioned to be much more effective. (This game would offer a middle of the road, with no upkeep costs to keep the Shuttle from being to ineffective)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can act as a bridge between the two hanger created crafts, taking elements of both all to create something that goes to space in sync. It would make the Large MK3 parts a SPH counterpart to the SLS parts of the VAB. It would be able to utilize the Cargo Bays from the MK3 pack without any worry, just as the SLS parts can handle almost any cargo of the VAB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, \u003Cstrong\u003EShuttles should NOT be as difficult to build as they are now\u003C/strong\u003E. Shuttles are almost non existant, with almost their whole difficulty lying in the fact there is no engine for them. SSTO\u0027s are easier to build, run and use and yet they haven\u0027t existed in real life yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of it lies with is that gimbal range. The Engine specs are there, the Shuttle\u0027s wings, body, and cargo bay are all there.

The KS-25x4 is agreeably OP. But its the biggest of the baddest, end game ultimate engine. Same could be said for this new theorietical engine. Neither could be used effeciently on something smaller, since they are designed for the hugest most rediculous missions. Using them for anything else is wasteful, especially in the fund consious career. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe MK3 parts are already coming with a number of adapters so you can use any engine you want. I personally see very few situations where you need a high gimbal engine outside of building an asymetric launch. Yes you could want a super maneuverable rocket, but why? It doesn\u0027t really offer much. What I request isn\u0027t for the manuverability but the actual ability to be more lenient on the design of your ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey could in the future add smaller engine classes that can represent high gimbal engines that allow players to build say MK2 space shuttles. But making MK2 Space Shuttle type designs is very ineffective for what they can do. Almost any Mk2 design would be better off as an SSTO. The same can\u0027t be said for the new MK3 parts that will probably end up carrying 2.5 sized parts and huge station parts into space that will create huge issues with thrust and changes in center of mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the smaller sizes really don\u0027t need the high gimbal, or would be a complete waste using them, why build parts for them?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-07T23:32:55Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2014 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MKI\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T02:28:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that classic Space Shuttle like gameplay should be a viable and fun way to play stock KSP.

You put some effort into this and I\u0027m quite glad that somebody opened up this discussion, so pls don\u0027t get the following wrong. The suggested numbers for the engine are a srsly overpowered. Don\u0027t forget that droptanks already add a quite significant level of efficiency to a design. An engine that allows you to use that technique extensively and also allows a considerably easy recovery doesn\u0027t need to have an (op) high isp AND a low weight.

Let alone get these single engines to become the \u0022wonder gimbal\u0022 engine the game actually needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a cluster does force you into having it as a single best way, but it also keeps you from spamming them to make even small launch systems OP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain the viewpoint of this engine is in terms of career and how it would work with the new MK3 parts. Thats as far as we need to evaluate the part itself. The Devs could always throw in single KS-25\u0027s that are balanced accordingly, instead of trying to make a wonder part that needs to be balanced against its size class and competent as an engine cluster for MK3 Shuttle Designs. \u003Cstrong\u003ESo I am wrong on the idea the game SHOULDN\u0027T have single KS-25 parts, its just they don\u0027t need these parts compared to THIS part(the cluster).\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best compromise is throw in possibly 2 different varients of the KS-25 cluster beside the existing x4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ean x3, which would be the \u0022Shuttle Engine\u0022 that would function as a main shuttle engine, and a Space Plane competator against the SLS x4 block.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand a single KS-25, which would just be a single varient of the KS-25 engine, that would offer significant Gimbal ranges at the cost of thrust compared to its larger clusters. Would be useful for MK2 designs and other interesting designs that take advantage of the high gimbal ranges. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince we are on the topic, they should adjust a few older engines to have larger gimbal just to offer a larger variety and impact for surface landers. Since I do not believe the KS-25 engine should be used for landings that need high gimbal, something more effecient should take its place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS I am writing these posts at 5 AM, so please for give me for seeming a little scatter brained ;D\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbhChallenger","CreatedById":106911,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T00:31:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I am against the idea of splitting the engine up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole idea of the engine should be to enable classic shuttle gameplay on stock.

I already did something like that with the v-tol rocket engines from b9. If you set the options and angles right they work for that. I lifted a 100t shuttle \u002B 45t payload with a cluster of 6 engines \u002B 2 huge LfO boosters (piggyback design with a huge external tank)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would still prefer the option to use more than 3 engines per cluster on my shuttle. Piggyback designs at different sizes need different thrust. It would be boring if there is only one size that works with the engines given. Of course you can adjust the angle, but that makes the design even tougher, creates problems with stability once the boosters run out and only works up to a certain limit. Adjusting the throtle works if you want to build a smaller shuttle only and would force you to carry more engine mass than necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the part that would annoy me is that the weight of the shuttle would be limited with a cluster part. If the shuttle\u0027s thrust gets too low you have to angle the engines inwards and burn toward the boosters. It looks strange and forces you to switch the engine\u0027s angle a lot once you ditched the boosters. It\u0027s possible with the mentioned b9 engine by using it\u0027s v-tol mode toggle, but it\u0027s far from ideal (or realiatic I imagine). Definetly the most bizarre craft I ever reached orbit with. But it shows how a low engine thrust can limit the function and potential of a design. A cluster has a fixed thrust and will therefore be too heavy or offer too little thrust for a number of dedigns.
