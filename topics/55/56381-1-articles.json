I was marking my territory all over the solar system. There isn\u0027t any real point to it though other than maybe marking a good landing spot or an easter egg. With reputation coming though, I think it would make sense that you should gain reputation every time you plant a flag in a biome in which you haven\u0027t previously planted a flag.
