Samples are rarer ans so Really good value.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that people who prefer probes can go nuts and make money. People who prefer Manned can make more elaborate missions and still make money.\u003Cbr\u003E\nScience is repeatable (someone always wants to buy data) and the price goes up with distance from KSP\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal wages can be an option or also on a sliding scale.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get some science.

I have the upkeep costs, have to buy science to unlock nodes (only 10% science return) and can sell science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem I\u0027m having is that science experiments are kind of useless, but until I find a mod that turns the science results directly into rep (or a contracts pack that asks to perform them), I have to live with it. But it\u0027s not that bad.
