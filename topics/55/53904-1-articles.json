You might need to research bigger and more efficient engines, but that\u0027s that. There\u0027s no accounting of the cosmic rays, meteoroid impacts, or the effects of prolonged zero-g on kerbals. And this isn\u0027t even about life support like food, water. Of course, all the command pods could be said to already have the technology to counter those problems, but that sounds like hand waving to me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that going to other planets is hard to begin with, so maybe if it should be more difficult, it should be reserved for something like the \u0027hard mode\u0027 of KSP. Do you think long journeys could be or should be more difficult and complex, or is it better to stay as it is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T15:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere\u0027s a little more to it than just \u0027building bigger rockets\u0027 but i get what you mean. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblems with the realism mode is where do you stop? First off food and water, then oxygen, then radiation shielding, then micrometeorite shower shields, then solar flare shielding, then exercise bays to reduce muscle wasting and bone de-calcification, then psych reports to assess mental health, then \u0027fun bays\u0027 for recreational...ermm...recreation, toilets...the list goes on and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you want all that programmed, balanced and made fun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EErmm, not gonna happen I\u0027m afraid.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil1993","CreatedById":92469,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T16:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if you do want more realism, you could add TAC life support ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-life-support/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-life-support/\u003C/a\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it would be interesting if there were a random failures mechanic that would require your Kerbals to perform EVAs to make repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
