More people play the actual game than KerbalEdu, and from what i\u0027ve learned, people learned a lot more with stock KSP than Edu. For those of you who don\u0027t know, KerbalEdu has a bunch of features optimized for education, which include:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Some built-in Kerbal Engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Parts that show the effects of lift, mass, drag, etc. using arrows and circles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Some other things I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile not absolutely necessary, they are\u00A0some nice features to have in stock. Take Hyperedit, for example. KSP basically took some of it\u0027s futures and put it in stock. I don\u0027t see why they wouldn\u0027t do the same with flight engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T11:06:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis assumes that the people who created KerbalEdu (as in, the modifications, not the Squad base) would be willing to license their IP back to Squad, which is by no means a given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T13:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnowing there are license issues, I still voted \u0060why not\u0060 because features can be rewritten using non-licensed code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
