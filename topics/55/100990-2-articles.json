If something like KCT was in game, then a strategy might be to be a \u0022national\u0022 program, and try to operate within a budget. Commercial contracts would be for additional funds.

I\u0027ll focus on just strategies and wrap around to contracts later.\n\nFirst, let\u0027s get the obvious out of the way: *as they currently are, strategies are completely game breaking*.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the idea being strategies was for them to be *interesting gameplay decisions*. So my focus is on moving them towards that goal.\n\n**Currency Conversion**\n\nThe entire notion of converting between the various game \u0022currencies\u0022 does not make sense from a design point of view - or at least, it\u0027s so difficult to balance to make it not worthwhile. A few reasons:\n\n1. There is no late game way of spending science. Once you finish the tech tree, there is no more way to spend science - so you\u0027re end up \u0022forced\u0022 as a player to simply take the \u0022convert science to \u0027x\u0027 strategies\u0022.\n2. Reputation is almost useless. Yes, it gets the player better contracts, but that\u0027s it. Compound with the fact that once you get close to peak reputation, you actually can\u0027t get more (or rather, what you receive becomes a small fraction of what the contract says you\u0027ll get). Again, the player\u0027s decision quickly turns into \u0022convert reputation to \u0027x\u0027\u0022.\n\nMy option is that currency conversion strategies should get scrapped completely and replaced with strategies that are *interesting gameplay decisions.*\n\n**Strategy Balance**\n\nEach strategy right now has a \u0022bad\u0022 half and a \u0022good\u0022 half. For example, \u0022get less science / get more funds\u0022 is one strategy. I don\u0027t necessarily think this needs to be the case - as the fact that you can pick only one strategy per category is a limiting factor. If you give enough interesting/varied choices to the player within a category, it will become an interesting decision to pick which one they want. Ideally these strategies should be things that aren\u0027t min/max-able. Giving more funds isn\u0027t interesting. Doing something that makes your rockets \u0022more better\u0022 is interesting. Anyway, the point is - I\u0027m not going to necessarily provide \u0022drawbacks\u0022 to these strategies, but it\u0027s easy enough to come up with interesting offsets to them if necessary.\n\n**Cater to Different Play Styles**\n\nTo meet their design goal, I think strategies should cater as much as possible to different play styles. There should be some strategies that encourage/reward building space planes, others that might encourage building big stations/ships/bases. Not sure how many different \u0022play styles\u0022 can be come up with here... but it\u0027s something that warrants consideration in my opinion.\n\n**Possible Strategies**\n\nOkay, here\u0027s one big list of random stuff! I won\u0027t try to categorizes these into the current categories, this is just brainstorming.\n\n1. Advanced areodynamics - vessels have slightly less drag.\n2. More efficient engines - engines have a slightly higher ISP.\n3. Bigger engines - engines have slightly higher thrust.\n4. Bigger panels - panels produce more power.\n5. Better panels - panels lose efficiency due to distance from the Sun slower.\n6. Better recruiting - Recruits start with some experience.\n7. Apprenticeship - Kerbals gain experience faster when on the same vessel as a 5 star of the same profession.\n8. Advanced Rovers - Rovers drive as if they were 2x heavier.\n9. Nuclear non-proliferation treaty - No LVNs allowed. Receive more rep.\n10. Girl Power - Receive more rep for missions done with all female crews\n11. Closed borders - Cannot recover vessels that are more than 10km from KSC. Receive more funds in compensation.\n12. Low tech - Science is locked at zero. Contract funds increased by x% for each unlocked tech node.\n13. Megastructures - Receive funds for stations in orbit over a certain tonnage. (Funds over time, perhaps - if time mattered)\n14. Killer asteroids - Increased funding. Increased asteroid detection. Player receives contracts to divert killer asteroids. Failing to divert them results in game over! May need a better hook to make the player want to pick this. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nBaby\u0027s awake now, so I\u0027m out of time - I could easily come up with dozens more in this vein. Some of these ideas are good, some are pretty random. The point is though - strategies don\u0027t need to be \u0022convert x into y at a z% loss\u0022. They can be so much better!\n\nOh, and also, many of these are gameable - so we have to pretend certain assumptions are true:\n\n1. Changing strategies has a cost - perhaps they take time to change over\n2. Time in KSP matters (otherwise we need another way to penalize changing strategies)"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T00:05:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E FYI [*(link to post)*](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111967-Squadcast-Summary-%282015-02-28%29-Insert-Witty-Edition-Title-Here-Edition?p=1763351\u0026viewfull=1#post1763351),\n\nAtleast should be changed to entering the same situation as the object to be rescued/tested (stable orbit for an orbital rescue, landing for a ground rescue, sub-orbital for a sub-orbital part test).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First, let\u0027s get the obvious out of the way: *as they currently are, strategies are completely game breaking*.\n\nI don\u0027t think I would go quite that far (except for the current numbers...), but I do think they missed the mark by a fair way.

At some point you have all the science you need, and the strategies exist to convert that extra science to funds, since there isn\u0027t a continuous science drain like there is with funds. I\u0027m not really sure how that could be changed, since I think the tech tree is also intended to be unlocked without being forced to science \u0022too much\u0022 (though some of that is holdover from before the extra biomes were introduced). And I suppose, as you pointed out, the science system is a whole \u0027nother topic (maybe for the next thread!).\n\nContract science is a strange animal. So, if part of the reason why the tech tree is so quick to unlock is because of Outsourced R\u0026D...assume that strategy doesn\u0027t exist anymore (or is reduced) and that science from contracts is dramatically reduced (just for the sake of argument). Does that change the perception any? How does that affect things? I know there is still tons of science out there, but what if you are more driven to obtain science by going out and doing science? (I\u0027m also aware that this doesn\u0027t change the lack of endgame expenditure for science.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E First of all, I think some contracts should come from The Space Program itself. Specifically, all explore contracts or contracts that would directly benefit the space program. Maybe The Space Program\u0027s ingame name would be that of the save file\u0027s title, and thus instead of saves being labeled \u0022Player Name\u0022, they should be labeled \u0022Space Program Name.\u0022\n\nI see what you are saying, but how does this differ from the current mechanic? (I mean, beyond the fact that I have to go click on the \u0022Explore Mun\u0022 contract.) Also, I do like the idea of contracts building off of each other (similar to the idea of pushing along science/exploration via contracts).\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T03:43:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Contract science is a strange animal.

Scan the Mun FIRST, then, within scanned regions, Linus selects places for data collection. perhaps before the FIRST Mun landing, they are not procedural, but pulled from a list of desirable first landing sites (nice terrain for landing).\n\nI\u0027m honestly unsure, but I think it\u0027s lacking now. And the repetitive Fine Print stuff adds more grind---I like many of the ideas, but I don\u0027t like them repeated, endlessly, but random. It needs a story line, or the new contracts are just different than the old, and rapidly become boring. There are some great ideas in this thread, actually.\n\n\u003E I see what you are saying, but how does this differ from the current mechanic? (I mean, beyond the fact that I have to go click on the \u0022Explore Mun\u0022 contract.) Also, I do like the idea of\n\nI\u0027m saying the same thing. It is NOT different, but it matters, anyway. There would be \u0022contracts\u0022 for 3d party, commercial stuff (primary reward funds), and the pure science would come from your own program (I\u0027m using \u0022Missions\u0022 for this). Unless your personal goal is 100% commercial, Missions is what the program is ABOUT, science. Contracts are a way to help pay the bills.\n\nMissions might be more like the Survey and Explore contracts we see now, muti-part, and related to one another (having chosen to to the \u0022Prosector\u0027s Alpha, Beta, etc\u0022 survey region, your next suggestions from Linus might tend to be to illuminate those areas with further missions).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T05:00:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 05:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T04:40:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We both want \u0022Make money\u0022 to be separate from \u0022Make science.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E some sort of system that tracks what the user does, then provides contracts that continue to push them forward to explore?\n\nWe already have this in the \u0022explore\u0022 contracts, that push players toward the next unexplored SoI.

If science should be less of a grind - than being able to afford the cool toys, then, that is where we are now.

And that if you stick with it, more rewarding contracts appear as Reputation increases. Regardless of Strategies and game setup features, the developers have to consider their intended default game balance.\n\n The best (or maybe just... the most *challenging* - Squad probably doesn\u0027t want to go in this direction) games force you into an agony of choice at every turn: you want to have three things, but you\u0027re only allowed to choose one at a time. Which of the three will you pick, this turn?\n\n Look at the tight agonizing balance of Firaxis\u0027 X-COM remake: back in the base, you want cool tech so you can win the war. But you need Science to get at the tech faster. To get more Science you need a lab, which costs Funds. Your troops need weapons, which cost Funds. The lab and the weapons take time to build, based on how many Engineers you can get. Which to build first: a workshop for the engineers, or a science lab? Maybe... neither one.
