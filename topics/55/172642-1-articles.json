max science tree out.\u00A0 I have sent two probes out of system to the closest two planets to the Sun, but only got 300 or so science for that.\u00A0 \u00A0 Perhaps Take Two could spend some time

sort of had a succesful DLC policy, and made\u00A0tons of money in the process,\u00A0 they started out as a minuscule company,\u00A0 Paradox Interactive, makers of Europa Universalis IV.\u00A0 \u00A0 They have tons of very minor cosmetic dlc that they sell for 5 dollars at release.\u00A0 These Dlc do nothing for core game play.\u00A0 Yet lots of people buy then, just to support their favorite game\u0027s development.\u00A0 \u00A0I have 2k hours into that game and have purchased over 200$ in dlc that wasn\u0027t needed at the time or at all.\u00A0 \u00A0For all that money its still pennies on the hour of game play.\u00A0 \u00A0Also the constant development that EU4 had due to it\u0027s dlc policy had me enthralled with the game for two years or more.\u00A0 I bought every dlc, which sold for 15-20 USD each,\u00A0the day they came out.\u00A0 I also bought several of the cosmetic and musical dlc for 5$ each.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, Dev teams do need to choose their \u0022battles\u0022\u00A0 \u00A0and the \u0022missions development\u0022\u00A0 added little for, most likely, a good half KSP player base, myself included.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy on Kerbal make \u00A0KSP 2 when there is so much that can be done yet with KSP.\u00A0 \u00A0Not to mention that if they play their cards right, there is\u00A0a boat load of money to be yet made on KSP.\u00A0 All they need for this is a proper strategy going forward.\u00A0 \u00A0A good start would be a music based dlc for ~ 10$\u00A0 This dlc should add nothing, but new music to the game and not be really needed to fully experience KSP.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0A DLC of this nature must be made ensuring that it will not break any major mods.\u00A0 \u00A0This would give TT a moderate input of cash, that they could then, hopefully, put towards new development.\u00A0 \u00A0 This new development should go into an actual DLC, priced at 15-20 USD,\u00A0that adds something major to the best part of KSP, the Career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Further more constant innovation and improvements to KSP will add fresh excitment to the game, ensuring that the modding community never gets bored and continues to thrive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, Please, Please.\u00A0 \u00A0Nothing comparable to a Call of duty story line,\u00A0 I would be Upset then.\u00A0 If I\u00A0had a physical copy of KSP, I would at that point destroy it.....\u00A0 \u00A0lol\u00A0 \u00A0Real Earth scale would be too boring and time consuming\u00A0for most, perhaps not for I, but for most. Besides the scale of game is easily modded.\u00A0 I have messed around with earth sized scale, it\u0027s brutal.\u00A0 \u00A0Game engine would need to be upgraded greatly in order to reduce the time needed to go anywhere.\u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0 As of such would not be an improvement.\u00A0 \u00A0A few cities would be nice if it wasn\u0027t too hard on the average pc, perhaps in the future.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way have you heard of the fallacy,\u00A0 Reductio ad Absurdum?\u00A0 You sir are guilty of that fallacy, please shy away from it in the future.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour comments above effectively sum up all the worst parts of the gaming industry today. It\u0027s the reason I skip past anything with Paradox\u0027s name on it. Release money-grabbing DLC with no content? No thanks, bud. Would you also like to click on an outer planet and be told \u0022you must purchase such and such DLC to access this planet\u0022? I too would \u0022destroy\u0022 my copy of KSP if I ever saw such a thing.

with Paradox atm.\u00A0 \u00A0I like the premise of their dlc policy, for the simple fact that it does get a lot of incoming money to work with, for further development.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0However there are many other aspects of their dlc policy that are\u00A0quite......\u00A0 \u00A0disappointing.\u00A0 \u00A0As I mentioned i have spent around 200\u002B dollars on two of their\u00A0games.\u00A0 \u00A0 I have not played in a while and have missed the last several dlc though.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I wanted to play\u00A0Crusader Kings 2\u00A0 \u00A0one day so loaded up Steam downloaded game updates, started new game.\u00A0 \u00A0 I then stared at the country map for about and hour pondering what nation and who in that nation I would play.\u00A0 Then my eyes and brain focused on the only Jewish country in the game, a tiny little nation, with a big job ahead of it.\u00A0 \u00A0Okay, that sounds like it could be fun.\u00A0 \u00A0So i think about it a little more and study my political\u00A0 surrounding well.\u00A0 \u00A0Finally decide to take the plunge as this tiny little doomed nation, one of the best parts about paradox games.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I click on the play button and am told that I need another DLC\u00A0to play this nation......\u00A0 \u00A0I at this point let out a big sigh, with all my dreams of a new conquest, in one of my all time favorite games, dashed.\u00A0 \u00A0Now at this point,\u00A0I could have gone to the store and bought the ability to play this one tiny nation in a very large game for 6$.\u00A0 \u00A0 But at this point I feel a little hurt by that DLC policy, especially with all of the money that I have already given that company in the span of two games.\u00A0 So I decided to just play a game of LOL instead.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not want that to happen to this game.\u00A0 \u00A0 It seems to me that Take Two could take what they have already done with this game, in this first expansion, and expand upon that practice going forward.\u00A0 \u00A0For example if someone has purchased the full game and first two, or even any two, dlc having spent\u00A0around\u00A0 70$.\u00A0 \u00A0Perhaps that person would then receive the next X number of DLC for free, as Squad did for those who bought the in early 2013.\u00A0 \u00A0I\u00A0 believe after personally experiencing Paradox

I too own EU4 and CK2. As a guy who thinks Medieval 2 and Civ IV are 2 of the greatest games of all time, I was told the 2 Paradox titles were right up my alley and that I would absolutely love them. And that may well be true; but I\u0027ll never know. I bought both games and loaded \u0027em up, very excited. You know that feeling when you download a game that you\u0027re sure is going to be awesome? That\u0027s how it was until I checked \u0027em out. I was horrified by the blatant, gimme more policy and immediately turned \u0027em off. I\u0027m kind of amazed they\u0027re able to keep it at it. I wouldn\u0027t care if the games were the best ever made; I won\u0027t give my money to a company like that. I thought Surviving Mars looked interesting; and then I saw the publisher. I didn\u0027t lament an opportunity lost. I just moved on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for KSP, I\u0027ve often wondered why they don\u0027t release \u0022mod packs\u0022. With 10 or a 12 popular mods bundled together for 10 bucks. I\u0027m sure there are tons of legal reasons, but it would seem to make sense for everyone. Squad and T2 could take their cut, and modders could start making some money. For us players, you\u0027d have the understanding that they will always be kept current with every update and expansion on day one. It seems like everyone would win, but I don\u0027t know anything about the inner workings of the industry; so I don\u0027t really know if such a thing is possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-22T00:09:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2018 12:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cpt Kerbalkrunch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
