It\u0027s fun having ground crew, but the proverbial lag issue crops up. Currently I keep my ground crew and reusable craft parked just over 2km away from the launch site (about 800m west of the end of the runway) so launching rockets are not effected by them. But that makes using the ground crew a bit of a mission and it still effects planes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really want my ground crew to be parked on the apron outside the SPH, but this adds lag to any rocket being launched or plane taking off/landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like is a hangar where these craft can be \u0022parked\u0022. What the hangar does is store the craft as it is; current fuel levels, MET, basically all the info for that craft from the persistent file, but takes it out of the persistent file so its not actually loaded in the scene and is therefore not being simulated. This would enable a set of craft to be on hand when needed, but not causing all of KSC to be a lag-zone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally (not sure how possible this is) the building should be something that you could switch to (unlike the other buildings) and then displays a menu which shows the stored craft so you can select one to load. Failing that it could work like the other buildings which you interact with from the space centre view (but I\u0027d prefer not to have to return the space centre view). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you select a craft to load from the hangar is basically re-injects the craft (sorry VESSEL{...} ) into the persistent file, then reloads the scene and the craft will now appear, exactly as it was, outside the hangar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how to handle the crew in craft being stored in the hangar. Leaving them sitting in the craft doesn\u0027t sound right, but that may just be a simple solution initially. Or the crew get \u0022reclaimed\u0022 and when you load a craft from the hangar you get a similar interface to the load craft from space centre interface that enables you to select which crew you want to put in it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from creating a new building I don\u0027t think this would be too hard to implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mardlamock","CreatedById":38972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T17:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a must, and also something like KAS and maybe some FAR in it as well\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PringleMan","CreatedById":1396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T18:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe crew could also be handled by the plugin. Something along the lines of saving the crew names, on vessel store it sets those kerbals to \u0022dead\u0022 so that they wont respawn in another rocket. On vessel relaunch, it changes those kerbals back to an alive state, then sets them as the crew. There are definitely hooks to allow crew manipulation as we see with life support mods, so I think it might be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Immashift","CreatedById":57223,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T05:00:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea. I too would use ground crews and more ACTUALLY reusable (as opposed to recovering once landed and going \u0022good enough\u0022) craft. The problem with me, like so many others, is the lag involved when doing such things. It\u0027s why I have around 10 small space stations up at various altitudes rather than one enormous one because of how bad lag gets for me when I have \u0026gt;300 parts or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea of a hangar which would be more or less a box of crafts that don\u0027t actually get loaded unless specifically asked to, is really cool. Sort of like a garage you\u0027d drive your fuel truck or whatever into, and then it is saved and unloaded. Select hangar empty-handed and you get a list of stuff you\u0027ve parked there. Select something, and it spawns in the hangar under your control, exactly as it was left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile we\u0027re on that sort of idea, I\u0027d love a way to refuel stuff WITHOUT spawning tanks with docking ports on runways. Sort of like a permanent fixture somewhere near the launchpad I could drive a truck up to, perhaps dock with a special part, and have it refuel all LFO tanks on the craft. Or perhaps integrate that into the UI of the hangar idea. This is just all conjecture of course, but I love the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T06:10:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is something I\u0027m trying to work out how to do because I\u0027m trying to build a permanent base on Laythe using Kerbtown. Spawning craft is something we can do, despawning is also something we can do but I\u0027m not too sure about the despawning-and-saving-for-later bit right now. Storing resources in a kerbtown building and being able to transfer those resources around other buildings without having to use KAS is the other line of inquiry atm.
