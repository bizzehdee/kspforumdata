However, I noticed that the wobbling was at the top, where the only place possible to strut it was the fairing itself, which was impossible to attach struts to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was very burdenous that I have to rely on strutting in vain, and a big hunk of streamlining and aesthetics is wasted. Maybe there can be another setting in the VAB to \u0022open\u0022 and \u0022close\u0022 the fairing, so that you can attach things on it, yet still keep it simple to assemble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TronX33","CreatedById":109784,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T22:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.
