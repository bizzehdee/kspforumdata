Sure sometimes I\u0027ll get a part test that\u0027s profitable... maybe one... but that\u0027s pretty much it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution: Currently contracts are handled by what seems to be a mix of reputation and achievements. Why not just have \u003Cem\u003Eall contract types and locations all the time\u003C/em\u003E? You think you can bring an asteroid to eeloo with 140 tons? Go ahead! Given the slightly spoilery nature, of course it would probably be disabled by default on normal or lower difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I get the idea of progression and all that, I think I can speak for anyone who has tried a second career attempt that it is always exactly the same, and kinda boring. I know ahead of time what ships I\u0027m going to build since the early set of contracts are all the same. And while it essentially kills reputation as a resource, reputation loss and use is pretty meaningless to even a mildly experienced player.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
