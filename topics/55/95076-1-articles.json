But sometimes the distances or angles between my manoeuvre node and target are just too great and I end up loosing focus on my manoeuvre node, and then moving it by mistake, or pulling on the wrong vector whilst trying to keep the \u0027view from target\u0027 on screen. Basically I get in a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce a manoeuvre node has been set and a target selected, it would be great to have the option to have the manoeuvre node on one side of the screen and the target (and my intercept path) on the other. Then I can tweak the manoeuvre node vectors and easily see their impact on my intercept path. Both sides of the screen could have independent zoom controls, and the level of zoom on the manoeuvre node side would determine the scale of adjustments - zoom out for the basic \u0027rough\u0027 setting of the intercept, zoom in to fine tune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr does this already exist?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T01:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Paul G\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Paul G\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr does this already exist?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, but it\u0027s a great idea and certainly possible \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.
