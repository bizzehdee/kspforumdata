The rationale behind this is that its large windows make it easier for the Kerbals to make their observations than in the other pods, whose small windows limit the science that can be done. Would give people a reason, other than role-playing, to add a Cupola Module to your space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T12:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great idea!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlamingPotatoes","CreatedById":35731,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T12:12:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it! adds a use other than just looking incredibly damn cool to the cupola!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBadAstronomer","CreatedById":89508,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-15T13:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat idea!
