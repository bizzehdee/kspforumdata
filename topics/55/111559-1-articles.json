In a mod with scifi parts maybe.\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027m not really sure what the in-game benefit of this is over something like a high thrust, high efficiency engine. Based on the description you provided, all this would really help out with is reducing the dV requirements in space since it wouldn\u0027t work near the large planets/moons where it would be most useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as sci-fi parts go, here\u0027s the parts I would find most useful:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFTL Drive (i.e. KSPI warp drive)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh power, high efficiency engines (every sci-fi ship you see only needs to devote a relatively small portion of its overall mass to fuel, KSPI has some engines that fit the bill, as well as a few other mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntigravity/repulsor drives (kerbal foundries has some, another approach would be basically something that negates gravity entirely for the vessel, similar to the gravity hack cheat)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnergy shield (haven\u0027t seen a mod provide this yet, basically the idea is that it creates an aerodynamic shield around your craft so you can easily fly anything down into an atmosphere, would also protect against collisions with other craft).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis addon sounds fun. Might give it a turn after I finish up the current Career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T19:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETurn on infinite fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T20:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn Space Engineers, it has seemed to me that the \u0022Inertia Dampener\u0022 was always a guidance system that reduced your relative speed to zero by thrusting in precalculated directions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but still, such a device would fit well in that universe.
