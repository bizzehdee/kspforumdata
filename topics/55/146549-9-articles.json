Or so I though. After a bit of research to try and put together a better argument I came across one very horrible fact. All the air in an average house when compressed and cooled to a very cold liquid could fit in a container about the size a of kettle. So imagining the capsule makers have down their job it would be a very tiny amount of space needed to store more than enough liquid air to refill the capsule on return a few times (I work on the assumption the kerbals in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E know where I\u0027m going even if I don\u0027t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but the air doesn\u0027t stay fresh, but this is the genius of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS supplies they aren\u0027t just food they are just a combined mass of stuff needed to feed, water and oxygenate a kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill this is where API\u0027s are great, instead of writing a whole Life support mod to tweak one aspect of life support you could just have a mod that tweaks Air supply, If no air then Kerbals put on their helmets and strike after 3 days not a fortnight. The same could be applied to mental health aspects with another mod that tweaks if Kerbals are eating or over eating due to homesickness without the need to write a whole new life support system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-02T08:04:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt needs to be an \u0022Option\u0022.

That said though,\u00A0constant resupply missions just become tedious after you\u0027ve done them a few times so\u00A0perhaps some sort of automated system could run in the background where things are supplied (either partially or completely)\u00A0for you in exchange for funds using something in the administration building.

Yes it would add new ones, but at the cost of existing viable options. Anything that restricts what is currently possible in the game has to be considered very carefully. Even a relatively minor thing like tweaking aerodynamic heating caused a huge ruckus, even though it would only involve very minor changes to existing vessels to make them work. Even that is a lot to ask. Life support would\u00A0completely\u00A0invalidate many vessels and missions that are perfectly viable today. That kind of collapse of the possible game play space is a huge deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second is that no two people are likely to ever agree exactly what a good game balance for life support should be. Should it all be abstracted into a single \u0027consumables\u0027 resource? Should food be distinct from recyclables such as air and water? Should we have food growing modules? How about components for recovering air or water from the environment? How close to realistic volume and mass requirements should it be? What would be realistic anyway? Lets say there are even only 5 different ways this could be balanced, each one with a similar number of people who support it. Whichever balance option Squad were to select, 4/5 of the players would disagree with it, to varying degrees. I suspect life support is far more susceptible to this than most game balance issues because it\u0027s so complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a perfect example of an area where mods are the right way to fill the gap.

In stock you can orbit single stage stuff with ease---if you can build a rocket with a mk1-2 capsule on top and get it to orbit with something that doesn\u0027t look like an Atlas I or Saturn I (\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E Ib), then the balance is screwy. So I suppose since sending huge payloads is so trivial in KSP, LS could be percieved the way you do, since it\u0027s trivial to add more mass to the top of the stack with literally no bad effects. In a more tightly constrained balance (more realistic solar systems), adding kg to the top of the stack can make the difference between getting anywhere or not, and designs need to be far more optimized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T15:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make life-support necessary for using pilot-skills (pointing prograde, retrograde, etc) or decrease the mining output of your drills with an engineer on board.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is a similar way of what the communication network does to probe-cores in 1.2 (no mission failures, just a bit more annoying if you go without)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy doing so, you leave all the freedom still intact in the game that you had before and satisfy everyone that would like to strap another ton of supplies to their backs to go on a jaunt on the mun \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-03T15:44:49Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2016 03:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by MalfunctionM1Ke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T20:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222740688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146549\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472917323\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002271626\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalfunctionM1Ke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, MalfunctionM1Ke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust make life-support necessary for using pilot-skills (pointing prograde, retrograde, etc) or decrease the mining output of your drills with an engineer on board.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is a similar way of what the communication network does to probe-cores in 1.2 (no mission failures, just a bit more annoying if you go without)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy doing so, you leave all the freedom still intact in the game that you had before and satisfy everyone that would like to strap another ton of supplies to their backs to go on a jaunt on the mun \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that would just undo the work that the new CommNet system is doing to make Kerbals relevant again.

And it really sucks when you\u0027re behind the Mun or in low orbit around\u00A0another planet and you basically lose your ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, I found it to be too much work, not enough enjoyment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the new system will be different, but I wasn\u0027t impressed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow - life support? Basically a time limit on all of my missions? Eh, no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m already struggling to meet delta V requirements on my missions to Jool\u0027s\u00A0moons, the last thing I need is a time requirement on top of that. Sometimes saving some delta V does mean taking extra time. So that would mean more mission failures and a real struggle to keep reputation up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E like to see reworked are the tech tree and the contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tech tree is a pain because oh hey look, what you need to get more science is locked deep into the tech tree, and you need science to get deep into the tech tree. It\u0027s a chicken and egg problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should get the \u0022raw science\u0022 parts \u00A0early in the tech tree. I don\u0027t see why the Gravioli Detector should be locked up in the late game, when you probably don\u0027t need it anymore. With mining in the game\u00A0and advanced communication coming up, there ought to be enough late game tech available, and\u00A0I think it\u0027s time that side of the tree got re-balanced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts also needs a bit of a rework. I think that the player ought to have a bit of control over the general direction of the game. Like, I want to focus on getting science from the Mun instead of going to Duna. I like that contracts can give me some direction if I\u0027m unsure of where I want to go next, but I\u0027d like some control over the direction if desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, it\u0027s either pure player direction (sandbox) or pure AI direction (campaign). Hoping for something in-between.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso - \u003Cem\u003ETHREE (or six) SCIENCE FOR EACH OBJECTIVE?!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Even in the mid to\u00A0late game? Why even bother giving us science at all, if it\u0027s going to be so little?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n. . . and just allow us to see the missing science reports in the archives. Please. There\u0027s not much reason to visit an archive of stuff I\u0027ve already seen. Mods are already doing a much better job than the archives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-06T07:11:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2016 07:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CobraA1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ImmaStegosaurus!","CreatedById":160589,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-06T10:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a difficulty option, yes.
