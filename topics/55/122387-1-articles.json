It\u0027s going fairly well except for the fact I have to use large reactions wheels in the range of 400 parts to get a proper torque to control the vehicle. This leads to several problems including wobbling and an inability to strut them all down(the wobbling). This game needs a new XL 3.75 reaction wheel to help with larger craft. This would be the size of the Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks. I\u0027m really curios why it doesn\u0027t already exist. they have the standard but no convenient way to control it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Why doesn\u0027t it already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe introduction of a 3.75 reaction wheel would reduce my parts count from 384 to only 96 parts(Assuming 120 torque.).... This is sorely needed. I\u0027m making a giant mining/space station modeled after a ship from another game. It works very well except for this aspect for the most part. And you need that many to get good turn ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts count reduction would obviously help the ship for the other reasons and make it much more flyable and less laggy from performance issues also. I have no idea why there isn\u0027t one already. It would be easy to make visually. It would be like the 3.75 decoupler but fatter more than likely and appropriate stats. It should be one of the easiest things to add to the game. All the parts of that size even have the same aesthetic.
