Why? It\u0027s very distracting. It\u0027s something that is moving in the corner of my eye, and every time I navigate the site, it grabs my attention while it has nothing to tell me. Pulling away the focus from what I want to do."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:24:10Z","Content":"Agree. It\u0027s incredibly silly."},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:36:09Z","Content":"It reminds me of the floating menus or animated snow foregrounds that people used to add to websites back in 1997. It\u0027s cute the first time one sees it but it\u0027s distracting and eventually, annoying."}]}
