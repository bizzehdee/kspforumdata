Not really a serious suggestion, just something that I want to share.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat if KSP uses a staff management style similar to MGSV? MGSV deals with having to manage a large a number of staff despite not being a management simulation game,\u00A0and I think KSP can use it as a model for its staff management aspect of the gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEach kerbal have an innate skill in Construction, Research, Charisma, and Observation, in addition to their default roles as Pilot, Engineer, and Scientist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nConstruction skill determines\u00A0the the capabilities of rocket building. The more high-skilled kerbals you have, the bigger the rocket you can build (until you hit a roadblock and have to upgrade the facility). Can be assigned to\u00A0VAB/SPH.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nResearch skill determines the capabilities of R\u0026amp;D. To research certain tech nodes and/or parts, your space program\u0027s accumulative Research skill must reach a certain point (provided you have enough Science). Certain parts need high enough cumulative Construction or Observation skills to be researched. Can be assigned to R\u0026amp;D Facility.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nObservation skill determines the information you can gather and process from planetary bodies. Better observation skills means you can unlock better maneuver node planning similar to MechJeb, and unlocks more science experiments for you to do. Can be assigned to Tracking Station.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCharisma skill determines the reputation gains of your space program, and helps unlocking new contracts. More kerbals with higher charisma means better contracts, bigger reputation bonuses, and\u00A0attracting better kerbals.\u00A0Can be assigned to\u00A0Mission Control.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Metal-Gear-Solid-5-Staff-management-640x\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzA4LzMwL2NhL01ldGFsR2VhclNvLjc3ZDA5LnBuZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/5cd85e9d/682/Metal-Gear-Solid-5-Staff-management-640x360.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou start with the first 4 kerbonauts\u00A0(Jeb, Bill, Bob, and Val) plus the non-kerbonaut ones (Wernher, Gene, Walt, and Gus), which all have a high stat in certain skills. You don\u0027t have any other staff, so you have to assign them to build, research, and observe themselves. As you complete contracts and gain reputation, low-skilled kerbals will come to work for you, and you can assign them to various facilities. You might want to assign kerbals to facilities that best suits their skills,\u00A0or maybe you want to focus on a specific\u00A0facility, so you assign more kerbals to that facility.\u00A0Some of the staff may have high enough Pilot/Engineer/Scientist level that you can\u00A0consider sending them on a mission instead of\u00A0working at a facility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you gain reputation, more high-skilled kerbals will come to your space program. Your space program has a limit, so at a certain point you have to fire the low-skilled kerbals, or upgrade the facilities to give them more place to work. Occasionally, you will have an opportunity to hire an exceptionally-skilled kerbal, and it\u0027s up to you whether to go for it or not. Some special parts may even need you to hire a specific kerbal (an expert in making that part?) to enable you to unlock it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mgs5_s_rank_staff.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://s3.accelerated-ideas.com/generic/images/metalgearsolid5/mgs5_s_rank_staff.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-26T02:41:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2016 02:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Algiark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Algiark","CreatedById":83907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T05:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo replies?
