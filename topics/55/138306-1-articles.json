It\u0027s impossible to see the KSC from orbit, let alone, land on it without any navigational reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFiguring out the exact numbers for an orbit is almost impossible if you want to do everything by hand. I\u0027m sure I can hit a 100x100km circular orbit from the pad, but there is no way I can do that with absolutely zero inclination. Having a \u0022target orbit\u0022 at the correct position would allow you to correct your inclination by using the AN/DN nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA similar mechanism would be to have a \u0022flight director\u0022 on the navball that you can set to a numeric heading/pitch/roll value and that the SAS can follow, so you can fly by the numbers without having to resort to a big autopilot system like MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T12:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that is a neat idea. \u00A0Not a game changer, but a very nice extra touch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
