The first big one is to add a new optional indicator in the VAB/SPH: center of torque. It\u0027s not really clear to a lot of players about how reaction wheels function, so being able to check where the center of torque is for their craft will help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The other suggestion I have is to re-implement the old SAS system as a sub-system of the current one, and make it so the player can toggle between the old (HOLD) and new (SAS) modes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T07:31:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECenter of torque has no effect, the torque is automatically distributed through the craft. It\u0027s clear now that some people have bugs in their SAS, so I wouldn\u0027t call for the old one too. I believe once this is fixed and it works for everyone, I don\u0027t believe anyone will want the old one back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
