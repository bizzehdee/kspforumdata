At the moment it\u0027s wild guessing and it\u0027s hard to define the value of a strategy if it costs a fixed number of rep while the amount I have is shown as a bar \u0026lt;- thats the case with agressive negotiations\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PhilTact","CreatedById":94689,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T09:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the bar for reputation.

In the strategies page, I clicked on the Unpaid Research Program (under Science) and then adjusted the slider at the bottom right of the page. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA commitment level of 90% is equivalent to 925 reputation points and the big green tick is still highlighted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA commitment level of 95% is equivalent to 963 reputation points and the big green tick is dulled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore I have between 925 and 963 reputation points. This roughly tallies with the green|blue|blue stripes slider top centre of the page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, however, does not tally with Mission Control. I went into the archives tab and summed all the reputation points in the completed sub-tab (I had no failed or cancelled contracts) and I have a reputation points value of 3309. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow 3309 got turned into 925-963 is not obvious to me yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T10:17:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually there are numbers ontop of the gauge.

This is important for the adminstration boosts. As they require direct values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Streamline of usage. Right now reputation does nothing but open up Administration programs. Kill a million kerbals no biggy you still don\u0027t lose the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBottom line Reputation as a whole needs some tweaking as its very vague compared to the other two major resources of Career. Simply put it should be more important than science. Generally I see Science as tech progression, Funds and ammunition and Reputation as LIFE itself in any game comparison. So run out of Reputation, or have it to low and you should LOSE the game. This all will come in due time and im sure the Devs will have another direct look at reputation, until then its a bar.

I would rather see reputation listed as a qualifier such as: infamous, bad, unknown/neutral, liked, well-known, established, industry-leader, influential, legendary, etc. Furthermore, this seems to be a logarithmic scale (add a zero to go up a level), not linear. I suspect that\u0027s what Squad was going for with a colored tape/meter, instead of a straight numeric readout. Reputation being what it is, it should perhaps affect the chances of certain strategies working, instead of being a hard requirement/prerequisite (i.e. you can try harder/invest more but with diminishing returns).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kaoz","CreatedById":101169,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T02:57:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emdosogne \u0022IIRC, when recovering a vessel (on the crew recovery tab), your reputation is shown as a number.\u0022 My reputation stop filling up once it reach 928, I believe it doesn\u0027t work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-28T03:14:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a percentage would be best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
