I hate that when I\u0027m controlling a ship and want to do something sciency or some engineering that I need to go to the space center, then the astronaut complex and find the ship I want to use to see which Kerbals do what, and what skills they have. It would be nice to be able to click or hover on their names and see their class and skill level. Even if I do remember that a specific kerbal is an engineer, there\u0027s no way to tell if he has the skill to repair rover wheels for example."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:45:51Z","Content":"1.:Open map mode\n\n2.:Click on the little kerbal-icon on the right side of the screen\n\n3.:Observe your crew and all their stats"},{"CreatedByName":"amorymeltzer","CreatedById":111542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T19:56:41Z","Content":"The answer is to just use [Portrait Stats](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120731) by DMagic, it\u0027s perfect."}]}
