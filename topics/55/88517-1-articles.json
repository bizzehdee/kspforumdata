I suggest there being a small spherical xenon tank similar to the \u0022Stratus-V Roundified Monopropellant Tank\u0022 and a radial size \u0022small\u0022 tank as opposed to only tiny. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccompanying the radial size \u0022small\u0022 xenon tank, I suggest there being an Ion Engine similar to the H.i.P.E.P (new potentially \u0022small\u0022 sized engine) compared to the N.E.X.T-like PB-Ion Electric Propulsion System. The part should have higher specific impulse and thrust, perhaps a higher thrust to weight ratio and maybe less electricity usage compared to thrust. I would also suggest putting this one science tree tier later after the original ion engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would really give the Xenon line of parts more diversity and versibility, so Xenon will no longer be an annoying type of fuel that is just there, with little capability. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T00:48:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by HamShanky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T06:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The part should have higher specific impulse and thrust, perhaps a higher thrust to weight ratio and maybe less electricity usage compared to thrust\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems pretty OP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T07:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Near Future Propulsion pack from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52042-0-25-Near-Future-Technologies-%2810-10-14-All-packs-0-25-update-fixes%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENear Future Technologies\u003C/a\u003E mod should be right up your alley.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HamShanky","CreatedById":127299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T13:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joonatan1998\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Joonatan1998\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022The part should have higher specific impulse and thrust, perhaps a higher thrust to weight ratio and maybe less electricity usage compared to thrust\u0022\u003Cp\u003ESeems pretty OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean not much increase in usefulness compared to size.
