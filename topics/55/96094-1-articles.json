It boggles my mind because there are so many possible designs that could have been had with this fairly mediocre piece of hardware. If you\u0027d still want to use it as a nosecone, it\u0027ll be easy enough to simply drain all the fuel out instead. Compared to the MK3 adapters and C7 adapters which all have fuel, it feels like the odd one out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI for one would like to see this little nosecone that could, get some fuel capacity.
