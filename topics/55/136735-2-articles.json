So long as they\u0027ve got a mission in-progress the cost can be deferred. The trick is that right now vessels aren\u0027t tied to missions at the time they\u0027re launched. The contract just sets up a set of conditions and if any vessel satisfies those conditions the contract is completed. You could of course set things up so vessels are labeled as part of a mission before launch, but Im worried this could get really complicated when docking is involved. There is however already a system set up for satellite delivery, so it seems to me if you could get any vessel to satisfy a condition like \u0027on Jool intercept course\u0027 this could satisfy one of your steps.

You need certain parts you don\u0027t have for your planned Mun mission that you lack. So you set the tech tree to research the important part node you want using minimal science and funds, and it will take a year, and you\u0027ll need at least 1 more node unlocked after that. You work away on your orbital stuff, run out of budget for the year, and warp ahead a couple months to the new year. You get some funds, do some more science, complete more orbital program stuff (docking, etc). You decide to make a Munar flyby, warp a few more months to secure the funds (dolled out monthly), then do that mission (completing part of the Munar program, adding some Rep. You might at this point just warp to R\u0026amp;D completion. Now you do the next tree node, but you spend some extra funds and some science, so instead of a year, it\u0027s 6 months. You do a few contracts, just because, and get some extra funds. You buy some cheap nodes you had not unlocked yet outright with science and funds. You warp to completion of the required node.

They only get punished if they warp excessively. They need to do something per year with their budget. So if they chose to no nothing, and warp month by month till next tear, next year they get less funding. Boo hoo. Right now it is nearly impossible to lose KSP career, ever, as far as I can tell, even not reverting. It\u0027s possible in \u0022grind\u0022 (\u0022HARD\u0022) mode, but it\u0027s just a grind, it\u0027s not difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour statement about running hundreds of garbage contracts does\u0027t apply, since those don\u0027t even exist any more in this scheme.

Out of cash? Warp to next month. This budget is pretty much for all science missions and is based on rep, what programs you want, etc. No more 3d parties asking you for science from orbit around the Mun. Linus and Werner ask for funds to do science. Commercial contracts are commercial, and are an external income stream. Tourism has to self-fund as well. Warping to Jool mission completion, ignoring everything else you have going on? That\u0027s not a thing, play sandbox for that. Besides, you don\u0027t need to, as routine play will actually move time forward, unlike now, where it ONLY moves forward due to players warping mission transit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp to next transfer window? If the next transfer window is in a year, guess what, you don\u0027t warp to it, you do a few other things, and since time actually moves forward in smaller wars, you don\u0027t need to do this.

Ever. Career is \u003Cem\u003Esupposed\u003C/em\u003E to have management aspects, and the ability to fail as a program. In replay it is simply not possible to fail. There are not even alternate strategies to bother taking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad hasn\u0027t tackled this because they have no decent conception of what career should be, and they tacked on the current system, then just ran with it as it was easier to \u0022finish\u0022 this one than make one that is actually good. The current career is random side quests. That\u0027s it. The \u0022strategies,\u0022 are not strategies. The Mission Control does;t control missions, it\u0027s a contract office. The rescues and milestones imply a space race... that doesn\u0027t exist. It\u0027s a cobbled together mess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that getting the balance right on a new career system is non-trivial, but it would be time well spent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings required to make career decent, plus have a chance of failure in any normal play mode, IMO:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Time needs to progress for normal operations. This means that warping has to become standard at some level due to budgets doled out over X week timeframes, construction taking time (a whole bunch of KCT stuff could be used here), etc. Life support? Maybe (could be Hard mode, as LS actually makes a qualitative difference in play, not just grind).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Dump absurd contracts. Hauling ore is not a thing, making a base with ISRU is. Suborbital is no different than orbital for part testing, ever, but being in or out of an atmosphere is meaningful, or reentering might be a new one (heat above some value). Most contracts are goofy. They need to make sense in the career context, instead---designed to make sense in that context from both directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Revert and quicksave... QS is pretty necessary for crashes, but using them in the course of regular play is a problem for career mode. In Sandbox, try things back from orbit all you like, but in career, since there are no random failures, the player has to be allowed (forced) to deal with their mistakes. That;s kind of the point of career, else why not play sandbox/science? I\u0027d have a revert quota per year, dunno if that is possible for loading or making saves. So the revert quota is for simulation (or it could go the KCT route). Then you actually end up testing stuff to save a revert for when you might really need it (you launched the Duna ship, but forgot to put an antenna on it). If building takes time, then just some testing moves the clock. We want testing, and failures to take time, so that you might end up with time pressure at some point if you\u0027ve not done well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Make Program/mission/contract (whatever we call them) time limits sensible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Allow the players to set the agenda. There are finite bodies to visit, and finite ways to visit them---from orbit, in the atmosphere (if any), or on the surface), manned or unmanned. That\u0027s it. It would be easy to have a \u0022build your program\u0022 section with pull downs. Allowable budget, timeframe, rep, min science gathered, all these can be interactive sliders... do the same mission for fewer funds, and watch the rep reward slider move up automatically, build a trivial mission, and the rep slider goes down, unless you can do it far cheaper than average.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has to be a way, and the entire Squad career paradigm is broken now. I just started a 1.1.2 career (mostly normal settings, dead crew is dead, and I don\u0027t revert except from the pad for dumb stuff (forgot to change the crew, or forgot some part, etc), and I only use QS for crash recovery. I take contracts that make sense, and parts contracts have to be part of a launch on an actual rocket. I\u0027ve unlocked the first few tiers of the tree, it\u0027s like day 61, and I have a million funds, and a few buildings upgraded. At this point, the game in terms of win/lose is long over. There is zero probability my funds and science don\u0027t just grow like crazy. Every career I start is like this, I\u0027d have to fubar several launches in a row early on to have a chance of failure. In hard mode, it would be similar, except I\u0027d have to take contracts I\u0027d never take otherwise (which I hate).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-12T18:59:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2016 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T19:08:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222577511\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136735\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221463073165\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devil is in the details here.

For money to matter the game should really only provide you with just enough money to complete the given mission. Lets just say the Mun mission should cost less than\u00A050,000f. So the game gives you a deadline of 6\u00A0months and provides you with 10,000f a month. What this means is you have to time warp\u00A0through 5 months of your deadline in order to have enough to launch the mission\u00A0and for each of those months your reputation is declining. Fine, you say, once you complete the Mun mission you\u0027ll earn all that reputation back and more. But what happens when you want to run a Jool mission? Its going to slowly dole\u00A0out the amount you\u0027ll eventually need to run the mission, then you need to warp to the next transfer window, then you have to warp 3 years while your mission transfers. If you don\u0027t run shorter missions in that time-frame you\u0027ll be sitting on a million gazillion dollars and all of your reputation will bleed away. You\u0027re thinking \u0022whatever, just send a Duna mission in the mean time\u0022, but you still have to wait for the Duna transfer window\u00A0and then 300 days in transit, so that mission must also be filled in with yet smaller missions in between to keep your rep alive. As pointed out in the thread I linked above this adds up to a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of smaller missions.

For money to matter the game should really only provide you with just enough money to complete the given mission. Lets just say the Mun mission should cost less than\u00A050,000f. So the game gives you a deadline of 6\u00A0months and provides you with 10,000f a month. What this means is you have to time warp\u00A0through 5 months of your deadline in order to have enough to launch the mission\u00A0and for each of those months your reputation is declining. Fine, you say, once you complete the Mun mission you\u0027ll earn all that reputation back and more. But what happens when you want to run a Jool mission? Its going to slowly dole\u00A0out the amount you\u0027ll eventually need to run the mission, then you need to warp to the next transfer window, then you have to warp 3 years while your mission transfers. If you don\u0027t run shorter missions in that time-frame you\u0027ll be sitting on a million gazillion dollars and all of your reputation will bleed away. You\u0027re thinking \u0022whatever, just send a Duna mission in the mean time\u0022, but you still have to wait for the Duna transfer window\u00A0and then 300 days in transit, so that mission must also be filled in with yet smaller missions in between to keep your rep alive. As pointed out in the thread I linked above this adds up to a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of smaller missions.
