It could be used for example to keep boosters loaded while falling back to Kerbin, so you could attach parachutes and recover them later (which would be handy in career). But also in sandbox you could do some cool things with it.\n\nDo give it an option to turn it off to prevent lag without having to terminate the craft.\n\nI don\u0027t know if it is possible at all, but that is why it is a suggestion ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T13:38:13Z","Content":"Once I had a contract wich said \u0027land a used-up SRB\u0027 . I had no better idea than adding parachutes to them and hope that they won\u0027t get out of loading range. They were the stronger SRBs, so I got waaay too far to be able to recover them. But once I decoupled them and activated the parachutes, I suddenly completed the contract. They never surfaced, but I got the contract. I wasn\u0027t looking wether I got back their cost, but in my view, that should be done. Have an option that gives you information about such decoupled parts, and says wether you have enough parachutes or not to survive. And how much will survive. Once you decouple these, and they became unloaded, you either get back their cost, or they will be placed on the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T20:55:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Once I had a contract wich said \u0027land a used-up SRB\u0027 .

Right now, the game only has one physics bubble, and it\u0027s limited in size (FP rounding errors cause issues when you go past about 25-30km from the center of the physics bubble).
