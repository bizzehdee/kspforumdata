Most pods don\u0027t even visually have a heat shield anyway, it\u0027s only the simple starter pod that has the visual shape. The current heat shields do the job just fine. I see absolutely no advantage to having an integrated shield on the starter pod, when you can just add a normal shield below it when required. Additionally, separate shields almost certainly make it much easier to deal with the physics of the heating in the simulation code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the shape, it\u0027s fine as-is, I see no need to change it. It even makes sense for using it without an additional ablative heat shield, if that\u0027s Squad\u0027s intended behaviour for slower re-entry. In theory, two of the features of the rounded shape are that it\u0027s aerodynamically stable, and can actually be used to fine-tune the trajectory, if memory serves (if KSP\u0027s aero sim ever reaches the point where that would matter). There\u0027s a very interesting Apollo-era video out there, a NASA official production (I think), which is roughly \u0022how pods work\u0022, if you want to know how you can actually \u0022fly\u0022 a pod rather than just passively wait for it to submit to gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T20:05:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Roflcopterkklol\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo be honest heat shields are pointless, i regularly re enter kerbin at 3000\u002Bm/s without heat shields, the worst that will happen is batteries on the craft will go boom.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI choose to think of it as a bug.... and I very much hope it will be tuned in future to make reentry heating actually a danger you need to account for....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t see why Ablator shouldn\u0027t work like monoprop: slider in tweakables, adding more will increase weight..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, current ablator doesn\u0027t change it\u0027s mass regardless if you choose maximum or barely anything - so I automatically assumed it\u0027d be the same for pods, and I dislike \u0022free perks\u0022 like that.
