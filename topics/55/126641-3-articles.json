Is it a limiting factor in real life? Yep, it sure is. But if life support just becomes another \u0022you must attach X number of part Y on your ship to fly for time Z\u0022, that also becomes \u0022boring\u0022 to me. If it becomes a matter of development time,\u00A0I would much rather see time spent adding more powerful\u00A0tools in the game first. Tools that allow for complex mission planning and mission management. I\u0027d rather be able to fly more simultaneous\u00A0missions to more places in complex ways, than to have to add more parts to my already laggy ships just so I can go on the same flights that I already do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we want to get into the realism debate, those complex mission management tools are just as \u0022grass roots.\u0022\u00A0Do I have a team of hundreds of thousands of scientists and a huge array of supercomputers\u00A0at my disposal? Nope.

There is a nice middle ground in there too, though I\u0027m sure there are plenty of people who disagree.

I\u0027m onboard with fairly realistic physics (doesn\u0027t have to be n-body and atomic level CFD though), but I\u0027m not a fan of adding things like fuel slosh, limited firings on engines, etc. into the core game.

I think many of us hoping for LS don\u0027t expect it to be included before major game mechanics are polished up, and some simple mission planning tools would be huge. In fact, in many ways LS doesn\u0027t work before you have that\u00A0because its too difficult to estimate how long your missions will be and plan accordingly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think though that long term, if done right, LS could add a lot more than adding mandatory parts. If the basics were simple but efficient greenhouses required some forethought there would be legit gameplay and weight tradeoffs to consider depending on how long your mission was.\u00A0It also could be a sincere basis for thinking about time as a cost. Transfers could be optimized by the player for shorter flight times or lower dV. Beyond adding just the sense that we were living off the land and surviving in harsh environments it adds tension and urgency.\u00A0Even if the realism is simplified (and it should be),\u00A0it opens up real considerations and could inject\u00A0a cool new layer to the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T18:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T20:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222309606\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126641\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449341433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n50 minutes ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndifficult to estimate how long your missions will be and plan accordingly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, exactly. 100% yes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a game of trial and error, then the penalty for failure can\u0027t be extreme.

Back in the days where getting to orbit was most of the game (and maybe the M\u00FCn if you were really good), trial and error worked fine. All your flights were relatively short and you could iterate quickly. If you stranded the odd kerbal on the M\u00FCn, then help (or likely another crash \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0) was just a day away in game time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese days, trial and error just gets in the way. Game mechanics can\u0027t be too challenging\u00A0because the penalty for failure can\u0027t be too extreme. Game mechanics are hobbled in some cases because they\u0027re just too hard to balance assuming the player is using trial-and-error. The parts test contracts spring to mind - given some decent planning tools they could be a lot more fun. As it is, I\u0027m either not going to bother trying them for the paltry reward, or I\u0027m going to \u0027revert flight\u0027 a whole lot in the process - which takes away a lot of the point of Career mode since it allows the penalties for failure to be eliminated at a stroke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing anything interplanetary is discouraged because who wants to spend months of game time flying a ship to Duna, only to have it fail at the last minute because you didn\u0027t trial and error your fuel load correctly?\u00A0Finally,\u00A0as you mentioned in an earlier post, simultaneous missions are discouraged because if you do pancake that Duna probe you have two unappetising\u00A0choices, either reiterate, start again and wait another umpteen months of game time,\u00A0or redo the mission and lose whatever progress you made on your other missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think that flexibility is KSP\u0027s weakness as well as its strength, particularly in career mode. It makes for a superlative sandbox and a career game that tries to be all things to all people but also falls short of the mark for all people. I appreciate what you\u0027re saying but I also think that Sandbox mode provides ample scope for all\u00A0the Ferris Wheels, trains, helicopters, or whatever you want to build. For Career mode, I say dial back the flexibility and give us more of what was intended\u00A0- a space program management game. If that means that some creative freedom is lost along the way, then so be it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat doesn\u0027t necessarily mean layering on oodles and oodles of detail (such as fuel sloshing and limited restart engines for example \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0) - the very best games combine simplicity \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E depth. The problem with KSP Career mode is that it doesn\u0027t have either - the basics of playing the game are not simple and the game as a whole lacks depth.

If a player is unwilling to even do part test contracts, because failure means they can just revert, why would they want to spend most of their play time to fly all the way out to somewhere just to find out that they not only fell short on fuel, but that they are also short on LS. Or even if they were just short on fuel, the crew is dead now because they can\u0027t wait two years for rescue. Is that realistic? Yep. But now it\u0027s just another revert away. So difficulty is just sidestepped anyway. There isn\u0027t even a reason to bother building a rescue mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike I said, if you want complex gameplay, you have to give the player some complex tools.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think we disagree. I just know that the current KSP design philosophy doesn\u0027t support the idea of complex tools. Therefore I\u0027m not a fan of something like LS, because it hobbles core gameplay without adding in something unique. (\u0022You now need part X to do the same thing you did last week.\u0022)\u00A0Same for a comm network. (\u0022You now need a satellite network so you can land a probe on the planet and do nothing.\u0022) Same for nearly anything that relies on time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose things need to be looked at from a holistic view. Adding them on one part at a time is what gives a disjointed, \u0022something is missing\u0022 feeling. KSP is what it is, and to expect radical change this late might be optimistic. If it\u0027s not going to get radical change, then anything new needs to enhance the core mechanics, or else it just adds to the disjointed feeling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s never a question of \u0022realism\u0022 vs. \u0022lol kerbal\u0022 in my mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake the comm network for example.

Sure, water might be recycled at 94% or something like that, and food much less so, but in the end all that matters is the net extra mass you must take. That\u0027s it, it\u0027s just mass. If you wanted to be more complex, do what Roverdude is talking about and have some requirement for ha volume per kerbal per unit time (they need nicer digs for a 10 year mission than a 10 day mission).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are going to send in effect a mk1 capsule to Duna, and that\u0027s all you can manage, then it should be a probe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-31T02:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2015 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-31T02:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo the OP:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe original idea for this game, as stated by Harv himself, was basically a 2,5D rocket launch into the atmo of a single planet that got on rails and 2D as soon as you left the atmo ... in other words ( the ones of ex-SQUAD MaxMaps ) a little more than a flash game , and more , made by someone that admitted that he only really learned about orbital mechanics while coding the game \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0So, the game has been since the beginning being steadily drifting towards more realism and that is a good thing \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0( atleast IMHO ...
