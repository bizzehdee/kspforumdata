I\u0027ve found nothing that says I can\u0027t do this, so on to the suggestions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Nuclear engines [can] use different fuel\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one seems a bit far out there, but let me explain. Nuclear engines use either water for fuel, or oxygen/hydrogen. This simplifies a lot of things later on, but it does have an actual backing anyways. A lot of liquid fuel rockets are quite literally steam rockets. They burn oxygen and hydrogen together, producing thrust, and, as exhaust, water in the form of steam. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for using water as fuel, there are some \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_thermal_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ereal-world ideas out there\u003C/a\u003E for rockets that can be effectively powered by water. Granted, these are all nuclear rockets, due to the way these rockets function. In short, the nuclear reactor superheats the propellant (in this case, water) which expands and provides the thrust to power the rocket. So really, this part isn\u0027t that far off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2. Water/metal mining\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the whole mining part has been suggested a lot, and by now reminds most people of the Kethane mod. This isn\u0027t like that. When you mine water, it goes directly into the tanks for your rocket, which, if it wants to use the water, needs to be nuclear powered. As for metal mining, it won\u0027t be used by the spacecraft for resource gain directly, but I\u0027ll come back to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Asteroid Belt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, another one that has probably been suggested a lot, but once again, there\u0027s a difference here. Asteroids in the belt would be small, maybe under a kilometer. These asteroids also have large supplies of frozen water (I believe the technical term is \u003Cem\u003Eice.\u003C/em\u003E) and metal, just waiting to be mined. These asteroids would be found either beyond Jool or between Jool and Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4. Rockets move asteroids\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s where stuff gets a little crazy. I am, in fact, suggesting the ability to move asteroids using rockets, although at a very slow pace. Let\u0027s assume that, since you have rockets, you can stop the rotation of the asteroid, or whatever you need to do. Using a ton of fuel, you can move an asteroid into a very different orbit. Now, how about that fuel? How are you going to get all the fuel you need to do that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple. The fuel is \u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003E the asteroid. Seriously. You can mine the water in the asteroid and use it for fuel at the same time. Of course, the process would be long, so you\u0027d need to have some way of \u0022locking\u0022 your ship onto the asteroid so you can somehow use time-warp and burn engines at the same time. The entire asteroid\u002Byour ship could even be regarded as a single ship, in much the same way that docked ships are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E5. Career Mode Metal Mining\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy now you must be wondering, \u0022WHY WOULD I WANT TO DO THIS?! This sounds so tedious/annoying to do!\u0022. Well, you\u0027re right and wrong at the same time. First, some background info. It\u0027s well known that in the upcoming career mode, you\u0027ll have to actually pay for your rocket parts (costs are already shown on part information!), you can do R\u0026amp;D, you hire new astronauts, and to pay for it all, you accomplish missions and such. But who wants to do something like fly to Duna for the 18th time to make some extra bucks when there\u0027s real money to be made, out in the asteroid belt?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest is that by using your asteroid-on-a-rocket, you can move it into a new orbit to make it much easier to get to - maybe into an orbit similar to Kerbin\u0027s, if not actually in Kerbin orbit - because bigger rockets cost more money, right? Then, you send in your real mining ships. Of course, they\u0027re all of your design, so they may mine water, they may not. Point being, these are the metal miners. They mine metal and store the ore in some sort of cargo tank. Then, they fly it back to Kerbin. For every kilogram/ton/whatever of ore you return safely to Kerbin, you get money. As in, a LOT of money, because asteroid metal is expensive, seeing the investment you have to put into it. Of course, there would be a limit on how much you could mine from it, at which point the asteroid might break up or something. Just as long as it\u0027s not your infinite cash cow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, in case anybody\u0027s thinking, \u0022That sounds way too easy. First day of career mode and you do this, and who cares about flying to the planets anymore when you have an asteroid in orbit giving you all the money you need?\u0022. That\u0027s why this would have to be quite an investment. Something has to be expensive in there - heck, if you could give somebody 50 dollars to do this and give you the profits, we\u0027d all be millionaires by now. So doing the whole mining-asteroids-for-money thing is quite expensive. Sending the rockets all the way out there, moving the asteroids into a more affordable orbit, it\u0027s all really expensive, not to mention the R\u0026amp;D costs required to be able to research how to do this in-game. This also has the side affect of preventing people from skipping all the other objectives that may or may not be in career mode - after all, you\u0027ve gotta pay for this asteroid mining thing somehow, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that\u0027s all my suggestions for today. Please tell me what you think of them, or how it could be improved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fox62","CreatedById":23673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T17:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds so genius I have a hard time thinking of how I never came up with this.

Especially if they\u0027ve got metal in them. This was brought up in another topic about asteroids(not by me, I was just a casual onlooker) and apparently a ten meter asteroid would weigh a LOT. It makes sense, too...I mean, if you had ten meters of steel, it\u0027d be extremely heavy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we\u0027d have to make something pretty extreme to be able to move a kilometer of asteroid about. Not that it\u0027d be impossible, just difficult and expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyways, mining and complex resource stuff has been planned by SQUAD. There was even a phenomenal flow chart shown(by them) to illustrate how resources would probably work in the stock game. I guess it was too complicated(but honestly not at all), so I\u0027ve heard that they gave up on that amazingness. They\u0027ve even considered leaving complex mining for an expansion pack after the release of KSP1.0 which made everyone very angry for a short while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that doesn\u0027t mean that they\u0027re bad suggestions. I definitely would love to be able to do all sorts of fun mining, setting up processing facilities on celestial bodies and all this fun stuff. It wouldn\u0027t even be as complicated as it looked on that flow chart if they just introduced one or two elements in at a time THEN introduced processing parts later on in the tech tree. I mean, they\u0027ve got idiots like me learning complicated rocket science(though not as complicated as real world science) without having to think about math or numbers at all.
