The only way it could be better is if there was a way to show closest approach markers, and maybe a permanent waypoint for KSP complex.\n\nObviously it isn\u0027t realistic that you could simply look through your window, or space suit face plate, and see a giant arrow pointing where you need to go. Well, until you research advanced LED tech it isn\u0027t realistic..however it is practically expected in video games.\n\nIt can be extremely hard to tell if you are going in the right direction. Showing a symbol on the navball helps, but it seems silly when I have my rocket do a 360 just to check which direction the target is in."},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T07:58:30Z","Content":"With remote tech you get a permanent marker on the KSC.
