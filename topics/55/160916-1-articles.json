I mean if we could get to stay there for a week, it would be cool feeling the different gravity, the absent atmosphere, the coolness factor of being one of the lucky few...but take a walk somewhere around there, and imagine how by the end of the week you realise everything looks pretty much the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo in game, we land on Duna, get the science, plant a flag and walk around...for 5 minutes? Then sometime after we may land again, or even build a base, this base refuels a science scout-plane-thing...and then suddenly it gets really boring there, because it is literally just flat textured landscapes.

Dres is a Ceres-like body, which will find it hard to hold on to its moon (half the size of Gilly is already too big for Dres). Mars could very well handle a Gilly size moon to simulate Mars\u0027 Deimos.

I don\u0027t spend a lot of time on the planets anymore, beyond landing and grabbing science, so additional transfers, cargo to be pushed, basically space-based activities get expanded by the addition of new planets. That makes the game for me, new destinations. The New Horizons mod got me a bit excited about stock KSP again because there were new destinations; being able to wrangle Sarnus and then Urlum fly-bys from a Jool transfer, and then finnagle a dip back to the inner system using Urlum\u0027s gravity was very satisfying.
