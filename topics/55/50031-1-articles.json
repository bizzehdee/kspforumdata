Once it deliver its payload, the spaceplane plunges to its doom (since you\u0027re now controlling the payload, not the rocket). While this isn\u0027t much of an issue with the economy disabled, it is still a bit bizarre why you would go through the effort of building an airplane that will just smash itself into the ground every single time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArguably, we\u0027ll need some sort of basic auto-pilot for planes, something as simple as altitude and speed hold should be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MajorNr01\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MajorNr01\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simply feel like the need is arising at this point, because SSTOs (especially spaceplanes) are in fact a viable option for a launch system and likely to be the future of space in reality.
