And it has only four control surfaces, two of which are powerful wing-length ailerons that it uses for pitch. So when you tell it to roll, it uses \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E of those surfaces to roll, plus the reaction wheel in the pod. If we could dedicate ailerons to roll and pitch separately, like we can with FAR, this kind of \u0022problem\u0022 wouldn\u0027t exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there\u0027s a mighty big problem with acceleration/deceleration as you propose. The problem being that the new ASAS will only lock onto a heading once the control input has returned to zero. Under that system, you\u0027ll have even more lag in SAS response than you do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just tried flying the Ravenspear, and it really handles like a dream with fine controls.

It smoothly rolls until you stop inputting the roll command ? It doesnt jerk from position to position ? Must be my installation of KSP then because the rolls seem to jerk quiet a bit...even a tap on the keyboard makes it jerk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem you describe is already an issue because of the sudden jerking nature of the controls at the moment players need to do minute corrections which cause extra inputs anyways... unless you are so pro that you can roll to precisely the correct position you want each time you use the Q and E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion would minimize the need to constantly correct your movements and thus not changing headings all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont get why you are so against this idea, the second I tried a plane the rolling and controls were so obviously wrong I cant believe it got out of development phase... there is no way even the most generous critic can say the plane controls are anywhere near good enough, even for a simulation lite program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe planes rolls are too spasmodic, the rudder controls make the craft slide rather than change heading... only the pitch controls seem to do the job properly and even those are imprecise and spasmodic with or without fine controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(NOTE: May sound harsh but I am only trying to improve the game with my suggestions, and I can tell you the plane controls are off, feels completely wrong and one of the reasons for that is the sudden and instant change in vectors when controls are applied. )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcceleration / deceleration would eliminate the sudden stops, the sudden change to position, grant more analogue control to the craft... by tapping you could move in gentle increments and by holding down it would rapidly accelerate to large movements, and then rapidly but not instantly stop when you stopped pressing the button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can only see improvement with this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T14:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know of the kind of system you mean, and I like it when it\u0027s done right, and applied right. I mostly see it in racing games for some reason. Also, whenever it exists, it exists as a setting in the options - you are given the option to tweak it to your liking. Fine Controls in KSP are already that system, they simply may be a little too quick for your liking - in which case the option to make the input as smooth as you need it would be the thing to add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is twofold here. The flight physics are as much to blame for this as the keyboard controls, and, honestly, I\u0027ve flown IL-2 Sturmovik with a keyboard - the only difference is the amount of roll momentum. The most agile of fighters in IL-2 will respond sharply to keyboard input, sharp enough to make aiming at anything but point-blank range a chore, but they won\u0027t start movement so suddenly, because they have an actual flight model behind them - and like I said earlier, they don\u0027t use all of their control surfaces to steer at once. KSP suffers from a lack of a flight model (what we have now isn\u0027t a flight model as much as it\u0027s a falling model - the barest basics of air resistance and lift) first and foremost. When it actually gets an overhaul of that, I think we\u0027ll see planes handling much more realistically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m not sure if it was fixed, but if you\u0027re on one of those non-Windows platforms, I think there was a bug that made fine controls mode not work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso also, since 0.21.1, there is a forced deadzone on the control input, so that SAS doesn\u0027t lose its lock on the intended direction so easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso also also, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/crr6am98zh5a91p/KSP%202013-07-25%2021-04-58-647.avi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis video I made\u003C/a\u003E with the Aeris 3A.
