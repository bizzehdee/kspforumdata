He has a point, of course.\n\nIt got me wondering whether there would be an easy (i.e. simple to implement and not disruptive to current game dynamics) way to spice up planetary surface science to encourage more small-scale land based exploration. In the real world (e.g. Mars Curiosity Rover), a lot of interesting geology happens from checking out different features over a scale of meters rather than kilometers.\n\nHere\u0027s what I came up with:\n\nSurface biomes could be chopped up into procedurally generated sub-biomes. Instead of \u0022EVA Report from the surface at Duna\u0027s Poles\u0022 you could have \u0022EVA Report from the surface at [procedurally generated name XYZ] within Duna\u0027s Poles.\u0022 Names and zones could be similar to those that are randomly/procedurally generated for the various survey and scanning contracts, and I would imagine a lot of the existing code that was built for those could even be recycled.\n\nThese sub-biomes would only be discoverable and accessible from the surface. From the atmosphere or from space, they would just show up as the regular biome.\n\nThis would motivate more surface-based exploration (rovers!) by offering up a few more science points to people willing to drive around a little. It also doesn\u0027t seem too hard to implement, and wouldn\u0027t really break any existing game feature.\n\nIt would be up to the devs to decide how much additional science to award for going to sub-biomes. It\u0027s probably too generous to award full science points for just driving a few km. I would suggest, as a starting point for further discussion/iteration, awarding 15-20% of the baseline science for each additional sub-biome that was explored. So for example, you land in a new biome and your first set of experiments gets the usual award. Then you drive/walk/hop to some other place in a different sub-biome, repeat your experiments (assuming you have the ability to repeat), and get perhaps 15% more science points. A third sub-biome would give you another 15%, etc.\n\nThoughts on this idea are welcome. One option, of course, would be for some intrepid coder to hack out a simple mod that does this. Anyone interested?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T18:06:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky**"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:11:08Z","Content":"Agreed.

But it\u0027s also not that interesting to use. Something with semi randomness to keep things unpredictable, and a set up that has you watching your instruments, looking for changes would feel much more like proper Exploration. Plus, it\u0027d work in sandbox - there\u0027s the challenge of finding stuff, despite you not needing to collect points. \n\nSomething like this is better than the survey contracts, because it\u0027d be always available, and you\u0027re exploring, and discovering things by yourself, not taking some data because someone sent you, to something they identified. \n\nThe way KSP uses points is a problem. It makes it hard to add something that lets you collect science without re balancing many things, and if you add things which are kust for interest, they\u0027ll feel out of place, what\u0027s the benefit of visiting? \n\n Career\u0027s features have been built around unlocking a finite list of upgrades, rather than sustaining and continually improving your endeavours in space.

Or maybe the game could be balanced so you don\u0027t necessarily need to collect all the points possible and still come home with a gain, making player interest the limit. \n\nAnyway, having some involved surface exploration would be a step from Rocket sim with challenges tacked on, to the full space experience it could be.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-31T08:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2015 08:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tw1**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T03:43:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not against this, but there is already too much \u0022science\u0022 WRT to the tech tree, etc. If something like this were added, I think all science values should drop.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* no.

I never expected it to generate this much interest!\n\nLots of discussion of how \u0022random\u0022 (vs. repeatable procedural) the sub-biomes should be. My view there is they at least have to be consistent within a given game file. They shouldn\u0027t shift around from mission to mission, but it might be acceptable to have every new game have a different randomly generated set. That would keep things interesting.\n\nAlso could work OK to just have them be totally procedural (not varying from game to game) since realistically it\u0027s not that common to touch down in exactly the same place every time. When I go to a planet (or the Mun), the point where I land is generally not too carefully selected, or driven by practical considerations like my orbital inclination and where it\u0027s daytime, unless I need to link up with something that I\u0027ve landed earlier. So in practice, randomness or non-randomness probably wouldn\u0027t impact the playability of the game much.

I\u0027d like it to happen, but the probability of that happening is ZERO.\n\nGiven this, we have to work within ideas that have a non-zero probability of being added.\n\n\u0022Biomes\u0022 are a thing. All the worlds need to be improved, so your idea of making interesting areas via \u0022art\u0022 is not impossible, so that\u0027s a good idea. Scatter exists, as do \u0022anomalies,\u0022 so perhaps those mechanisms might also be used.\n\nI like your idea of detailed areas of interest... describe one to me, just an example. Is it *possible* that some of these areas of interest, as detailed as they might be are not really site-specific? (by site I mean the exact location on the map, not the type of terrain. Ie: interesting feature X only occurs in lowlands, but it need not occur only in a certain lowland area)\n\nDuna might be a better example, but for the Mun, we have scatter rocks, sort of like this, only rounded for some inexplicable reason:\n\n![610213main_S73-22871_full_zps7930337c.jpg](http://i1163.photobucket.com/albums/q552/Rodeogeo/610213main_S73-22871_full_zps7930337c.jpg)\n\n(the guy in the picture, Jack (Harrison) Schmitt, taught a unit on lunar geology I took a rather long time ago, as you might imagine, his slideshows were epic for a geology class ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ).\n\nIsolated outcropping like this that are different than the usual scatter would be a simple, *random* addition that would provide something to do on EVA. Once you land on a body it might have a % chance of generating a rock that is different from other scatter XXX to YYYY meters away from the landing site (far enough that it might look like normal scatter at a glance). Say just angular boulders for the Mun, instead of the rounded scatter. These would have colliders, too.\n\nYour idea would be great for things like Rilles, domes, or even a kind of material collected on the above Apollo 17 mission, dark mantling deposits. Those are macroscopic features and by definition need to be done to the terrain at large. What I am talking about is the sort of small-scale novelty that only gets spotted once you are on the surface itself. Think novel deposits that Curiosity finds pretty commonly. Geologists know what to roughly expect, but then Curiosity sends an image os layered sediment visible due to erosion, for example, and it\u0027s exciting. Invisible from orbit, obvious at EVA height. These features are not truly random, which is why we can use the \u0022biomes\u0022 to chose appropriate small-scale additions. Areas that formerly held water on Duna would get exposed sedimentary stuff that a scientist could spot, for example.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s actually sound design.\n\u003E You have to go to great effort (lot of Mun/Minmus landing and retrieval) to actually advance much in the Tech-Tree.\n\u003E \n\u003E By allowing to finish the entire Tech-tree with only the Mun/Minmus or another planet you are giving the ability to play a whole scenario centered around a Moon or Planet.\n\u003E \n\u003E This one seem childish but \u0022Balanced Progression =/= 100% Completion Grinding\u0022 many game-maker do that error.\n\nI was merely making an observation that this is the case. I wasn\u0027t saying to nerf the science to the point you needed to go to Jool to make a new rocket engine (dumb tech tree), just that by adding *additional* large chunks of science the whole tree might get unlocked far faster than it does already. In general, KSP needs a time-based mechanic. I suppose many play by warping any given mission to competition, to get time passing.

I was thinking, that maybe we dont need artificial interesting spots, but could do with what we have, if we just use a couple of more parameters for the experiments. For each geome there could be altitude as well as attitude \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4records\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4. Like: Your first experiment in the given geome pays the usual (maybe compensated for the addtional stuff, as: ) and the altitude and attitude (slopyness of terrain) get noted. Now, you can conduct additional experiments at the same geome, but at higher/lower altitudes/angles, paying you science according to the difference of each to your \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4record\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (highest/lowest already conducted experiment of this type in the geome). \n\nIn effect, after landing and conducting the standard experiments as we know them, you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d want to drive around to cover a bit of altitude difference, go as high above and low below the landing site as you find reasonable to maximize your science rewards, and investigate this slope over there, while you are at it.\n\nA third parameter could simply be \u0022distance to landing site\u0022 rewarding just simply driving as far a way as you want to repeat the experiment on the landing site.\n\nHave each of the parameters modify the reward for the repeated experiment for upto 100% max. The extra 100% for altitude would have to be split between at least two (additional, after the first) experiments as at least one experiment would have to take place at the lowest point of elevation of the geome and another at its highest (if you want the full 100% that is - you could chose to go with less, of course). Same for attitude, if the first experiement is not conducted at absolutely level terrain and the second standing at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (the full 100% will be very hard to get i guess, or the max could be set to \u003C90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, say 60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ).

Heck, I think squad should do a better job of creating such areas in general.\n\nChange scale, though, and ask a simple question: Could an astronaut or probe *ever* find something of interest at a landing site that is not apparent from orbital photography? Yes, or no? If the answer is \u0022yes,\u0022 then you are either suggesting that Squad manually scatter stuff on this tiny scale all over every world very carefully, scatter it randomly over every world on a level that you\u0027d find them at a reasonable rate---OR, it could be scattered randomly only in areas where the player has a craft capable of possibly spotting these tiny \u0022anomalies\u0022 of interest (these would be actual geology). \n\nBTW, if you said \u0022no,\u0022 you are simply wrong, it\u0027s not a question of opinion. Curiosity, for example, finds things that were not visible from orbit practically every Sol. In the image above of the Apollo 17 site, that rock would have been barely visible in some high-res imagery. The LRO flying now can image Apollo sites with a resolution of ~1m, and the Lunar Orbiters of the mid 1960s did about the same. Ranger managed 0.5 m resolution on the last image before impact. You could tell boulders were there, but not if they were interesting for a geologist.\n\nThe first 2 methods require literally millions of new, interactive scatters be added. The 3d method need only throw possibly a couple per landing site, likely 5 orders of magnitude less stuff for the game to track.\n\nThere is a place for random, and it\u0027s on THAT scale size I am talking, NOT major features, visible from high-res orbital photography.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E From my point of view it would be the WORST idea ever for KSP.

Such a randomized system would have to be done in the context of changing the game such that there is \u0022fog\u0022 about what the other planets actually looked like. Orbital elements are calculated with precision from ground-based astronomy, and some data about atmospheres is know pretty well (spectrometry). That said, the resolution of the surfaces would be pretty low. The first Mariner flyby utterly changed what people knew about Mars, for example. A random system need not have planets generated 100% randomly, BTW, they need only be placed and scaled randomly. Imagine the Kerbol system, but squad makes 10 more planets, and twice as many new minor planets/moons (tiny is size a, huge mons are size z)---they can be made at any detail you desire. A randomized solar system would simply alter the orbits, and pick 6-10 as \u0022planets\u0022 and give each a chance to have moons based upon size (smaller planets get 0-3 moons of size a-g, medium planets might get sizes a-n, and gas or ice giant planets get moons of sizes a-z. All can be as designed, or scaled by a factor of 1 to 6 (size, and orbital distances). The scale factor would be capped in difficulty settings, since 6X is about like 6.4X RSS. Kerbin would stay the same (or maybe scale from 1-3X so standard parts would fine (3.2 kerbin is great with nothing but stock parts)), though it could have the orbital distance chance somewhat (within kerbol\u0027s habitable zone).\n\nSo we have a random system that the player must explore to know about (again, better science instruments and \u0022science\u0022 in general to meaningfully unlock the secrets of worlds, taking images (camera part, like scansat) to make a map view at whatever resolution, for example). The planets are just as well constructed (ideally better) than they are now.\n\nRandomization is involved, and it is unambiguously better for replay, with none of the negatives you mention (I granted all your positive improvements, so you\u0027ll need to explain how not having a wiki page for every world makes exploring less cool---the game will generate all that data as a function of what science you do (atm height, composition, etc, etc).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T13:50:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 01:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"}]}
