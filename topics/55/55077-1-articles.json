Having built many, many ships in my time (and backed most of them up for future space adventures), I\u0027ve come to the discovery that the current save list format is rather unsuitable when you have ~100\u002B craft in your VAB/SPH folders. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Having played Garry\u0027s Mod and being well accustomed to it\u0027s Advanced Duplicator (which saves it\u0027s files in customizable folders), I could consider a similar system in managing saves would be useful in KSP. Basically, instead of a list, you\u0027d get a menu full of folders which you can rename for different ship categories (ex Landers, Orbiters, Mod Ships, etc). Possibly with a corresponding system for subassemblys, or a merger of the two. It would make it much easier to navigate and find the ship you want then the list we have now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile on the subject, perhaps include a GUI system that shows a picture/3d representation of the ship along with it\u0027s description, so it\u0027s easier to figure out which it is. Many KSP ships tend to have cryptic mission names and such a feature would be very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hurry- Starfish!","CreatedById":90298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T15:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please. I have tons of crafts and also tend to have many different versions of the same craft, so something like that would be really helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA 3D representation probably won\u0027t be possible, but maybe a preview screenshot taken on save from an automatically calculated camera position would work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Garek","CreatedById":73214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T16:20:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is so much needed.
