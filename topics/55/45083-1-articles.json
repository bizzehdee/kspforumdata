You\u0027re going to use the observatory at KSC to discover planets and things before you go trying to send probes and such there. They\u0027d even mentioned using it to discover nearby star systems, as you suggested. The planned endgame was, of course, FTL warping to other solar systems that you\u0027d discovered via the observatory. What I hope for(and many other people, I\u0027d imagine) is that we can expand the observatory mechanic by dropping orbital telescopes into space, like we do in real life. That\u0027d be fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore things to do is always good for a game like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancZer","CreatedById":90711,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T13:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see not ony bulding, but spacecraft parts to be able to build space telescopes like Hubble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
