Now, if they did return the Magic Boulder, they should put it in harder to reach, harder to ascend from places then Ike. For example, Eeloo. Eeloo takes a lot of fuel to get to, and you\u0027ll need to push a heavier lander out there to land and ascend from there to get to the Magic Boulder. They could also put it around Moho, Pol (believe me or not, Pol is very hard to land on), Tylo, Vall, and Dres. What do you think? Should the Magic Boulder be forgotten, or resurrected?![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:04:40Z","Content":"What, you mean you haven\u0027t found it yet? ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:11:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What, you mean you haven\u0027t found it yet? ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nNo, the version I started playing KSP was 0.23."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T08:57:48Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see Option 5: I don\u0027t really care."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T09:03:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t see Option 5: I don\u0027t really care.\n\nBecause that\u0027s a really important thing to know for everyone. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T09:15:26Z","Content":"There is also Option 6.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot790.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.25/Screenshots/screenshot790.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot791.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.25/Screenshots/screenshot791.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T14:39:14Z","Content":"Would be nice to get it back, but it also would be nice to get it in an improved form, with some new features.\n\nEg. make it heat the approaching ships? Or kill kerbals with radiation? Or have random bursts of dust pushing away anything on it\u0027s path? And put it on some interesting, challenging orbit (eg. Molniya orbit in retrograde?) Something to make it an actual interesting object to visit."}]}
