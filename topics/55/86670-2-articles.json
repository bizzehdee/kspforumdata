I have so far tried one strategy which is the 50% commitment towards aggressive negotiations, I intend to go 50% in on enhancing recovery stuff once I get the parts for reusable big boost stages. My personal strategy in 0.25 is one of slightly more caution than usual(though I have already destroyed the launch pad once at a 64,000 funds cost) and so far have not done as many simultaneous flights as in previous versions and am letting the Kerbal clock move forward faster than usual. I am finding funds easy to acquire still, but also want to make sure I have a buffer against some accident that wipes out a more expensive facility. I was surprised how easy it was to destroy the launch pad (a staging error that had me drop a 1.25meter parts first stage that had un-ignited boosters from about 20 meters). I am also aiming in my strategy to not have to hire any Kerbals (I have two rescued recruits so far and hope to have enough Kerbals to do simultaneous interplanetary flights in the not too distant future). Oh and while I have got a sandbox game set up, that I intended to try new designs in, I am thinking that as long as I have sufficient funds I may try to play with development activity in the career game as an extra level of difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T17:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AmpsterMan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think we are forgetting that the tech tree was meant to be a sort of training wheels for newer players (of which non of us on this thread are)..\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E That was truth ages ago, now \u0022training wheels for new players\u0022 are tutorials or sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nadreck\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nadreck\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think they put the right thought into balancing this for an early access game: leave it to the players to balance it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Having an option to manually change the game balance isn\u0027t an excuse for poor balance in default settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Democracy 3 already made that mistake and paid with bad reviews, though the \u0022bad\u0022 balance out there was nowhere near as bad as what we have here now in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E KSP needs an end game---which would segue into a paid KSP follow on (devs gotta eat!).
