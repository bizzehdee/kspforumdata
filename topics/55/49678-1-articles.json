You place a station in orbit and than remove the command pod. But it has an docking port for ships to attach - send up a pod, dock with the station, and you run the tests. The manned craft than leaves the dock and lands (crashes) back onto Kerbin and returns the data? You can return and runs more tests until it is no longer worth the points to do so. Maybe add fuel tanks to the station so it can be used as a fuel station when retired from science duty?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marko dash","CreatedById":1584,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:18:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe problem is that by the time you unlock docking ports to build stations you\u0027ve exhausted all the science in the local kerbin area, and to get points from the experiments the part that generated it (example: the goo container) but be intact and present on the ship that lands and gets recovered.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Whackjob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Whackjob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s an idea. Rather than some simple science-over-time bit, why not have a microgravity laboratory? Put the lab module on a space station, and it doesn\u0027t work unless it\u0027s in 0G. Then, you have to fly up samples from KSP, dock, run the tests in the lab, then return them. And why not add the capability to have different modules to bolt on to the microgravity lab? Bio lab, polymer lab, et cetera.\u003Cp\u003EThis would also give people a reason to learn docking in a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought I had a good idea in the other thread, but nobody seemed to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T16:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022marko dash\u0022 data-cite=\u0022marko dash\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe problem is that by the time you unlock docking ports to build stations you\u0027ve exhausted all the science in the local kerbin area, and to get points from the experiments the part that generated it (example: the goo container) but be intact and present on the ship that lands and gets recovered.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrue.

With funding short, a massive mining operation could be a huge moneymaker for your program. let\u0027s not forget that the current tech tree requires you to pay money to unlock each part in a node. Researching it is one thing. Unlocking it is different. Without money implemented, you\u0027d never notice but I think things would get a lot harder when that happens, making reusability and orbital staging points critical if you want to go farther out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
