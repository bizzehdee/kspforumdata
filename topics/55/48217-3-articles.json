Milestone versions include specific sets of functions and are released as soon as the functionality is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing (alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, used as the number 1). In this phase, developers generally test the software using white box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black box or gray box techniques, by another testing team. Moving to black box testing inside the organization is known as alpha release.[2]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. External availability of alpha software is uncommon in proprietary software. However, open source software, in particular, often have publicly available alpha versions, often distributed as the raw source code of the software. The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be feature complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta, named after the second letter of the Greek alphabet, is the software development phase following alpha. It generally begins when the software is feature complete. Software in the beta phase will generally have many more bugs in it than completed software, as well as speed/performance issues and may still cause crashes or data loss. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe users of a beta version are called beta testers. They are usually customers or prospective customers of the organization that develops the software, willing to test the software without charge, often receiving the final software free of charge or for a reduced price. Beta version software is often useful for demonstrations and previews within an organization and to prospective customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a preview, prototype, technical preview (TP), or early access. Some software is kept in perpetual beta\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwhere new features and functionality are continually added to the software without establishing a firm \u0022final\u0022 release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen and closed beta[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevelopers release either a closed beta or an open beta; closed beta versions are released to a restricted group of individuals for a user test by invitation, while open beta testers are from a larger group, or anyone interested. The testers report any bugs that they find, and sometimes suggest additional features they think should be available in the final version. Examples of a major public beta test are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn September 2000 a boxed version of Apple\u0027s Mac OS X Public Beta operating system was released.[3]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMicrosoft\u0027s release of community technology previews (CTPs) for Windows Vista in January 2005.[4]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen betas serve the dual purpose of demonstrating a product to potential consumers, and testing among an extremely wide user base likely to bring to light obscure errors that a much smaller testing team might not find.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gambi","CreatedById":7621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T23:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AlamoVampire\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eallmhuran. you sir are about as wrong as wrong gets. this game is in Alpha State.
