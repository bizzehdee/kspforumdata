This really highlights two problems, one that gravity or weight or something clearly increases with physics warp, and two that wheels have negligible friction at best. Because of this there are problems with simple operations like using your brakes or accelerating on bodies with low gravity. You\u0027d think your rover would behave nicely on the Mun? Think again, you can barely get the thing to move if it isn\u0027t going downhill. And if you ARE going downhill, good luck coming to a stop. Obviously this isn\u0027t a problem SOLELY to do with wheels, if your ship isn\u0027t exploding, it can pretty much slide forever if it doesn\u0027t hit an upwards slope. But it\u0027s something you\u0027d think wheels would do right.  \n  \nIt\u0027s pretty well known that the wheels in KSP suck. I can only wager a guess as to the true cause, perhaps the wheel colliders in Unity are garbage, but this sort of behavior has long been a nuisance. Now that we\u0027ve gotten to 1.0 is there anyone else who would like to see a concerted effort to improve wheels? This isn\u0027t just landing gear either, motorized wheels suffer from a lack of friction with the ground as well, you can do things like engage the brakes and do 360\u0027s with SAS on the Mun, and because of this, rovers are near useless on any body outside of Kerbin. With the addition a many new landing gears, it\u0027s obvious wheels have finally gotten some love in terms of diversity, now we just need some love in terms of functionality."},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T20:52:07Z","Content":"big \u002B1\n\nwith rovers, once you get on the side of the wheels you can slide unstoppable... its like the most stable state of a vehicle can have ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T21:12:25Z","Content":"while I admit that alot of my issue is trying to drive too fast, the wheels really do tend to slide, and never really \u0027dig\u0027 in to terrain, like you might expect on a sandy dune."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:03:46Z","Content":"\u002B1 from me. this should be a priority. breaks don\u0027t really work at all anymore and rovers struggle to drive up easy inclines. if you have an 8 wheel drive vehicle you should be going up just about anything."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:23:27Z","Content":"Wheels have always been an issue in KSP.
