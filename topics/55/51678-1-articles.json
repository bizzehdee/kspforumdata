At such time, would science points already accumulated still be available to research the new techs or will we need to start again? I have landed probes on 4 or 5 other celestial bodies so far and have completed the tech tree as it stands now and have an extra 5000 science points stacked up.

As likely as not, nobody will know for sure till the devs start to fill out the Tech Tree. I would think that, unless there\u0027s some serious rearranging of the tech tree, as well as replacement for existing nodes introduced, it should not erase your already gained science points \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merlinux","CreatedById":83117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T11:26:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe due to the nature of this game being in alpha you are likely not to be playing on the same career save in a few versions.
