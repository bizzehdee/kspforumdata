But there are rough edges around and I want to point them out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did play through all tutorial scenarios to make sure I am just doing dumb stuff all around so I had some initial knowledge when I tried to perform different stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not off Kerbin just yet but I have quite a few successful orbital mission already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally many contracts have unclear objectives. For example contract for testing parts like couplers or chutes do not tell you details like the part HAS to be activated using STAGING when all requirements are met. I spent quite a lot of time to understand that. Same goes for parts like engines that have a rightclick option for running the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had some problems understanding how do observation missions work as well as temperature/pressure tests and it was always an issue to spot required sensor in flight to rightclick it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJokes in mission descriptions are fine but there should definitely be exact clear explanation for every objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions with taking data on surface are really confusing until you have any means of travelling on ground like rovers or something. Landing a plane on this stage is even worse of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Planes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanes are really confusing in every possible aspect. There are almost no means of navigation. And the most annoying thing there is no autopilot. While planes are obvious tools for taking test data with \u0022below\u0022 alt, getting to the spot is really confusing with no means for warping. KSP runway location is also a problem to locate both in map mode and in navigation. I had too big of an issue landing plane cause I could not visually locate the runway as well. So for now I just ignore planes while they can be really useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Map\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst and the most annoying thing is that KSP center is not visible on map. In both in-flight and from space center. I am sure showing KSP base on map with direction grid (like navball) would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond problem is night/dark side. I find is rediculous that space program with that high tech all around can\u0027t see the planetary map from map view. And in-flight especially on a plane I just can\u0027t see anything like a blind kitten. Really not good at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Stability Launch Enhancer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure this one is meant to be used to stabilize rocket before launch cause sometimes rockets just fall due to wind or other stuff. But in my experience this thing only reduces launch stability as when it is released rocket experiences a major shake like one when physics ititialize before launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now thats all. This is not some kind of a rage post or something. I just tried pointing out weak spots from a newbie standpoints as most veterans are too used to all of this stuff to actually notice it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T22:53:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis discussion of the game\u0027s development has been moved to Development Discussions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-02T23:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223284268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170423\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517610124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185011\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pacifyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, Pacifyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.

You can move your staging around in the editor or before you launch. What I normally do is to stage the engines first, then stage the launch clamps/stabilizers on the next stage. So, when I hit the space bar the first time, the engines ignite. When I hit the space bar the second time, the craft is released. This way, you don\u0027t have the launchpad drop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223284268\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170423\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517610124\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022185011\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pacifyer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Pacifyer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

From the Tracking Station (or while controlling a craft), call up the debug menu (mod-F12, where \u0027mod\u0027 is Alt on PC), and on the console command line enter the command \u0027/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027.

By default it only shows on the map/tracking station, but when you rightclick on the waypoint marker it allows to \u0027activate navigation\u0027, which will also show an indicator on your navball (four blue arrows pointing inwards).

With two flags, besides simply finding the runway, you can also use the markers as visual aids in aligning with the runway direction - just keep them overlapping as you approach and you are pretty much perfectly aligned for landing.

Contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally many contracts have unclear objectives. For example contract for testing parts like couplers or chutes do not tell you details like the part HAS to be activated using STAGING when all requirements are met. I spent quite a lot of time to understand that. Same goes for parts like engines that have a rightclick option for running the test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had some problems understanding how do observation missions work as well as temperature/pressure tests and it was always an issue to spot required sensor in flight to rightclick it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJokes in mission descriptions are fine but there should definitely be exact clear explanation for every objective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions with taking data on surface are really confusing until you have any means of travelling on ground like rovers or something. Landing a plane on this stage is even worse of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Planes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanes are really confusing in every possible aspect. There are almost no means of navigation. And the most annoying thing there is no autopilot. While planes are obvious tools for taking test data with \u0022below\u0022 alt, getting to the spot is really confusing with no means for warping. KSP runway location is also a problem to locate both in map mode and in navigation. I had too big of an issue landing plane cause I could not visually locate the runway as well. So for now I just ignore planes while they can be really useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Map\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst and the most annoying thing is that KSP center is not visible on map. In both in-flight and from space center. I am sure showing KSP base on map with direction grid (like navball) would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond problem is night/dark side. I find is rediculous that space program with that high tech all around can\u0027t see the planetary map from map view. And in-flight especially on a plane I just can\u0027t see anything like a blind kitten. Really not good at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Stability Launch Enhancer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure this one is meant to be used to stabilize rocket before launch cause sometimes rockets just fall due to wind or other stuff. But in my experience this thing only reduces launch stability as when it is released rocket experiences a major shake like one when physics ititialize before launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now thats all. This is not some kind of a rage post or something. I just tried pointing out weak spots from a newbie standpoints as most veterans are too used to all of this stuff to actually notice it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. They actually do specify\u00A0if you read the full contract description\u00A0closely. Assign the science test part to an action group if you have trouble right clicking it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Kerbnet let\u0027s you set way points, use those for navigation. You can also click your contract waypoint in map view and set it to display on your Navball. Your Navball not only tells you the cardinal direction you are travelling but also the degrees of your heading. Physical time warp is possible for planes, just hold Alt and hit \u0026gt; or \u0026lt; only goes to x4 max though. You only think you need an autopilot because you have the weakest starting jet engines, once you have better ones you can be on the other side of Kerbin in like 5 mins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Once again, set a waypoint with Kerbnet, or plant a flag out there and name it \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or make a mini rover, name it \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and drive it out there. Use your imagination!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Not sure what you mean, haven\u0027t seen this myself; although I rarely use the launch stabilizers.
