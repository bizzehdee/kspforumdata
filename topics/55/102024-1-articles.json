Most games have a scaling system where, the player starts small and gets bigger, better things (this does happen in career) but... Over time, the challenges the player is presented with get more difficult faster then the player gets his new trinkets that makes it easier... (this part is not in KSP)\n\nThe contracts kind of do this (which is why they are probably less annoying than science) but not enough to motivate the player to push through a tough situation.. You can just x away contracts until an easy one pops up.\n\nThe only current proposal I\u0027ve seen to this has been rival agencies (who would step up their game to make the career harder as the player got new parts and such, the player would have to do more impressive feats with less than them..).\n\nAny other ideas ? Maybe since the failure is reputation based, we could have something where the agency needs to keep public interest in the space program to prevent itself from being shutdown by ..... somebody...."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T22:08:23Z","Content":"There is not really a way around this. The difficulty in terms of operating spacecraft is fixed, only the dv requirements really change.\n\nA space race would also, obviously be cool, but it doesn\u0027t really scale difficulty with ability, either."},{"CreatedByName":"WanderingKid","CreatedById":110855,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T23:11:43Z","Content":"There are three vectors I can see challenging a player in KSP. Currently, none of them really exist.\n\n1) Time challenges. \n\nCurrently the only time challenge is the transfer burn times for efficient rendezvous with other orbital bodies. These optimal burn times can be ignored with enough dV.\n\nThere is no other cause for time to be considered, in stock. TacLS gives you a realistic issue for your crews, but that\u0027s self-imposed at launch time, it\u0027s not an external challenge of the game itself. Again, with enough dV, you can overcome it by over-supplying any particular mission.\n\nBecause there\u0027s no pressure, this is not a challenge vector currently. Even an \u0027Oh My God the Asteroid is coming on x date!\u0027 type of pressure might be useful. However, that\u0027s a Kerbin SOI level of difficulty, and not solar system level.\n\n2) Knowledge vs. Execution\n\nSimilar to Dwarf Fortress, once you know what you\u0027re doing, the challenge is in execution. However, execution does not ramp up in difficulty to proceed. If you take, for example, a side scrolling shooter, then the difficulty is increased against this by adding more versatile enemies, bullet storms, etc. KSP does not lend itself to this type of challenge vector. Unless you have invading aliens or something...\n\nKnowledge gained is kept, and once learned doesn\u0027t need to be applied much differently at the end than at the beginning. Land once on Mun and Kerbin and you have the basic knowledge tools you need for landing anywhere (besides on Jool). While it may require different variables (Eve\u0027s gravity vs. Gilly\u0027s, for example, require a different approach) the execution method doesn\u0027t really change as a challenge, unless it\u0027s self imposed to \u0022Do It Better\u0022.\n\n3) Limited Resources\n\nThis is currently a vector in career mode, and is the cause of the \u0027grind\u0027. Science, similarly, is also a vector in this category. Additional to this is the need to upgrade your buildings at the KSP to get access to useful tools and/or large enough ships for the dV required. All of these force you to perform tasks with less than optimal setups. However, this challenge is avoided due to contract declines and contract churn.\n\nSaid declines and churn however are necessary, as the contract system is far too variable and procedural to allow for it to be enforced. I offer you the following scenario: All you have is part test contracts worth less than the part costs you. You have three satellite missions and they\u0027re all at Tylo and Lathe, and a good transfer window won\u0027t open up for 2 years.\n\nUnless the contract system is made less procedural and more coherent and consistent, it\u0027s not a valid vector to enforce as the only path to the challenge.\n\nA similar idea to this is the competing agencies, causing either auctioning of contracts for lowest bid or competition of the limited resource of a contract pool."},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T03:47:36Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure the scaling in difficulty can be done eventually with new planets/moons or reworking the current Kerbol System.\n\nMost of the ships I have build on Kerbin and launched had about 8k dV. If I tried really hard, I could do 15-18k, but my system would lag and I hate lag. Ramp difficulty up, I had to learn to Dock and refuel. Still, we need destinations that makes Moho a joke. I mean REALLY far stuff that would warrant using Jool as gravity assist or serious ship engineering to pull off.\n\nCase and Point : \n\nJupiter is 778.547.200 km from the sun, the Earth is 151.000 km.\n\nSaturn 1.433.449.370 km\n\nUranus 2.870.671.400 km\n\nNeptune 4.498.542.600 km\n\nPluto 5.874.000.000 km\n\nNow if Jool is 68.773.560 km, then the next planets could be : \n\n126.629.803\n\n253.592.879\n\n397.397.756\n\n518.904.593\n\nthe farthest one is ~7,5 times further away than Jool. If we say 3k dV for single trip to Jool, it becomes 22\u0027500 dV for a simple go at that farthest planet. It makes up for an interesting challenge (especially I you make that last planet have 5 moons like Pluto, that makes stuff to do once there).\n\nAdd in solar panels being ~56 times less efficient (distance exponent 2), even if you do not play with Life Support, that\u0027s quite the challenge. And that\u0027s just a logistic challenge. Don\u0027t forget EVE for now... it\u0027s hard, and doesn\u0027t get much love as a result.\n\nNow if our \u0022future Pluto\u0022 is a large planet with 5 tough moons to get to (weird inclination, super dense atmosphere, etc)... imaging a tougher Jool-5 but with the above difficulties.\n\nAnd don\u0027t get me started about having a \u0022Halley\u0027s Comet\u0022 that orbits closer than Moho and slightly less far than our to-be Neptune analog. That would also pose quite the challenge to intercept and land. And it would be fun !\n\nwell, these where my thoughts on the subject, enjoy =)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T04:15:50Z","Content":"Maybe have nuclear reactors for power out there?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T06:22:53Z","Content":"Even RTGs fall off over their flight times, but yeah, reactors would be better.\n\nI agree on the distances, but it\u0027s not \u0022more difficult\u0022 It\u0027s simply \u0022more throw weight.\u0022 If you can rendezvous in Kerbin orbit, then building a ship, fueling it, sending fuel ahead for refuel around body X is all complex, and fun, but not \u0022more difficult\u0022 in the sense I think we mean.

Many are against having the kerbals fly themselves, I tend to think it\u0027s mandatory if the game wants to pretend to any \u0022management\u0022 level of play at all.\n\nI think that in the end it still comes down to how much payload you can give whatever amount of dv, nothing more. It makes long distance missions more complex, but not fundamentally harder. I\u0027m not suggesting that they even should be harder, I\u0027m saying that is the reality of a game that is even sort of realistic. The basic tools are there at the start, and technological improvements make the game easier as time goes on, not harder.\n\nOne problem is really that the early game is in fact so easy. When you blow past what should be an incredible accomplishment, landing on the Mun before you\u0027ve played more than a couple hours, that\u0027s a problem. That would really require more data than squad likes to give as well. In the VAB it should show how many hours the batteries will last with minimal systems on at the very least, for example. It\u0027s counter-intuitive to make the early game harder, not easier, but I think that spending more time getting ready for the Mun would be a good thing for career (basically wanting a sort of mercury--\u003Egemini--\u003Eapollo sort of progression to happen instead of a couple suborbitals to unlock stuff, then *an* orbital mission, then a Mun landing (which is a fairly normal progression for me, even in an RSS cfg)."}]}
