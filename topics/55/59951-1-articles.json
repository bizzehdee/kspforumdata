Similarly, a manned sub-orbital flight would again reward you with science in propulsion as well as command, control and perhaps utility. The amount of science you get in each category factors in the time spent using them, the cost (which might influence a base science index) and of course their usefulness (a monopropellant tank with no RCS is not useful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe this might encourage a more logical and meaningful progression through research and development. After all, NASA didn\u0027t acquire the technology to go to the Moon by driving a buggy around the parking lot. Sure, they might get some interesting data out of that, but the key elements were the early stages of astronaut training, including their flight experience prior to the Apollo program (ie. spaceplanes), building bigger and more advanced rockets over time and previous missions to explore the effect of prolonged exposure to zero gravity on humans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of the tech tree, rather than a single branching tree, perhaps there could be one smaller tree for each type of part with less parts per unlock. This way you could obtain more relevant parts sooner based on your current mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current progression of the career mode is not far off, we obviously still have to start small and do small things before moving on, but it might be more enjoyable if you could really have more control over the direction of your own space program.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T08:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked at \u0022a few\u0022 of the science threads due to thinking this very thought and most of them tend to simply diverge into what I figure is a temporary demonstration \u0022tech tree.\u0022 As it stands, \u0022Science\u0022 is blatantly an achievement system.
