The first couple of times they can be fun but can become just a tedious chore that needs to be done to fund your program.\n\nPersonally I think contracts should be only given out once or twice and pay out more. They should be given slightly before you have the tech to do it easily to challenge a player to come up with a design.\n\nAs an example for the sat contracts: \n\nContract to be put in a rather LKO and allow more deviation from the contract requirements\n\nContract for a esentric orbit and having to be more precise with the orbit\n\nContract for geosync orbit\n\nContract to place sats with LOS of certain points on Kerbin at all times.\n\nContracts for putting up a sat linked to your scince parts tech level. Unlock the thermometer you get a contract to put a sat up with one attached, same with the scanning parts.\n\nAfter you complete each you will no longer get sat contracts for Kerbin and rinse and repeat with all other bodies in kerbin and contracts.\n\nA suggestion for space station contracts is they should be more long term expansion and support minded. \n\nThe 1st condition for the contract can be it must hold 5 Kerbals, have comunications, generate a certain amount of power, docking port, and mystery goo container. Once complete you get rewarded just like say the explore mun contract when you do not complete it but get rewarded for completing part of it.\n\nThe contract then can have objectives to expand the base with the progression of the tech tree in mind. As the player unlocks the tree they can complete another step in the contract and have the fun of designing and expanding a space station. \n\nDoing the above should help with not turning the game into grinding the same contracts to fund upgrades, hiring kerbonauts and missions.\n\nEdit: I also like the idea someone had about getting automatic funding each month based on reputation. This again will give the player a little more choice as how they want to play.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T19:37:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 07:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WOODY01**"},{"CreatedByName":"hawk_za","CreatedById":59433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:17:12Z","Content":"I could not agree more we need more satellite contracts \n\nI would also suggest moving the ore scanner closer to the beginning of the tech tree so we could get ore scanning contracts and that also then reserves the drilling and harvesting of the ore till later game"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T19:15:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E After you complete each you will no longer get sat contracts for Kerbin and rinse and repeat with all other bodies in kerbin and contracts.\n\nI would never willingly buy a sandbox game which allows you to run out of content in this fashion.
