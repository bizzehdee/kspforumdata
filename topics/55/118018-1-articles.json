RCS-powered engines had to be used during landing (I saw a video with a person sending 3 poor Kerbals to Moho in a RCS lander, one like used on Minmus but bigger), and parachutes could be used near surface. Unfortunately, Moho had been stripped of it\u0027s atmosphere in 0.18.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all feel nostalgy for such a wonderful and respectworthy planet.
