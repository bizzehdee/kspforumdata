Above specific temperature, ship without cooling module, or without coolant explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaying in hot areas of atmosphere, depletes coolant in pace proportional to temperature. So time you can spend inside atmosphere is limited. It woudl add dramatic flavor to exploration. Player woudl need to calsulate time spent on surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower in atmosphere ship sinks, hotter it gets. Temparature is fluctuating so even if you stay in one place it can get hotter or colder by few degrees. Specific parts of planet woudl also be hotter and warmer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with weather system implementation? Oh no, the storm is coming!
