Since that time these numbers have been little more than a roleplaying element. I propose that Courage and stupidity have effects on gameplay. Kerbals will require a specific stat in order to do certain things. for example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Flying through the atmosphere at mach 4 you ask your kerbal to go on an EVA. being incredibly stupid he happily obliges. If he wasn\u0027t as stupid he would have refused your suicidal request shaking his head and grunting angrily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -while going on EVA your cowardly Kerbal gets camera shy and refuses to plant the flag, instead quivering in fear at the prospect of being remembered for all time! luckily it was a two man mission!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -on route to Jool you decide it is time for Chicken Kerman to get some fresh air. Unfortunately the cold dark vacuum of space scares him and he refuses to let go of the ladder!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Landed at KSC you decide to go out for a walk. The problem is your rocket is 30m tall and your pilot just isn\u0027t stupid enough to let go and fall all that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost actions are assigned a courage and or stupidity level. this is the threshold below which a kerbal will refuse to undertake that action. A kerbal MAY be convinced to expand his boundaries by doing things just below his threshold but never above it. It may be because their shy, or just because they aren\u0027t brain dead enough to follow your orders, but they just wont do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd like I said, a Kerbal may become stupider and braver if he try\u0027s hard. maybe your kerbal is too afraid to plant the flag but surface samples are right up his alley. take enough surface samples and he may one day plant that flag with pride.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecourage and stupidity currently have a bar. The closer an action is to the kerbals threshold the more scared or angry he appears. kerbals pushed beyond there threshold are either petrified by fear or blinded by rage at your blatant lunacy!. the idea is to link kerbals physical and emotional responses to actual game actions, hopefully, giving them some much needed character.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T22:49:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds awesome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E My only concern though is that stupidity/courage could actually \u003Cem\u003Estop\u003C/em\u003E you from doing certain things like going on EVA to collect reports / science experiments / etc. I think that would be okay if the task was way beyond a kerbal\u0027s threshold, but if it\u0027s only a \u0022little\u0022 over you should be able to force them to do it by being insistent / suggesting punishment somehow if they don\u0027t comply (within reason; I don\u0027t think you should be able to threaten your kerbals with torture and such \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).
