The proposed implementation would effectively remove this constraint and a payload could be designed to be ultra-light and flimsy, unable to take more than 1G of acceleration but still be launched into orbit intact because the physics of the payload under higher launch accelerations would not be simulated. I don\u0027t know if a modification to this to reintroduce this constraint would be worthwhile, since it would require some physics calculations to be done on the payload anyway and at that point the main benefit of this proposed system is gone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the points made about substituting the payload with a point mass with a set moment of inertia are perfectly accurate, if we\u0027re dealing with rigid bodies.

Without modelling that we\u0027re back to the problem noted above, namely, that a payload can be designed without caring about how it would be affected by the launch conditions. A highly-flexible payload can pull a rocket of course because its deformation offsets the CoM of the rocket from the thrust vector, and thus removes another constraint on payload design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: The current proposal effectively removes the constraints on the strength and flexibility of payloads, allowing ridiculously weak payloads to be put into orbit.
