When I\u0027m looking up information on, say, Ike, I don\u0027t just want information on Ike--I want to see its surface gravity, how that compares to the surface gravity of various other worlds, and lists of thrust and ISP of various engines, preferably all simultaneously open in different tabs that I can view side by side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T01:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have full-functional tutorials, wiki, Q\u0026amp;A forum, far more than enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still want to get a manual pdf, just like those lovely tiny books!
