Right now, the reason why people take \u0022ore\u0022 off the surface is that the stock game doesn\u0027t have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, so there is no way to easily dock things on the ground, and it\u0027s literally easier to fly stuff to space, then transfer it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOxygen is easily available everywhere, trapped in soils. You\u0027re never going to haul metric tons of regolith anyplace at all. You\u0027ll drive the Oxygen off, and be left with Al, Fe, etc. Carbon is harder to find many places, particularly airless worlds, then maybe hydrocarbon ice is what you look for. Mining this would not result in \u0022ore\u0022 however---I realize that the word ore is just a really poor choice of words in KSP, but I will harp on it, because I tend to be a pedant, lol, and \u0022ore\u0022 has a meaning. Also, it is of course generic in KSP---another example of where more detail would make the game better. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E should have to be specific to a particular resource.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s beside the point regarding hauling ore.

Ore should be such that only a tiny fraction of it can be converted to something useful, the rest being dead mass.
