Cause that\u0027s what all Kerbonauts are right now. Since we are getting sciency stuff in the next release, I thought why not have scientist kerbals who can operate al the science equipment in orbit. And engineer kerbals who are good at building things in orbit or on other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought science bays, and later planetary science stations could have modules that require one or more scientist to operate, or to operate efficiently. Maybe the first few technologies in the tech tree would require a small amount of science points, so even pilots operating the science equipment could gather that many points, but later on, the techs would get so expensive that you could never collect all the points to unlock them if you are using pilot kerbals to operate the equipment. So you would have to hire scientist Kerbonauts (more expensive than pilots) who could operate the same science equipment with much higher efficiency. Maybe higher level science parts would require scientists on board to function at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when we get some sort of repair mechanic in the game (or orbital building possibilities) we could hire engineer Kerbonauts who know how to place struts for example. Or who can repair certain damaged parts and do basic chores like repacking parachutes much faster than pilot kerbals can.

I keep brave or not stupid kerbals just in case they become useful in career. I\u0060d like to see the kerbals stats change if they do something smart or brave but not so much that you could have loads of fully brave smart kerbals. I think the roles kerbals get like pilot or scientist will be decided by what stats they have. It would be nice to give them different coloured suits to match their roles though. As has been said I am sure the kerbals in the KSP would be the best of the best and able to do many things, it\u0060s just that kerbals might not be so good generally, explaining the explosions n stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicX1","CreatedById":35008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T16:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of classes, but I don\u0027t think they should be game changing. Perhaps a scientist Kerbal could add a percentage modifier to science yield (up to a limit of course, to prevent you from using a spaceship full of Kerbals to unlock the entire tech tree by staring at Kerbin). A pilot Kerbal could increase the strength of your reaction wheels by a tiny percentage too (this wouldn\u0027t be stackable thought since most of the time only one person can fly a rocket at a time!). Not quite sure what an engineer could do currently, however if repairing wheels and such were to be changed so it is not instantaneous, the engineer could speed that process up. By keeping the differences between kerbals small, the game doesn\u0027t force you to choose particular Kerbals, which would be the case if an important tool could only be inexplicably held by one class.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T16:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps engineers could increase engine efficiency slightly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso my stupid kerbals are slated as tourists once I get efficient off-world colonies going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
