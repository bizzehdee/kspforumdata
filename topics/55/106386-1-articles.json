This would, of course, be rounded to the closest time when the vessel reaches the maneuver node."},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T14:26:58Z","Content":"What an excellent idea! Here\u0027s the thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108944-Transfer-Nodes](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108944-Transfer-Nodes) ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nA \u0022Transfer Node\u0022 - a maneuver node on the parent object\u0027s orbit - would allow you to time your maneuver up to a an entire revolution of the parent body in the future, rather than one or several revolutions of your orbit around the parent object. This would make \u0022discovering\u0022 transfer windows more intuitive.\n\nThe Transfer Node would work just like a maneuver node where direction (based on the three cardinal orbit relative directions) AND magnitude are important. One of the outstanding questions in my head is how do you measure magnitude in a way that\u0027s meaningful to the player. As a first cut you could give the dV measurement as if you were the parent body itself, but I suspect (but not sure) that this number would be significantly different than the actual dV requirement of your craft.\n\nI\u0027m afraid to guess if it would be lower or higher. On the one hand your craft is (presumably) already at orbital velocity relative to the parent planet - 2200 m/s in LKO. On the other hand you have to climb out of the parent body\u0027s gravity well. I am hoping someone with a more rigorous orbital mathematics background could weigh in, even to speculate."}]}
