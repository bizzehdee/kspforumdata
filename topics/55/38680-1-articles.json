Nothing else kills my frame rate like Kerbans ocean. Without the water fix, with every setting as low as they can go, it is still a slideshow at the KSC launchpad. Even in orbit, looking towards Kerban drops fps to below 10. It makes the game near unplayable. However with the water fix, the game runs smooth and consistently, even with highest settings/SM3 shaders.

The new Mun and KSC have gained so much more detail, while managing to decrease the workload on systems. I think that the devs will be giving all planets/features the same treatment at some point, but right now the focus is career mode, putting new content into the game. The reason clouds/weather/heat etc are not in the game, is because they have yet to figure out a suitable way of implementing them without killing already overloaded systems. It\u0027s obvious that this is not a problem for everyone, it may be more of an optimization issue for different hardware. But one things for sure, as the devs improve the game, they learn more about what is possible and put it into the game the best they can.
