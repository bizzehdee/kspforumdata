You have to zoom out to the point where Kerbin (and your flight path) are next to invisible in order to see any other planet, so fine-tuning the escape burn is maddening - at least, this has been my experience. If you veterans have another perspective, I\u0027d love to hear it. Maybe there\u0027s a mod for this I should use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo improve this, I suggest that a large analog of your flight path (visible from any scale) is superimposed over Kerbin\u0027s location when you are using the maneuver planner while zoomed far out. This would help users like myself to optimize these burns. Another benefit is that Kerbin\u0027s pro- and retro-grade vectors are easily seen at these scales.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel these changes may help make the maneuver planner even more robust than it is. If there is something I\u0027m missing that would make this issue irrelevant, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bobert577","CreatedById":72153,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T17:17:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have been having the same problem as you, which has prevented me from taking on much in the way of interplanetary travel.
