The career mode got more interesting with this fact and the destruction of buildings around KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is about KSC itself and the strategies involved to build, research and construct your space center. Since in career mode it\u0027s very costly to construct a doomed building, I remember images of the first versions of KSP where the KSC was basically...well... naked compared to what we have today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we manage our own space program, we should also build our own Space center. New technologies should be implemented to get various building types to serve a certain function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would require, maybe, a second tech tree just to advance a simple concrete lunch bay into a full luncher bay with options to build cranes and all sort of things to help our rockets get into orbit. I remember seeing pictures of this huge red tower, this was before I bought my KSP, and I thought, wow that looks great and it would be so cool if it had a function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tracking center is also one of the options, buildings should be able to be upgraded, while we build a tracking station, it has a basic radar system to allow comunication to planes or rockets just in low orbit for example, and it is not able to detect far distance objects outside of the SOI of Kerbin. While getting more funds from different missions we upgrade the Tracking center with different radars and more of them to detect far objects and allow communication with vessels outside of the SOI of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea can be also added to all the buildings in KSP. The VAB can be upgraded to build more higher rockets for example, start with a simple building where probably you can build a 1 or 2 stage rocket, sooner or latter you need to upgrade it to accommodate taller rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience is still very basic in this game, 3 tests are done, Goo, soil sample and the SC-9001 can besides crew reports. This kind of science is not enough to give points and spent them on stuff. This points should be used to \u0022invest\u0022 in different experiments in the labs (that needed to be upgraded also in future for more complex science projects) to research new parts and technology. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy should I build a airstrip if I do not care about building planes for example? And if I do, let me chose the type of runway I want. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the inclusion of the difficulty levels in 0.25 and the custom options to turn off or on some options like save, revert, etc, all of this things could be also customized by the players to give anyone the chance to play KSP as they like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just a \u0022small\u0022 idea, but I know there are more important things the team need to be doing also and that they have a plan. I think this things cannot be achieved in a mod (but what do I know? I\u0027m not a modder) but it would introduce new ways of playing and giving a new sense of strategy that you are really playing a Space Program game, that need to be evolved and invested in to be able to achieve something great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably new parts, new options for science, experimental science and also engineer projects could be added to the game, if you had the right buildings to do so and the money that you get from investors. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore business strategy, more science strategy and more construction and upgrades to our space center would be pretty cool. If a number of players did not want this things, it is something that can be customized in the difficulty levels and changed to each one preferences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T15:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpgradable buildings are going to be implemented in 0.26/0.90.
