In the war mode, you would get guns and things available to you (such as cannons, machine guns etc) and new parts that hold ammo. Other weapons could also be flamethrower that uses liquid fuel, and attacking lasers that use electricity. Up in several orbits (as in around kerbin, mun, duna, etc.) would be \u0027pirate\u0027 ships that attack you and try to destroy your ship, and also on the actual planets would be \u0027evil\u0027 kerbals that attack you and your ship if you land.
