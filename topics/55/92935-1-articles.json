Just set it to point toward surface velocity \u002B and control it from a part that will face forward when the station is oriented the way you want it. Once you go outside of physics range, the station will be put \u0022on rails\u0022 and won\u0027t change anything about its orbit or orientation until you get back in range, at which point physics restarts for it and it will re-orient itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere you can get in trouble with this is if your station\u0027s rotational capabilities are fairly powerful and you don\u0027t have it braced well enough - it\u0027ll start flopping around like an electrocuted octopus and might blow things up or tear itself completely apart. When I do this trick, I always attach a bunch of struts to the station first (Kerbal Attachment System lets you do it on EVA) to be sure it\u0027s braced really well and can\u0027t flail around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T18:59:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the new vector holders in the next update, this is going to be trivial.
