So does this mean, that part of the project was dumped? Considering that would be a big implementation as far as the core systems of the game? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr is my imagination(as little as it is) actually come up with something neat for the game, and they were actually meaning just, \u0022Right-Click, Moved\u0022 from part to part like you can now... Cause the ability to physically move around your ship, would add a WHOLE NEW diversity to the game. How cool would it be, once docked at your station to be able to explore it from the inside out, instead of the same old boring outside-in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, The resource system was touched base on, in the beta info news release. However, this was by far (in my opinion) was going to be the best, and most game changing (for the better) impact on the game. And I\u0027ve now been waiting 2yrs for this (*laughs and then starts to cry slowly*) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above, is what I\u0027ve been waiting for in this game/simulator. In my opinion, getting to space is the first step, building camp/station/base is second, and third is surviving the trip back home from another planet.(by surviving I mean having fuel and resources after touching down, and not having to fly the same mission 36 more times just to have enough fuel to fly back.) Especially now that we have Budgets... Doesn\u0027t seem very cost effective to be dumping 30\u002B ships just to get one back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really just trying to figure out, from what they say, \u00221st its a game, second its a simulator.\u0022 would the above mentioned implements, not effect both, in an outstanding way? For them to be \u0022possibly\u0022 adding it in beta, it would seem more like an entirely different game once it was released, in which case it would be more of a DLC then anything...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny comments to touch base?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T05:42:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 05:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by btymciw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T08:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe current way to move Kerbals around the ship is effective and simple.

We all saw the Grid layout for the way the resource system would run. And it was fairly straight forward. They were almost done the project too. They worked a good month or two on all the parts and systems, and gave spoilers for it almost every week for that period. If anything they should bring it to us just because of the two month long tease, and then 2 years of nothing, until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dunno, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial thought process seemed they had for the game, made it look like it involved more then just Planet Kerbin. It seemed like the game revolved around Space, traveling, exploring, building, and expanding. Planet Kerbin was only the starting point, and control center for everything that was to happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t the point of a space program, to explore new heights? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Venture where no man has gone before? And return with valuable information, and samples?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just seems like progression on the game has been far too grounded on Kerbin lately. And to hear the major development will be coming to an end, is unfortunate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they are just focusing on the control center, then they should have made research and development, actually include development. Like even the ability to be able to switch a few simple values (like more oxygen intake, but at the cost of loosing some fuel capacity...etc) on parts, in game, would have made the research \u0026amp; development, include the development part.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-16T09:37:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2014 09:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by btymciw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\u0026#039;s\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Resender","CreatedById":18274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T10:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell development isn\u0027t going to end per say,what squad means by scope complete is that all the objects,features are going to be present that can be reused for other stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Like we might see new planets,procedurally generated,unique for each save,using the asteroid spawn \u0026amp; biome mechanism\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*With destroyable buildings this opens up the door to settlements on Kerbin,either player of game generated that will add an extra difficulty when launching stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The inclusion of the first vanilla cargo bay opens a the door to for instance stock fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*new aerodynamics model suggested\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we are going to is similar to Minecraft, the basics are their,minor updates will introduce new items/missions based on the structure in place (like new blocks in MC),major updates might include new features that were just thought off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most of the updates between beta \u0026amp; full release will probably be bug fixing \u0026amp; client optimization, the problem with the 64bit versions are routed within the 64bit version of the Unity 5 engine (on which KSP runs) so that won\u0027t \u0026amp; can\u0027t be fixed by SQUAD directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiplayer is going to be another fun factor we\u0027ll just have to wait and see how they implement it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supergamervictor","CreatedById":23473,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T12:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would prefer it as a mod in the future.I do agree it would take large amounts of resources but it is certainly cool when you can move to parts of the station like a real astronaut.Just imagine doing experiments,wrecking havoc,extinguishing fires,opening docking ports and .....
