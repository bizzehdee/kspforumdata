Having tried it now, I think a lot of the issues can be solved not by simply making it easier, but improving the maneuver gui. I don\u0027t want to compromise the actual difficulty, just make the controls easier. Below are my suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Add a fine adjustment control. When your trying to zero in on an orbit it\u0027s hard to adjust because it moves so quickly when you pull the levers. So if you hold the MOD key and pull the lever it should slow down rate at which the vector changes. (if there is already a way to do this, I couldn\u0027t find it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add a way to see elevations et. al. without mouse over. Perhaps a list view that appears on one side of the screen showing current, maneuver, and target for apoapsis, acending, decending nodes, intercepts, captures, and escapes, etc. The reasoning here is that constantly picking up the mouse off of the control your tweaking to see if your at your target is a good way to miss. It\u0027s a bit absurd really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Add a \u0022snap to\u0022 maneuver button. This would be a button to snap the maneuver to the target as close as possible given the point of maneuver. So if I add a maneuver at the perapsis and click the button, the apoapsis should adjust to be pretty close to the target\u0027s apoapsis, however because of the maneuver node\u0027s location, the periapsis would likely not change much. After doing 2 of these maneuvers I should be in a near identical orbit to my target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T19:06:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of those were already (or kind of) solved:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Since 23.5 you can adjust the nodes with the mouse wheel to make fine adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- you can leave displayed apoapsis and periapsis info (even of targeted crafts) by pressing control\u002Bclick the \u0022banner\u0022. As long as I tried, this won\u0027t work with the intercept node and ascending/descending node information and I think that could actually be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 3, I feel that is part of the fun of this game, finding out how to do the rendezvous thing. In addition to this, you are considering that you are in the same orbital plane of the target and this is generally (it is difficult to be exactly at 0) not the case...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
