A really handy addition, in my opinion, would be to include a craft description in the *Rename Craft* area, just as you are able to add a description to crafts and subassemblies in the VAB. You could add stuff like where it\u0027s been, where and when a transfer window it\u0027s waiting for is, etc. What do you guys think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T19:56:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this would make more sense within the Mission control building, doing a whole mission plan for the rocket you\u0027re sending up, including maneuver nodes, time plans, alarm clock and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
