That really is the dilemma, it\u0027s figuring out how to make the game enjoyable, but no so watered down that it isn\u0027t. A possible solution to the craft editing problem would be to disable part removal/placing, allowing you to get really close before moving the part, and/or having to tap the part to select it and then be able to remove it (this is sorta how it works in sfs.) Another thing they should do is have the mobile version use the same .craft file, allowing you to switch craft between versions, so maybe you could pre-load craft made in pc into the phone. Maybe a way to make it controllable in 3d would be to have a draggable navball where you could set your heading, or something like the nav sphere in sr2, but with it broken up into two draggable wheels on a hi (probably weird at first but easy to get used to and better than the draggable navball.)
