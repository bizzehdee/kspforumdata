What is the problem? Why would I use any of the heavier and bulkier high-gain antennas while communotron is the best? It is somewhat wrong, usually bigger antenna = better. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso would be great to see antenna directions to actually matter (e.g. one needs line of sight to Kerbin to use radio to send science), of course then relaying should be possible via other crafts. That would promote putting satellites into orbit as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T19:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, it\u0027s throughput isn\u0027t the best, the other two antennas are faster, they just have a throughput stat that is inversely proportional to the actual throughput.
