Alternatively, You can use [mod]\u002BF5 to quicksave under a certain name, and [mod]\u002BF9 to load again. [mod] represents a certain button on the keyboard that allows you to do certain things, like physics warp in orbit, or duplicating parts. On any windows KSP, it\u0027s alt. For apple and linux, I\u0027m not sure (it might be the \u0027command\u0027 button or something, not used any apple device much before). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you want to go to the mun. You can press alt\u002Bf5 to quicksave in orbit and save it as \u0027(Mission name) orbit\u0027. You do this because, assuming you have a docking port on board, if you don\u0027t have enough fuel to land on the mun, then you can always save in kerbin orbit, dock a resupply module and refuel the ship. This is pointless if you already have a fully fueled vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou do a transfer maneuver to go to the mun. Not much point doing anything here, but when you get into orbit, then you can NQS (name quicksave, as I\u0027ve just called it) to say \u0027[mission name] munar orbit\u0027. You can then land on the surface and NQS there as \u0027landed\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo into munar orbit or, if you\u0027re on the trailing side of the mun (if viewed from kerbin, it\u0027s the right hand side of the mun), just launch vertically.
