Where as the Giganator produces only 1.47 per meter sq.\n\nSo apart from part count why would you ever use the large panels?\n\n[table=width: 500]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Panel[/td]\n\n [td]ECU Stock[/td]\n\n [td]ECU per M2 Stock[/td]\n\n [td]ECU suggested[/td]\n\n [td]ECU per M2 suggested[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]OX-STAT[/td]\n\n [td]0.75[/td]\n\n [td]4.96[/td]\n\n [td]0.4[/td]\n\n [td]2.44[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]OX-4L[/td]\n\n [td]2[/td]\n\n [td]2.44[/td]\n\n [td]2[/td]\n\n [td]2.44[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[tr]\n\n [td]Giganator[/td]\n\n [td]18[/td]\n\n [td]1.47[/td]\n\n [td]29.8[/td]\n\n [td]2.44[/td]\n\n[/tr]\n\n[/table]\n\nThese changes would make each panel equally efficient and give you more reason to use larger panels."},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:19:18Z","Content":"The smallest panel probably should produce more/ton because it doesn\u0027t have tracking."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:42:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The smallest panel probably should produce more/ton because it doesn\u0027t have tracking.\n\nFigures I\u0027ve given are per square meter of panel area.

Never mind the area, but by weight it should at least be competitive with the smaller tracking panels. Maybe slightly worse, because more structural stuff, maybe even better.

Then you have guaranteed generation for any time of year. If you\u0027re using an array of medium sized guys then twice a year they\u0027ll occlude each other, right? So for a guaranteed level of generation for any time of year without maneuvering, Gigantors are most efficient.\n\n...yeah, when I type that out it\u0027s a little more tenuous sounding than I expected."},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:21:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One advantage of the Giganator is that if you align axis of panel rotation to the axis of rotation about the sun......\n\nYou can do the same with only a single panel. If you align your craft so the panel extends \u0027up\u0027 or \u0027down\u0027 in reference to the solar system plane they can rotate to follow the sun all year round. The only time you\u0027ll be in shadow is if you\u0027re orbiting a planet and you do around to the dark side. I used to use this trick with a single OX-4L on my RemoteTech satellites. But again you can do this with the more efficiently OX-4L so there\u0027s still no need for the Giginator."},{"CreatedByName":"MacroNova","CreatedById":126611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:37:31Z","Content":"I feel like the whole electric system could use a balance pass. Operating a basic probe computer takes about as much electricity as spinning the reaction wheels, sending a data packet with the antenna takes as much as driving a rover 100 yards, etc.\n\nThe small panels need to produce a little less energy, but the things you use them for in the early game need to require less energy. As the game progresses, things should need more energy and the player is nudged into using the bigger panels. In .9 and earlier, the only thing that really required significant electricity was Ion engines."}]}
