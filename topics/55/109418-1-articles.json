Laythe also has blue, Duna has pink and Eve has purple IIRC.\n\nIt sounds like something is wrong with your KSP install, and you should check the \u0022support\u0022 subforum."},{"CreatedByName":"MrZayas1","CreatedById":95654,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T00:42:42Z","Content":"If you look straight up, is it blue?
