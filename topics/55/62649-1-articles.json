Something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edamage = 0 to 10 (0 = garbage, destroyed by game, just to let the game know), 1 = almost destroyed, completely out of order, but with some more or less valuable raw materials like gold, copper, platinum, titanium, etc up to 10 which mean brand new. A value of 5 (average) can be for used parts that have come out and back to Kerbin (=need service). The value could be use to set price we can get back (0= 0 * base price, 10 = 100 %) and by adding recycler and parts dealers, we can make money by selling old parts, gathering parts left by others (randomly generated, just to make some extra money, or eventually from multiplayer game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be also a repair cost and this let us creating cheap spaceship by buying cheap used parts, repair them (the cost should be \u0026lt; brand new price - used price obviously) and make some money by delivering goods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may add another dimension to rocket building: reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coolitic","CreatedById":79738,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T16:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can recycle the ones that go back to kerbin.
