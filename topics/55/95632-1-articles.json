That would be nice. I just tried to do a satelite deployment contract and was close to punch my monitor after failing to keep that damn satelite straight during the burn (had to build an asymetrical stayputnik \u002B basic sas due to part count). And it wasn\u0027t my first attempt, I already tried to do a manned mission and just decouple it, but hey: massless parts and the late unlock of smaller decouplers made it impossible as a simple decoupling altered it\u0027s course by many km...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T15:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be really helpful, that and putting the Stayputnik earlier in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T17:22:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I like TweakableEverything.
