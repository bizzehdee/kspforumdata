Throwing in Waypoints that you can\u0027t turn off, Real Event Action Keys [what ever the abominations are called], no need to watch your Health bars cause it\u0027s all regenerated at a fast rate, way to many Items / Ammo scattered through levels so you never run out [many Games have completely removed Ammo all together], and the list goes on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll use Take on Mars as the latest Example that I\u0027ve encountered [and I\u0027ve rambled to them aswell]. It has so much potential with it\u0027s Concept, but if they stick to the way their Career Mode is at the moment, I forsee that Game only being played for a Modded Version only. I understand that it is only an Alpha, but the Game gives you no Freedom, no thought, and basically, no Science for your own rewards at the end. You have to go to a Waypoint [spot on it, not within a certain area, if your not right ontop of it, then you cannot continue the Mission], you need to take exactly the Photo\u0027s they make you take [not just of the area that the Mission Description says], and Analyze the Rocks they make you [not in the Area the Mission Description says].

Literally everyone wins. If you want the game to be harder, you can ramp up some of the settings, give yourself lower income per mission or increased fuel consuption/weight with slightly weaker part connections or more of a chance of micrometeorites breaking your solar panels or stations/bases requiring more frequent maintenance.

It wouldn\u0027t be that much of a stretch for them to implement toggles or multipliers for certain mechanics in a realism/difficulty menu in the options. Purist vanilla types can play using the defaults, people who want more challenge(even after playing default or easy for a while) can increase the difficulty of some aspects while people who don\u0027t really care to worry about fuel or what-not can ignore those features without being limited exclusively to sandbox mode(some people just like structure but not challenge).

Everyone has the ability to up the Challenge in this Game, but it\u0027s up to them to Challenge their knowledge and understanding of the Mechanics. That\u0027s what KSP is about, creating your own Difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would understand if Life Support in the Core Game had a option to enable and disable [in Sandbox], and what other new Features they add [maybe like Re-entry Damage], but Unlimited Fuel [or less], Crash Damage [Higher or Lower], ect ect ect, is already changeable in the Game files, which is very simple to do. Mods are another thing that can change the Difficulty for both sides of the party [and yes not everyone likes Mods, and this includes myself, until I tried them in KSP and found how easy and hassle free they were], aswell as the Debug Menu, which I\u0027m guessing will stay on the final Version in Sandbox Mode, but not Career. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think though it is way to early still to say things aren\u0027t challenging enough, because it\u0027s a Alpha, and who\u0027s to say what Features will end up in the Final Version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ittiz","CreatedById":78645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T11:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see a lot of people say \u0022there should be no difficulty setting\u0022. Well compared to our system and planet KSP is a cake walk. Kerbin has parameters much like Mars. For Earth you need to be going at almost 10kps at 120km altitude to get in to orbit. Kerbin is only about 2 at 70km altitude. The moon is around 30 times the distance from Earth as the Mun is from Kerbin, even Minmus is 10 times closer than our moon. Even the Kerbin system is much smaller than ours, more like red dwarf sized system. Eloo the most distant planet in the Kerbin system has an orbit that would put it between Venus and Earth in our system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said I think difficulty should be set by these parameters. The current settings should be the \u0022easy\u0022 mode. Kirbin is about as small as you can get for a living (natural) planet. Medium should be a Planet and system some where between Kirbin\u0027s and our\u0027s. Hard should be an Earth like system. Finally I think there should be an Ultra Hard with the largest possible (theoretically) living Planet at about twice Earth\u0027s size. Each setting the gravity of the home world should approximately double.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth noting that Earth has so much gravity that getting into space using a chemical rocket is just barely possible. So the only thing that could achieve orbit in Ultra Hard would be space planes (probably multistage) and nuclear rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the harder the modes get the more interesting the systems should be. Alternatively they could just use the same system design and just increase the sizes, distances and gravities. That would be the most simplistic way of doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned just above, you can already set the difficulty of the game yourself. The devs are against creating different difficulty selectors, and have instead left tools to customize the game to what you want. The debug menu has plenty of tools to make your game much easier, such as hack gravity, unbreakable joints and infinite fuel. Then to make it harder, there\u0027s a lot of mods that can do the job for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince this can already be done and that actual difficulty selectors won\u0027t be in the game, better close this now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
