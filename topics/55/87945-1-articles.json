I\u0027ve seen all the mods and plugins for it, but I want to see this implemented into the stock game. I\u0027ll be discussing the many practical uses of airship parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the patient pilots, flying an airship up to the edge of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and launching a rocket from it would be one of the most efficient and recyclable methods of launching rockets to orbit. Once the rocket was in orbit, you could switch your focus back to the airship and fly it back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the Jool fanatics, an airship would be the most effective method for studying the gas giant\u0027s thick atmosphere. Several Jool airships could be docked together to form a massive floating research station. If you managed it good enough, it could even act as a resupply point and launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAirships would also be good for more general uses such as cargo transport, refueling, and rescue. You could even potentially build a flying aircraft carrier for spaceplanes and the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA buoyancy system would need to be implemented. Also, in order to switch vessels from an airship to something else, you would need to either land the airship or leave it at a geostationary position. A special system would assist in geostationary positioning. Considering all of the things that Squad has managed so far, this should be a piece of cake. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECertain parts would be needed to make the most effective airships.
