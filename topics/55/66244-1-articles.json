I think this will allow people to create \u0022micro return\u0022 vessels and have them designed solely to return science to kerbin. it could potentially add new options to the game, either, spam transmit \u0026amp; clean experiments, or return a single science packet with several thousand points of science aboard. Even make several docked probes on a single unmanned ship, each probe carries a science packet, and once a certain amount of science is complete, a single probe returns to kerbin to allow the larger mothership to continue around the system : )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T19:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESend a kerbal on EVA, get him near an instrument, right-click on the instrument, and select Take Data from the menu.

I actually set my lander up so the Kerbal could get out and grab all the science from the ladder, then right click the pod and store it. Very easy. However, you could justify a small (somewhere between the size of a pod and a size of a probe core) \u0022science module\u0022 that could store science and also be a probe core, but it couldn\u0027t store science itself. A Kerbal would have to put it in there, but then it could fly home on its own. Marginally useful? Sure.

I\u0027m thinking, Large land based rover, fitted with a science lab, multiple SSTO minipods, each comprised of a small vessel capable of getting into a stable orbit and performing a rendezvous. once docked the science is transferred to the main station and the pods are refueled, and returned to the surface, either to re-dock with the rover or land within close proximity. Then at every transfer window, a nuclear tug is sent to meet the station and bring additional fuel supplies and/or planetary escape vehicles to the target planet before then return to kerbin with all the science vessels. While the SSTO minipods are travelling to orbit the science lab scrubs all the experiments and performs a few transmits in order to clean the last bit of research from the biome, before slowly chugging off to find more science. That way you can clean the science from a planet without having to spam the crap out of the experiments\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T10:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe science lab is awesome around a body with multiple biomes.
