Basically wide open with not much to see. I don\u0027t see why terrain textures are not so much detailed up close. Textures are very bland and monotone. The only things that has very detailed textures is the ksc, I don\u0027t see why textures are not more detailed when you are on the ground. Also landscapes are very flat. Similar to that of procedural craters on the mun why not add procedural sand dunes in deserts and procedural lakes and rivers in land with sharper edges. Also more realistic looking forests too, something like from space a huge wooded area would just look like a drab of dark green but as you get closer these would turn into triangle like objects and eventually if you get close enough individual trees. Right now ground objects are either in or out there is not in-between. I know these things are not easy to do but they should at least have some type of look at. It would be great to have more fun on ksp\u0027s \u0022microscopic\u0022 level. I\u0027m not asking for as much ground detail as No Man\u0027s Sky but something more would be fun to see or maybe even interact with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ximrm","CreatedById":111063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T13:53:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they\u0027ll add that later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
