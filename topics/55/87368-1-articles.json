I think tho it is time to sit down and polish what you have so far. The last couple patches have added alot of content, but has degraded the overall feel of the game to a bit of something sloppy. Adding more content on top of what you have done so far will exacerbate this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T08:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPolishing will come after feature completion (there have been statements to this effect).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T11:39:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI must ask how are they not \u0022polishing\u0022 what they have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis patch and the next patch both carry large amounts of upgrades to what we already have, and introduce some new features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe SP\u002B parts were \u0022polish\u0022 and so shall be the MK3 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next update will also bring biomes to everywhere, which again is polish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Devs do tend to add general upgrades to the game, take the subassembly manager, upgraded navball, upgraded nodes, and upgraded orbit calculations. All of which are just refinements or improvements the game just needs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel the biggest thing lacking that hasn\u0027t be delt with in a while or even mentioned is IVA views. I feel they will get focused once the upgradable buildings are handled, since the art department has their hands full of that stuff. But these are totally non critical to gameplay, but are very much welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T14:37:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with having a \u0022nothing new, only polish\u0022 patch, which seems to be what you\u0027re suggesting. We\u0027re doing just fine with the \u0022some new stuff \u002B some polish\u0022 patches that have been released for the last while. The game is in alpha, there\u0027s no real need for heavy polishing effort before it\u0027s ready to move to beta. Early heavy polishing can actually be wasted effort, slowing the project as a whole down, as the same things need to be repeatedly polished when new changes render the old polish dull.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s specific things which you feel are in relatively urgent need of some polishing in the short term, you need to be specific in what you\u0027d like to see, rather than just polish everything. 0.25 is far from sloppy, and I just don\u0027t see the overall quality getting worse with each release \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC quite the opposite, it\u0027s getting better and better with each release. New alpha releases can be expected to introduce new snags, but the balance between old issues getting fixed and new issues introduced seems pretty good overall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
