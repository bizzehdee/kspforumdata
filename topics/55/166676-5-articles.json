stock once you can make it to the mun, you can pretty much farm enough science to purchase everything, especially if you go for the MPL; my personal strategy is generally to beeline thru probes to get

This is because the ship never decelerates to a safe deployment speed for the main chute before impact. Drogue chutes should be available early.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Also to that end, Players should be aware that these difficulties can arise *before* they wind up killing Kerbals. A basic Stayputnik should be available early so players can get a feel for the difficulties without killing kerbals, and perhaps test manned concepts remotely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Antenna ranges don\u0027t improve apace with available targets. There is a large chunk of the mid- game where it is possible to send missions to planets, but lack of communication keeps the mission from happening. This results in grinding for science instead of engaging in more ambitious missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The more distant science available on Kerbin is very minor and time consuming, thus, it is only worth collecting (from a game play perspective) very early in the career. During this time, it becomes easier and more productive to go to Minmus rather than exploring Kerbin due to the lack of development of tech that would aid in terrestrial science. I think manned terrestrial science (jets, wheels, etc.) should develop much more rapidly, while space tech should be reined in a bit.
