I\u0027ve not played around with rovers in 0.23 so far, so no comment on the actual behaviour of them, just an observation on the part configuration parameters, which is where any change like that should be visible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T09:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t used them yet but 150m/s breaking speed seems reasonable.
