My sense is that the \u0022Golden Age\u0022 of KSP took off from around 0.90 through today. That recognized, with each new patch, the modding community face a setback and have to update their content for compatibility. It need not be said they these selfless individuals work for free and create passion within the community with their content.\n\nThereby it is understandably when modders burn-out from continuous updates and the demands for updates by the community who love their contributions. Alternatively new interests simply arise, and they move on in life.\n\n**My wish is that development focus** **only** **on final \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CStabilization\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (Unity 5, 64-bit support, and improved resource/asset management). If any \u0022content\u0022 related updates occur, then it should only focus on integrating selected mods for long term support.**  This will cement the modding community relationship, as opposed to wear it out. The rest can be saved for KSP 2.\n\nPerhaps it is overblow, however the have been cases recently where this occurred. (KW Rocketry comes to mind)  I love KSP, and it\u0027s the first single game that I broke over 50 hours playtime within 20\u002B years of gaming. (currently 267 hours) My thanks goes out to the mod community, and to Squad!\n\nThanks for your thoughts \u0026 feedback."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:47:34Z","Content":"This suggestion for the game\u0027s development has been moved to Development Discussions. \n\nAs for my opinion, remember that some of us do not use mods, and would not want to see the game\u0027s development inhibited for a problem which doesn\u0027t affect me or my style of play. Also, some modders are going to lose interest and abandon their projects no matter what else is going on. That\u0027s just the nature of things."},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T21:51:20Z","Content":"I agree, we should focus at the very least with finishing stabilize KSP for PC on Unity 5, BEFORE going to PS4 and without altering it horribly to kill the mods. Modding is truly a huge part of KSP, and SQUAD must weigh that into account when making planning changes."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T01:22:40Z","Content":"No. No. A thousand times no. First off, doing this (basically stopping development after U5)... Do you really want that? Basically that\u0027s what you\u0027re saying. Also, I\u0027d hardly say that modders are drained from continuous updates. When 1.0, easily the biggest update to KSP ever, half the modding community had updated within a few days, and 95% had updated within a week. Do you really want to sacrifice thee entire future of KSP, just so modders don\u0027t have to spend a couple hours updating their files *once every two months?*"},{"CreatedByName":"samhuk","CreatedById":221604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:21:27Z","Content":"I agree somewhat with the OP. There really is little point on further work without updating the extremely outdated core systems of KSP (Unity 5, 64-bit, etc.). KSP has already somewhat reached a glass-ceiling in terms of quality, there is *hardly* any room for improvement without the actions advised by the OP.\n\nAlso...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E No. No. A thousand times no.

The problem with this is that many mods add their features in a bit of a hacky way, and it takes longer to integrate that into the base game source code then to just code the entire thing from scratch.\n\n\u003E Also, you say that , but that is the case with only small and basic mods.

Make KSP better. Give me more options. I got fun from the things I built while I was building them. I enjoyed missions until they were over. My bases once built don\u0027\u0027t get many visits. There is always something else to do. That is what I want. What I don\u0027t want to change. So break it and rebuild it.

I think that most (all?) current development should focus on stability (bug fixes, U5, 64-bit), and for the near future let the game be expandable by using mods.\n\nHowever, I do not agree that development should stop with that - once U5 and x64 are implemented I would hope that development of parts, features, etc. continues."},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T14:12:22Z","Content":"No, no, a thousand times no!\n\nKeep going with development as-is. Stability of old, long established features will emerge naturally. There is absolutely no need to kill off the inertia of ongoing development. The action proposed here would be hugely harmful to the long term success of KSP; whereas continued significant feature development boosts the long term success and helps both to stretch the long tail of sales revenue as well as generating potential for more short term spikes in sales revenue, i.e. maximum commercial success.\n\nMuch as I like the wide selection of mods available for KSP, that should have absolutely zero influence on development decisions by Squad (other than to continue to make sure that there\u0027s a generous selection of hooks for mods to attach to, and avoiding coding in ways that make it difficult to later mod). If some modders can\u0027t handle the pace, so be it. Any mods of significant value which are under proper FOSS licenses will continue regardless of their original creator\u0027s feelings. Those with restrictive licenses will die off and be replaced by something else (hopefully something better, and with a properly open license)."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:22:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, no, a thousand times no!\n\nHey, you quoted me ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T15:24:11Z","Content":"I agree that the current focus should be on U5 etc. But squad are right IMO to take time to fix issues with the current version as they have done.
