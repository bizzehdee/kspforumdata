Most likely .23 and .24 will also be spend fleshing out career mode since they can get a lot of progress for their work as opposed to fine tuning physics and adding parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"webkilla","CreatedById":71356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T18:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efair nuf\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewould be neat if there was a list of future planned features...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T18:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
