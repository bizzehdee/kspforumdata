Personally I just look forward to any new parts that get added, although nuclear fuel would be further down the list for me personally. Basically biomes and such don\u0027t interest me. I mean sure they add a little bit, but not much. With biomes basically all it means is I can land somewhere and get a slightly different science report. That doesn\u0027t interest me at all. What I would like is something to actually do down there. I don\u0027t consider right clicking on a few things and collecting science for all of 50 seconds a worth while reward for the journey.

It\u0027s not like there isn\u0027t a substitute to replace it out there.That\u0027s one of the things that recently irks me, is that all of the latest features seem to be comings in mods before stock. We already have a mod now for contracts, and that\u0027s practically the main basis of the next update, but I know it\u0027s the nature of the beast that mods may well be the first to fill a gap obviously too though. If I had to pick a feature though that I would like to be expanded for a future update it would be science that requires us to actually do something to earn it, Or IVA\u0027s which allowed us to move around and perform a variety of experiments in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, whatever Squad add I will appreciate whether they are of real interest to me or not, but what I want from KSP will probably only ever come from mods, expansion packs or perhaps just close to release. I just miss the .1x updates which added features that opened up whole new opportunities, whereas the updates we are receiving now will take the tools we already have and add restrictions to how we use them.
