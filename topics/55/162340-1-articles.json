been suggested here have ended up getting incorporated in some fashion into the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, attributing \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecausality\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E can be tricky-- i.e. just because they added feature X, and someone happened to suggest that feature here at some time before that... there\u0027s not really any way to know whether they added it \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ebecause\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the suggestion, or whether they would have added it anyway and it\u0027s just a case of great minds thinking alike.\u00A0 Or maybe they were \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethinking\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of adding it already, and seeing enthusiastic player chatter about it might tip the scales in its favor.\u00A0 Who knows?\u00A0 They don\u0027t publicly discuss their reasons or inspirations for adding this or that feature, as \u003Ca

feature that the devs may add or consider adding to the game, there\u0027s a pretty good chance that someone already suggested it at that point, simply because there are so many of us here in the
