Then, when I bring up the current in-flight contract widget, it could be toggled to only show contracts assigned to that vessel. Then I wouldn\u0027t have to wade through all the contracts I have, collapsing them as I go, (only to have one pop open again), to find out if I\u0027m high/low enough and fast/slow enough over the right body with the right kerbals and/or parts to complete the contract(s)!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll it boils down to is filtering the stock contract widget to only show the contracts I want to see when I\u0027m controlling that vessel. Right now it gets way too cluttered with contracts that will get completed by other vessels, once they complete the multi-year coast phase of that mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease and Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T11:09:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing KSP there is of course a mod that will help with that. Since installing Contracts Window \u00A0\u002B I haven\u0027t opened the stock contracts window. It allows you to assign contracts to missions and show only the contracts for your currently selected mission.
