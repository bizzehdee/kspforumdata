I know that remaining time is displayed when clicking on the orbit to generate a maneuver node but doing this way it will be faster to see this information for making nodes. And showing estimated altitude will be another good point for making faster and better planification on burnings, as for example make a node in a reentry to make a burn at a certain altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it also does not make the UI look overloaded (give excessive information to the user) as it will only appear when hovering the mouse on an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease pardon my english as it\u0027s not my mother tongue, and I encourage a discussion on this point (although this is a suggestion of a feature i\u0027ll be glad to see in a future update, I think this post can be a good place to discuss better and faster navigation plannification).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egood flights!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
