Given the same \u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003Eput, a procedural process will always produce the same output. This gets confused with \u0022random\u0022 because very \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E frequently, objects that are procedurally generated by computers pass the generation process a random value (often referred to as a \u0022seed\u0022).

Pseduorandom generators are \u003Cem\u003Eactually procedural\u003C/em\u003E because the same seed (e.g. system clock time) will always produce the same result. The only way around this is to provide the pseudorandom generator\u0027s seed, in turn, from some physical source that actually has entropy (nuclear decay, noise, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T05:19:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI said procedural is not the same as random.
