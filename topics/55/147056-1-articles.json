And welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou make some good points there. \u00A0An \u0027auto pause\u0027 whenever new info gets posted on screen to give the reader time to study it makes sense, especially for those not overly familiar with English. \u00A0Voiced tutorials sounds like quite a nice idea too, maybe one of those \u0027text to speech\u0027 thingummy wotsits could be integrated if a human actor isn\u0027t a workable option for whatever reason. \u00A0An \u0027Auto translating text to speech\u0027 to accommodate other languages may also be possible, but could throw up some confusing instructions if it\u0027s not properly configured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been a while since I did anything serious with a tutorial, I had a look out of interest when 1.1 came out, but didn\u0027t need to follow them as such so didn\u0027t notice your issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe learning curve for KSP is notorious for it\u0027s steep gradient, so anything that helps new players effectively is a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe forums are also a very useful resource for learning stuff. \u00A0Feel free to ask on here if you get
