Politicians and the like are to concerned with a single life when it comes to this sort of thing, and yet we loose more in car accidents and wars every day. We have a mentality of a shut-in, and we need to just stop and realize there are billions of humans right now...one or two casualties in the name of progress is not a very high cost at all. Especially if those that are lost accept it is a possibility of the job.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T20:23:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a really good way for them to list out various goals or achievements in KSP.
