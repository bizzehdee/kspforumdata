One of the most fun parts of KSP is blowing things up right? So, what if there were missions with objectives to \u0022test Part X to failure\u0022? Maybe even under certain circumstances? Like overheat this part, or smash it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads into the other part of my idea. Which is, maybe don\u0027t give all the information on components until they have been used in such and such a way? i.e. For a landing strut it says \u0022weight: 0.1, drag: ???, crash tolerance: ???\u0022 Until you actually fly it then it will tell you drag, and smash it and then it tells you crash tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be really great and add all sorts of information to each parts shown performance data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould really make the game feel even more huge than it already does.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:38:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea.
