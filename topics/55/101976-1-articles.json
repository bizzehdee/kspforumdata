And it would result in some, er.... problems...\n\nAnd there aren\u0027t any plans for more star systems in the near future.\n\nJust set a timer and do something else while your ship warps. With 1.0 you get timewarp-to as well, so jsut tell it to do that and then it\u0027ll go to real time. Meaning if you\u0027re a bit late you\u0027ll be fine."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T03:06:08Z","Content":"Sorry, fellas.
