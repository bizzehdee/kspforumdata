The station wasn\u0027t that big and was coming down engine first which makes a heatshield of sorts - as it did with DRE if I remember correctly. The crew compartments were spaceplane cabins - again designed for re-entry. The bits that did explode were the bits I\u0027d expect to explode - ie the parts on the end on those girders that weren\u0027t hiding behind anything. And if the girders survived - well that\u0027s not too much of a stretch, given that large chunks of [real life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deorbit_of_Mir#Debris) space stations survived re-entry too, albeit not from lunar orbit.\n\nNot entirely sure how Squad are meant to \u0027fix\u0027 this to be honest. If they crank up the stock heat damage too far, all the spaceplane flyers will be screaming blue murder that they can\u0027t land anything any more. They could perhaps make the fuel tanks a bit flimsier - if there\u0027s one thing that didn\u0027t look right with that station, it was the surviving Jumbo-64. Then again, KSP fuel tanks have always been ridiculously sturdy - and I suspect that messing around with that would break so many other parts of the game that it just wouldn\u0027t be worthwhile."},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:59:56Z","Content":"The problem is the 1.02 drag boost means that stuff slows so fast it doesn\u0027t get a chance to cook properly.

In my opinion, if something can survive going 2000 m/s through the atmosphere, with giant things sticking out from the side, that doesn\u0027t seem right, to me at least.

Why fix something that isn\u0027t broken.\n\nI think it was an attempt at:\n\n- Making planes easier and so they didn\u0027t burn up on re-entry 50% of the time (I wouldn\u0027t claim to know anything about this as i\u0027m not a plane person, but a lot of people are suggesting changing jets, not the atmosphere for making planes better)\n- increasing the delta-v requirements closer to their old levels,\n- and imo the old atmosphere felt a little too thin, which may of been what squad was thinking as well, which is why I suggest setting the atmosphere to a half-way mark, though I have no idea if that would actually work, I haven\u0027t tested it.\n\n1.0.1 was a **great** update; it fixed a bunch of glitches (invulnerable parachutes, heatshields being physicless, just to namea few), and brought in new features (a basic fin that was needed for early career), just re-entry heat was a casualty (I can literally re-enter with just an unprotected landing can), and aero is a little too soupy. That\u0027s okay; but in my opinion it\u0027s something that needs to be looked at, either for 1.1 or for a possible 1.0.3.
