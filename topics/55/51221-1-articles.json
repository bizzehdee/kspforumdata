Space stations though aren\u0027t useless pieces of flotsam. They serve as orbital transfer points, and fuel depots. The problem is Space stations should have multiple uses and either you should be forced to build a smaller specialized station for one of the two uses mentioned above or possibly an orbital zero g-laboratory or a zero g-factory. Since what the OP is commenting on is science I will focus my ideas and concepts there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, a new space station/base module should be introduced. This module should eat power and a small amount of fuel for all the Bunsen burners. Also, It should require scientist crew members to man the module. The reason for this is that either a small specialized station for science only can be built, forcing a player to make a choice. Do I use my crew quarters to hold scientist or pilots? Do I use the large fuel tank to supply outgoing rockets to far flung destinations or do I use it to fuel my Bunsen burners? With out any of the these resources the experiments stop. Thus partially avoiding the time warp issue, if you time warp to fast you\u0027ll just have to do a resupply mission to refill the stations fuel supply. But wait that\u0027s not all, there\u0027s more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELabs shouldn\u0027t directly generate science, they should be generating data. Which either can be transmitted to the surface of Kerbin, for a massive reduction in the potential science. The packets of data should be huge, so that with the lab running it would be a huge drain on the electrical system to transmit this data and run the lab. So a data storage device with the information gained by the scientist on the station would need to be sent down and recovered. Viola science points. Also I think the rate of science created should be highest at the altitude that allows only physical time warp and lowest on the surface (with samples from EVA\u0027s giving a boost to the rate, and samples from further bodies giving more of a boost) and lower as the time warp capabilities open up. So basically the lowest point for these labs functionality would be on the surface, and in high orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Visitor","CreatedById":90120,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-05T10:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a tangent: For each \u0022station\u0022 around a unique body in the solar system, transmitting data back to Kerbin gets a 10% science boost.
