optimization, and the grafix overhaul that was started by porkjet (right now we have no idea what his absence will mean, im not going to jump on the bandwagon and automatically assume the rocket parts revamp is dead).\u00A0 I know it isnt essential, but itd be very nice to have the rocket parts (and especially the few remaining ugly cockpits) redone in a standard similar to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E and starfighter (i dont make planes so i cant call them airplane) parts that we got with the mk2 and mk3 updates.\u00A0 Clouds and better atmo shaders would also be welcome here, but given that scatterer/eve have more or less done that already to a reasonable degree, i am perfectly content with mods to fix the glaring visual issues of stock.\u00A0 That and the stock implementation would have to have customizable textures for me to be really happy with it and stop using visual mods.\u00A0 Things like the cloud textures, sunflare (stock sunflare in scatterer sucks as it doesnt look like something out of sci-fi), and the coloring schemes of atmo/clouds (astronomer\u0027s pack was the only eve based mod i actually liked out of the box, everything else lacks that sci-fi feel to it)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from that, there is very little that i consider that necessary in stock KSP, the 2 mods that id personally love in stock is the robotics mod (or some variation of that that gives you rotating/bending joints), and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E (so i can make minor repairs and modifications to a ship in space).\u00A0 Anything else is just too limited in its audience to make stock.\u00A0 Things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E are great for those that enjoy it, but making that stock would make at least 50% of the community unhappy, LS same situation (albeit that can just be toggled off), just no reason to spend the time and effort implenting something that at least half the community isnt crazy about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, while i would love to see MP, the amount of effort and time it would take to make that would require too much time dedicated away from core features.\u00A0 Wish DMP wasnt abandoned (its technically being updated to new versions but actual development and bugfixing is completely dead), it was a good mod back in the day before it just fell apart.\u00A0 That said, not exactly a priority imo right
