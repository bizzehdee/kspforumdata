I know many of these could be fixed with mods, but if they could be put into the game at some point, that would make many, destructive, builders happy. If you have any ideas, do put \u0027em on down!\n\nA few of my ideas include:\n\nThe ability to have the \u0022Used fuel\u0022 gauge next to an activated engine in the stage bars be switched between fuels, IE from LF to LOx, Xenon to Electric Charge, Etc. so you can keep an eye on your more limited resources.\n\nThe ability to have a free-floating camera in the editors. I find all too often I just can move the ship properly or can\u0027t get the right view, especially if I\u0027m making a massive vessel.\n\nAn option to have engines shut off, change mode, or other tweakables/functions change/actuate at a set height. IE, turn off jets engines at 15kM and turn on a rocket engine at said height.\n\nGear/legs to deploy/retract at certain altitudes from the surface.\n\nAdjust the cone of lights, maybe? So you can have \u0022laser pointers\u0022 or something along those lines for landing craft.\n\nPlease allow the torque of SAS units be changed. I don\u0027t need a spinning death machine, just a little spin sometimes. :3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T23:03:15Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 11:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mapleguy4**\n  \nSlight title typo"}]}
