The way I imagined it is something like this: all parts, perhaps in the r\u0026amp;d menu or in the VAB would have a slider. When full, the part is very expensive, but very reliable, with minimum rare faliures that are not critical (example an engine could lose 50% of its thrust or shut down early, or a battery could lose some capacity/whatever)/ With the slider at minimum, the part is cheap BUT has a higher rate of faliure, and the faliures are more severe (structural faliure, explosion, gimbal stuck at full angle etc). This could give an interesting dimension to career: make money more critical and difficult to get, you need to balance your trade off between reliablility (manned missions, critical parts like engines on your booster need to be relaiable, but maybe things like the landing light not so much), and being able to afford your missions. It could also drastically change the way you build manned ships: you might need to consider redundancy, you\u0027ll need to plan your missions and every burn you are going to make and know exactly what is the point of adding a certain part, rather than just \u0022I\u0027ll put this stuff incase I need it, I\u0027ll work it out when I get there...\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could extend this furthur: as you use a part more often, it becomes more reliable, and if you recover a part you get a bonus to the reliablitity increase. You could also tie it into part availability: at the moment you can launch one rocket every five minutes with 20 mainsails and 10 nuke engines and 50 solid rockets if you want. In real life there is a limit to how fast they can be built.

Some probably significant mass increase. Take an orbital engine with redundancy (like Apollo), all but the engine bell has backup systems, engine mass up by 30% maybe, and gets a 2d chance if there is a failure. I really like that. Note that some systems can have things that engineers could repair (a use for skill). Another use for pilot skill might be to be able to deal with maneuver problems... say holding attitude with RCS/SAS when either (or both) of those systems have some failure. Say 1 RCS nozzle is not functioning, an RCS input using it would cause a spin, but the pilot can deal with it within some range based on skill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience instruments could be repaired by a scientist (cause they need some use for skill)..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T18:38:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the concept of all of these things put together, but then it might get a little too \u0022simmy\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I just thought it would be neat to have the consideration in the design stage of accounting for failures with redundancy, definitely not something I\u0027d want enabled in a standard game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0But my apologies for even bringing it up.
