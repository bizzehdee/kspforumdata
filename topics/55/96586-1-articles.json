What\u0027s happening (as I understand it, having asked people who have looked at the code around it) is that the game actually dampens rotation forces by a certain amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, calculating rotational damping probably wouldn\u0027t be too tricky over timewarp, but I feel as though it\u0027s such an unnecessary thing to have that it should probably go out the window entirely. As a bonus, it would make applying rotation properly over timewarp simpler. What I see as the main problem with this, however, is that you\u0027ve got basically two solutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECalculate total rotation for the entire time interval upon dropping out of warp. You won\u0027t see the rotation happening once in warp, but you\u0027ll see your craft rotated upon dropping out of warp. The issue with this is that it could end up being confusing, as the craft would be abruptly rotated, potentially seriously messing up a planned manoeuvre or the like.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECalculate rotation on the vessel each step while in timewarp. It would be a simple rotation of the entire craft, no need to simulate forces. The issue with this is that at high warp, even tiny amounts of rotation would be amplified, turning your vessel into a spinning blur. That would make it essentially impossible to interact with any part of the craft and/or check its orientation whilst in high warp. Not a massive loss, but still something to consider, I think.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
