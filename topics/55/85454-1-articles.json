I (as well as others) have found it has clever uses such as creating command modules for orbital space stations and Mun/Interplanetary bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince reading about crew transfers finally getting added, wouldn\u0027t it be great to add crew support to structural fuselages (possibly 3 per structural fuselage)? This could even lead to a nifty feature involving modular IVAs where if you connect one structural fuselage to another, you will have an expanded IVA (with Kerbals standing or possibly walking). This could also lead to windowed structural fuselages to add pretty cool effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine the first existence of a possible procedural IVA (currently for specially designed structural fuselages) where the inside changes (others probably have done this through modding already). Another nifty thing is to add some form of airlock into the docking port that is attached to the structure fuselage (like a secondary hatch). Possibly leading to some very interesting part module combos when certain parts are connected with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example: Sticking a structural fuselage (with either an included docking part or a similar part) to the Mk2 Lander Can. Mk2 Lander Can acts as the Parent part and the structural fuselage (or another part like a docking node or a connecting part) acts as a child part. With the Mk2 Lander Can acting as the parent, you can easily transfer the crew from the lander can to the structural fuselage just before exiting out the specially made docking hatch on the structural fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-26T16:53:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2014 04:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bandock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prophet_01","CreatedById":111502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T21:18:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds cool. I would definetly like to see this as a conection betwen modules of a station or a massive ship. Also, bigger vessels can get difficult to dock without damaging anything. Placing the docking ports further out helps with that. Once moving crew without eva gets aded I don\u0027t want to use hitch hikers only, especially for that. Some flexibilty would be nice to make this feature more practical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m not rly thrilled about another part that ads to the issue of flooded menus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be a good idea to implement it as a tweakable for the regular structural fuselage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think a capacity of 3 seems rather high, considering it\u0027s not that big.

If IVA ever gets to the point you can walk (or move in Space) Kerbals inside of modules, it would definitely come in handy. Perhaps a click allows you to access another module while exploring inside the craft or base?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T16:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about structural fuselages having \u0022crew capacity\u0022.
