Apart from a convenient place to store your Science Lab, or as a glorified gas station? Hardly. They\u0027re nice to look at, fun to plan, and building them is good docking practise, but space stations serve sorely little purpose in Stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStation Science is the solution. It adds a set of science experiments to be performed in orbit around the various bodies. But unlike instruments such as thermometers or barometers or gravioli detectors, you can\u0027t just send them up, click a button, and be done. No, these science experiments need infrastructure. First and foremost, a Science Lab. With the lab, you can perform basic plant growth experiments, but for more exotic stuff you need more. Want to observe certain subatomic particles in a zero-G environment? Haul a cyclotron into orbit. Animal experiments? Up you go, Zoology Bay. Add them to your station, and you\u0027ll be able to conduct more, cooler, and more rewarding experiments, with a decent reward every time a contract asks for it to be conducted. There\u0027s no need to deorbit the Zoology bay once you\u0027ve conducted the zoology experiment, the contract may appear again and offer a similar reward if you repeat it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, those labs, cyclotrons and zoology bays use a fair amount of power. Do you think large rigs of 8-16 Gigantor XL solar arrays, like they have on the ISS, look cool? Of course you do. Have you ever felt the need to use one - or for that matter, any - of those big boys on your station in stock? Well, to run a cyclotron at full power, you need four Gigantor XL-arrays, if I recall correctly. The most exotic particle experiments require two cyclotrons running at full power for quite some time, so the mod gives you a pretty good reason to build a full ISS-style solar rig, and slap together banks of Z-1k batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, the mod turns space stations from vanity projects into good gameplay elements. It gives you reasons to build, use and revisit space stations in orbit around Kerbin, Mun, Minmus and other bodies. It adds to KSP a type of space science and research that is common in the real world; more than just \u0022measure the temperature in orbit once and be done with it forever\u0022. I highly recommend the mod to everybody, and urge the developers to have a look at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endomen","CreatedById":163630,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-11T00:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInfernal robotics: KSP needs parts to fold up so that they can take up less space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRasterPropMonitor: Without this, IVAs are just IVs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDMagic Orbital Science: Adds lots of experiments like sciesmic pods, magnetometer booms and other useful stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHullCam: What do almost all probes have on them?
