I just did some test flights with a new SSTO of mine. It uses 2 jet- and a rocket engine. I\u0027m using FAR, B9 and DRE. The result is a flood of data (intake air, climb rate, temperature, angle of attack, apoapsis) that I have to keep an eye on while keeping the plane stable (the stock SAS has some issues with FAR; it wobbles and changes course). I already burned up twice and ripped my plane to shreds due to stalls like 5 times.

If anyone has ever played KSP with another Kerbalnaut, of a similar skill level, they know how easy that can make flying/building spacecraft, heck you could even have it be able to pass primary control of the vessel over to PLAYER 2 if PLAYER 1 can\u0027t fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
