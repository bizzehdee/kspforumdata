At the same time, they slow the game down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, when building a surface base out of different-sized components, I would put wheels on the modules to allow me to move everything around and in to the proper location. Then I would deploy landing legs to get everything off of the ground and at a uniform height. Now I\u0027m left with wheels I don\u0027t need. I\u0027d like to be able to have an engineer take a crowbar and rip them off (turning them into debris).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise for missions with parts which aren\u0027t needed any more. For example, a mystery-goo unit might have the experiment removed and then stowed in the capsule. I\u0027d love to be able to have an engineer remove/discard the goo container to save on mass/aero limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to KAS, this would work on any component. Also, it would not be set up to allow part attachment or relocation. Merely remove and discard the existing scrap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T14:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways use decouplers with parts that you won\u0027t need!
