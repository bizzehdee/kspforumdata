That\u0027s a bit harder, since I assume a lot of people still want to see the flags on the map. Could flags be on some kind of seperate tab or be sorted to the bottom with a seperator, so that they are still visible by default but not cluttering up the list of active space craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T00:55:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Runboy","CreatedById":62496,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T02:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood Idea.Small,but good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T04:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please make this happen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T05:00:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too would like to see this as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter yet, have a Settings menu option that allows players to select which vessel types will count towards \u0022Flights In Progress\u0022 for the load screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RSwordsman","CreatedById":78678,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T05:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
