A smooth porting transition for the developers of *Rust* does not guarantee a similar experience for SQUAD and KSP.\n\nWith regards to the inclusion/exclusion of features from add-ons, at the end of the day, KSP is SQUAD (and Harvester\u0027s) baby, and they have an original vision that they are aiming for. Add-ons that don\u0027t fit this vision are generally not considered in the grand scheme of things, at least for 1.0.\n\nAlso, integrating add-ons isn\u0027t a simple matter of \u0022here, take my code and put it into your game\u0022. SQUAD has their hands full maintaining their existing codebase, fixing bugs and implementing features that were originally planned as part of their internal roadmap to KSP 1.0, and adding foreign code that is potentially unoptimized or makes use of outdated workarounds/hacks for problems from the base game adds to their workload significantly.\n\nFinally, not all players agree one what add-ons should be integrated into the stock game - for instance, I\u0027m an avid user of MechJeb for flight automation because I\u0027m personally more of a infrastructure manager than a hotshot ace pilot, but many people aren\u0027t. SQUAD\u0027s choices on which add-ons to make stock is mainly dependent on what fits their vision of the game and what doesn\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T07:50:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have been getting crashes every other launch due to memory issues.

KSP is not GPU greedy. At all. Like not at all. KSP barely needs your GPU, a basic graphics card with 1GB of memory would do the job without any problem. KSP is limited by the CPU. While the game is multithreaded, the Unity API is not threadsafe. What this means is that you cannot split one task across multiple cores. And the culprit is physics. They\u0027re stuck being calculated by a single core, which is really suboptimal. And when you increase your part coutn, this is where the load increases. Not on the GPU. But on the ever growing physics thread.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This brings me to my argument and point. 64bit Windows mode should be #1 priority for the Devs. It\u0027s current broken state is not good enough. Everything I see them listing as the next release I can do without.\n\nThat\u0027s about as good as a priority as saying switching to Unity 5 is the priority.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Aerodynamics model, I have FAR to do that.

Let the community do their job of creating content, and Squad fix the game so I can use more than 4gb of Ram.\n\nHold on. I\u0027m not sure you understand that statement. The stock game runs very well on 32bit. Stock itself is not eating up the memory limit. Mods are. This is why 64bit should *not* be a priority. The priority is to finish the game and have it functional vanilla. Modding capacity is candy. It\u0027s very important candy yes, but it should not drive the **priorities** of the game, it should drive the \\*execution\\*.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I ask this because it\u0027s almost certainly a lot easier to fix the 64 bit client for KSP than it is for someone to sort Linux out and make it more mainstream. Make 1.0 the 64 bit release please.\n\nFixing the client, is, unfortunately, probably the hardest task you could ask from the devs. I don\u0027t think you understand how this works. The problem is not native to the game, it\u0027s native to Unity itself. Literally, there are things that the devs can\u0027t do even if they spent a month on them. Fixing the client is going to at least require switching to Unity 5, which actually brings forward 64bit stability on Windows.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That is a first hand account of changing a game from Unity 4 to 5. It\u0027s not a difficult process, obviously it is work but considering the biggest issue with the game currently is memory usage I think it\u0027s warranted.\n\nNo, porting to Unity 5 is not an easy process. Especially not on a game like KSP, which is extremely physics intensive and pushes Unity to it\u0027s limit. It\u0027s a long, hard, and complex process, which may not work at all without large parts of the codebase being rewritten from the ground up.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I also read the official response to not integrating mods into the game which basically contradicts this official statement in some ways. On one hand they are saying we aren\u0027t implementing mods because it becomes extra work they then need to do when it\u0027s being done by others for free right now.\n\u003E I don\u0027t understand that statement. Modding has always been on a volunteering basis, and unpaid. Squad is working on a game which they are trying to make revenue from. They need to complete their game, and integrating a mod is sometimes more complex than writing it in the game. It requires adaptation and restructurations, and a lot of legalese.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Then they are saying we aren\u0027t going to fix the (in my opinion) biggest problem with the game because we are too busy adding features which as I said in my previous comment is already available by using mods.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E They aren\u0027t going to fix the problem because most of it is not even in their hands.

I\u0027m sure your right about the CPU and thread thing however when I was testing for resource use and FPS over the last day or so I did notice when I told my large rocket to break up by releasing boosters the CPU usage immediately fired across all 4 cores. 1 was used then on staging all cores went crazy so that was interesting. Oh and despite your claim of GPU having no impact I observed a noticeable and recordable difference between SLI and non SLI configs in windows. I can only go off my own interpretation from Linux as I was having some weird behaviour from the FPS counter.\n\n2. I agree there are more modders than devs, that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying Devs fix the engine by changing across to U5 and let the myriad of modders fill in the content in the mean time. I am saying U5 should be priority. I understand there can be complications with the physics etc but the Rust is a physics game as well so it is possible and according to his report not that hard. I personally have no experience in it you are right so I can only go off what I can read, listening to those who are experienced and more than likely a lot smarter than me.\n\n3. Your point about U4 engine being extremely hard to fix I\u0027m sure is also right however that\u0027s why I\u0027m saying move onto U5 because that is the fix. The developers have upgraded it specifically to include 64 bit as native among other things of lesser note.\n\n4. I mentions the transition to U5 and certainly it wouldn\u0027t be the easiest way out. The easy way is to say .... it, leave it as it is and move on. Perhaps Squad will leave it, perhaps they will fix this issue. Only they know for certain. KSP is about the physics but U5 bring a more capable physics engine which I\u0027m sure will be a lot of work to transition but the rewards I would think are worth it.\n\n5. Your comment about modding. I\u0027m saying exactly what you are saying. Let the modders do the modding, add content etc. Let the developers fix the major issues that modders can\u0027t fix. We don\u0027t need more official content right now. We have a large and thriving modding community making amazing content and it costs the developers nothing to maintain or implement. This is the time for the developers to fix the engine problems before all the content that they plan to include is in place. If they add more content now and then decide to fix the memory issues by changing the engine its probably going to create more work fixing even more official content. At no point am I saying incorporate mods in officially at this time.\n\n6. They should be fixing the memory issue because the engine developers have already fixed the issue by creating and releasing a new and relatively easily transferable engine.\n\nI\u0027m not saying they should transition the engine in 2 hours like Rust did. Use the whole patch development cycle. How long has it been since 0.90 came out? Long enough to have U5 up and running that\u0027s how long. It is their game and they need to make money but if they are planning on making a transition at all it should be priority because everything else is covered by mods."},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T14:01:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *That is a first hand account of changing a game from Unity 4 to 5.

Of course they\u0027re gonna try, maybe things will go better than expected. Coding is just a massive whatever fest. Sometimes things work and you have no clue why. But the opposite is true. Chances are transfering to Unity 5 could take half a year, and yield unstable results. And then even, as Harv mentioned, Unity 5 is not a promise of fixes. Transferring to Unity 5 is not necessarily going to fix the 64bit client. All in all, if you want to transfer to U5, completely fix the win64 client, and completely multithread KSP with the physics being correctly split across cores, I\u0027d expect it to take something around 6-12 months with the current team.
