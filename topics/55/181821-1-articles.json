That\u0027s as heavy as a Poodle, and much heavier than 1.25m engine options.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the Making History DLC, it is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emassively\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0outclassed by the Cub (especially for landers), an engine with 5x lower mass, but only 3x lower thrust, and \u002B5/\u002B5\u00A0Isp, with the only downside of only one axis of gimbal. While you effectively need 4x Cub minimum...that\u0027s still less mass than 1 Thud (of which you need 2).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBecause of 1, and being radially-mounted, one of its niches is to be an early \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E booster...but the Spark\u00A0outclasses it at this, and 2 means that it\u0027s probably better on drag to have radially-mounted tanks with caps and clustered Sparks on the bottom than to use Thuds.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s obvious intended asthetics, and one niche where its radial mounting and gimbaling should make it great, is as a shuttle OMS. The terrible vacuum Isp holds it back, however, and this clashes with its other main use\u00A0being atmospheric.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThat drag\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eneeds\u003C/em\u003E to be fixed.

The two problems here are its mass and vacuum Isp. I think both should be about in line with 2 Thuds being only a bit worse than a Terrier. It also should be slightly worse than the Skiff, as that engine\u0027s pretty good and there should be a slight penalty for radial-mounting.
