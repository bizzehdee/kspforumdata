You have to consider the flight path to an extent to make sure it\u0027s not too steep, and you have to make sure you\u0027ve got proper heat protection of the spacecraft. So it\u0027s pretty clear that this is something the stock game needs to have. But the thing is, it\u0027s not a \u0022new system.\u0022 Shock heating is part of the aerodynamic effects of travelling at high mach numbers. I think this is grounds to implement it along with the other aerodynamic changes. They\u0027re the same thing, just manifest on different speeds.
