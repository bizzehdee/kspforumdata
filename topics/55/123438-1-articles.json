The two tabs are \u0022Ships\u0022 (the currently available tab) and \u0022Maneuvers\u0022 (the new tab I\u0027m proposing). This tab would only appear once the player has upgraded the tracking station to allow setting maneuver nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Maneuvers tab would be different from the Ships tab, as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

However, it\u0027s completely tedious for reason #2.

you\u0027re pretty much guaranteeing that somebody at Squad will look at it and triage it appropriately (i.e. decide what, if anything, to do about it).\u00A0 However:\u00A0 if you do that, the likelihood that other KSP players will see it goes way down (how many of us are in the habit of browsing Squad\u0027s ticket database?), and it\u0027s much less likely to have a freewheeling discussion on the matter.\u00A0 And if Squad happens to decide \u0022nah, we\u0027re not doing that\u0022 when they see the ticket, then it\u0027ll basically just die right there without any further discussion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you post it in the forums, you\u0027re not \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eforcing\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E anybody at Squad to look at it \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(though they probably do)\u003C/span\u003E... but it\u0027s a lot more visible to the players, and if it\u0027s a topic that really speaks to people, then many participants will join in and the feature\u0027s appeal and need will become much more apparent to anyone reading (including Squad).\u00A0 And you\u0027re likely to hear feedback from lots of people who may propose additional refinements that didn\u0027t occur to the OP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that forums \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan be\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E a terrible way to get things done.\u00A0 It completely depends on the attitude of whoever\u0027s running the forum.\u00A0 If a company just views the forums as a place for users to spout off, and never bothers reading what\u0027s in them, and never addresses the content, then yeah, nothing\u0027s going to happen and you\u0027re basically just shouting down a hole.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, my observation has been that in the particular case of Squad and the KSP forums, it\u0027s not like that.\u00A0 The \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactual developers\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eactually reading\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E this, and demonstrate this frequently by jumping into discussions, answering questions, etc.\u00A0 I\u0027m frankly astonished.\u00A0 I\u0027ve been in the software industry a very long time, and I\u0027ve never seen that level of responsiveness of developers to end users anywhere else.\u00A0 Heck, I\u0027ve lost count of how many times this has happened:\u00A0 I post a comment or question about ISRU somewhere, and RoverDude himself jumps in to respond.\u00A0 Or it\u0027ll be about aerodynamics, and there\u0027s NathanKell.\u00A0 Or contracts, and there\u0027s Arsonide.\u00A0 And this happens even if I never mentioned the developer by name, which means that they\u0027re actively reading these forums for topics relevant to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry getting that level of response, straight from the original author of the feature, from \u003Cem\u003Eanywhere else\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Not gonna see \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E from EA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact of the matter is, as an input mechanism from the general public, the actual form of the input (forum or ticketing system) doesn\u0027t matter much.\u00A0 What matters is the attitude of the operator.\u00A0 A company that routinely ignores the forums could just as easily routinely ignore the ticketing system by summarily triaging user-generated tickets as \u0022by design.\u0022\u00A0 Or by closing it to public input and only letting a few chosen ones participate.\u00A0 Or by just getting into the habit of ignoring all such tickets completely and filtering them out of their ticket queries.\u00A0 What really matters is, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edoes the company pay attention to its users\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and my impression over the past year or two has been that Squad really does.\u00A0 To an amazing (and refreshing) degree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\u00A0 It\u0027s also not an either/or, you can have your cake and eat it, too.\u00A0 For example, suppose you propose something in the forums, and it turns out to be very \u0022successful\u0022 (i.e. lots of users weigh in, there\u0027s a lot of commentary, and general acclamation that \u0022yes, we really need this\u0022), then you can go ahead and create a ticket in Squad\u0027s ticketing system, with a link to the forum thread for context.\u00A0 (And add the ticket link to the original forum post).\u00A0 Best of both
