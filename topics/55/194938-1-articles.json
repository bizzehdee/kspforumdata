It is quite literally a game-changer, but is has one major issue, maintenance. Kopernicus is an incredibly complex mod that requires constant updates, but precisely because of its complexity, said updates require a massive amount of work, work that is done pro bono by volunteer devs. As such, I would like to suggest a petition for the game devs to take over. Updating Kopernicus first requires that one understand how it all works and how each update affects the code. The volunteer devs have to figure that on their own for the most part, but the game devs would know everything they need to implement such features by default. That would make it infinitely easier to maintain the mod, and given how vital this mod is (I mean it quite literally is a dependency for an entire genre of mods), and how promoted\u00A0mod-usage is to begin with\u00A0(since there\u0027s an option for it on right the game\u0027s main menu), I should think that integrating such a mod into the stock build would be a no-brainer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, Kopernicus is a game-changing mod that would be best served if integrated into the stock build, as that would benefit everyone, the mod devs (for easing their trouble), the game devs (for making a better game), and the end-users, who\u0027d no longer have to rely on how the mod devs spend their free time. And seriously now, how is this mod not yet stock to begin with?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kraken that doesn\u0026#039;t exist","CreatedById":202664,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-21T21:07:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DirtyFace83","CreatedById":131509,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-21T21:59:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to give anybody any ideas, but if it\u0027s done right and also has some kind of\u00A0 \u0027planet making made really really easy - like, for 5 year olds easy\u0027 type of editor, then I might even pay 10 or 15 bucks for it as a DLC.

\u00A0I think there\u0027s a couple of valid reasons Squad should take a look at this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is a clear and unequivocal demand from the user group that this is a functionality change that they want to see included at the base level of the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is the capability of being able to \u0027hide\u0027 this functionality behind the paywall of a DLC pack, making the decision to incorporate these changes an economic one\u00A0rather \u0022all work and no payoff\u0022; or\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThey use this as an opportunity to develop a system as a \u0022proof of concept\u0022 that can be used in future releases (KSP2 anyone?).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the most enticing of these is reason three. \u00A0For example, it opens the door for Squad to make new DLC packs (income generation) which focus on new star systems / planets. \u00A0Done Kerbol in 2.5x? \u00A0Well have a try of our new \u0022Alpha Centauri\u0027 DLC pack, or the Sirius DLC which features \u0022hot\u0022 gas giants circling in close orbit around a binary star system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, we all love Kopernicus and what it enables us to do in a game we all enjoy playing (shut up kraken, I\u0027m not talking to you). \u00A0If there were only a handful of people that played using JNSQ or OPM or ReScale then I doubt we\u0027d be having this discussion. \u00A0In reality there is a significant number of us who are committed to playing with these mods, and the effect is that many of us are not keeping up with content patches / bug fixes with the latest releases because Kopernicus update isn\u0027t available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt; TO THE DEVS \u0026gt;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDevs, if you\u0027re listening (well, reading actually, but whatever): is this something you have written on a card wall somewhere?
