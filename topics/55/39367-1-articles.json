As far as weight, crash test dummies aren\u0027t very useful. However, when testing a lander, it would be good to know things like G-force, impact speeds, and other little tidbits that could be gathered from using a test dummy crammed full of SCIENCE! could tell us. Plus: with the new addition of possibly losing a test pilot (so, so many test pilots) it might be a good idea to have a crash test dummy that fills the seat, but adds a remote control system to the whole mess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Themohawkninja","CreatedById":9628,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T17:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbals inside command pods weight nothing at all, unless you mean dummies in command seats.
