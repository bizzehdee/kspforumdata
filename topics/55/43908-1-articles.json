There seems to be a multi-core library for unity available.. but i cant judge if its worth to rewrite everything to make use of it. I would rather wait for unity to implement it nativly..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: So.. basically not a bad idea.. but would you rather take a lag of a second per part in the vab that you add to your craft? at least for the first N parts? Just imagine the effect: the game loads pretty fast and once in the vab you have the game choke/stop on every part that you didnt use before.. i would expect the outcry would be much much louder than we hear right now. There might be a way for in between... giving \u0022trends\u0022 on which parts are used most and which are \u0022in flight\u0022... but that would still be slow compared to the current VAB system..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4: I would say this is \u0022polishing\u0022 and can be done pretty late in the development.. but history is different. Take a look at the changelogs and you will see how much the textures already have changed.. might be worth thinking about it.. but i dont think it would add a lot to the overall performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5: Well.. its up to them i guess \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
