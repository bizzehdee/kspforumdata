So you can make as many ships as you want but none of your ships can exceed your budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Then you have missions like (suborbital flight, achieve orbit, land in X planet, etc...). You only have missions that can be done within your budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you choose to play a mission, when you complete it you gain a bigger budget and unlock new mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you never run out of money and the player can alternate between science missions and money missions. (or bout at the same time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBigger budget = Bigger ships = Bigger missions = Bigger science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my bad English.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETnks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T08:26:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooking the thread because there is a current discussion about it already in progress: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52543-For-22-Component-cost\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52543-For-22-Component-cost\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has also be confirmed that it will be there for the final career mode, which is not yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
