Jebretary currently works on all versions of KSP and can deal with 95% of mods. There are still improvements and fixes I want to make to it, but I\u0027m just one rather thinly spread guy! My work on KerbalX has resulted in much better craft file reading code so that is due to be incorporated into Jebretary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust as an fyi about Jebretary and the way it uses git; I\u0027ve not tried out the backup mod you linked but from what I can see it makes copies of save files. Jebretary doesn\u0027t make copy of files. It uses git to store the \u0022diff\u0022 or \u0022delta\u0022 between file versions, in other words it only stores the lines in a file that have changed. This makes it extremely space efficient especially when the file changes just a little but frequently like the persistent files do. If you take a copy of your persistence files every time it changes that starts using up a fair bit (GB\u0027s) of space, but with Jebretary tracking every single change to both quick and autosaves and all craft versions it will only use a fraction of that space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T13:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJeberetary is still a current project, its just not being actively improved right now as I\u0027m focusing on KerbalX in my spare time.

Mine has never gotten above 1MB, even with dozens of active vessels. In any case, the S.A.V.E. mod allows you to set a maximum number of backups, which means it\u0027s a total non-issue \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E; seems unlikely you\u0027ll need to revert to 20 versions ago \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E. Having a dependency on git is perhaps not the greatest idea though, especially if you\u0027re only using it for diff; from experience git is far from the most user-friendly version control system (but the best by far!). Diff is its own separate program you can find on most linux systems; there\u0027s a windows version too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
