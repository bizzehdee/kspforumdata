If Happiness is down for a long time, sanity will suffer. \n\u003E Now, happiness is influenced by the types of food and drinks the kerbals are given (for example, fresh meat and vegetables will increase happiness and health), but of course, as in real life, the foods which are the yummiest, will get unhealthy.\n\nThat\u0027s a lot more finicky than we want for stock life support - a bunch of new resources and three needs that need to be micromanaged.

I know some people don\u0027t like the idea of it, but I don\u0027t think they should be forced to use it. Everyone should have fun on their own rules and that\u0027s why it should be toggleable.\n\u003E So let\u0027s keep it as simple as possible:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Kerbals need electricity (CO2 filtering, water purification, heat, whatever) and food to survive. Food should be stored in the modules with crew. You can decide if you want to hold the crew in it or fill it with supplies instead.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Greenhouse module (roughly the size of the lab module with big, glass windows) that would support X number of Kerbals for infinite amount of time. Needs a lot of electricity to grow food (AFAIK [it\u0027s been done on ISS and other spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_in_space), just on lower scale, so why not simply make the farm bigger?).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Messages that would take into account the nearest low-dV transfers (or full implementation of KAC) for the bodies your Kerbals are on/orbiting with a rough calculation that would allow you to resupply them (r4pt0r\u0027s idea).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If the crew runs out of food it dies after, lets say, a month of not eating.

While initially it may be fun to have the immersion, sending resupplies out constantly will quickly get old especially when you end up having 100s of kerbals out in the kerbol system. And things like food resuppliers/growers/whatever will be what, excessive part counts you need to add.\n\nI just feel that having a sort of hard limit on how long you can last without resupply would be more annoying in the long term then fun. Think about it, right now with fuel, yes you need to resupply long term missioins a few times, but you only need to supply them when you run out or low on fuel, something that is in my opinion fun but not tedious or annoying especially with teh advent of IRSU parts which make local supplying rather possible. That, and you can forget abotu a ship you dont feel like working with for the time being, and can focus on whatrever you feel like working on at the moment, never do you need to go out of your way to make sure noone dies (unless they happen to be on a collision course with something ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)).\n\nThat, and its also tough to balance, make the resource drain very low, and it can be ignored, while making it too high, and it becomes a pain in the arse to deal with.

They would chance the efficiency of scrubbing/recovery for the habs connected as a function of total connected crew aboard. Some might explicitly mention that they get a bonus if a power cell is used (water), for example, or might even function as one. The description would explain that they produce a small amount of power using fuel/oxidizer to generate water for LS.\n\nnet result is just lowering consumption slightly.

One of the more interesting stats they gave was the mass of spare parts required to keep the life support functional based upon RL data from ongoing LS maintenance on ISS. It amounted to *multiple* full Dragon loads of parts for a 26 month resupply period to have just a 50% chance of having the right parts available. Their figure for one crew of 4 for 26 months was 10,000kg of spare parts for a coin-flip capability to fix any LS problem (bad odds when the next possible resupply is 26 months). They show 9 Dragons required for the first 4 people (preloading with supplies, etc). The MIT guys show that they would need 4 more just for LS spare parts (wow).\n\nThis makes what we normally think of as \u0022consumables\u0022 look pretty easy, mass wise.\n\nI don\u0027t think any LS mods include this at all, so I bet their mass numbers are really optimistic. For a simple, stock system this just means increasing the mass of LS supplies used per kerbal, per day. It\u0027s also an entirely legit reason for having an engineer aboard reduce consumption (he\u0027s fixing the LS all the time). No outposts should be 100% efficient unless they have the capacity to manufacture spare parts (EPL?). \n\nIt might also be cool to have cheaper and lighter, but needs more resupply vs heavier, and way more expensive to need lower resupply.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-24T06:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2015 06:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T07:32:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nI\u0027m struggling to understand what gave you so much rep to get you to the light green group.\n\nGuys, let\u0027s keep the LS as simple as possible.
