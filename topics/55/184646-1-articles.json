I\u0027d love to have a mission planner function where you can enter in a launch time, and already start placing maneuver nodes, then start the mission with all the maneuver nodes already there and in place (or perhaps you select a target starting orbit, and then once you reach it within acceptable deviation, as in a contract, you can load the maneuver node set)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like probe cores to be able to execute maneuver nodes on their own, automatically (even if signal is lost, as long as the maneuver was entered before signal loss, it should do it).

But sure, better graphics are nice. I\u0027m not sure KSP 2.0 is needed for that though... but I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d feel about a \u0022High Def\u0022 graphics overhaul DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 2: that\u0027s really just a squad business model, doesn\u0027t really relate to KSP 2.0 or KSP 1.9 DLC...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor 3... again, I don\u0027t know if they need to go to KSP 2.0 for that. With that said, I do like the system that many games have - where you just subscribe on steam, and select the mods you want from a launcher on start-up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I accept that mech jeb isn\u0027t unrealistic, it is a game, and before I got the game I had an interest in it, but I then lost all interest in mechjeb. It is a game. Right now astronauts are kind of useless as far as getting to space: not needed at all, they are a payload. Given the scale of the game and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E margins, I\u0027m fine with it being manual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, given that we have mech jeb already, I\u0027d again say this isn\u0027t a reason that we need a KSP 2.0 (not that I wouldn\u0027t like a KSP 2.0 if it was polished and had the right features)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) I\u0027m pretty sure that would be easy for them to change (even games back in the 90s often had console commands that let you change the FOV, like \u0022FOV 90\u0022 or \u0022FOV 70\u0022). I really doubt KSP 2.0 is needed for that. KSP 1.X could probably do that\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean.... sure... but I don\u0027t think modern direct X graphics really are needed for a sense of scale? KSP already has a sense of scale that puts most other games to shame. All that is really needed for your suggestion is that a plane starts just outside the spaceplane hangar, or you add a crawler animation for rockets. You can already spawn an unmanned plane on the runway, then spawn a bus from the launchpad and go drive your kerbal to the plane. KSP as it is supports adding launch/ spawn points so really they could just add a kerbal spawnpoint near the astronaut complex, and add an option to spawn rockets/planes outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E or on the runway/launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure all this could be modded in, so while I think they are good suggestions, I don\u0027t think they need KSP 2.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps this could be implemented with the part switching function, and the (currently unused in the stock game, but the framework was put in place) part upgrade system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, a big thing I think we need is mission planning. I mean, the ability to make manuever nodes and such before launching a craft. I\u0027d love to have a mission planner function where you can enter in a launch time, and already start placing maneuver nodes, then start the mission with all the maneuver nodes already there and in place (or perhaps you select a target starting orbit, and then once you reach it within acceptable deviation, as in a contract, you can load the maneuver node set)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like probe cores to be able to execute maneuver nodes on their own, automatically (even if signal is lost, as long as the maneuver was entered before signal loss, it should do it). It could be nice if they\u0027d even execute the nodes while \u0022on rails\u0022 in the background/not the active flight, as long as their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is within a certain range, and the maneuver node estimated burn time is within a certain percent of orbital period (so you don\u0027t have a 9km/second burn with ion engines executing on some probe that is on rails and not the active vessel). This would allow you to set up target vehicles and let you handle routine cargo launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently the limit of 1 active vessel is one of the biggest creativity limits. Trying to make flyback boosters when only 1 vessel is controllable at a time is very difficult. Air launch to orbit from something with high bypass turbofans will basically only ever let you get your payload to orbit, or recover the launcher aircraft, not both. If the rocket payload could have its maneuver nodes pre-set and if it executes them on its own, you could air drop it, and fly the launching craft back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, while your air dropped rocket continues to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMabye KSP 2.0 is needed for this? I dunno\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.. they need a mission set... they kind of maybe sort of get close to this with some missions that sort of come up sequentially... like get to orbit, rendezvous in orbit, dock, explore Mun (flyby, then orbit, then land)... but often this progression gets broken (oh, you flew by the Mun before rendezvousing first... never mind your explore mun contracts, and I think the docking contract may go away).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022worlds first\u0022 achievements sort of kind of get close to this... especially with \u0022leadership initiative\u0022... you can do missions to reach those goals, ignoring contracts. The problem is that you can\u0027t really rely on \u0022leadership initiative\u0022 early in the game because of the investment needed to upgrade the admin building, and commit to it at 100%... by the time you\u0027ve accepted enough contracts and done enough stuff to unlock all that, most of the achievements are already gone, and you need to go interplanetary for more, and each planet gets you only a handful of bonuses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA campaign consisting of a structured and well defined contract/mission sequence would be good. Alternatively, a list of \u0022worlds first\u0022 achievements remaining (as another tab, so you can switch between those and cotnracts) could help. I\u0027d rather have the option to effectively start with a 100% commitment to leadership initiative..and then later switch to a \u0022commercial space initiative\u0022... basically reversing the situation with leadership initiative\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s a consequence of building planes part by part. I don\u0027t know of any flight simulator that allows you to build craft the way KSP does. That said... something more like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E would be great. Wing aspect ratio currently doesn\u0027t matter, straight vs swept wing doesn\u0027t matter. you can clip a bunch of wings into each other, and they all work equally well, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d guess a KSP 2.0 could do this better than the way \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E does it as a patch on top of the KSP system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, its quite possible to have something that is aerodynamically stable in two orientations... and woe to anyone who exceeds the limits of one, and ends up transitioning to another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA space plane to orbit? super easy with KSP\u0027s small size and the high performance of jet engines for that size. An STS style rocket, much harder due to asymmetry and shifting center of mass. That said... this is difficult because of physics concerns. KSP 2.0 isn\u0027t going to help. You\u0027ve already got the tools to do it in KSP, and many many people do it quite successfully. I\u0027d like a better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E though, that would help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s what the DLC is meant to address... but even so, there are practical limits. The game No Man\u0027s Sky basically ran headfirst into this problem. With no real storyline, players got bored pretty fast of just wandering around planet after planet... collecting stuff, fueling their ship, going to a new planet, collect stuff, refuel their ship, repeat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could add all the interation that NMS has, and it would still be the same issue. I like to set up modular and relocatable surface bases myself... but once built, there\u0027s nothing really to do with them. The DLC is going to allow me to use them as a home base (necessary as I play with life support, otherwise I could endlessly rove with Kerbals) to go searching for nearby terrain features, but its only ever going to be: land, plant flag, do science. People have commented over and over on this, but I have yet to see any suggestion better than what the DLC is doing (add science hotspots that you have to search for). More interesting small scale terrain detail seems like it would help, but NMS had that, and it seems players get equally bored (never played it, so...

However, based on your arguments, I think it could be better stated as KSP needs better multithreading/multicore support. If I understand correctly, DX12 allows more stuff to be offloaded to the GPU.
