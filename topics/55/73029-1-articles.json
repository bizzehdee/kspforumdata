I did not think about that... because there would be less fuel in the parts (presumably that you actually flew) you would receive less money back. because your craft would then be re-launched with full fuel, you would assume it would cost slightly more than what you recovered. That way it would make you do missions to get the money to get the fuel to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T11:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not clear that any reusability mechanic will be included in the stock economic model.
