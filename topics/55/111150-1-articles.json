Then I thought of a way to put it into career mode: have it as just flat land, maybe faintly darker/lighter than the rest of the ground, and have the new runway (for example) become unlocked and usable. \u003Cem\u003EThen\u003C/em\u003E I thought \u0022why shouldn\u0027t this apply to the whole space center?\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you basically have a big area of land that you can build new buildings on that cost money. The editors and launch pads would be cheapest, with mission control following shortly after. The money could be raised with the automatic \u0022world first\u0022 contracts...maybe.
