The KSP stock aero model wasn\u0027t made to simulate every aspect of real life aerodynamics. Just really enough to allow your average Joe to tell it\u0027s there when launching a spacecraft and launch a plane with. Of course it was pretty bad for a while, so it got upgraded in 1.0.0. It is of course still nowhere like real life (you still need FAR for that). KSP still doesn\u0027t model stalls reasonably, so why would we expect it to model the drag reduction of running engines?

KSP physics mean that nodes will produce drag, regardless of the engine thrusting or not, so the argument about adding nosecones is a bit arbitrary.

You say OP is effectively asking for an increase in thrust, but an increase in thrust would also affect the engine in vacuum, would it not? Drag changes depending on the makeup of the atmosphere and how thin it is at altitude, whilst thrust is a completely different animal.
