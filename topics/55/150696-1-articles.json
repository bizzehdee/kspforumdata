Or, at least Medieval II Total War \u003Cstrong\u003Emostly\u003C/strong\u003E does it this way:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost cutscenes are not played automatically, but a clickable box (like a letter) appears on the side of the screen. When its window is opened, it displays a message in text, as well as a little video snippet. Don\u0027t like the cutscene, just close the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP, this would be the \u0022milestone message\u0022 box. You open it and find the obligatory congratulations, as well as a short video. Those messages could be skipped, ignored, deleted or whatever, and the video stored for posterity at the appropriate facility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust as long as the cutscenes weren\u0027t shoved in our faces, I think most people would tolerate them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
