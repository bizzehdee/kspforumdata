But considering that stock already has this support if you own a 6-dof device, and the fact that joystick support is apparently going to be upgraded for 1.0;\n\nI got a dual-usb-gamepad-controller that I was gonna take-a-part and make a 6-dof-joystick to go with the two Thrustmaster T.1600 and one T.Flight Hotas X that I bought for Kerbal. But then I discover that one can not assign more than pan and tilt camera controls to a joystick-axis.\n\nPlease, when you upgrade the joystick support, let all camera directions/rotations and zoom be assignable to joystick-axes."}]}
