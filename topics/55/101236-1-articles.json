The F9 key would not function thereby giving the same level of difficulty as the current \u0027disable quicksave\u0027 option without the loss of protection against Kraken attacks."},{"CreatedByName":"GreenWolf","CreatedById":65798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T18:51:19Z","Content":"Yes. Yes, so much. It should have been implemented like this to begin with.

The game loads persistent save file even if it crashes."}]}
