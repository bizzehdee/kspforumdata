Instead of trying to launch a kerbin to space with few resources, let\u0027s put the things into a more realistic way. We could start with simple rockets launching simple things like artificial sat\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9lites and probes to, for example, improve communications on Kerbin or collecting data from the atmosphere. The collected data will improve Science giving us the possibility of using new devices or have data about Kerbin\u0027s climate and environment. Evolution must start from simple to complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKPB 14.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
