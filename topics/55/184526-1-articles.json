Maybe its the way I think but I find it much easier to plan my landings when I can see biomes in map view. We can already do this using the debug menu but the lighting is a little janky and it should really be an integrated part of career and science mode. I do like SCANsat, but for the stock game I think it could be okay if it just unlocks with the survey scanner or by some other method. Or maybe because we\u0027ll have more\u00A0timed experiments soon it should be like SCANsat?

On the one hand it fits in with the whole time-based experiment thing and shows players why you want to place a surveyor in a polar orbit, on the other it is more complicated and time-consuming and maybe the simple instant unlock like the resource scanner uses is more straight forward for stock.
