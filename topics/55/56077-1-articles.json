This is fine by me with crafts launched in a fairing, but not the moment I have, say, a light sticking out, messing with the \u0022airflow\u0022 around my rocket or spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest are parts that, in their undeployed state, are \u003Cstrong\u003Einside\u003C/strong\u003E the rocket (i.e. the fuel tank they\u0027re attached to), to give it a sleeker view. We already have examples of this in the deployable ladders and the new 88-88 dish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would not necessarily add new parts. It\u0027s very simple, really. The shielded solar panels, some lights, some landing legs or the linear RCS ports could stick to have more of them on the inside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T00:44:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIsn\u0027t this something which is better, and more realistically, solved with fairings?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SebLavK","CreatedById":77634,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-14T01:09:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIsn\u0027t this something which is better, and more realistically, solved with fairings?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is solved with fairings, in some cases. However, in an Apollo style rocket, for example, where you have the command pod at the top, and the service module right underneath, there\u0027s no need/way to put a fairing, and you need to add panels to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I didn\u0027t express myself in a clear way.
