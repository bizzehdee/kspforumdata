Well now that we have aero and fairings and resources and it seems a remote-techy kind of system is on the way, what are the top 5 features you\u0027re hoping to see in the next couple of updates? Big things? Little things? I know there will be some do-not-suggests in this thread, so we can be brief, mainly I\u0027m curious to see what people\u0027s priorities would be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me it would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) \u003Cstrong\u003ELife support\u003C/strong\u003E: I know a lot of people were talking about this some time ago and I think there were some really nice suggestions. Id personally like to see a single \u0022Life-support\u0022 resource that ticks down based on the number of kerbals on board, with a few things like scrubbers and greenhouses that could extend/regenerate it. There could also be a \u0022Happiness\u0022 resource that depletes if kerbals are locked in small spaces with very few other kerbals for long periods of time. As it depletes kerbals loose their experience abilities, and eventually the ability to go EVA. Happiness could be extended by bringing more kerbals, and also by adding habitation modules. I feel like this would be a huge step to feeling like we were doing real colonization, with built in game-play dynamics so that it wasn\u0027t just aesthetic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u003Cstrong\u003EMore compelling experiments\u003C/strong\u003E: This is a concern I know people have had for some time, that the current experiments basically amount to clicking on a thing. I\u0027ll be honest its one of the more tedious elements of the game. I think though with a few changes it could be made much more fun and challenging. Generally I think each experiment should have its own dynamic. For instance the barometer could pay out science based on how great a swath of atmosphere it passed through while activated, making it great for drop-pods. For the materials bay to work you should have to load it with actual materials, a few stock materials available at KSC, and potentially atmospheric and surface samples collected in the field. Harder to reach samples would have a higher multiplier, and more exotic locations of exposure would also have high multipliers, meaning you\u0027d have to work and cleverly manage things to get big payouts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u003Cstrong\u003EFlesh out the Experience system\u003C/strong\u003E: This is another big one. Right now its really skeletal. I know a lot of people have had fun ideas about different abilities for the different classes, mainly though Id like to have a clear idea through the game UI what is possible and what I have to do to achieve it so I can make smart choices about who to send where. Big ones Id like to see are TWR and Delta-V readouts from engineers, and Aerobreak and landing site projections from pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) \u003Cstrong\u003EMore interesting planetary surfaces\u003C/strong\u003E: Id really love to see things like geysers and volcanoes, ice crystals, interesting mineral formations, maybe even fossil beds? Mainly it would cool to have a real drive to make precise landings and do surface exploration that felt rewarding. Formations like these could hold both big science rewards and potentially indicate high resource locations. Mainly it would make the world feel more full, and add new reasons to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) \u003Cstrong\u003EA 2.5m Nerva\u003C/strong\u003E: And low-dry weight LF tanks. There\u0027s a thread about the latter, and I loved some of the spherical jobbies. For the engine I think it should basically have slightly higher ISP and slightly lower thrust to weight than the LV-N but it should weigh like 10t. Id love to see a 1.25m ion engine too but I wont be too greedy about it. Point of, when mounting really big interplanetary missions it would be great to simplify the transfer stage for the mothership. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean there are tons of things like clouds and non-lethal water and GP2 that would be great, but these are what Im most hoping for.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-26T04:15:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2015 04:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T23:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll yes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWAIT!!!!

It should be big, but it doesn\u0027t necessarily have to adhere to the same density as the LV-N. I tend to think many of these things would be tech-tree enders, and give completionists a big prize at the end that pointed toward building really cool offworld bases and stations.

I do agree though that there should be a way to exclude specific parts from loading, I would wonder what the interface for that would look like as I would assume it would just list all parts and let you pick which ones to disable, which could get very cumbersome for people who use a lot of part packs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would say the interface would be a text file. It doesn\u0027t have to be easier than editing the configs of a part.
