Unfortunetily, Squad hasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E siezed upon this ability. So you have all these part folders with a mishmash of patterns and paradigms and the results are a bit \u003Cem\u003Echaotic\u003C/em\u003E, albeit in a managed fashion. You\u0027ve got the starter engine hanging out right next to the (formerly) last conventional engine to be unlocked, you\u0027ve got a bunch of midrange engines scattered here and there, you\u0027ve got tanks that go from middle to small to GINORMOUS. And now with the release of the ARM you\u0027ve got a similar thing with another Squad-developed parts pack, except that because it\u0027s all in \\NASAmission\\ it\u0027s gonna\u0027 be scrunched all the way at the very top and front of the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts don\u0027t give a darn at all what the name of the folder they reside in is called, whether it\u0027s liquidEngine1 or ENG-1250-LFO-0215 or thisEndFacingDown1. So let\u0027s exploit that and do some spring cleaning both players and devs can appreciate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Integrate the \\NASAmission stuff into the main \\Squad\\ folder and file structure. Yes, I know it\u0027s a big deal and everything, but having it separated like that only causes discord and especially so if you have mods between the two folders further mixing things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Change part folder names to better reflect and sort their contents with a system of the main prefixes, suffixes and values that define the part. Contents of \\Engine, for example? You could go ENG-(size in cm)-(fuel type, eg \u003Cstrong\u003EL\u003C/strong\u003Eiquid\u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003C/strong\u003Euel\u003Cstrong\u003EO\u003C/strong\u003Exidizer or \u003Cstrong\u003EL\u003C/strong\u003Eiquid\u003Cstrong\u003EF\u003C/strong\u003Euel\u003Cstrong\u003EA\u003C/strong\u003Eir\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u003C/strong\u003Entake or \u003Cstrong\u003EE\u003C/strong\u003Electric\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003Eharge or \u003Cstrong\u003EE\u003C/strong\u003Electric\u003Cstrong\u003EC\u003C/strong\u003Eharge\u003Cstrong\u003EX\u003C/strong\u003Eenon)-(thrust). \\FuelTank? Use FUE-(size in cm)-(fuel type)-(total volume). \\Utility? You could get a bit more elaborate, like UTI-COM-1 for the basic antenna or UTI-DOC-1 for the Clamp-o-Tron JR or UTI-LEG-1 for the small landing leg. On and on throughout the folders until everything\u0027s nice and orderly in a fashion that people react to intuitively. You wouldn\u0027t even have to do changes to the internal part names in the .cfg files as most people aren\u0027t concerned with the internals, just the frontend. Between switching back and forth to get correct data and actually renaming the folders, the process could be done in about two hours, possibly even during a lunch break. And given part folders are self-contained and Squad part .cfgs never do cross-\\Parts referencing there\u0027s very little risk of anything actually being broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to see how well it works, I went and rigged \\Engine and \\FuelTank with such a scheme, and from a fileside standpoint it\u0027s a major improvement:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/R5pv7UW.jpg%5D\u0022 alt=\u0022R5pv7UW.jpg]\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ryd6Ur4.jpg%5D\u0022 alt=\u0022Ryd6Ur4.jpg]\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook at how informative and orderly those are! Well, except for the MK2-3 adapters, forgot those were actually fuel tanks. But from this I can tell exactly which part is which instead of remembering abstract folder name associations and it\u0027s all in a nice progressive order that\u0027s both functional and visually-pleasing. Though maybe it\u0027d be worth changing \\Engine to \\Propulsion\\ so they appear AFTER fuel tanks, which is even more logical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/4u3fSeU.jpg%5D\u0022 alt=\u00224u3fSeU.jpg]\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/twrYsF6.jpg%5D\u0022 alt=\u0022twrYsF6.jpg]\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ELook at it!

I\u0027ve got the small stuff early on and the heavy hitters later! I\u0027ve got things sorted by fuel type and whether they\u0027re in-line or radial! I now have a \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E better idea in my head as to where stuff is and can zip right to it instead of scanning through and picking it out amongst an unorderly crowd!

So please, usher in some much-needed order in the \\Parts\\ folder by spritzing up the sub-folder names. Not only will such have a nice cleaning and sorting effect in the base game, it\u0027ll make mod development from stock derivation easier and might inspire other modders to apply a similar system to their work, making those much easier to navigate as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varses","CreatedById":105101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T00:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually done this before myself--manually went through and renamed everything.

Personally, I think this is the wrong solution to the right problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA better solution, imho, would be to give each part several tags in their config file. For example, the Mainsail would get the 2.5m, LFO, and gimbal tags (perhaps others but those are just the ones off the top of my head). The idea being that you could add filters to your part window in the VAB. This would also make it much easier to integrate with mods--all the mod author would have to do is add a line to each config file listing all the tags. At least, that\u0027s my own personal vision for the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T00:58:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sort order is a bit of a mess, indeed.

Adding sorting tags to .cfgs would require not only the editing of the specific .cfgs in a fashion that goes beyond \u0022F2, PREFIX-SIZE-SUFFIX-VALUE, Return\u0022 but the development of a system inside KSP to read those tags and shuffle them around according to user inputs, the testing of said system, bugfixing of said system and fine-tuning of said system.
