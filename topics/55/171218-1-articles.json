I actually bought KSP a second time on the same PC so I can have the Steam Version of KSP, I also bought KSP a second time to support the Developers and everyone else involved in the Development of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I have a very minor suggestion for KSP. I think it would be nice to have a button in the \u0022Pause Menu\u0022 that Quits the game to the desktop. And when you press \u0022Quit to Desktop\u0022, it will ask you if you want to save the game before quitting. As of right now, to quit the game you must \u0022Pause\u0022 the game, Press \u0022Quit to Main Menu\u0022, then press \u0022Back\u0022, then press \u0022Quit\u0022. It just seems a lot faster to have a button in the pause menu that quits the game to desktop, instead of going through and pressing all of those buttons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts just an idea/suggestion. Either way, KSP is and always will be an epic game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Thank You,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGary TheTechGenius\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T10:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice to see this suggested again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still support this idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery time I play another game where it is easy to go back to the desktop it emphasises just how hard it is to do in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-22T14:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree this would be a nice feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the meantime, Alt-F4 on a PC works just fine for me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Onigato","CreatedById":153336,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-23T05:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fourth this motion, Quit to Desktop would be a lovely feature on the pause menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
