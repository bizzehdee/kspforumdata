Instead, each exchange could have a rate of return driven by a number of other factors. For example, Currency --\u0026gt; Science might produce more Science if there are better researchers and scientists working at the R\u0026amp;D branch. Reputation --\u0026gt; Currency may return an amount of Currency directly proportional to the amount of Reputation you currently have (the more popular you are, the more money you get). Maybe some Science patents are worth more money than others. Et Cetera...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience, Reputation, and Currency could all be generated in varying ratios by doing certain tasks.

They say \u0022budget\u0022. That is a subtle but important difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have currency in absolute amounts, like a bank balance. You spend something, it goes away. You earn something, you now have it. But budgets don\u0027t work that way. A budget is no absolute, overarching figure, but rather something that applies to a certain task or process individually - regardless of how often that task or process is executed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, a budget in KSP might manifest itself in the shape of a \u0022launch cost allowance\u0022 - in other words, you can launch as often as you want, but each individual launch cannot be more expensive than X. You need to fly your missions within the envelope of that sum. If you can, then that\u0027s fine, you can keep flying that way. But if you find that you just can\u0027t construct the spacecraft you need within the budget, then you must find ways to increase it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA budget is provided by an external source, such as a government. You don\u0027t own any of the money, it remains theirs. And you cannot earn any extra money (since that would be just a one-time sum, while the budget itself is completely unrelated and stays the same). Your budget increases when you deserve it - for example, when you successfully complete contracts, building confidence that you do not squander the funds entrusted to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, though, there would still be ways to increase the budget by using science and/or reputation, they\u0027d just be named slightly differently.

Your budget goes up, but your reputation goes down because there are now less favors owed to you, and asking for money never made anyone popular. Or, you could use your \u003Cstrong\u003Escience\u003C/strong\u003E pool to \u0022Educate\u0022 the public about how awesome space is and the awesome technologies you have researched. Your budget goes up because the now space-enthusiastic public demands that it be increased, but your science goes down because the people who would usually research new rocket parts are busy writing publications and giving TED talks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-08T12:09:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2014 12:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T20:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor example, a budget in KSP might manifest itself in the shape of a \u0022launch cost allowance\u0022 - in other words, you can launch as often as you want, but each individual launch cannot be more expensive than X.
