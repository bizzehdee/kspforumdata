To simplify things - the government gives a fixed amount of money to its space agency and the space agency then decides (ideally LOL) what can be accomplished with this. If the space agency wastes money on failed launches or worse - killing astronauts then it would be logical that the next year\u0027s amount would be lower. From the other hand, if this space agency achieves something and thus makes itself useful (by providing either economic or reputational benefits) the funding would most likely be increased the next year.
