Currently that\u0027s done via science gained either from contracts or taking science directly, which gives you some options since taking science requires you to go to different places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if instead each part type (ie. branch on the explosion tree) had a sort of progress bar toward the next step, and actually \u003Cem\u003Eusing\u003C/em\u003E that part type in a variety of conditions directly caused that progress bar to go up. Essentially the game would be keeping track of the location, duration, g-forces, etc. a mission is experiencing and the wider variety of conditions a part is exposed over a longer period of time, the more credit you get toward the next level. Have weak little landing legs and want beefy ones? Create test craft and land it with your current legs on the flat, on a mountain, on a beach, on the moon, land it harder and harder until you figure out when they break. Want bigger a bigger rocket motor? Launch 20 missions with the ones you have, launch light things and heavy things, stick it on a space plane prototype and test it that way. This would encourage even more diversity of missions, give the player many many play style options, but still give a sense of actually \u0022doing R\u0026amp;D\u0022 on the part types in question, working on branches directly rather than generally gathering a resource to buy steps with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still like the idea of initially unlocking the part with a test contract, which would work well with this.
