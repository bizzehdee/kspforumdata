One thing I\u0027m noticing that is different from before is that nearly all of these now require a minimum amount of liquid fuel and/or electric charge as part of the station requirements. When I first started to see these contracts, the liquid fuel requirement is 4000 units and the electric charge requirement is 5000 units. The problem is that I\u0027m early enough in the tech tree that this isn\u0027t really feasible. My largest fuel tank is only 760 units and the engines I have unlocked would probably not be sufficient to haul that much mass into orbit of another body, let alone LKO. Similarly I only have access to 200 EC batteries, so the idea of having 5000 units of EC seems a bit crazy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it might be a good idea to make a balance pass on these early contracts to make sure that the requirements are reasonable for when you receive them. I think something more like 1000 LF and EC would make more sense at the beginning and the 4000 values would be fine for later on once more of the tech tree is unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
