However, we don\u0027t have axial tilt in KSP(which we should have, by the way). What we do have is elliptical orbits, which can cause \u0022seasons\u0022 on planets that have enough eccentricity to their orbits in real life. (Pluto is theorized to have a seasonal methane atmosphere, depending on its distance from the sun.) So, Kerbin would not have seasons, but Moho very well could.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-12T19:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maximus97\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maximus97\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut seasons are caused by axial tilt, not distance.\u003Cp\u003EI do like the idea of \u0022night science\u0022, and agree that it\u0027d be a great reason to stay on a planetary body for a bit longer.
