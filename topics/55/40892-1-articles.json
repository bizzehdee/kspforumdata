KSP\u0027s only making use of one core for the physics (which is where the the bottleneck is) and so you want to make sure that your processor is running that core at the maximum frequency it can handle; if it isn\u0027t running the maximum frequency the whole time it\u0027s probably overheating a bit and you\u0027d be well served by getting in there with a can of compressed air and cleaning out any dust that\u0027s built up in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing to do is to make absolutely sure that KSP is using your dedicated GPU; since you have the integrated GPU on that CPU KSP might be trying to use that instead. Try right-clicking on the program and look under \u0022Run with graphics processor\u0022 and see which one is labelled as \u0022default.\u0022 If it isn\u0027t the GeForce, then you should be able to switch it permanently in the Nvidia 3d Settings, though you\u0027ll have to add KSP to the list of programs since it won\u0027t appear in there by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf both of those are the case, then you can set everything to max and try comparing the framerates between max graphics and min graphics using fraps or some similar utility. I suspect that they will be very similar, the only difference being the fps drop when looking at the ground due to the terrain rendering (which is still very unoptimized, particularly the ocean). If that\u0027s the case you should try going into the settings.cfg file and find the terrain sections labelled \u0022ocean\u0022 for each planet and set the subdivisions to much lower numbers than they are currently. They won\u0027t render properly at all with that, but the framerate will increase to something far more manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, make sure that Windows Aero is turned off and try setting KSP to have \u0022high\u0022 priority using the \u0022processes\u0022 tab of the Task Manager, which will help prevent any other programs you\u0027re running from getting in the way of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing to keep in mind is that the vast majority of games have a much higher load put on the GPU than the CPU; KSP is the other way around.
