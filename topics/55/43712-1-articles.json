This way we could also make an unmanned capsule for space stations to carry cargo just like Progress and also we would have less parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso there could be cargo modules that have a lot of empty space so we could determine what we are gonna fill it with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow\u0027s this idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T15:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 03:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by miracmert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T16:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETruth be told, we\u0027ll probably see cargo bays or something like them in the future. The B9 aerospace pack has a LOT of different cargo bays available and the creator of that mod was hired on by SQUAD a while back. We probably won\u0027t see those parts until we get a revamp to the spaceplane parts, though...which probably won\u0027t come \u0027till the aerodynamics update, whenever that happens. So...I don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut we\u0027ll hopefully see \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E kind of payload system in .22 even if it\u0027s just like a little compartment for deployable experiments on landers \u0027cause science is going to be really important in .22 and especially as career mode becomes more and more complete. A lot of people want to see all sorts of experiments and things you can drop on the ground(ploppable science, as I like to call it) like we did in real life on the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope we wind up with food, water and oxygen being part of a vanilla life support system, that way manned or unmanned resupply missions would become a necessity and just give you something else to do to fill out your game-time. I mean, resupply missions are very important to real life space programs, they should be a major consideration for us in KSP as well. At least, in career mode. Life support should be a toggleable option for sandbox mode \u0027cause...well, it\u0027s sandbox mode, there shouldn\u0027t be any inherent responsibilities or restrictions on what you can do!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
