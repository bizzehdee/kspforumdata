It will never be a simulation, imho hoping for the day when suddenly the curtain drops and a super realistic, orbiterlike ksp pro hardcore extreme realism comes into the light is a great recipe for false hopes, misdirected energy and frustration. A bit more \u0022realism\u0022 will find its way, but never on the scale of FAR or RSS.

Why should i have a problem with technologies, near or far (no pun intended) that get only integrated via mods anyway?

Feeling superior to other gamers that have fun with things like greenhouses, drilling karbonite or energytransfer through space? So yes, i enjoy potential technological advances that look like science fiction in the same way as todays space travel would look like for oberth and braun in the 1920s.
