In a MODULE node, add an UPGRADE node. Inside that add one node per techID you wish to provide upgrades, in ascending order. Inside that place keys and nodes you wish to upgrade. e.g. \u0060UPGRADES { basicRocketry { maxThrust = 250 } }\u0060 will change maxThrust to 250 once basicRocketry unlocks. Upgrades will never override persistent data. Further, by default they overwrite each other; to make a node apply on a clean slate (so you can, say, add two PROPELLANT nodes and not have them conflict due to the overwrite logic) set \u0060IsExclusiveUpgrade__ = True\u0060 in the upgrade\u0027s node. That will clear the upgrade state and apply that upgrade fresh. Upgrades are applied only when you add a part to a craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, they don\u0027t magically apply in flight.

This would also make developing and testing such upgrades easier and, if also available in career mode would give players the option to to NOT use an already unlocked upgrade, for example for cheaply launching a smaller payload where you don\u0027t need the upgraded parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tr1gg3r","CreatedById":161427,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T10:05:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty sure theres a setting for upgraded parts in sandbox mode, in the main settings options.....
