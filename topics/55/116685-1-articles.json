It would be pretty lame if every time you crashed the game would halt for a couple of seconds to dig a little hole. Plus, the terrain resolution is far too low to do them like that. \n\u003E \n\u003E I think a better solution there would be to do crater objects that we place, like bullet holes in shooting games. But that\u0027s another feature for another day. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nIt has been two years.
