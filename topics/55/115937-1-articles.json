Jeb is always a pilot, Bill is always an engineer, etc. That consistency is probably in-line with why they choose consistent planets rather than random planets between saves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, I don\u0027t see names and profession being correlated as being a mutually exclusive issue. If you get unbalanced specialization in a batch of applicants, the game could just re-roll names until it is balanced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ll point out something that I just noticed: If you wait long enough (several days) eventually applicants roll off the list and get replaced by new ones. It can take a while though, so it wasn\u0027t immediately obvious to me that was an option. So this suggestion is probably less important than I originally thought, less of a \u0022problem\u0022 and more of an issue of convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
