For example, when you\u0027re on Kerbin\u0027s ice caps, your friction should be way less than on its grasslands. This could prove fun for some ice-skid designs. Maybe this will make rough terrain really feel rough, or allow for some out-of-control drifting on the minmus flats with the new wheel physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t imagine this to be hard for the devs to do, but I\u0027m not a modder, so please correct me if I\u0027m wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what are your opinions on this matter?
