At most more types of vegetation!\n\nI wasn\u0027t even suggesting aliens - just some form of Kerbal civilization. Not that I would be opposed to other intelligent species, though. Kerbin just seems so empty, and when you consider how much civilization it takes to support a space program, it seems even more incongruous."},{"CreatedByName":"Vorg","CreatedById":74652,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T19:37:55Z","Content":"They live underground...."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:10:07Z","Content":"I think this falls under too much cost for too little benefit.

Maybe give some locations to visit, just something to see from the sky when flying overhead. I mean, I follow the ideology that Kerbals are descended from plants, so it makes sense that a species that can photosynthesize should live aboveground."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:21:53Z","Content":"Something I suggested in another thread is that tourists and VIPs could have optional objectives added to their contracts, giving extra rewards if you deliver them to a particular Kerbal city and not just recovering them in any old place. This would give the player an incentive to make precision landings on tourist flights, even if the cost of the capsule isn\u0027t big enough to warrant the effort."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:25:28Z","Content":"They are an underground dwelling sentient mold (that\u0027s why they \\*poof\\* when they hit the ground too hard).\n\nI also used to think they all followed the will of their giant slug-like queen, who lives in an underground cathedral worshiping the distant planets.

Interesting!\n\nBut that just begs the question... Why is there no debris when you start a new game... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif) It must be towards the start of the Kerbals going into space for the first time because they start with scavenged junk parts!

Some were found \u0022lying beside the road!\u0022 Aha!"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T23:04:06Z","Content":"If there would be cities added I would like to see low-poly buildings, just to save RAM and FPS.
