Works like charm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need to play fullscreen, you may try the \u0022-nopopupwindow\u0022 option, i.e. borderless windowed with resolution set to your desktop. But you will need to hop between game and the rest anyway, you can only have one window on top.

Alt-tab surely?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I find myself checking the wiki a lot more than the forum. Tons of data on there. Besides, a lot of the other tools you need (transfer window calculators, etc) are hosted on other sites, so you\u0027re always going to be switching back and forth between KSP and the browser.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T10:09:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have it on Steam you can open the overlay web browser and do it that way. If not, have you got a phone or tablet or laptop or a similar device. Just have it in front of you and when you want to read just go on the forums on your device. This way you can watch KSP and read the forums at the same time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MircoMars","CreatedById":61811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T18:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm, in-game support of forum challenges (visible as kind of contract) could be interesting...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T18:29:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike previously mentioned, with Steam you can use the overlay (which you can use even if you don\u0027t own the game through steam, you just have to add it to your games list as a non-steam game). But mostly I just have chrome open in another window on my second monitor (but I still play full screen, so it effectively alt-tabs away). Also, if you press shift\u002Benter you can switch between fullscreen and windowed mode. Great for doing other things while loading the game (start in fullscreen, shift\u002Benter to make it windowed, it continues loading in the background)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
