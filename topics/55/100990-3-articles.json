I won\u0027t try to categorizes these into the current categories, this is just brainstorming.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1. Advanced areodynamics - vessels have slightly less drag.\n\u003E 2. More efficient engines - engines have a slightly higher ISP.\n\u003E 3. Bigger engines - engines have slightly higher thrust.\n\u003E 4. Bigger panels - panels produce more power.\n\u003E 5. Better panels - panels lose efficiency due to distance from the Sun slower.\n\u003E 6. Better recruiting - Recruits start with some experience.\n\u003E 7. Apprenticeship - Kerbals gain experience faster when on the same vessel as a 5 star of the same profession.\n\u003E 8. Advanced Rovers - Rovers drive as if they were 2x heavier.\n\u003E 9. Nuclear non-proliferation treaty - No LVNs allowed. Receive more rep.\n\u003E 10. Girl Power - Receive more rep for missions done with all female crews\n\u003E 11. Closed borders - Cannot recover vessels that are more than 10km from KSC. Receive more funds in compensation.\n\u003E 12. Low tech - Science is locked at zero. Contract funds increased by x% for each unlocked tech node.\n\u003E 13. Megastructures - Receive funds for stations in orbit over a certain tonnage. (Funds over time, perhaps - if time mattered)\n\u003E 14. Killer asteroids - Increased funding. Increased asteroid detection. Player receives contracts to divert killer asteroids. Failing to divert them results in game over!

Strategies can be switched, but cost will vary. Within, many sub-strategies/tactics/background will look like nightingale\u0027s post ideas.\n\n***Real*** **Strategies:**\n\n**1. KASA**. Your program is an analog of a national space program. The program gets to pick X missions/contracts per year based upon Rep. The missions will be broad, multi-part affairs like \u0022explore the Mun\u0022 with enough parts that they will keep you busy. X will be small, and upgrade sort of like it does now. The Missions will have most cash up front, but large penalties for failure in terms of rep. Rep will actually determine budget, basically, so loss of rep will hurt next year\u0027s operations. Possible Mission goals might include a \u0022beat the competing program to X\u0022 race like goal that is time critical. Very, very costly to switch to another strategy, and very unlike to switch TO this strategy from another unless your rep is stellar.\n\n**2. Commercial Launch Provider.** You are a commercial outfit. A substantially lower annual budget than #1. You will have mostly Contracts, and maybe some Missions based upon infrastructure goals to facilitate future business. Easy to switch strategies to or from.\n\n**3. Commercial Development of Space.** Another commercial company, a kind of SpaceX analog. A substantially lower annual budget than #1. They will do commercial contracts (launch, resupply, etc), but have an ultimate goal of exploitation/colonization of the solar system. They will have the usual Contracts, plus some tailored Missions related to their own goals (science and rep gain, little in the way of funding).

State sponsored space program vs space for profit.\n\nIf you break it into more specific goals, then there are almost infinite possibilities. Here are a few that are based on historical exploration programs.\n\n**The EITC model**\n\nThis is setting your program to trade with a specific region or for a specific resource. For example, the Duna Trading Company picks up fuel mined from Duna and returns it to Kerbin.\n\n**The Virginia Company model**This program would focus on colonizing a specific region and generating resources to be sold. A Laythe colony would be a prime example of this. A colony on Laythe is set up that makes fuel then sells it to ships visiting the Joolian system.\n\n**The Spanish/Portugese model**\n\nThis program is a space race, with a goal. The program needs to be the first to set up a trade route to a location so that they can force exclusive trading rights with the destination.\n\n**The piracy and smuggler model**\n\nThis strategy focuses on breaking into trading monopolies. After a company has succeeded with the Spanish model, then a company using the piracy model would do clandestine contacts with the target location. Rendezvouses on the dark side of a moon, intercept to landing with out entering orbit, launch to escape, intercept trade ships, etc.\n\nAs you may have noticed by now, most of these strategies require some opponent or at least an NPC space program."},{"CreatedByName":"SorryDave","CreatedById":119474,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T17:43:00Z","Content":"Just brainstorming...\n\nI think the strategies would make more sense if the game had victory conditions.\n\nVictory conditions could be:\n\n Achieve 75,000 science points\n\n Accumulate 20M funds\n\n Reach highest reputation\n\nIf someone uses strategy it should be towards a victory condition and more than one should be obtainable.\n\n Unlocking the tech tree should not be a victory condition, I think a lot of players feel it is the goal of career mode."},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T18:05:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Just brainstorming...\n\u003E I think the strategies would make more sense if the game had victory conditions.\n\u003E \n\u003E Victory conditions could be:\n\u003E \n\u003E  Achieve 75,000 science points\n\u003E \n\u003E  Accumulate 20M funds\n\u003E \n\u003E  Reach highest reputation\n\u003E \n\u003E If someone uses strategy it should be towards a victory condition and more than one should be obtainable.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Unlocking the tech tree should not be a victory condition, I think a lot of players feel it is the goal of career mode.\n\nCareer mode would certainly make more sense with victory conditions, but I don\u0027t like the ones you\u0027ve mentioned because they seem like they would be boring and/or grindy and/or subject to just getting exploited even worse than what we have now. Since Squad has stated that career mode was supposed to be \u0022like a tycoon game\u0022, I\u0027ll draw comparisons from there.\n\nThe first thing that would really open up victory conditions would be a rivals/opponents. You could then have pre-built scenarios or overall goals for beating your rivals to typical space-race goals. Of course, I\u0027ve never heard anything mentioned about AI opponents, and we\u0027re nearing feature complete, so safe to assume this is off the table and put it in the \u0022dare to dream\u0022 bucket.\n\nYou could accomplish the same thing by just setting a target date - you need to land a kerbal on the Mun by date X (or could have bronze, silver and gold for dates X/Y/Z). Now all of a sudden time matters. Bring in KCT-like behaviour and now the player starts having to make harder decisions... do I spend a week building a rocket for part testing to increase my cash flow so I can build a bigger rocket to get to the Mun? Or just launch a minimal one that doesn\u0027t include x and try to make it as is? Then the existing strategies have potential for meaning too when there\u0027s a time limit.\n\nHonestly, you can almost get this just by having steam achievements to the same effect... although I understand why they don\u0027t since you pretty much have to limit to no mods to make the steam achievements meaningful.\n\nAnother thing I think would be neat for career would be allowing the player to pick their start site. Current KSP could be \u0022easy\u0022 mode and there could be \u0022harder\u0022 launch sites with higher latitudes. But I\u0027m getting way off topic for this discussion.\n\nBack on topic - victory conditions make so much sense, and would potentially completely change the dynamic of contracts/strategies."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T18:19:18Z","Content":"Regarding a \u0022Space Race,\u0022 there is a way to do it without AI.

They would be tagged by preset difficulty level.\n\nWhen you play, it will pick from those other players at the same diff level, chose ONE, and their milestones will represent the competition. So you are playing against other KSP players anonymously.\n\nIdeally, there would be a competing center, and you\u0027d play against people choosing that other center, in a \u0022dream\u0022 version, there would be stock-alike soviet stuff for that center."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T20:18:35Z","Content":"As others have noted, parts contracts seem off. Also, it\u0027s incredibly easy to unlock large portions of the tree with ugly speed. Here\u0027s how I would approach it:\n\n1) Parts test contracts no longer simply spawn at random. They are keyed to the node unlock. On node unlock, a Development Time value is randomly assigned for each part. This could be days, months, or years. Science and Funds can be \u0022donated\u0022 to reduce this.\n\n2) Once Development Time passes, a test contract is spawned, and a similar Release Time value is randomly assigned.\n\n3) On contract acceptance, one (1) instance of the test part is made available to you. No spamming of 48-7S before you unlock it!\n\n4) On successful test, the remaining Release Time is halved. It\u0027s now in your best interest to do these tests.\n\n5) Once Release Time has passed, the part is available for purchase. If you completed the test, the part will be discounted as described in the test contract. So you can ignore bad part contracts and let them do the development themselves, but you\u0027ll have to wait longer and it will cost more in the long run.\n\n6) All parts in a node must be Released to advance to the next node along the branch.\n\nThis post is just about the concept of parts contracts.

Test a part, the cost goes down. Each part has 3 tests. In atmo, in space, and landed on a planet. Either:\n\n1.

How is that possibly worse than time warping, exactly? I should load up stock, and just mess with this a little using stuff I already have in orbit/landed various places in a save.

You have a big target that you can choose (eg. \u0022Put a kerbal on the mun\u0022) which comes with a group of related sub-objectives (eg. return a kerbal safetly to Kerbin from a mun intercept) through which you can develop and test multiple parts of the mission (ie. can my return vessel survive reentry coming in from a lunar orbit). Wrap several contract types together with objective related goals and create a reason to be doing things like testing an lv-909 in lunar orbit (because you things always hit the fan the first time you try something)\n\n**Objective:** Put a kerbal on the munar surface and return it to Kerbin safetly\n\n**Suggested sub-objectives:**\n\n- Dock two vessels while in orbit around Kerbin\n- Perform a lunar intercept and return to Kerbin\u0027s surface in one piece\n- Put a comsat/surveyor in lunar orbit\n- Land a probe on lunar surface\n- Assorted related parts testing (eg. lv-909 in lunar orbit.

Unfortunately, there is no perfect answer here. Players exhaust content faster than it can be created. It can only be made \u0022less grindy,\u0022 and I think we have to try. Complaints are inevitable (but not \u0022the end\u0022) and some players are already hacking their configs to nuke undesired contract types. \nSquad could spend months on an update, we could get 4 new contract types that have diverse, interesting tasks and write nice compliments on the forums, only to be grumbling in the next week that we have played until dawn over the weekend, done 15 orbital rendezvous for different purposes, and are bored again. I think this is one reason they went with procedural contracts in the first place, because a story driven campaign (as much as I would like to have one!) is over when its over, limits some of the replay value, and if you liked it, you\u0027re crying for more to do. \n\n###\n\nClaw, I was expecting you to throw some cold water on this brainstorming, because we\u0027ve pretty much reinvented how Strategies might work in the last 3 pages - your initial charter was asking us to look for what tweaks to existing Strategies - and Contracts that would fit inside the current Contract system - would be helpful. \n\nTo that end, Outsourced R\u0026D popped up for most people as overpowered, although science availability is \u0022overpowered\u0022 as well. I think Wanderfound summarized the problem with existing Strategies effectively, in post #47: \n\n\u003E \n\u003E As well as the money -\u003E science strategy being overpowered, the anything -\u003E money strategies are underpowered. They\u0027re all off by about a factor of ten.\n\nToward existing contracts, I think many are wanting more sensible structures to them, where one builds upon another: if you\u0027ve completed a temp scan from altitude, you might later be asked to do something on the ground in the same area. Don\u0027t randomly ask for a ground activity before an aerial one. Parts tests should progress the same way, and not repeat, and probably disappear entirely once you go to another planet\u0027s SoI, since its entry-level work.

In the real world a company hires another company to do something that the second party is better at and progresses the first party towards its business goals. In KSP a company hires the player\u0027s space agency to do random pointless busy work.\n\nGiving the (npc/notional) agencies business goals that determine the types of contracts they offer would help. An over-arching strategy that defines the player\u0027s goals (ie complete the grand tour, colonize the Joolian moons) chosen when the game is started would give the possibility of contracts being offered if they support the player\u0027s grand design. For example, if the player wants to colonize Duna then contracts to establish outposts on or stations around Mun and Minmus would not be offered.\n\nWith my career mode game, I hate repeatedly doing 7 \u0022test landed\u0022 contracts with one vessel because it isn\u0027t testing anything (I don\u0027t even include fuel tanks) and it isn\u0027t setting up infrastructure to make future missions easier (ie LKO refuel station). The only reason I do them is because I can\u0027t afford to do what I want with out doing mind-numbing click-fests on hundreds of ships designed to do nothing but hold 7 random parts together."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T00:48:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E However, something that I\u0027m still falling back and forth on in the conversations is the idea of \u0022grindy\u0022 and \u0022contract farming.\u0022\n\nProbably has a lot to do with just how much money is required in 0.90 to get anywhere. You run into the science cap very quickly, but you need something like 2-3 million funds to upgrade all the KSC structures just once.

I just played a RSS 3.2x career with KCT, life support, etc and have unlocked everything (including some mod parts past the stock tree).

Most of a space program\u0027s time isn\u0027t spent flying maneuvers - it\u0027s analyzing data, planning missions, astronaut training, developing RFQ\u0027s, testing equipment. Most of this isn\u0027t supposed to be simulated in-game, and players SHOULD be time-warping through it.\n\nBut you\u0027re right, there should be some incentive to keeping your hands full while you wait for transfers to complete or parts to be developed or ships to be built.\n\nOne thing that partially exists already is missed opportunities. During long timewarps you risk missing launch and tranfer windows, just due to the nature of the simulation. Not a huge loss, but it\u0027s there.\n\nAnother possibility of missed opportunities is for reputation to degrade if you\u0027re \u0022doing nothing.\u0022 Routinely ignoring contract requests could make Agencies less willing to give you good ones. This would work better if there were a competing space program to compete for the work. I know this is exactly the opposite of what some others like regex want, but it is a source of challenge to balance your program\u0027s *wants* against its *needs.*\n\nAnother possibility is overhead costs. You\u0027ve got mortgage (and taxes, maybe? How government are we?), the gas and electric needs paid, and your employees sure want to buy Snacks for their families.
