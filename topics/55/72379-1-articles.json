That\u0027s low end. Yet, I\u0027m still playing the game, and I really like it. However, I do get frame rate drops more often than not, especially on the ground and when re-entering the atmosphere, so I\u0027m asking about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 is soon to be released, if it hasn\u0027t been already. Part of the big \u0022Unity 5\u0022 update is a new Multi-Threaded job system. Are you planning to incorporate this into KSP? If you did, I believe the game would be much lower in system requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, I love this game. Even though I haven\u0027t made it out of the atmosphere once (giant boosters on a tiny plane are just too tempting), I really have a lot of fun with it. At this point, I think it would do fine if it were released today as a full game rather than early access, and the fact that you have refused to call it a full game at this point just makes me think that something huge is coming up next for the game.
