However, the integral gain must be set to zero (a PD controller), because the system simply does not respond to steady-state error. \u00A0You can see this yourself with any spacecraft where the thrust vector doesn\u0027t intersect the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Setting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and engaging the engines causes the craft to slew. \u00A0The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E will stop the slew after a few degrees (depending on the strength of your control schema), but it doesnt even try to get the heading back to the original state, even if the control axes are not pegged. \u00A0It seems like the directional holds are slightly better at countering error but this may be blind optimism. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any insight into why this may be it would be greatly appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-02T10:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that the one-size-fits-all solution is a bit unpractical for some. However once Squad would give in to requests for custom \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E setups I think they could start a separate section on the forum. There are multiple mods that allow you to adjust the PID settings yourself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I\u0027ve discovered with the newest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is that it all depends on how you build a craft i.e. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and lift/drag. Too much control authority doesn\u0027t help either. In my case it\u0027s a bit different, my engines produce vibrations which often confuse the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
