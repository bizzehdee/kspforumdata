Because the stock staging controller doesn\u0027t really allow a part to be \u0022unstaged\u0022, and thus it can\u0027t be staged again. The staging controller is old and deprecated and they really need to burn it down because there\u0027s no salvaging it. There needs a new one from bottoms up.\n\nThis is also why RealChute doesn\u0027t use the stock staging controller. You know it\u0027s bad when catching the \u0022launch stage\u0022 keypress is better than listening to what the stock staging controller is telling you.\n\nSo another feature that would appear if Squad fixed their bugs, yay."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T16:10:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There needs a new one from bottoms up.\n\nMore like from the BUTTONS up, amitire?

Obviously this has some drawbacks (clunky, only one at a time, etc), but it\u0027s a band-aid solution and pretty much how I do Duna missions in a normal stock game (assuming the save lives long enough to go to Duna and doesn\u0027t drown in 40,000 science points before reaching orbit).\n\nI\u0027d definitely support being able to re-stage chutes. I\u0027d also love to see some of the (other) RealChute features make it into stock (like gentle deployment, selectable kinds, de/activation settings, etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T23:06:56Z","Content":"Last time I tried it worked for me, you just need to drag the chute manually into a new stage (use \u002B button).

(RealChutes may mod this.)\n\nI\u0027ve am aware that you can deploy parachutes using Action Groups and activate them after repacking as many times as you repack them but, in career mode action groups are limited to none, basic, and full for each of the three VAB upgrade levels, respectively. Yet parachutes are a 0 level technology and require level 1 engineers to repack. So maybe this is a broken feature that was intended but (AFAIK) has never worked.\n\nThis is further complicated by the fact that the icons for parachutes gets reset after a repack and reload of a vessel. The icons are (IIRC):\n\nWhite - packed ready for staging\n\nCyan - staged but not deployed\n\nYellow - semi-deployed\n\nGreen - deployed\n\nRed - unpacked\n\nIf you repack a unpacked parachute, red icon, it turns into a green icon, deployed, but it is in fact packed ready for staging. However if you\u0027ve returned to the KSC and go back to the vessel you\u0027ll find that you have a white icon (which is correct) but if you move it to a new or un-staged stage you cannot deploy it using staging. (@Devs fix this pretty please.)\n\nI have had another thought on this after reading the previous posts: When you accept a contract to test an engine under specific conditions if you miss the conditions can\u0027t re-stage the engine activation after manual deactivation (or action group shutdown) and then perform the staging test -- you either have to revert the flight to launch and try again or launch another attempt.\n\nSo in summary staging need a overhaul SQUAD ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
