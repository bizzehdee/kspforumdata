You can (in game) have them roaring full blast with an object directly in front of them and nothing will happen. Meanwhile you can easily find a video from the USS Theodore Roosevelt on which an A-6 intruder sucked in a man working on deck. Luckily for him his helmet and his own blockage of the airflow into the engine saved him among other things. Many other incidents can be found in which things ranging in size from bolts to baggage cars were pulled into engine intakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImho the intake side of engines should be just as dangerous as the exhaust.
