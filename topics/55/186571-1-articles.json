GLaDOS and the rover sometimes end up headbutting the terrain if I drive them too fast and the mech can\u0027t support itself and ends up doing the splits on the floor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve never used infernal robotics, but from the stability of some of the craft built using it, it appears people have a better time controlling craft that use the IR joints, while craft that use the official joints are floppier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-21T15:08:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2019 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Bej Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
