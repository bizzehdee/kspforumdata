But from what I\u0027ve seen the changes that have been proposed right now are still pretty unintuitive. Transmission logic is \u0022being redone\u0022, mystery goo will behave differently and very strangely - I can\u0027t find the post about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have a much simpler, more intuitive system that still addresses allof the concerns with 0.22 mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Every science generating activity grants 100% of its science value. There is no such thing as transmission loss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) No diminishing returns. No experiment can be repeated. If you attempt to perform the same experiment you\u0027ve done before, the game should simply say \u0022you already have this data\u0022 (or show the data but also show this message).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Samples contain two experiments: the sample itself, and data about the sample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3a) Samples themselves must be returned, no transmission is possible for samples. This is a high value science objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 3b) Sample data is granted on return OR by processing the sample at the new lab module. This is a medium value science objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Any non-sample experiment (crew reports, EVA reports, temperature, pressure, etc) can be transmitted or returned for 100% value. No transmission loss. This is a low value science objective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Mystery goo counts as a sample that you take with you, not data (and so must be returned for the sample value, and/or processed at a lab for the sample data value). Each container can only be used once ever. If you already have that particular data you should be informed of this and not perform the experiment (so as to not waste the container).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this seems to make a lot more sense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it\u0027s not at all intuitive that things which are pure data (like temperature readings) would have diminished value when transmitted, and it\u0027s also not clear why any data for samples is returned via transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that each experiment only grants science points once ever, with the complete removal of diminishing returns, removes any kind of tedious grinding from the game. Yes, I know repeating experiments is important in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh value science objectives are the most difficult (requires sample return).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMedium value science is somewhat difficult (requires that you return or carry a lab with you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELow value science is easy (only requires having enough energy available to transmit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only hesitation I have with this system is that only being able to perform any experiment one time (or at least, only getting science points one time) might be seen as making career mode \u0022end\u0022 too soon. But I don\u0027t think this is actually the case. With the addition of more biomes there should still be easily enough experiments available to keep people busy without forcing them to redo previous experiments. I\u0027m sure more experiments will also be coming along, like atmospheric samples, more data experiments, etc. And I\u0027m sure there\u0027s much more to be added to the overall career mechanics outside of science collection as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-19T08:42:34Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2013 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T10:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have already proposed similar thing in the past, with the following differences:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- each experiment has \u0022transmission\u0022 and \u0022delivery\u0022 science value.

I think squad is going in at least of few of the directions I mention here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince there are various different flavor texts for doing experiments in the same area, it\u0027s implied that you\u0027ll do it a few times (and should still be fun). This favors the diminishing returns strategy by rewarding you big time for the first successful mission and slowly discouraging repeats. For return-to-Kerbin missions, I have found no problem with the system as it is. You get full value, and it only takes a handful of missions (or duplicate science parts on the same mission) to collect everything from an area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems with the system come from the transmission mechanics. There are 2 main problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Transmission loss results in players repeating experiments in the same area many more times than is fun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A power generating craft can do science infinitely and obsoletes return-to-Kerbin strategies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time sink involved with transmitted experiments is annoying. It forces you to repeat the same experiment, read the same flavor text, and sit through transmission/recharge cycles many times. Even if you split this up over multiple flights (which you don\u0027t need to, which I\u0027ll cover next), you will still run some experiments 20\u002B times to collect all science possible. Simply giving maximum value per experiment would reduce the amount of time seeing the same science report and would be simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower generating craft are capable of draining all science from multiple areas during a single mission while reusing a single science part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis completely obsoletes the return-to-kerbin method of science collection which requires multiple science parts to carry experiment results and must make a return trip to Kerbin after collecting. A limit to the number of experiments that can be run per part would encourage the planning of multiple missions and/or require craft to be designed to carry additional science instruments in order to do more (the same as a return-to-Kerbin mission, but still with more capability to repeat experiments and without needing the return). To increase the usefullness of return-to-Kerbin missions to match the flexibility of transmission-based missions, some experiments should only be rewarded for recovery. This could be extended by the late game Kerballed lab module which might take over the recovery of data. This way, big rewards would remain for the more difficult return missions or those involving heavy space station or surface labs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Keep diminishing returns (We like some repeats and multiple flavor text per area)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drop transmission loss (We don\u0027t like 20 repeats per experiment per area)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-limit # experiments per science part (Make 1-shot missions to collect all science from one or more areas challenging)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Differentiate between transmission-capable and lab-processed experiments (Maintain a use for return trips or heavy, Kerballed Lab-modules)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Queeg","CreatedById":92659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T22:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too would like to see a more intuitive solution, rather than a \u0022gamey\u0022 one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiminishing returns seem to be solving a gaming problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransmission quotas... same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus both add complexity that just ends up being confusing to new players (or a least confused THIS new player).
