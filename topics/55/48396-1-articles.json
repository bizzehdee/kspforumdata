I then sent up the next module, only to find after an hour or so of meticulously manouvering to get the module in position to be docked, that there was no docking port for it to attach to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to pretty much just destroy both ships and start again from launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only would this feature remove a frustration, it would add an exciting element of gameplay. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo have a kerbal attach a part, you would have to build a special rocket for the job. A part, called the storage container (Or something like that), would have the ability to assign parts to \u0022store\u0022 in it. ot just any part could be stored, only radial attachment type of things. AKA, no structural components or fuel tanks. (MAYBE engines, but that is pushing it. Probably not)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when you put your kerbal on EVA, you could click the storage container and get the kerbal to hold the part you want, then, similar to KAS, you could place it by showing a half transparent image of what the part will look like on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forwards to your opinions, and suggestions \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T22:14:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI strongly suggest you check out the Kerbal Attachment System (KAS) add-on by KospY / Majiir - the latest version comes with containers for storing actual parts, as well as the ability to attach/remove them while on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAquired","CreatedById":83672,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T07:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow!
