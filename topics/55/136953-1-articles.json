At that altitude and speed, your control surfaces become more and more useless and you need to rely on reaction wheels for control. You can\u0027t deploy solar panels at that point (only OX-STATs which cause a lot of drag and can heatsplode) so you\u0027re stuck with either heavy batteries and RTGs or fuel cells. Once in space, you can deploy solar panels to your heart\u0027s content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue becomes most apparent when keeping SAS on since SAS positively\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eguzzles\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0electrical power from the torque wheels, and there is no way to limit the amount of action SAS has on the craft. In most of my flights, my batteries run out halfway on the way up because SAS drained everything even though it only has to do a small amount of control to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can offset that with RCS, but that means squandering a lot of Monopropellant. The over-zealous SAS action is what causes the large EC consumption in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T22:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever had a problem with SSTOs running out of power during ascent.\u00A0 The one I use most often \u2014 a 49-ton, 6-person Mk2 plane with four RAPIERs and an LV-N \u2014 has 1400 EC total, and the lowest it gets during flight is about 1350, just before I turn on the LV-N at 20km.\u00A0 How many reaction wheels are you using?\u00A0 I just have one, in a cargo bay near the middle of the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darth Lazarus","CreatedById":60937,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T01:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif i discover, that i need more EC and the engines are not generating EC ... then i add batteries, RTG\u0027s or solarpanels to my design.
