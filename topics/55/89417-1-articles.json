I\u0027ve done my best to adapt to it and figure out how to do things in spite of the different camera angles making them more difficult. Unfortunately these efforts have been failing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the view I\u0027m accustomed to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ptQbxAW.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ptQbxAW.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the view that we have now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OfEwGvJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022OfEwGvJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the camera angle is off at an angle I now find it much more difficult to get parts aligned the way I need them to be. I\u0027ve also found it to be much more difficult to get things like struts placed anywhere close to as straight as they have to be to prevent inducing unwanted roll in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to say that as much as I\u0027ve tried I cannot understand the reason why this change was made. Is it supposed to be more \u0022artistic\u0022 or something? I personally would rather it was simply functional like it was before and leave artistic views for the player to arrange in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked but have not found any setting in the .cfg file that makes it possible to change back to the old straight on camera angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan we PLEASE have such an option?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T20:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m confused.

Only the initial orientation and position of the camera has changed as far as I know.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the really frustrating part of this change is that rotating the camera doesn\u0027t help nearly as much as it should. It seems like the camera is locked on a point just to one side of the actual center of mass of the vehicle under construction. It always looks crooked or tilted one way or the other and I have a really hard time making sure that parts are aligned the way I need them to be. Placing struts for example, has become almost a nightmare trying to get them straight where it used to be the simplest thing in the world to do. The old camera orientation was much better\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T22:36:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t reproduce your issue. If I place a tank as the first part and don\u0027t move it, the camera rotates around the vertical axis of the tank so it seems to me that it is centered on the CoM of the vessel. Using the scrollwheel or Home/End moves up or down that axis and the arrow keys rotate the camera, so I can reproduce the old orientation exactly. I can\u0027t move the camera until that first part is placed, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suspect may be happening is that the root part goes off center when moving it up to build more stages below. In that case, the camera continues to rotate around the initial axis which is no longer centered on the vessel. Does that sound plausible or do you have the same issue when placing just a single tank as the first part and not moving it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an aside, I think the change was made when the starting orientation of craft was rotated by 90 degrees to match up with the visible launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
