This hexagon, slightly thicker than the fuel duct, would be selectable when entering the Actions menu, and could be set with action groups of \u0022transfer out\u0022 or \u0022transfer in\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-17T22:43:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2016 10:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Gromitrix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
