So, I\u0027m not a computer hardware expert, but according to [this article](http://m.imore.com/metal-os-x-so-huge-i-no-longer-need-mac-pro), this bypasses the super-slow OpenGL framework, and basically makes stuff run way better. Unity (as well as every other major game engine, including 2K and Blizzard\u0027s in-house engines) will support Metal. What I\u0027m interested in is a) is this integration automatic, or does SQUAD need to spend time on it? ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) What performance increase do you guys think this would give, if any? and c) If this requires SQUAD to spend time on it, should they devote dev time, or is the OSX crowd just a too small segment of the player base?\n\nDiscuss."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:58:28Z","Content":"Interesting Blog post from Unity when Metal was announced for iOS.\n\n[http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/03/metal-a-new-graphics-api-for-ios-8/](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/03/metal-a-new-graphics-api-for-ios-8/)\n\nIf these answers in the FAQ at the end are the same for Metal on OS X it can only be a good thing for KSP right?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *What would I have to do to take advantage Metal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lower CPU overhead?*\n\u003E Generally, nothing. Once we add support for Metal in Unity, using it should be very transparent. All your existing projects, all your shaders and graphics effects should just work. Just enjoy your lower CPU usage!\n\u003E \n\u003E  *But what about shaders, since Metal has a different shading language?*\n\u003E \n\u003E We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll take care of that. Right now you generally write shaders in Cg/HLSL, which we convert into GLSL for OpenGL ES behind the scenes. For Metal, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll convert them in a very similar way.\n\u003E \n\u003E  *What can I do with lower CPU overhead, again?*\n\u003E \n\u003E Have better physics, AI or more complex gameplay logic. Put more objects on the screen. Or just enjoy lower battery usage.

Correctly configured, your KSP will more likely be bottlenecked on physics, not graphics. It\u0027s not a particularly graphics-heavy game. Once they eventually ship a version which has the Unity support enabled, you might be able to push a graphics option or 2 upwards, but that should be all unless you\u0027ve already got the options set too high."}]}
