Unity (as well as every other major game engine, including 2K and Blizzard\u0027s in-house engines) will support Metal. What I\u0027m interested in is a) is this integration automatic, or does SQUAD need to spend time on it? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E What performance increase do you guys think this would give, if any? and c) If this requires SQUAD to spend time on it, should they devote dev time, or is the OSX crowd just a too small segment of the player base?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T22:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting Blog post from Unity when Metal was announced for iOS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/03/metal-a-new-graphics-api-for-ios-8/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/07/03/metal-a-new-graphics-api-for-ios-8/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these answers in the FAQ at the end are the same for Metal on OS X it can only be a good thing for KSP right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat would I have to do to take advantage Metal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lower CPU overhead?\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, nothing. Once we add support for Metal in Unity, using it should be very transparent. All your existing projects, all your shaders and graphics effects should just work.

Correctly configured, your KSP will more likely be bottlenecked on physics, not graphics. It\u0027s not a particularly graphics-heavy game. Once they eventually ship a version which has the Unity support enabled, you might be able to push a graphics option or 2 upwards, but that should be all unless you\u0027ve already got the options set too high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
