Best. Game. Ever. Apologies if this idea has been mentioned in a previous thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion: The number of Reputation Points gained for a successful mission should not just be any \u0022random\u0022 number. They should be directly related to how far a player has gotten in the tech tree. If you have unlocked only the first three tech nodes, but are still able to complete a contract to land a vessel on the Mun or Gilly (cough-scott manley-cough), then that should be worth waaaay more in Reputation Points than if the same mission is completed when you have half the entire tech tree unlocked. Or, perhaps the Points earned could be equal to how many days are left in the contract when you achieve it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would give players a reason to attempt to do things \u0022not because they are easy, but because they are hard.\u0022 (For those saying \u0022Well, nothing is keeping you from doing those missions anyway, and getting the science from them...\u0022 That\u0027s true, but what I am talking about here is the game play mechanics of Reputation Points.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA contract system that only generates missions it thinks a player is \u0022ready for\u0022 or is \u0022able to do\u0022 will \u0022flatten\u0022 the game, and players will just plod from A to B to C to D... without any reason to try to go directly from A to Z. And if any game out there should inspire us to challenge ourselves, to reach for the impossible, shouldn\u0027t it be this one? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP should give us a reason to dream.
