Basically having them act more petlike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings that already work like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- We see the pictures of the kerbals in the capsules and how they are feeling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kerbal\u0027s speciality affect what bonus they give. e.g. pilots and SASS and scientists and science bonus etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my proposal is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How about when you dont control a kerbal for a while he can start wondering off a bit. Maybe he\u0027s outside the plane and start to look around or climb on top or inspect the wonderous ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Maybe have an option to indirectly control kerbals. e.g. point and click and they go where you want them to go. So you dont walk them 3rd person style if you dont want to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Kerbal interaction. e.g. if one kerbal bumps into another they may have a quick fight animation or the the other one may lose his balance etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. After amazing survivals there may be a very lucky kerbal celebrating or running away from the wreckage until you get them under control again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Maybe general commands that they forget. e.g. if they are doing eva, you may tell them to not use their RCS but later they forget and you have to tell them again to stop wasting fuel. (like PETS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I think what make them cute is because we give personalities to them. So having them add more like your pets that you have to bring to order may make for even cooler events.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI needn\u0027t interrupt too much with your plans. I remember there was a comment that they wont make random failures etc. So I guess these kerbals always need to do what you tell them but after a while of not controlling them their actions may deviate a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis opens up a lot of attributes for their personality:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Obedience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Focus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Bravery (we have)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Aggression\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Leadership\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-15T17:53:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt may be interesting to set them on \u0022free will\u0022, in which they would occasionally wander from there parent craft.

How about when you dont control a kerbal for a while he can start wondering off a bit.

Maybe have an option to indirectly control kerbals. e.g. point and click and they go where you want them to go. So you dont walk them 3rd person style if you dont want to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

After amazing survivals there may be a very lucky kerbal celebrating or running away from the wreckage until you get them under control again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Maybe general commands that they forget. e.g. if they are doing eva, you may tell them to not use their RCS but later they forget and you have to tell them again to stop wasting fuel. (like PETS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I think what make them cute is because we give personalities to them.

KSP really lacks in this sector. The only thing we have is simple face expressions, mainly during IVA. Making characters lifelike gives birth to more complex game lore and thus magnifies PR efforts and in the end - actual sales. I don\u0027t understand the passivity regarding this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I support it, partially. For example, you could order them to take samples by smacking a rock with a pickaxe, or to perform an experiment, etc. Important thing is to have that locally, and not to turn into typical annoying strategic game click orders and grinding of your Kerbal army.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
