As a result, I occasionally have to spend an annoying amount of time paging through the structural parts tab to reach the stock parts .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I propose is to organize parts into subfolders within the parts sections that are determined based on mods installed. That way, people would only have to look for the part in a specific subfolder; this is more manageable than a collective tab. The subfolders would be inactive while no mods are installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(First thing you would see when you look in the structural tab)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStructural:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;Stock (contains all stock parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;B9 Aerospace\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;KW Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know what you think.
