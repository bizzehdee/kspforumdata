New Horizons, has of course, made big news lately with the success of it\u0027s primary goal, to get quality photos and scientific measurements of Pluto. Being that far out, New Horizons required an RTG power source. Nine years ago, when New Horizons was launched, this was actually a very big issue. It\u0027s a huge deal when you want to launch radioactive materials into space. If a launch disaster happens, you risk spreading radioactive materials over an area that sits near a population center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a story told by the some of the people who were \u0022pitching\u0022 the New Horizons launch. They wanted to talk the governor of the state of Florida to okay the nuclear launch, and actually had suggested flying the recently minted Florida themed state quarter, as a publicity move. This actually happened, and a number of the quarters were used for center of mass balancing. Furthermore, they needed to demonstrate that the RTGs wouldn\u0027t break up and release radioactive material all over Florida if there was a launch disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of this, is that it took a bit of politics and sweet talking and proving the survivability of the RTGs to get this to happen at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what if... What if there were Administration requirements for launching nuclear parts, like the LV-N Nerv and the PB-NUK Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator. There could be different paths to make it possible, and if you fail to choose a path, you\u0027re not permitted to launch nuclear parts. A few thoughts I had are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpend money:\u003C/strong\u003E Your PR guys wine and dine the politicians, lobby their causes, and fund their campaigns. You convince them that the Kerbal love for all things space is an endeavor that must advance, for the betterment of all Kerbal kind. Maybe you gotta beat those Kruskies to the Mun in this decade, and do silly things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard***. You spend quite a bit of money up front, but once you have a politician in your pocket, you\u0027re golden. They\u0027ll back you, cause you helped get them elected or re-elected. You can launch and launch and launch... Until you have an accident. If a nuclear accident occurs on the surface or in the atmosphere, you loose reputation, and are docked funds for cleanup. Your politicians turn their back on you, and you have to cajole them again to get them to back you once more. Each accident ups the cost of getting a politician in your pocket. Politics, amirite? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpend money and science:\u003C/strong\u003E You do a little bit of the same as before, but with one change. Instead of luring politicians with the royal treatment, you focus of the sell, touring the politicians, as well as the press, through the R\u0026amp;D center, showing how resilient your latest nuclear technology is. You spend extra science on reinforcing the RTG and NERV cores, so they remain intact in the event of an accident, and can be recovered (this can be implied, of course. No need to actually alter part physics) safely. There isn\u0027t a large initial investment... You\u0027re just inviting the press and politicians to tour the R\u0026amp;D facilities. A little money for the catering and the KSC swag bag, and it costs you a little science, cause you\u0027re disrupting your engineer\u0027s precious research time, but it\u0027s worth it! The added safety measures slightly increases the cost of RTGs and NERVs in the VAB, and it actually costs a small amount of science to launch them, but there is \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E additional penalty if a nuclear device is destroyed in the atmosphere, or on the surface of Kerbin. If a vessel loss normally results in a loss of reputation, that loss is actually reduced by the news of your technology succeeding in containing all traces of nuclear materials. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpend Reputation:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022Politics and the civilian public can all go sit on a lit booster! We\u0027re going to space, and we\u0027ll bully our way there if we must! We push the right agendas, talk to the right people... Or the wrong ones, if need be... One way or another, we are go for launch! We don\u0027t care about no little green hippies with signs protesting our launch. Better step away from the launch exhaust plume, cause it\u0027s not stopping\u0027 for you!\u0022 You loose a small amount of reputation every time you launch a nuclear device, but you gain more reputation completing contracts successfully, because no one else presumably could have achieved what the KSC can... Cause they don\u0027t have the guts! Alternately, in the case of a nuclear accident, you loose significant amounts of reputation, more than any other scenario. The upside, is you keep that glorious science and funds to yourself. You greedy nut! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo? Any thoughts? Is this something people think would actually be a cool addition to the Administration? A need to get authorization for nuclear device launches? I could also totally see some manner of fine for activating a NERV in the lower atmosphere, as well. Not like it has a use there anyway. I guess the New Horizon\u0027s story inspired this idea. Apollo was a lot like the first one, with touches of the second one. It was mostly politics and a push of strong nationalism that launched the Apollo to the Moon, but NASA had already lost an RTG over the indian Ocean in 1964, and the SNAP 27 RTG that would have been onboard the LEM to power moon based experiments had been designed to be able to survive reentry intact. When Apollo 13 had it\u0027s accident, and the LEM served as the lifeboat to make the return to Earth, the unintended consequence, was that a SNAP 27 RTG made it\u0027s way into the South Pacific ocean. In that scenario, science succeeded in a further catastrophe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs another side note... While thinking of the NERV\u0027s low atmospheric thrust, reminds me of engines in general. What do people think of efficiency tiers for the engines? When you first unlock an engine, it\u0027s ISP and thrust are not maxed out, but every successful launch and recovery, plus a small amount of science spent, grants boosts to performance, up to the maximum. Considering the fact that it\u0027s relatively easy to spam science early on, I think it\u0027d be a great way to boost the usefulness of collecting science, and spread out the inevitable max science. It also provides a reason for part testing. Engine test contracts could include selecting the number of points of science you wish to spend on your \u0022research\u0022. The more points you spend, the faster you develop a more efficient engine. This could also be applied to a number of other parts. Researching a reaction wheel would bump up it\u0027s torque. Maybe testing probe cores would unlock SAS functions. Some contracts could be dependent on not only launching and successfully recovering a vessel containing a particular part, but then subsequently testing said part \u0022on kerbin\u0022, so emulate the concept of testing a \u0022flown\u0022 part on the ground. This type of contract could grant larger efficiency boosts, or even max a part out. Of course, the option to have part efficiency scale in this manner could be ticked off in the difficulty/settings options, same as any other major functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***Yes, I totally snagged that great parody quote from the epic EVA grand tour video.

I also think it\u0027d be something where it just mimics the basic concept of engine development and part testing. NASA had a LOT of engine tests done, and my concept is just an attempt to put a reason for all those engine tests we do in the contracts, and maybe flesh those out a bit. I figure no low tier engine would take more than 2-5 flights or tests to max out. I think a logarithmic curve would be fair too. First use of an engine is at 80% total efficiency, but on successful test and recovery (say, with a contract test), it\u0027s been boosted up to 88%. I\u0027m not suggesting that it drag out, nor that it provide a huge penalty. Just a touch of a penalty to show that it\u0027s new tech, with kinks to work out, and to justify the existence of those early contracts. Testing an engine on the launch pad... This is a thing we ALREADY do in the early game... I say, justify it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of the spending reputation. I do cover an aggressive version of that.

That would be more on par with real engines which go through several iterations of development and improvement -- with each consecutive launch and recovery, your Isp would be a bit more generous, fuel usage would go down a bit, and your reliability on the engine improves because it\u0027s been tested in the field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe notion of having an \u0022experience rating\u0022 for each engine type is not that far-fetched.
