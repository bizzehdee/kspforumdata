So the model is fine, for a plug-nozzle engine, bearing in mind that it\u0027s essentially an inside-out bell nozzle. In practice, if we\u0027re talking about toroidal plug-nozzle engines, the ring part consists of multiple small engines arranged in a ring, which can be independently throttled or turned on and off (or turned on and off in groups), to enable steering.

In theory the aerospike should look roughly like a lance. with a wide base and long tapering forebody. However, the \u0022spike\u0022 portion can be cut off with only minor effects on performance, leaving just the base section.
