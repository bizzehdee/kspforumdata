A few mods rely on stock textures, so it\u0027s being taken advantage of to a small degree. (Though admittedly, until the Porkification of the rocket parts, the stock textures themselves are\u00A0 a bit disparate other then the MK2 and MK3 line of parts. The Size-3 parts are sorta inline with one another, I think. Sizes 0-2 are all over the place though.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for why a community texture map hasn\u0027t\u00A0happened (and probably won\u0027t): Artistic/creative freedom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome users/modder get slightly miffed when asked way a mod isn\u0027t more stock-a-like. Also, textures aren\u0027t a one size-fits-all aspect (unlike functional plugins that have defined uses and function for conformity.) You\u0027d have to get modder to also agree on part design practices and such. That\u0027s not gonna happen (at least not on a very broad scale). Everyone has their own vision for their mod. Stock/common textures may not cut it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be benefits, of course, like reduced workload (not as much texturing time, and some modder admit they suck at texturing as well). However, I find it hard to see a community-agree texture map. It\u0027s just too restrictive. Also might wind up being a little bland if EVERYTHING started looking too similar. And of course, there\u0027s the management of such an undertaking as well. It won\u0027t be easy by any means at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, some user might not like the idea of need a texture pack as a dependencies if they\u0027re using a small mod that doesn\u0027t use much from such a pack. Imagine needing to download an install like 100MB or more of textures to use a mod that using like 1% of the packs content. Users who know how can purge the unneeded textures, but it seems a lot of user depend on something like CKAN to manage their mods. Those who do probably can\u0027t/won\u0027t bother with manual mod tweaks (and that\u0027s assuming CKAN won\u0027t complain about an installed mod not matching it\u0027s database...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, you can have mods include only the textures they use, but it sorta defeats the purpose of having a centralized texture pack. (Imagine if the texture pack got updated and the same texture file from 2 different\u00A0mods are different for some reason.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T09:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome sort of \u003Cem\u003ECommunity Texture Pack \u003C/em\u003Ewould really be able to reduce the memory size (a lot). Or at least at the first look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are right, that parts created with the \u0022CTP\u0022 would all share the same style and may also look more stock-a-like. But there are some downsides of this concept:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nEvery modder has their own view on what is a good texture and what is not. Many have developed their own distinctive style that is unique for the mod/author\u00A0and they don\u0027t want their mod to look generic and like all the other mods out there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe models would have to be more detailed. Many details of the models are created with the help of the texture. And many textures are specifically designed to fit one model. One would have to model the details and increase the number of plygons per part to achieve the same level of detail with generic textures.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd i doubt that every detail can be create only with generic textures (e.g. texts, special icons)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere would have to be one material for every texture that is used in a model. Complex mods might need more than 10 materials for only one part. This would introduce a computational overhead. So we have some kind of \u003Cem\u003EMemory Usage\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to \u003Cem\u003EComputing Time\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0tradeoff here. And computing time is better spend for the physics simulation.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere\u00A0would have to be a lot of tileable textures to account for every possible situation. And there will be more and more over the time when modders add new ones that fit with their specific case. This would make the \u0022CTP\u0022 really big.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMany mods would only need to use a small portion of all the textures provided by \u0022CTP\u0022.
