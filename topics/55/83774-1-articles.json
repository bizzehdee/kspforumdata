Bit of a shame that such could not be added to the game. Even though in a sense they have a start of one. I\u0027m looking at you Funds.

The lack or x material means no ship built = no fun. That I can competely understand. The second (no fun for them at least) is figuring out if the resources is finite or not as well as how to distrubite them in a sane way that is easish for them to implement (this for myself would be the least fun as you would need to have every moon and planet there is with a unique-ish resourse table and hey still have yet to do biomes for outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI). Third no fun aspect is a signing resource values and where or not it takes time to build/refine said part/fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now it looks like a lot of work for modders to do. I know Kethane/Kerbinite mod show it could be done in a simplistic way. Regardless.
