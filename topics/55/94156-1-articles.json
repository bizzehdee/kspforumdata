This could make a lot of room for tweakables, and could also give some reason to allow more of the basic construction technology earlier in the tech tree. For example, probe cores could all be upgradeable: every time you unlock a higher tech probe core, you can use an older probe core body and choose either to fit it with higher tech or to save cost and keep it low. Another big one would be basic construction pieces: you could have panels, beams, and fuselages from the start, but gradually get lighter and stronger pieces in addition to getting more options for styles of pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket engines: should be able to subtract thrust vectoring to reduce mass and/or increase thrust, or in the case of the LV-T30, add thrust vectoring for a bit higher mass cost.
