This is a game, if complicating things too much would ruin it then we should talk about what is \u0022most fun\u0022 than what is \u0022most real\u0022\n\n**5) No Call for the removal of the feature**\n\nMy \u0022personal view and not limited to the discussion\u0022 on the matter is that resource mining should end up being a significant long term investment and various mining tools / refinement facilities should be unique to what is being mined. I like the idea, I like thinking that a long term space program would have various bases setup, transfer points plotted out; a kind of universe... but roleplaying only goes so far.\n\nThere are halfway points that we could meet at, adding in an \u0022ultimate drill\u0022 while still designing the system to use separate drills; etc... there are negociations, making it less enticing to work in ways that THE COMMUNITY feels it should not.\n\nI say again, I only wish to keep this purely discussion, my rules are designed only for \u0022purely discussion\u0022, so while an ultimate drill would require a violation of rule #2, I feel that since the OPTION to have more complexity is there, that if people complain about removing a stock part because it isn\u0027t \u0022cannon\u0022 to the rest of the suggested parts, it would be okay to mention that. Use common sense, the only thing you should never mention is the removal of the feature; I want to balance it, not remove it."},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T20:05:17Z","Content":"My view is that it\u0027s actually unrealistic not to depict ISRU for crewed missions. ISRU is used in planning of IRL crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, because it offers the only way to these missions affordably.\n\nThere have been proposals to do interplanetary missions the way we see them in KSP. These haul all of the supplies and consumables required for the entire mission from Earth. This requires the construction of a massive interplanetary spaceship that has to be assembled on orbit in the same manner as the ISS. The projected cost of doing such a mission IRL is so huge as to make it a complete budgetary non-starter!\n\nHowever, it gets worse. Doing a mission without ISRU means that the crew will have limited consumables and mobility. They won\u0027t have much time to explore and they won\u0027t be able to explore very far from the landing site. If the crew discover that they have a problem with the lander and can\u0027t ride it back to orbit, they have no option to await rescue on the surface. The landing allows for a basic \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 exercise, but doesn\u0027t get much real exploration done and doesn\u0027t offer any prospect of a permanent human presence. This leads many to question whether sending automated probes and rovers would be better.\n\nThe aim of sending humans to other worlds is to allow them to do useful work when they get there. Experiments conducted at Moon and Mars analogues on Earth have shown that human explorers have a huge advantage over robots. IRSU provides life support consumables as well as fuels to run surface vehicles. Once a mature base is established, more and more of the explorers\u0027 needs can be met locally without resupply from Earth. ISRU also lowers the total launch mass of the mission to the point that it can be done on existing space agency budgets with existing technology, meaning that these missions are something that could actually be done in the near term.\n\nAs far as KSP is concerned, the difficulty aspect of ISRU should be about getting interplanetary missions done within the budgetary limits set by the contracts system. If ISRU makes it easier to do interplanetary missions, then part costs and contract rewards should be balanced accordingly.\n\nIn the longer term, KSP will need features that more accurately depict crewed missions. We don\u0027t currently have to worry about providing proper living accommodations for our crew on long duration missions. We also don\u0027t have to provide life support consumables and food.\n\nWhen our kerbals arrive at their destination, they need to be given more to do that simply plant a flag, collect a sample, and go home! Ideally, they would need vehicles to get around, and a base to operate from and resupply them with snacks! Hopefully, we will see such features in future updates."},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T20:39:21Z","Content":"Personally, the heat generation for drills is too high---may I suggest a \u0022durability\u0022 that requires an engineer to repair it occasionally? This would prevent time warp at 100k and having a full tank in seconds. If we added Life Support, this wouldn\u0027t be as much as an issue-but drills are complicated and an engineer could repair it with differencing levels of strength-5 star would last for years, 1 star maybe for a day or two. Heat would shorten the lifetime.\n\nSecondly, if the drills are stuck in a large, freezing hunk of mass, I really don\u0027t think they\u0027ll ever get that hot. We\u0027ll need heat radiators, and stuff like that.\n\nHopefully the heat system will become simpler---I really don\u0027t think it\u0027s fun, more realistic, but not fun."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T20:54:54Z","Content":"Fel : very interesting post, thanks !\n\nI myself think that we should try out the resource system ourselves before talking about balancing it. i\u0027ll tell you guys my opinion as soon as i get my hands on those drills"},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T21:10:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m withholding my opinion till i actually get my hands on the system ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nBut in general i think having an IRSU system stock is an awesome idea (seeing as how real space agencies are planning the same thing) \n\nSquad has stated that the system will be extensively moddable, So im sure we\u0027ll have plenty of chances to adjust the system to our hearts content."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T21:23:11Z","Content":"From a balance standpoint, I think something akin to the station/base requirements in contracts makes sense.

Extant KSP is hardest in the early game, ISRU that is universal makes the later game even easier, from a gameplay balance POV, that seems like a mistake.

Can make a few different fuels, so have this make LF-O.\n\nWater (usually frozen) another (comets (add those ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ), and perhaps particular \u0022biomes\u0022 (none have biology, so none deserve that name), like polar regions could use this. You get H2 and O2, very useful. Locations could be rare/inefficient, except on bodies with loads of ice/water.\n\nRegolith, this melts regolith to extract O2, and perhaps Al as propellant (would require a novel engine).\n\nWhy would this be good gameplay? Airless moons would require polar ice, likely. You could get loads of O2 from regolith, but not much else of use (unless you bring a specific engine to burn Al). Duna, Laythe, have more options, but landing area is constrained for some of them. Comets (add a few) are very eccentric, but provide a huge payoff.\n\nI dunno, I think it adds to gameplay compared to, \u0022stick drill anyplace, profit.\u0022"}]}
