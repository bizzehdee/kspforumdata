It might also be nice to re-lock moho\u0027s rotation and have ice present on the night-side of Moho. Regions with ice could perhaps give a 30-50% science bonus for surface samples, and later could be mined and refined to make LF/O.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELiquid water: Found around geysers on Duna, Eve, a few Joolian moons. I dont know if any ocean sample on Eve or Laythe should give the science bonus but it stands to reason. Geysers could be relatively common (within a short rover-ride of any given landing zone) and contained within small isolated biomes. Surface samples near them could result in 80-100% science bonus and later could be refined into LF/O at higher rates than areas with subsurface ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFossils: Perhaps found in visible formations in select biomes (maybe slopes?) on Duna, Eve, and Joolian moons.

There might also be a science bonus for taking an atmospheric analysis near one of these formations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly you could stop right there, but maybe, possibly, there could also be a very small number of biomes with things like snails, worms, small plants, anemones, and the like that could be gathered and returned to Kerbin for big science bonuses. These regions should be rare and hard to get to (maybe 5 small biomes in the whole game) but once reached, a few kerbals with a buggy or rover should be able to buzz around and gather them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe? Something like that? These could also be things that benefitted in some special way from being analyzed in the science lab module. Obviously the science multipliers would have to be carefully balanced, but I think if they only affected surface samples it wouldn\u0027t break the game or anything, just give a little extra incentive for real exploration, getting out and about on the surface rather than getting basically an equal science bonus no matter where you take sample from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-20T18:31:12Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2014 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T19:27:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this idea -- I\u0027d find it much more realistic and entertaining to look for microbes in different biomes than to \u0022expose Mystery Goo\u0022 to things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor it to work \u0022best\u0022, I think it would be a high-reward experiment for difficult missions, e.g., drawing samples from the surface of Laythe, Eve.
