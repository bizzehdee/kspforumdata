There could be a high altitude engine, a low speed one and maybe a High speed/low alt one. Although the high alt one could work with the BJE it would be best with the TRJ/RAPIER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENERVA: For the NERV I think that there should be a \u0027Toggle reactor\u0027 button and a \u0027toggle engine\u0027 button-when powering (Very long spool up) up the reactor there will be LOTS of heat produced- when the engine is activated during spool up of the reactor, it will have a lower ISP.

The current basic jet is basically a subsonic turbofan like you find on most big jets and fills the low speed/high efficiency role. The current turboramjet is a high altitude engine. The new panther engine planned for the next update is a low-bypass turbofan like fighter jets have for the high speed/low altitude role.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the current engine parts are silly with putting the entire engine in the nozzle. What I would propose to fix that would be to have the actual engine be a resource generator part shaped something like a structural fuselage. It could generate a thrust resource which would then be sent to a nozzle part (which would be much lighter as a result).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the nerva, that sounds good, and the engine should have maximum cooling at maximum thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust reversers for jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropeller engines (at the very least an electric prop for small planes on eve/duna/jool)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T04:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that they fill these roles, however I was hoping that by combining the High Alt engine and the BJE nozzle you could get a low speed /high alt setup or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T11:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike some sort of drone High Alt thing with really big wings (Ive always wanted to build a cool-looking High alt 99% wing drone)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T19:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a similar idea to the nuke one.

In open-cycle mode, it behaves as it does currently (your idea is nice from a realism perspective, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d want that much complexity in engine management). In closed-cycle mode, it provides no thrust, but acts as a source of copious amounts of heat and electricity (say two or three times more than the existing alternator output). If more than a certain amount of fuel is available in attached tankage, the heat is transferred to the tankage and can from there be disposed of with radiators. If insufficient fuel is available, no electricity is produced, and the heat builds up in and quickly destroys the engine. (Basically, in closed cycle mode the NERV is acting as a nuclear power plant and needs a source of coolant, which the fuel provides. The fuel is recycled in closed cycle mode, so it\u0027s not used up, but enough of it has to be present to fill the cooling loop). The idea is to make the NERV provide more than enough power to large spacecraft that are already using a NERV for propulsion, but, due to the weight of the engine and the fuel required for coolant, not have it be a great option for smaller spacecraft, especially those that can use an engine with less ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"F117nighthawkX","CreatedById":151225,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T18:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lord Aurelius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew ideas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust reversers for jet engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropeller engines (at the very least an electric prop for small planes on eve/duna/jool)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to expand on these ideas, as I have been wanting these for quite some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the trust reversers for jet engines would be interesting, as you could key-bind that functionality to your \u0022break\u0022 key. This would make landing more interesting, and possibly less dangerous, especially if you are going too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcerning the propeller engines, I would really like to see multiple versions of these, i.e. electric, open cycle, and closed cycle. The electric option would obviously only be for drone class aircraft, where you could use them to scout areas, or just for a light, long range flyer. The open cycle propeller engines would be more powerful, and only use liquid fuel in atmosphere (only Kerbin and Laythe). I would also like to see a closed cycle propeller engine, where it uses liquid fuel and oxidizer. For the closed cycle props, they should be decently efficient, to allow long duration flights in atmospheres that do not have combustible gases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this considered, the question I have is: should these props induce a torque on the craft? If you add props, people will automatically ask for helicopter blades as well, but I think that topic is out of scope for my response.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-16T21:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImprovments for engines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EBetter jet engine simulation\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E where a \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Esmall delta\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E in thrust setting is \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003Eexecuted a lot faster\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E than now.
