My idea is that if I select a ship in the list, a window would open at the lower right corner of the map view after a short time (while the game loads the ship\u0027s model; I expect it wouldn\u0027t take longer than the skip when I get a ship within radius when I\u0027m doing rendezvous). Just the model would be ok, nearby planets are not necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is, sometimes when I go delete debris I am not sure what I\u0027m deleting. And to check it out, I need to switch to it and then go back to tracking station which takes considerable time and after return I\u0027m not sure which item in the list I selected anymore. I have already deleted a perfectly fine mission once thanks to that and the fact that the game marks my debris as ships or landers way too often.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T14:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI totally agree with your idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
