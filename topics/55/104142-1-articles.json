I like to build tiny stuff. Tiny landers, tiny service modules. Everything that can be tiny, I will make them that way. But now that this fuel tank was repurposed to Xenon, my tiny things won\u0027t have fuel anymore. =D\n\nThis is the only thing I really disliked about this next update. Instead of repurposing, why not just make a new version as inline Xenon tank and keep the old format as well. That\u0027d be better.\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n\nCheers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-14T22:51:31Z\u0022 title=\u002204/14/2015 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by purpletarget**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T01:28:56Z","Content":"Whoa, I missed that in my first readthrough of today\u0027s devnotes.
