So I was woundering if it would be worth it for Squad to do an update soon that is primarily focused on polishing what has already been implemented, example the MK 3 cockpit. I know that normally this is something that you do at the end of a project but I don\u0027t think it would do any harm. Sprig cleaning if you will. It could be the update where little things are added, better editor tools for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know if it would be worth it at this point in development so I want your opinion. If enough good ideas get thrown around I might start up a list, let me know if this is a good idea or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T14:01:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll be a waste of time, because once they add new features, they can go right back to polishing again.

As bad as the stock parts are there are so many great mods that I can\u0027t really complain. I would prefer Squad to continue working on new mechanics. They refine some things from update to update anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T19:52:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea right, fair enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:26:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s like on a building site: if you put in the windows/wash the floors before you\u0027ve finished putting the bricks down, the windows will get broken/the floors will get dirty and you\u0027ll start all over again...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-27T20:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA quick pass over the Squad directory assets ensuring their textures are correctly PoT, appropriate size/resolution for their parts and finally sans alpha channel if appropriate would nice\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
