Unlocked the whole tech tree in 3 flights.. *roll credits* Game over. Well that was fun... NOT!! either fix the money to science ratio, and if your not going to do that then Honestly what this game needs is some SERIOUSLY overpriced endgame parts. That would balance it out. Something like Oh.. I dunno.. SPACE-STATION PARTS THAT HAVE MEANING. Final piece being something that allows you to VISIT A BLACK HOLE. Yeah.. I know.. unrealistic, but its a game. How about some tech that lets you get through the atmosphere of jool and land on it (somehow) we need SOMETHING to fix this. as of right now, It\u0027s REALLY boring. If you want to play and have fun, I\u0027d suggest playing science instead of career. It takes away all the administration and mundane contracts. Makes it like an actual game again. Honestly, the career should have been based on the science collection. Goto the north pole and get a sample, or EVA over kerbin. NO BONUS SCIENCE. Administration should have been a building that dealt primarily with training your kerbals for their added perks.. The whole Career system is completely broken right now. Unless you\u0027re looking for sandbox with contracts... well.. there are mods for that. no sense in ruining the game to cater to the casual player.. even on hard, it\u0027s ridiculously simple.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-14T19:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe funds-to-science ratio has been well-noted by basically everyone that\u0027s tried it.
