I love the whimsy shown in the part descriptions (best, the LV-1: \u0022what is this, an engine for ants?\u0022) and I\u0027d love to see more whimsy elsewhere in the game. So here\u0027s a suggestion for more whimsy in the missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose this could be considered a request for more \u0022realism\u0022, but in a direction orthogonal to most such requests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022visual survey of $BODY\u0022 missions are rather grindy, in part because they are so implausible. What interest could Flooyd or Ionic Protonic possibly have in a visual survey of some random part of the Kerbol system? Flooyd \u003Cem\u003Eet al.\u003C/em\u003E make rocket parts; they aren\u0027t map-makers or otherwise interested in what\u0027s where.

However, they have a shared interest in, erm, \u0022investigating reported manifestations of the Kraken\u0022 -- in reality, in disproving these reported manifestations, or destroying the evidence if it exists. For if kerbals can experience the Kraken directly, what need do they have of a church to intermediate for them? So the Churches want to be the first on the spot when there is a report of a Kraken\u0027s Egg, or the Kraken itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Kerbin Skeptics\u0027 Society. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOrdinarily well-balanced and sensible, this group of kerbals has an unfortunate bee in its collective bonnet about reported sightings of UFOs.
