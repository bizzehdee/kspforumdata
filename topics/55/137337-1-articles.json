It seems at least from the pre-release that 1.1 has indeed brought forward some big advancements in the UI and memory management departments, but has been left deliberately light on new features. The new dish array\u00A0and transmission system has been in the works for some time and there\u0027s been mention that we may be getting a rocket part overhaul soon as well. I did my very best to boil down some of the most common suggestions for future development to gauge what else folks here would most like to see come next. If you don\u0027t see a feature you\u0027d really like feel free to write it in or expand on your vote below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coeus","CreatedById":160405,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-19T17:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are really too \u00A0many additions/features/improvements to be wanted. Now, I feel the greatest thing which is lacking, is a proper science system. That\u0027s also the reason I voted for science and surface features. If this is done well, it could add so much content-wise to the game. Another necessity is the addition of some mission planning gizmos ( or resources?\u00A0I don\u0027t know how to call them). While I\u0027m now an expert in guesstimating, and start doing calculations by hand, I think such a feature couldn\u0027t be left out in a game about conquering space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know 1.2 is already packed with new features, and the science overhaul would be\u00A0a major update on its own. I think it is unrealistic to expect many more features to be added in 1.2, but maybe this poll could offer some new insights to the devs for future updates.
