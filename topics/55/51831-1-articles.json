As it is you must select each one individually and most importantly this is not a feature on the spaceport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example recently I released a craft and the only comments were these : \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You need to see nassaults operation skybox short film on YouTube.

Even though this is also another unoriginal piece, it\u0027s just a cover of a pre-existing song by MacLeod. I think it would be a great Jool song, edited to feel more spacey, and without the dramtic part in the middle.\u0022 \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat has that to do with my Apollo replica?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ONLY comments I got on topic from the spaceport and thread COMBINED were \u0022I like how you incorporated science into the CSM.
