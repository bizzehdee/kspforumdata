We were having a lot of fun crashing our giant \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erockets onto the moon and stuff. It didnt take long before i started reading up on the math/physics behind rocket science. As a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esoftware developer i also wrote myself some primitive tools to help me calculate stuff, i didnt know about mechjeb at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main motivation at that point was to build the most efficient rockets possible and to land them where no one has gone before \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI calculated A LOT and experimented a lot... but at some point the limitations of the game became obvious. I will get to that later, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebecause just in time i found mechjeb and it restored my fun with the game, at least for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had two things that i wanted to accomplish. One, fly to Jool/Laythe, land there, eventually build a base there and get back. Two, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereach the moon with the smallest possible rocket. I knew there were some community challenges in the forum but i missed them by \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eseveral month so i just did it for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI soon reached a point where the game limited my plans, both of them and i couldnt see why the devs wouldnt change them but, again, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas a sw-dev myself i thought i just takes a bit more time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout five month have passed since that point and... i dont see any real issues fixes, all i see is candy for the kids (career \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emode). So im disapointed and thats why i want to give you this feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me explain what exactly crushes all my efforts in reaching my self-set goals:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rocket stability\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that struts are free, but when its possible to build something like a jumbo tank, than why should 4 tanks of the same \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esize, mass and content wabble around like they do ? Cylindrical objects attached to eachother to build an even longer cylinder are \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eextremely sturdy in real life static. Its not even hard to do. Just code it in a way that if two objects are connected with the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexact same connection shape, they are treated as one object or give that connection some ridiculous value. Its ok if something with \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea really small mount-point breaks off if its really heavy, like 2 Jumbos next to eachother, but not two jumbos building a longer jumbo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt often happens, that my spaceplanes land and when they touch down, the ENGINE, off all things, just detaches and crashes into the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eground. Imagine a fighterjet like a F18 Hornet, how could the exhaust part of the engine suddenly break off ? The whole thing is \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuilt as nearly one piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr i land on a planet, looong way from home and the engine just falls off the second i land. Im talking about a lander-capsule-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erocket kinda thing. The landing struts dont break, nothing else but the engines. Ofc that mission is a bust because without engines \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou dont go nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the entire math behind it and i can see why you chose this formula, but i think you dont see the side effects it has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon reentry once the drag really sets in, the heaviest part of the rocket will face backwards. On tiny rockets with a heavy cockpit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat means the one ton cockpit will suddenly turn to the sky and the empty 0.5 ton engine \u002B 0.1 ish fuel container will point \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etowards the planet. Its like throwing a dart into the air and the heavy tip will point to the sky once its falling down...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that calculating real air resistance \u0022on the fly\u0022 for every possible combination of parts is a mess, but there would be some \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeasy-to-use tricks and simplyfications that COULD do the trick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In addition to the drag, on spacesplanes... the air flow\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of the whole drag n thrust issue often enough my planes start spinning like crazy once a certain amount of fuel has been \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexpended. Its just NOT POSSIBLE. A plane flying with 1000 m/s cant just spin around its horizontal axis. The wings stabilize it. If \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe nose would suddenly go up by 90 degrees the air would hit the entire wing-surface with maximum resistance, the plane would \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eexplode like a firecracker. But no... its just spinning around. Once spinning, its almost impossible to catch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow u cant tell from the beginning of the design that it will happen. And i had it happen upon return from Laythe. A LOT of work \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebehind me and the last steps, the landing on Kerbin... disaster. I did reload the game 20 times, it always happened and the entire \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emission was a failure, for no good reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll those things destroy missions once their under-way but there are things that make rocket design a pain in the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Efficiency of engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow because the engines in the game are way too heavy in relation to the fuel, staging sometimes makes no sense. But even if it \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes, if you look at the engines, they are just not balanced out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is just no alternative to the Mainsail. Its ISP and thrust/weight are unrivaled. But what if i need an engine with only 1k \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrust and not 1,5k ? If i have to combine two big engines with less thrust, where do i place them ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its worse with the smaller engines. The LVT30 and 45 for example. Ive been over the math countless times and it never makes \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esense to take the 45 unless you REALLY need the gimbal. So if you look at it, for 1 deg of gimbal it has to sacrifice almost 10% of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits thrust and gains somewhat 20% weight. What if i just want 0.5 gimbal, but therefor only gain 10% weight and lose 5% thrust ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this with so many engines. Sometimes i just need 10 kN more and i could sacrifice the gimbal for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy not give every engine some sliders/bars where everyone can adjust them ? With some simple limits and rules, like for every 1% \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrust you increase the weight by 2% etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you can create ur own parts via config files but with the endless loading times of the game its annoying to always go out of \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe game, create a new engine with some tiny amounts changed and the try this one out... missing 20 kN, exit game again, tweak \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eetc... cmon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- scalability of fuel containers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust like the above, the rules of containers are quite simple, 1/9 emtpy weight, 8/9 fuel. Why not let the player decide how long a \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econtainer should be ? If its not possible because of the engine, well then just make em the same size but change the values. When \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuilding really small rockets i sometimes need 1,5 small fuel containers if i take 2 it messes up my delta-v, if i take one im short \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea half one... in the end calculation i \u0027have\u0027 to take some extra 200 kg of stuff i dont need to not return with still half a tank fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you could say \u0022why bother\u0022, well because in game with no real goal its my personal goal to achieve the smallest slimmest rocket \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut i dont want to spend hours exiting, changing config, loading again. Especially if what i need is such a simple thing to code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont like/need the career mode and i think the tech tree and all is... really bad, but i dont have to use it so i dont have a problem with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the above issues made me stop playing again after 2 hours of patch 0.23 . My friends asked me \u0022so how is the new patch, whats \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enew?\u0022 And all i could tell them was \u0022still all the same issues... dont bother\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts really sad because i do like the entire rocket thing a lot and the game CAN be fun, if only it wasnt for those annoying rocket-killing issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T00:09:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECherry picking just a couple of issues, as I don\u0027t have the energy to respond to everything here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NikkyD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NikkyD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt often happens, that my spaceplanes land and when they touch down, the ENGINE, off all things, just detaches and crashes into the \u003Cp\u003Eground.

Ok, the damage is probably going to be quite different on the real F18, but the plane is not going to be flying again in the short term.

It\u0027s hard to be certain, but it\u0027s very likely that your plane\u0027s centre of mass (CoM) is ending up behind the centre of lift (CoL). When that happens, the plane loses aerodynamic stability and becomes uncontrollable. If it only happens after fuel has been used, it\u0027s quite possible that the CoM is starting out ok, but moving to an unstable position as it changes with fuel use. These are real issues from the real world. The solution is to manage the fuel weight, and/or ensure that the CoM and CoL positions prevent it happening too easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NikkyD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NikkyD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere is just no alternative to the Mainsail.
