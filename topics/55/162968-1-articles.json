I\u0027m looking for any help and support that could get this project on the road and/or someone with some ksp plugin experience since i have none bar part modding, thanks for any help you can lend and I look forward to this ever becoming a reality!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-06T19:59:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2017 07:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by amankd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T21:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome constructive criticism: Consider breaking your idea up into more sentences and paragraphs to make it more readable; more people will read it and offer feedback if you do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso: Moving this over to the Suggestions forum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-06T22:59:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion 1 for KSP in VR: you are in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, looking at a rocket you are building.

Most likely you\u0027d have to tear into the sourcecode at a very low level to change the camera mechanics, and without that, the VR experience is a horrible contradiction of head movements that don\u0027t connect to the way the scene shifts - or head movements that get ignored because there is no sane translation of \u0022look left\u0022. If you did solve the camera issue, there would be the question of \u0022why do I \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E to look away from my vessel?\u0022 The easy rotation around the ship is now multiple steps of turn head, teleport, look back to see if I\u0027m at the correct angle, repeat. It becomes cumbersome to find the correct viewpoint, and seems unlikely to deliver an experience you\u0027d want. My feeling is that visual immersion for KSP is better provided by a large monitor than by a VR headset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost VR games are either planned to be VR, or were fundamentally first person and therefore easily adapted. Skyrim, for instance, works very well as a VR concept because you were always a viewer within the world.
