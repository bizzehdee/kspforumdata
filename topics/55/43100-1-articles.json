There is simply no way but to eyeball it, and while for many people this is just fine (just look at all the space stations people have built) It is extremely difficult and makes construction in space for anything out of line with the main body immensely difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I\u0027m suggesting is that when within physics range of an object, roughly the correct distance to target a specific piece the pilot would get another option: Orient On.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHence the Ender\u0027s Game quote: in null G, which orbit is pretty much, \u0022Down\u0022 is whichever way you want it to be. In this case, by orienting down (or up) on the docking port, the pilot now simply needs to align his target indicator, pro-grade vector, and down or up indicator and know that he is perfectly aligned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for constructing ships in space, the ability to align the vectors also allows the pilot to us the ui\u0027s orientation indicator to precisely line up with the docking port at a relatively precise angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there are any questions or concerns, I\u0027d love to hear them in order to make this idea work better for as many people as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T14:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou just described the par and -par functions of mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econserns, anti mechjeb people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmappedout","CreatedById":57281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T14:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the only piece of the Smart ASS module which is missing from the vanilla UI - and could potentially be added as a marker to the Nav ball (only within target range, maybe?).
