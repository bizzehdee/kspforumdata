Within a few unlocks it is easy to harvest 1k\u002B scince per mission and thereby unlocking stuff faster than you can ever use it. I\u0027d wish there were harder challenges, I\u0027d wish I had to really optimize my weight and design before getting rewarded with new stuff. I am not sure excactly how to implement difficulty settings, but I can think of a few ways.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T13:13:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 Being able to complete the tech tree with science only from mun\u002Bkerbin can be fun for some players, but many players would like some difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think that we should wait until they implement money to see how that changes the difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-30T13:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode is far from finished - and it looks like it will take a while, with contracts in 0.24 being only one of steps. Yes I agree it\u0027s rather easy now if you know what you\u0027re doing - you need about than 11k science to unlock the whole tech tree and there is more than 70k science available all over the system. In my opinion we need to wait till the whole system is designed and only then ask for changes to it. I am pretty sure things will become better balanced as the career mode implementation will finish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
