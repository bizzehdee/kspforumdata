That means velocity and position, but not acceleration.) The math wouldn\u0027t even be capable of *storing* any changes to the rotational momentum. It\u0027s assuming a constant rotational velocity is happening while on rails. So as long as you kill the rotation with SAS prior to going on rails, there won\u0027t be any phantom rotations while on rails. The parts of the physics engine that are causing the phantom rotations aren\u0027t active and the time warp rotation would only be capable of remembering what the rotational velocity was at the moment you went on rails. It wouldn\u0027t be capable of altering it while on rails. (So if you are rotating slowly at 2 RPMS when first going into rails, you\u0027ll still be going 2 RPMs when you come out. You won\u0027t have accelerated via phantom rotational forces to something like 100 RPM or anything like that because those forces don\u0027t exist while on rails.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-24T10:24:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2014 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T10:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo as long as you kill the rotation with SAS prior to going on rails, there won\u0027t be any phantom rotations while on rails.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the point - the phantom forces spin the ship when it\u0027s not on rails and SAS doesn\u0027t help (or is even sometimes the cause).
