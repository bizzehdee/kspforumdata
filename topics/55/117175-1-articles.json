(Perhaps you instead get a range of possible trajectories indicated somehow) That seems grounded in realism - if a body doesn\u0027t have a moon it\u0027s hard to know its mass until you send a probe past it, but rather easier to know its orbit from telescope observations. It wouldn\u0027t excessively hold the players back or make us jump through hoops or do gruntwork - if we want we can just go for it and sort things out when we get there at a probable delta-V penalty. And I think it would add some interest, and another reason to do a quick preliminary mission to a planet before sending Kerbals there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T12:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moon itself would tug on its parent planet, and so we should still know its mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the moon gets big enoug, its basically a binary system (pluto-ish).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke would certainly tug on duna enough to figure that stuff out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol on Jool... not so much\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol perturbing bop? perhaps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo/laythe on Jool? probably enough to get rough estimates\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T13:22:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think a mod - possibly an extension to RemoteTech? - that would provide navigation accuracy improvements would be nice.
