I\u0026#39;ve been too scared to ever try any strategies, because I have no clue what so ever how the reputation numbers affect the coloured bar at the top, because I never learned how to convert between arbitrary decimal numbers, gold stars, percentage and coloured bars.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhy can\u0026#39;t there just be a single number, in the same units, everywhere for reputation points?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is even more important now that declining contracts apparently costs you one gold star: what does that even mean?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VolvoxPL","CreatedById":153704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T13:01:51Z","Content":"\nI can agree on that. It\u0026#39;s confusing for me too. This bar has also three colors which does not tell much.
