So it\u0027s more immersive and hands on while you are of EVA! It would be easier to try and board a craft, seeing as you have to try and finangle the camera around to get close to it, but if it was first person, you\u0027d be the Kerbal trying to get it! It would make it easier to fly about in EVA if you\u0027re trying to get somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt wouldn\u0027t be too hard to code I\u0027d imagine. Just press C while controlling a Kerbal and it would zoom in to a first person camera set in his face. You would have a sort of Helmet HUD surround the camera, but not too intrusive. It would show things such as propellant left, speed, and the standard Nav-Globe. Doesn\u0027t have to perfect, it\u0027d just make it easier to move about as a Kerbal and immerse you in the flying part of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe HUD could also be able to be used for mods too! I can picture a mod that shows the amount of air left in the suit, and stuff like that. \u003Cem\u003EGravity\u003C/em\u003E anyone?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, it\u0027s a great idea and would make the game sort of first person. It\u0027d be fun for moon walks, and personally easier for me since I can\u0027t zoom in because I have no scroll wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI welcome suggestions, modifications, and opinions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrian\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T20:14:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AwesumnisRawr188\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AwesumnisRawr188\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E*snip*\u003Cp\u003Eeasier for me since I can\u0027t zoom in because I have no scroll wheel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying on a laptop, I take it?
