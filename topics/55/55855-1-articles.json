They could be used to discover an asteroid belt, but instead of dealing with hundreds of small rocks loading constantly within a 2.5 KM radius, A telescope can find asteroids that are around the size of Gilly, but could be bigger or smaller. They would be either randomly generated, or pulled from a big pile of asteroids that squad would make, model, and texture. Obviously we don\u0027t have planet-sized asteroids in the belt, and it it would be pointless to have an asteroid that is smaller than your ship! Upon it\u0027s discovery with the telescope, you could be given the option to name it, and it would then appear on the Orbital Map. I\u0027m not saying there SHOULD be asteroids as it is on the Do not suggest list. But is a suggestion for a mechanic that would permit implementation, what are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Are on Planned Features list, though lack a citation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
