Right now the parts are not mirrored as I would expect, i.e. similar to how triangular lifting surfaces are mirrored. Instead it seems to be a cross between mirror and radial symmetry in that the position relative to the parent part is mirrored, yet the actual rotation of the parts is set as it would be in radial mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a bug, could it be fixed in the next update? I would like to use those parts, but with the current behaviour their range of application is rather limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-11T14:12:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSplit this post into its own thread in Suggestions \u0026amp; Development Discussion, since the original thread was about something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vycma","CreatedById":106068,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-19T11:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is an issue on the bug tracker, for anyone who wants to give this a vote: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/20762#change-116686\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBug #20762\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-19T21:01:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpvoted.
