I guess it\u0026#39;s better to ask \u0022is it intuitive?\u0022 instead of \u0022is it realistic?\u0022. It\u0026#39;s not realisitc at all to fly around with little green men. But the overall game mechanic kinda \u0022feels right\u0022. And even in KSP, raising the capacity of solar panels or battery density by 100(!)% just by throwing funds at it, is far from intuitive. Yet allone 70000%. Heck, where would humanity be if science really works that way....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe thing with tweakscale: roughly, your panel would get 70x larger, just like tanks, batteries, so why again doing this instead of adding a single large part?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, for the times where you get out of the spheres which you can handle with one larger part, like you need 10 of the largest batteries, i suggest a welding feature: You select the stack of 10 batteries and weld them together. In career mode, this could double the part count of the welded stack reported in the VAB (so the part limit in the lower levels prevents you from welding all rockets together by default, you get 20/30 parts instead of 10/30 without welding), but in flight, this stack behaves as one inseparable part. Should only work with parts of the same kind, though.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWould this improve performance? If i pack 10 parts into one \u0022container\u0022 part of the same size and assume the parts in it as static, rigid forces/wobble would only apply for this container part as a whole, not every singly part in it. So there\u0026#39;d be much less physics-calculations right?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: TweakScale is a nice mod for those who want it, but somehow i don\u0026#39;t want that mechanic in stock, as it\u0026#39;s too abuseable. When hitting the part count limit, one could just scale up one tank instead of using 2 tanks. This takes out a bit of the design challenge (Lame gamplaywise, but anyway good for those whose PCs are not that fast so every part less is better.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also don\u0026#39;t like the current fuel tank situation (why do adapters have LF/O only, while tanks are available as LF/O, LF or Monopropellant?). But i hope there\u0026#39;s a better solution than tweakscales or simply \u0022You decide what goes in there\u0022. I like the simplicity of KSP: \u0022Here\u0026#39;s the parts, do what you want with them\u0022. I also hate the simplicity of KSP: \u0022Darn, are there no big LF-Tanks for my nuke?\u0022\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-26T13:16:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2015 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Octa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuranon","CreatedById":154117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-30T13:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of having the possibility to improve the stats of parts, allowing parts to be \u0022upgraded\u0022 up to three times (perhaps costing x1.25, x2.5 and x7.5) increasing key stats like thrust of an 1st stage\u00A0engine, or the ISP on jet or 2nd stage engine.
