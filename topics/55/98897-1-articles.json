The player must complete the contract before the rival agency does. If the player fails to beat the agency, then the agency gets the reward and the player looses.

See, the contracts vanishing would likely be enough gameplaywise, but it wouldn\u0027t really be that satisfying as a player because it\u0027s not that immersive. On the other hand, we also don\u0027t want the game to chug because the computer is constantly calculating launches for two or more sets of ships and populating our universe with tons of lag-inducing debris. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo we compromise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt its basic setting, a contract disappears when the agency completes it and, if necessary, the rival\u0027s flag pops up at the location specified in the contract (where possible) or a bit of debris. Either way, unless the contract was a component test or an altitude record, an object to mark the completion is typically loaded into existence.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt the intermediate setting, in addition to the flags, the agency uses simple, low part-count premade crafts (based on the tech level of the agency) - be it a base or a lander or whatever - that pops up into existence at the location for the player to interact with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt the advanced setting, the agency does all the above, plus it uses a premade rocket (again, based on the tech level) that launches on rails (precalculated trajectories and launch windows) that the player could theoretically interact with. It would leave bases and debris and probes in its wake, though again, it would be low part count.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m not suggesting that the rival agency have some sort of crafty AI... a built in contract bias would work just fine. For flying, it would only need the simple mechjeb-like capability to go to places and land, and strategically, the agency would be limited by the same kind of budgetary and technical restrictions that a player would have: \u003Cem\u003Enot enough cash to make a ship/component to complete a contract? then the agency doesn\u0027t take the contract.\u003C/em\u003E Simple, no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other neat thing about this idea is that outside of career mode, there could be quickgames in KSP where it is something like Race to the Mun where the objective is to beat the agency to a specific spot and plant a flag or drop a base or whatever. Simple challenges like that for players who want to play the game but don\u0027t have the energy, time or patience to invest in career mode, or who want to be challenged in specific ways (ala the Challenges subforum) rather than by random contract. Heck, maybe even add an editor where players can build challenges and set parameters for both the player and the agency, and then post them for other players to try out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I\u0027ve only spent a small amount of time working out this suggestions as it obviously needs to be fleshed out more and both the possibilities and the practicalities examined (perhaps it would change KSP\u0027s fundamentals too much, or would be too time consuming or complex to implement)... but just on the face of it, I see a lot of potential for this idea, so I offer it up to the community to be killed or nurtured as they see fit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-06T07:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2015 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scoundrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed the formatting.

Contracts vs Missions. The \u0022contract\u0022 nature needs to change. Internal plans for broad direction drive internal missions. MISSIONS. Explore the Mun is a \u003Cem\u003Emission\u003C/em\u003E. Launching a satellite for the Kerbal Broadcasting Network is a contract. Taking seismic data on the Mun? That\u0027s a mission, at least early game. Later, it might be a contract (so a private entity can then exploit that data, perhaps). Contracts should be what would realistically come from 3d parties. Missions are anything internal, and should pay up front, including \u0022science\u0022 if that is to be the only currency for buying tech (failure should be very bad then in terms of future up front payments, and rep).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Time is meaningless. There are no time contrasts whatsoever, at any scale size you care to look at. Not even \u0022rescue a kerbal\u0022 missions are time critical, and even if they were, you could build a new rocket from scratch, instantly, and rescue them. In addition, the tech tree strings out tech which was concurrent in our only model for such a system, real life. Solar panels? 50s. Nuke rockets? 50s-60s. You can have pods, etc show up mid 60s if you want to lock them later, but there was no technical reason not to have them whenever. The spaceplane stuff is the only thing in KSP that should be later, since current versions in KSP exist with a touch of unicorn dust. Computer tech would be another possibility to model increasing over time, but that become more of a UI issue, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The entire science buys tech paradigm is, well, wrong. Exactly wrong, in fact. Science was almost a byproduct of the space race in RL, and even now, if new technology is needed, it designed with a goal in mind. Pick the mission, design the tech needed to complete that mission. The current system requires endless \u0022balancing\u0022 since any way of developing tech but the real way is \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. No competition, which is what entirely drove the space race era that this game models (the end of the tech tree in KSP is stuff NASA was working on during Apollo). Competition is also, BTW, implicit in extant KSP, as the stranded kerbals MUST come from a competing program. JUst as reentry effects are explicit in the current game due to part descriptions stating that certain parts cannot survive reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. No randomness. Yeah, the devs don\u0027t like it, apparently, but replay is improved with having novel places to explore (randomized worlds), and failures are FUN, and result in some of the best gameplay (can always be optional, as I keep seeing posts by people who have been playing a while who are still trying to do stuff I did the first night I played, before my 2d beer was finished).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolutions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I suggested the change to mission vs contract above. If you chose a mission-based program, you will be operating on a sort of budget (money up front to \u0022Explore the Mun,\u0022 for example, and points to buy tech). Such missions would possibly have competition in a couple ways. One would be to have it as OP suggests. If the Union of Kerbanov Republics (whatever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) lands on the Mun first, there is a chance you have the budget forwarded to you slashed, and rep badly dinged. In the current game, it could be a hard time limit. Broad time limits are only meaningful with problem #2 fixed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Time: Having things take time would be a start. Like the KCT mod. Given the stated addition of \u0022warp to time X\u0022 to 1.0, there could simply be a link to that, even from the VAB. Add a \u0022construct\u0022 button to the VAB (then you do something else while the rocket is built), but if you simply hit \u0022Launch,\u0022 then time warps to the date of completion. Zero visible change from the current system to the player, they hit launch, then launch. The difference is that the game clock gets advanced X weeks. It means that current early game play takes the career player exactly the same amount of his/her time, but that in game terms it might be a couple years. The other way to add meaningful time is for some Missions (currently \u0022contracts\u0022) might have further milestones. Achieving Orbit is one step, but then the next goals might be orbital flight\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 docking missions, and other precursors to further flights. Adding these to career means building new crafts, then flying the missions. Each mission takes time. Weeks. Note that most of the dumb testing contracts should be replaced with not-dumb testing contracts. Life support is an obvious time limit creator as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Tech\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a can of worms. Forget that for now, and assume that \u0022Mission\u0022 acceptance (vs contracts) pays funds and science \u003Cem\u003Ein advance\u003C/em\u003E. Additional science gained from actually doing the mission is as per current KSP. Basically, you accept the Mun mission as a goal, and you have to complete it in XX months, but here\u0027s some science/funds to buy a few tech nodes with\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 chose wisely. If you don\u0027t revert, and your rocket fails\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 a few months til the next launch, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Competition can be abstracted as slightly randomized time limits, or via the game playing out AI missions, etc, as per OP\u0027s suggestions. It would add life to the game, frankly, particularly if they have novel parts (cool to run into a Soyuz looking craft in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Random system generation (optional) makes exploring fun, even in the Nth replay. Random part failures are also fun (again, optional difficulty setting). They could be done as test parts, after any part spends a certain amount of time in use (for some orbital use would be required), they have failure chances reduced to near, or actually 0 (diff setting). The UKR just sent a munar probe\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 sure, the engines we need are untested, but we better go to the Mun NOW with Jeb, or they might orbit manned before we do!

Your argument is circular WRT to manned flight, however. I was clearly referring to the basic science associated with exploring the planets/moons, and the space they occupy. Medical science associated with spaceflight is certainly a thing, but the only point is to further manned flight. If your goal is to study Mars, that effort would be better spent on sending probes to Mars, not wasting vast resources on manned efforts in orbit so that you can then send even more expensive missions to Mars. If you can land and return an astronaut, you could land and return samples far more easily with a robot (vastly smaller payloads to lift in both directions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not against manned flight, but the \u0022science\u0022 of it only exists to further itself.
