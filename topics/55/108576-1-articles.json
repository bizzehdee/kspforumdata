Your test is invalid due to staying vertical, and focussing only on the maximum altitude. A valid test must include a realistic ascent profile, and consider whether it improves aerodynamic stability and control. I.e. does it improve flight characteristics, helping to avoid loss of control, on a realistic profile? A valid test should also keep to appropriate speeds on the way up, i.e. no prolonged balls of fire due to excessive TWR, no mach 3\u002B at low altitude.\n\nIf you want to conduct a more meaningful test, I suggest using MechJeb to get a repeatable \u0022hands off\u0022 realistic ascent profile (assuming that MJ ascent guidance is working for 1.x now, I\u0027ve yet to try it as I have chosen to do the first bit of career hand flying). You\u0027d still need to do some separate hand flying, and subjective evaluation, to decide whether it helps for control and stability.\n\nN.B.

Further, the high TWR of the rockets ensures that the aerodynamic forces are very high, which should reduce the error in the calculations.\n\nI see nothing invalid with this method of straight-up testing, since it provides a very reproducible method of launching, as well as a simple method to determine the energy lost to aerodynamic forces, which will be proportional to the reduction in altitude.\n\nIn all cases, this is concerning, since the flatter rockets should not only have higher drag, but with all that drag ahead of the CoM, should be harder to control.
