After the discussion, I started to wonder about what could be coming to really limit this practice. In the end I started to think about the command module, crew modules, and probe cores. What if these in the future were to have a specific data capacity. So you have a choice of storing the data, but you can only have so much and the rest, if you want it you have to send it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some cases this would be good, like being able to transfer the data from a Science Jr. to the command pod so you can run another experiment, or ditch the module for the return trip. But the limit would work against the player some because if they fill up on crew reports and eva\u0027s...they would be forced to transmit other data back home losing points in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course better command modules and probe cores could have greater data capacity. But then your trading capacity with added mass. There would also be the idea of a hard drive module so you could store more...like the size of a battery pack. But it would depend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the question is, do you think this is a path the developers are heading towards? may be other thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toric5","CreatedById":58046,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T06:04:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think that data would be no loss, as its just what gets sent home. the resin that we would return is that we want to actually see the samples, so no. also, this should be in the suggestions forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T06:15:38Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 06:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by toric5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SyberSmoke","CreatedById":73912,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T06:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toric5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toric5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei think that data would be boo loss, as its just what gets sent home. the resin that we would return is that we want to actually see the samples, so no. also, this should be in the suggestions forum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is not a suggestion, as the title states, it is rampant speculation about what the developers may do.
