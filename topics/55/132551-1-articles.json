The actual timeline should have pretty basic icons to keep it from getting too cluttered. You can compare the icons on the timeline to the ones in the KAC window. On the far right you see an arrow, this could signify user created maneuver nodes or alarms that are off screen in the future.\u00A0\u00A0In this case the SOI and transfer window alarms. Maybe in the real UI you\u0027d just mouse over the arrow and it would show the details in a text popup.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of my ideas for multiplayer timewarp would be to integrate it into the timeline, in addition to hotkeys (which could be treated like the game \u0027defcon\u0027 where the game runs at the fastest speed of the slowest player), you\u0027d be able to que up warps (similar to KAC or mechjeb warp helper). In this example, the player (blue bar) qued up a warp 20 minutes from now to some point in the future, but the 2nd player (purple bar) wants to warp sooner (looks like around 12m30s) but the green bar represents the agreed upon overlap, so thats when it will warp. So maybe the purple player can go get a sandwich. ;P\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CKUM4BK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CKUM4BK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis Shows a longer timescale, Since the alarm clock is so close to zero at this time scale, there should be some advanced info on it, maybe it blinks red with a timer indicator under it, since at a 3 hour gradation you\u0027d never be able to tell when a 3 minute timer would pop just by looking. Again mouseover shows more time detail. In this example our Transfer window is still way out, so it\u0027s got the right hand arrow indicating it\u0027s off the scale. In this example you qued up a warp 8 days from now till around \u00A018 days, and since player 2 wants to warp to the foreseeable future (Boy are they mad at you!) You\u0027re entire warp is approved since it overlaps, note we won\u0027t necessarily track warp in the T minus part of the scale since it\u0027s pretty pointless, but I guess you could.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0ryjnvx.png\u0022 alt=\u00220ryjnvx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinal picture shows the last idea. And this is we could have context buttons (see transfer window icon lower left) That would show non user-created info on the timeline.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this example we\u0027re dealing with year scale timelines, so our SOI transfer and alarm clock are Red flashing since they\u0027re happening sooner than the lowest gradient, and since the alarm is happening sooner, it\u0027s time is displayed, and once it pops, the SOI transfer time will show instead, possibly the alarm would blink since it\u0027s happening within 15 minutes, and the SOI would be less dire because it\u0027s still 1 day out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this example shows something you could do with mission info (Launch, staging, part heating, destruction, failure, landing, eva) with the proper context button. But in this\u00A0case we\u0027ll use Transfer window (but you could do SOI, whatever)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo say you click the transfer window button, now it\u0027ll show a dot for each Transfer window upcoming from your current location, maybe a pop up key will show a different color for each body. But in this case we\u0027ll use muted green dot for every planet with an upcoming Transfer. In our example we clicked Duna, note that \u00A0Eeloo is below it (the muted green dot under the bright green dot) because they\u0027re nearly the same time window. Since we selected Duna, in addition to showing it\u0027s nearest transfer, it now projects out the next 4 transfer windows (represented by bright dots that fade from green, to yellow, to red) So you can visualize the time scale of the Kerbin Duna transfer in context of your other markers, alarms, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this example I further demonstrated the Warp overlap Mechanism, both players have layed out warp ques, but only the agreed\u00A0upon areas are going to warp. I suppose the player could hit the warp hotkey when they are within player twos warp que and it\u0027ll just automatically add say 5 minutes of warp or whatever till they run out. If there is going to be \u0027surprise\u0027 warp, there should be some 10 second warning in which the other player can change their mind, so you can change your mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway So this is the Summary:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nTimeline, different time scales and positions selectable by player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKAC functionality built into it, place alarms by clicking on timeline, select context buttons to show all SOI, Transfer windows, closest approach, AP, PE, etc. Place an alarm just by clicking icon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission Timeline also shown on this with context button. Icons to represent evens, so Launch Icon, Stage Icon, Landing Icon, Recovery? Park failure icons. Mouse overs show details, Possibly multiplayer support with a muted or different color to optionally show the other players launches, disasters, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if there is life support, this would be a HUGE factor also, big indicators to show estimated life support range, warnings for specific flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasier Time warp, just click and drag on the timeline, it\u0027ll warp during that time segment. Maybe time warp hot keys just add an automatic time segment to the timeline, the longer the segment, the faster the warp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShow upcoming Transfer windows, SOI changes, AP, PE, etc based on context menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway i\u0027m done, what do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T01:41:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow.
