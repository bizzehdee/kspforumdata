Sure, you can send Kerbals one 1 way missions, but I think most players do not like that idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA feature that is useful for 1 way missions is a poor addition to a crewed module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Reuse Mat bays and goo canisters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Problem: for the same weight, you can carry 10 goo cans, and 10 mat bays. Making them as little modules allows you to land, do the science, store results, and detach them, your ascent stage is then lighter and more fuel efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are few situations where a sciece lab is better than 1 goo\u002B mat bay modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that parts cost money, there\u0027s even less incentive to add 3.5 tons of dry weight to your ships/requiring your landers to carry up another .35 tons of experiments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Data storage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, you can store multiple reports of the same type in it so its easy to max out that science in one go (for when 1 experiment wont max it out, like a temp scan or EVA report)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-problem: diminishing returns mean there isn\u0027t all that much point to this, and you\u0027ve probably got another command pod to store things in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESynergy? Versatility?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeh, it is nice to be able to do an experiment, do a boosted transmission for immediate science, and then do it again and store the data for max science (esp on long interplanetary missions). You can already do that for all science except the mat and goo - just for less science. You can do that with surface samples, which you can\u0027t always do with labs (landing a lab is really inefficient, unless perhaps if it is the very last stop of your journey).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is the main draw of it (aside from RP reasons)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest to just make the transmission boost better:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp the transmission modifier from 1.5x to 2.0x (it seems they\u0027ve already contemplating this, modding it to be 2.0 changed the description from detailed analysis to exhuastive analysis)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr change it so that you get an additional 50% of the remaining science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIe a transmit value of 20% leaves behind 80%, detailed analysis recovers 40 of those 80, for a transmit value of 60%, while a transmit value of 50, leaves behind 50, and the detailed analysis recovers 25 of those 50, for 75% transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd a smaller uncrewed \u0022automated lab\u0022 that has a 1.5x modifier, and cannot reset experiments - something intended for 1 way trips (ie, Eve, maybe Tylo)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M3tal_Warrior","CreatedById":116603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T18:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe missions I do always use a lab (but then I rover about half the mun with it and such), but you\u0027re right: Labs are (apart from the resetting/storage capacity) quite useless and damn heavy. Most of the time I use them as eye candy, for a space station HAS to have at least one lab and such. And you\u0027re right - having a fully fledged gigantic lab at hand that is just able to slightly increase the science transmitted is awkward. It should be able to do almost everything in place.

Of course, it would need to be continuously crewed and in an interesting location such in orbit around a planet/moon. Put a cap on the allowable science accumulation depending on the planet/moon it was orbiting. A lab orbiting Duna would have a much higher cap than one orbiting Minmus, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would avoid the issue of science spamming and provide a reason to have multi-Kerbal missions to other planets. Combining with life support mods would add an interesting game dynamic, where you would be concerned about the longevity of missions, rather simply how many science instruments you can stick on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T18:53:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...\u003Cp\u003E2) Reuse Mat bays and goo canisters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Problem: for the same weight, you can carry 10 goo cans, and 10 mat bays.
