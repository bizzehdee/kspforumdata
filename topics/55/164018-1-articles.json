The only problem with this is that the satellites in question are my meticulously positioned relay satellites, which are \u003Cem\u003Eexactly \u003C/em\u003Ewhere I want them. They don\u0027t get to be moved, and I want some way to tell the game that this is the case, so it will stop trying to mess with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my suggestion is this: Alter the mission code so that contracts are not created for vessels with the relay icon attached. Alternatively, give me a little checkbox in the rename vessel dialog box labeled \u0027critical equipment\u0027 or something like that. When it\u0027s checked, no missions are created involving that vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Messy Recipe","CreatedById":177223,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-03T17:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132844-122-contract-pack-clever-sats-14-13122016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EClever Sats\u003C/a\u003E contract pack by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/80345-severedsolo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002280345\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/80345-severedsolo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@severedsolo\u003C/a\u003E.

Gets annoying if you don\u0027t wanna decline it because of the rep loss and have to see the proposed orbit in your tracking station until it expires. I think the checkbox would be the best approach; could be nice for stations as well if you don\u0027t want upgrade contracts involving them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-03T17:15:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2017 05:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Messy Recipe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
