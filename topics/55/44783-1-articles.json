One of my favorite ideas would be similar to what happened on one of the return to flight missions after the Columbia disaster, where an astronaut had to go UNDER the shuttle to pull a piece off of the shuttle because they thought it was a flight risk to the shuttle for reentry. To expand my idea, lets say you launch a mission into orbit, and now that you are in orbit, you must EVA to check the over all health of your ship, and then, because perhaps you were a little to liberal on your application of throttle, you broke something during ascent. Well, now, you gotta fix it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
