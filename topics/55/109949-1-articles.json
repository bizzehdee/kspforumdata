Basically, this would be a workaround to avoid stacking multiple shields, or putting multiple ones over parts of the ship, making it visually and literally become redundant. \u003Cem\u003E(Even though, the game nicely lets you select how much \u0022Ablator\u0022 is used, which could reduce the weight slightly, so you only burn up as much as you use, but that\u0027s another subject.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough heat does dissipate, and yes, there is some valid points about heat not being a major issue with a regular heat-shield provided with the vanilla game version, this is still an idea nonetheless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing it could be useful for?

(The article shown mentions it being a \u0022decelerator,\u0022 so this seems somewhat proven. Also, an amazing idea presented in the article that could totally work for KSP: Dropping cargo from space with heat-shields that fold out. That sounds like fun to me. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) Although... \u0022A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.\u0022 does a very good job of doing the decelerating as well, the same as creating a fairing that dissolves most of the heat and speed without sacrificing anything inside of it. It\u0027s about the same result either way. I\u0027ve done a few tests myself, going typical orbital velocities as different angles, using a combination of the airbrakes and heat-shields, which, the brakes seem to lower the speed greatly, and in my experience, around 2x as fast deceleration than it would be without the brakes. But, this is all for you to decide. Just some thoughts I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:24:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current forkaround is to us a fairing and but a regular heasheild on the inline bit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[MOD - Thread title renamed for clarity]\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould double as a good toboggan on minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T09:13:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m betting someone would make boat out of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EInflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
