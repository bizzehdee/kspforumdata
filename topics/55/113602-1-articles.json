The thought of that little guy being the one to turn my perfect approach into a vertical death-plunge into Kerbin or throw me back out into Solar SOI tickles my fancy.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It would be neat, but I also think it should be a \u0027tickbox\u0027 difficulty option which people can enable at/to their own peril/taste.\n\nI don\u0027t see that being all that practical considering the overall effect it would require. This sort of element would pretty much have to be a core part of the game or not be there at all. But, as Red Crown illustrated, the difficulty curve would still start out easy from Kerbin and its moons. And there really wouldn\u0027t be that big of a change in difficulty, anyways. There are enough biomes on Duna alone that would require a change in orbital attitude alone to get an approach to. With the navigation system as it is(with a couple extra nodes in stock coming soon, I hope) finding the way to get there is already available and made easy.\n\nIf you need practice, just take a couple flights to Minmus and on your return aim for as close to the KSC as you can.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T06:24:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 06:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by samstarman5**"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T15:34:09Z","Content":"I would LOVE to see varied axial tilt on planets and moons!"}]}
