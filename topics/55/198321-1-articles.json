You can literally be going at exactly 100 m/s in straight and level flight, press F3, then press F3 again a minute later. Instead of the expected 6 km it will tell you that you\u0027ve gone 11 km or something. It\u0027s not a constant multiple of the actual value.

If you go east at 175 m/s it overestimates distance. Not negates it entirely. Zeroing your orbital speed will not zero your travel distance.\u00A0And plus, they have no trouble with surface speed readouts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you go down the runway at 1 m/s, it will not say you went 176 times further than you did. Only around double-ish. Again it\u0027s wrong for orbital speed travel distance too. And if you mean Kerbin\u0027s motion around Kerbol, not Kerbin\u0027s rotation, then it\u0027s even more wrong, because it certainly doesn\u0027t tell you you\u0027ve moved 800 km after a minute of standing still.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurthermore, its speed estimate can be off by well over 200 m/s. I\u0027ve seen someone post that distance in a way that implied their Turboram-powered jet plane could average 2700 m/s. That\u0027s an error of like \u0026gt;1200 m/s, not 200. But it doesn\u0027t consistently double distances either.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally I would still consider it a bug if\u00A0 it went by orbital speed. When I\u0027m in orbit, that\u0027s not even on my top 20 list for information I care about, and there\u0027s a solid argument that distance over land should still be relative to that land, not relative to the core of Kerbin.\u00A0 One area where this would be clearly superior would be Kerbostationary satellites, where it serves as a measure of the average amount of motion of the satellite from its ideal fixed position over Kerbin\u0027s equator. Further still, when I am NOT in orbit, orbital distance travelled is just not very important information, while basic things like fuel budgetting, surveying the size of a landform ingame, etc are much harder if you don\u0027t have an accurate estimate of surface distance travelled. Not orbital.
