However, it is only available after you\u0027ve launched, meaning you have to design and launch your rocket before you can use it to figure out the optimal flightpath. I propose adding a special \u0027astrodynamics\u0027 facility to the space center, which gives you access to the solar system map (similar to the tracking station), but where you would be able to add a special \u0022launch node\u0022 by clicking on a space center icon or specifying coordinates on any planet. The launch node would allow you to specify the orbit a hypothetical spacecraft would initially launch into, and would estimate the required delta-v (and thrust/weight ratio, etc.). It would then be possible to add maneuver nodes to this starting orbit and plan a whole mission. Time warp should be available, but since this is a \u0027simulation\u0027 it won\u0027t effect the \u0027real\u0027 universe time, and it will be possible to scrub both forward and backward, allowing players to identify launch windows and useful planetary alignments ahead of time. In addition to enabling the planning of more complex missions that require precisely timed launches to take advantage of planetary alignments, it will allow players to know the delta-v requirements of these complex flights up front, before they\u0027ve designed their spacecraft. Beyond just helping advanced players efficiently execute more complicated missions, this will greatly aid beginners, who don\u0027t already know the approximate delta-v need to reach the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, or when the launch windows between Kerbin and Duna are, and it builds on already established systems, so I think it would be a very logical addition to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T21:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeconded. That is a level of complexity which I may never need as the game sits now but if such system were provided, I would absolutely use it. It would be even better if something like this would come with a stock equivalent of kerbal alarm clock. You could use preplanning to mark out all your major phase angle intervals and set up the alarm system (or even have those intervals precoded into the preplanner).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dlrk","CreatedById":60033,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T21:53:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-28T22:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m fairly certain that something like this is planned for a future update, as mentioned in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOfficial Planned Features List.\u003C/a\u003E The entry there is not verified, so I can\u0027t be completely sure that it is planned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, I think this is a good idea.
