I want to tell Pandora to skip, or hit next on a YouTube video, respond to a private message in Discord, or whatever, and things go wonky with a lot of games in full-screen mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using multiple-monitors for many years now, and almost everyone I know uses multiple-monitors. It\u0027s anecdotal for me, but I suspect that multi-monitor is very popular and becoming the norm if it isn\u0027t already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are lots of games that handled Windowed-Mode very well, they usually are ones that don\u0027t care what size the window is set to, I can click the little \u0022Full-Screen\u0022 button (not true full screen) between the little line for minimize and the \u0027X\u0027 for close, and they pop into filling the entire screen up, and they generally work really well. Not always, but most.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s another category, that Kerbal Space Program falls into, which is to have fixed sizes for me to choose from. I don\u0027t know why a fixed size is necessary in a game like Kerbal, or many of the others, but they have it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is, they don\u0027t account for the Window-Head, or Banner at the top of the window, in Windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if I set them to 1920x1080, for example, on a 1920x1080 screen, the foot of the window disappears of the screen. On Kerbal this hides the YAW, The names of my passengers, the HDG, and other things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some games, it just hides picture real-estate, but in other games like Kerbal, it actually hides information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d recommend getting rid of fixed window sizes if possible, or making an option that allows a player to set the window size to anything they want it to be in windowed mode, and leave the fixed sizes in for whoever might want them (I can\u0027t imagine how, but I suspect someone likes them fixed or they wouldn\u0027t exist as an option).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, I\u0027d appreciate it if you-folks took Window\u0027s window-heads into account in the future, with all games, as well as fixed it for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n=-=-=-=\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m aware of programs that exist to make games borderless windowed, and some games even come with that as an option. Some games and programs don\u0027t play nice with that extra program for me, and I feel game companies should have figured this out by now and I shouldn\u0027t be required to run a third-party software for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, not all games function well in borderless-windowed mode that come with it as an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not looking for feedback from general forum users, I\u0027m offering a suggestion and feedback of my own to the current developers of KSP and KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-06T08:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223966819\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202212\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221620232217\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119064\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sasuga\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Sasuga said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using multiple-monitors for many years now, and almost everyone I know uses multiple-monitors.
