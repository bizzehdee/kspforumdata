You switch to IVA view of your MK2 Lander Can and you realize there\u0027s nobody sitting in the pilot seat and the ship is steering itself like a Flying Dutchman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I thought the second seat in the Lander Can could get some controls, too. Or perhaps they could switch seats automatically when the pilot leaves. Because I always find that view quite disturbing and sending the Kerbal on EVA to switch seats during reentry is not very safe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
