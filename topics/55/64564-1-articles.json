Even the console tech of the new consoles is not top of the line. For a limited budget you can build a PC that is not much more expensive and will equal or surpass the consoles. Secondly, pretty much everyone needs a PC for other purposes anyway. The difference in cost between a basic PC and one that plays games decently (I am not talking about high-end 120 fps rigs here) is a lot smaller than the new consoles will set you back and will easily outperform them. A PC is a much more versatile tool which most people will purchase anway. Games or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not saying one or the other is better - that is totally up to your personal preferences and play style, but costs are not really an argument, especially if you take game prices into account too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T15:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing about PC\u0027s, if you know what you\u0027re doing, you can have a PC that will last longer than a console.
