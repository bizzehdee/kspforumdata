A game that entered the market in 2012 and 2013 as a great way to build and launch Lego style rockets, was a massive success for an indie game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilt on the idea of exploding your way to success and the stars (least for me in 2013, see the old mottos of \u201Cadd more boosters/struts\u201D, \u201Cwent better than last time\u201D, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, in the 5-6 years since then, the game has changed and evolved. In ~2014, KSP finally made the first step to taking itself serious as it received the NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission update which brought real NASA concepts to KSP. Then, in 2016, KSP got the next realistic addition when the B126 (whatever the number) added the Asteroid Day Pack to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTruly KSP has grown in more ways than could be counted. As such, it does beg the question now that new packs have been added like Spaceplane\u002B and such.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is- \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat is KSP\u2019s current image? What does it want to be? What does it want to become?\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday, the game has become a mash of content and goals while the focus has been lost. Which is helping to blur the question- what\u2019s next? More KSP content? More DLCs? KSP2? Understandably Squad/T2 don\u2019t want to announce any plans they\u2019ll have to cancel and end up building hype for promises they can\u2019t keep- makes sense. But the lack of direction, the merging of so many ideas and directions has left the game aimless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know as a sandbox game it shouldn\u2019t force a perspective. Leave that to the player. But it can\u2019t hurt to give a theme. A style. A\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edirection\u003C/em\u003E. Some fresh indication of what KSP is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout this, asking for new suggestions, new content or DLC is kind of ineffective. Some clear indication of intent needs to be present to show what\u2019s planned and what kind of future to expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just my opinion on the matter however. So take it as it is. Thanks for bothering to read.

A game that entered the market in 2012 and 2013 as a great way to build and launch Lego style rockets and was a massive success for an indie game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuilt on the idea of exploding your way to success and the stars (least for me in 2013, see the old mottos of \u201Cadd more boosters/struts\u201D, \u201Cwent better than last time\u201D, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, in the 5-6 years since then, the game has changed and evolved. In ~2014, KSP finally made the first step to taking itself serious as it received the NASA Asteroid Redirect Mission update which brought real NASA concepts to KSP. Then, in 2016, KSP got the next realistic addition when the B126 (whatever the number) added the Asteroid Day Pack to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTruly KSP has grown in more ways than could be counted. As such, it does beg the question now that new packs have been added like Spaceplane\u002B and such.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe question is-\u003Cu\u003E\u00A0what is KSP\u2019s current image?

Which is helping to blur the question- what\u2019s next? More KSP content? More DLCs? KSP2? Understandably Squad/T2 don\u2019t want to announce any plans they\u2019ll have to cancel and end up building hype for promises they can\u2019t keep- makes sense. But the lack of direction, the merging of some many ideas and directions has left the game aimless.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I know as a sandbox game it shouldn\u2019t force a perspective. Leave that to the player. But it can\u2019t hurt to give a theme. A style. A\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edirection\u003C/em\u003E. Some fresh indication what KSP is.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout this, asking for new suggestions, new content or DLC is kind of ineffective. Some clear indication of intent needs to be present to show what\u2019s planned and what kind of future to expect for the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just my opinion on the matter however.
