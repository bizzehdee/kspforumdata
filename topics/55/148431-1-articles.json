We could get some really neat and creative things going on with just adding this one thing. I\u0027m sure there are countless things we can come up with, but the great thing about it is it would add so much play value to the game, for such an easy thing to insert.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027d probably want\u00A0to be able to assign a value to the Delay, and all the actions would need to flow top down for it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust an idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royying","CreatedById":20591,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T05:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup, this is also the solution of\u00A0\u0022cannot be\u00A0deployed\u00A0while stowed\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T06:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, there aren\u0027t many things I assign to action groups that require a sequencer of sorts.
