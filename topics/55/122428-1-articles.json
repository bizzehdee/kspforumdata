In my opinion the idea of ISRU is pretty damn cool, but the problem is the game doesn\u0027t force you to use it much.\u003Cp\u003EImagine if LS became a thing. Add crew rotation and KIS/KAS-like base maintance contracts and suddenly getting fuel from the surface of the planet becomes a key to keep your base alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say you have a Duna base and you need to keep it occupied by crew for X years, because a contracts tells you to do so. There\u0027s also a contract that tells you to rotate the crew from time to time. The base has a functioning shuttle (that needs refuelling after going to orbit and back) that carries the crew to the interplanetary mothership and returns back to base with new colony/base members. You also need to get some new water/other LS resource from the ground, because otherwise your base inhabitants will starve to death. So now ISRU not only keeps your shuttle functional but also keeps your crew alive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah.
