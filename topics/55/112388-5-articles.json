Just observe those moons and you\u0027ll see that they are all unique in some crazy way. For example, only Fonso, the planned moon around GP2, has mountains heighter that it\u0027s atnosphere. Only Daphy has large cracks and an ogherwise smooth surface, Only Potatus is oblate... Things like that. Also, Faz, an old unimplemented planet had huge crystals on it\u0027s surface, something only developers cab add to a planet.

I have no interest in doing the same sort of missions with even worse mass margin. Constant optimization is a one trick pony, but giving new toy to play with you could reconsider doing bigger thing elsewhere, like that giant ISRU base on Laythe you were too lazy to carry.\n\nIt would be pointless to add clone-planet or ridiculously specific hat-planet with only one new challenge, when you could retroactively give new challenge to every other planets at once.\n\nAs example, take the case of heat radiators :\n\nNow heat transfer rate between the inside and the outside matter, which mean we can actually have planet/biome that require special heat consideration, making temperature scan matter ! More stuff to design for WITHOUT adding more planet.\n\nAnd lastly whatever feature a new planet/moon could have, can be added to old planets the same (Geyser, spiked-mountain, plateau, cave, floor is lave, rings...etc)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T07:16:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I like the idea of more destinations to fly to, but I must also point out hat the title of this thread is somewhat misleading.

Optimization and beautification, to be exact. The game loads so many things on start up, perhaps reducing that and loading things on demand would help. Maybe make it possible to \u0022background load\u0022? Loading parts of the game while playing other parts. Is that not doable? After optimizing, the game could use an improved look. Betters skybox, clouds, and maybe better textures?\n\nAfter that, more interesting terrain, like huge canyons and weird landforms, could make places more interesting. Also, a larger demand for going interplanetary. I could just grind contracts in the Kerbin system, and then fund science missions to fill out the tech tree. There needs to be a need to go interplanetary.
