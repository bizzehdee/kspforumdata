My design makes it a sort of combination of the SSME and F-1 Engines. The Poodle also has only had a texture pass, which is good, but I think it should look more like what many people use it for-a Service propulsion Engine for a C/SM. Of course these engines would stay the same size so craft wouldn\u0027t break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, sometimes you just don\u0027t have enough TWR for stages with a Skipper, but too much and too inefficent work for a mainsail. So a Twin-Engine could bridge the gap, which is ironically what the Skipper already did. It would have 1.7 or so times the thrust of the Skipper, in Twin-Engine form. In addition to bridging the gap between the Mainsail and Skipper, It could also serve an aesthetic purpose of being the only stock Twin Engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasmic","CreatedById":64885,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T19:05:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this suggestion wholeheartedly.
