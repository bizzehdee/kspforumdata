I tried taking to the station directly but after two 1/2 hours and two fuel resupply missions i gave up. My thought was that if I have a probe on say the Mun. And i get sci data from the surface. I should get the option to send it to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or a part that can store sci and has an antenna. Still have the transmit penalty but then I could process it in my station. Just a thought. What do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
