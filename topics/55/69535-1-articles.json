The issue that I have with this, and I\u0027m sure many others do too, is that you have one flag that sets both the graphics on the parts \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eand\u003C/span\u003E the flag itself. What I propose is that there are two graphic selection boxes: one for the flag, and one for the part decals. This would mean that I could use any flag I want without worrying about it looking bad on the side of the ship, or any decal I want without having to worry about it looking poor as a flag. This would open up a whole new scope in terms of such graphics - some players may want to have their company\u0027s logo on the side of their craft, but want to use a separate mission-specific flag to plant. Could this be done? What other possible solutions are there to this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
