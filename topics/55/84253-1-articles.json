I was hoping we will be talking about what we feel while standing on the surface of the Mun. On the side facing away from Kerbin. When we look up, and see only empty vastness of space. When we realize how small and fragile we are. How terribly far away we are from another living being, breathable air and all the coddling, lush environment we grew up in. How precious and irreplaceable our pale blue dot of a home is to us. And about this second realisation... We can go anywhere. Do anything.

In fact thats an important part of the game\u0027s atmosphere to me. Space is huge and you are rly small no matter how big a mission is and thats something special.

It\u0027s a long way from home\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I do agree it gets boring from time to time and more important is the fact that it can be a little disapointing to set food on a new planet/moon and realize that it\u0027s not rly interesting, unique and tbh worth the trip... I am not sure if science is the right tool to fix that entitely. Easter eggs/anomalies and things like the eve mod helped me to enhance the atmosphere a lot. I had a great time cruising around on the mun in a big manned rover looking for the N.A. memorial. That was one of the few moments when the game rly showed deep atmosphere. I would like to have more reasons to actually drive or maybe walk to a location. It would forcee me to actually spent some time on the surface and realise that I am in completely different world.
