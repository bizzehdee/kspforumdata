Others have delved more carefully into the balance between individually collected science vs contract rewards, but I think the real issue is that experiments currently are just clicking a thing in a biome, and don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t resemble conducting real science. There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nothing substantively different between running a gravoli experiment vs a temperature scan other than where they can be activated. My suggestion is that each experiment needs to be a real activity that is fun, challenging, rewarding, and in some way resembles the way a real study would work. Moreover, in addition to science payoffs, the data experiments collect should be \u003Cem\u003Euseful in and of itself\u003C/em\u003E. More could be added and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d love to hear others\u0027 suggestions, but here\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s my best crack at it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMystery Goo Containment Unit\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This could remain mostly unchanged and left early in the tech tree as an introduction to the concept of science and biomes. Activate it and if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in a new biome you receive a set science reward.

While on, it collects and saves temperature data whenever it enters a new biome, (it stores whatever it collects indefinitely) but it consumes .1 e/s while activated. It does not collect data when outside of near-space of any body, but data is 75% transmittable. In addition to its science pay-out, re-entry and engine overheat would be visible in logged biomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPresMat Barometer\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 The third experiment to be unlocked, this essentially pays off based on how great a swath of an atmosphere it passes through while continually activated. Each atmospheric biome has a set load and the swath from the edge of the atmosphere to the surface represents %100 of it. An easy use will be running it during launch, but as the data is 90% transmittable its real benefit comes from drop-probes with batteries and an antenna. It draws .1 e/s while activated. Additionally, once an air column is observed, trajectories through it would accurately reflect drag if piloted by an adequately trained pilot (level 3 or so)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESC-9001 Science Jr\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This will be in many ways the most important science module in the game. Instead of being functionally identical to the goo canister, the Materials Bay will have 5 slots to load materials either at launch or using a Science Lab operated by a level 3 scientist or higher. At the point of being unlocked there will be three KSC available materials \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Distilled Water, Soil, and Nematodes, but others can be collected in the form of surface samples and atmospheric samples. Each surface or atmospheric sample yields 5 materials, and generally material values will correspond to how hard to reach they are. Once activated, the Materials bay will expose the samples it contains for 30 days, with each sample paying off based on its own multiplier as well as the multiplier of the biome it was exposed in. Once exposed those samples are dead and the Materials bay cannot be re-used unless reloaded by an adequately staffed Science Lab. This means that collecting and distributing samples becomes a real game mechanic, rather than just filing a checklist. The materials bay consumes no energy, but results can only be transmitted at 25%. This could be a great thing to run in orbital stations or bases. I would normally not be a fan of long-duration experiments, but I think the non-repeatability of it makes time-warping possible but not advantageous or broken in any way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESensor Array Computing Nose Cone\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This experiment collects atmospheric samples, but must run at a roughly constant speed and altitude for 10 seconds to successfully collect a sample. It consumes .5 e/s while activated, shuts off automatically after 10 seconds, and can collect up to 5 samples. These samples, like surface samples, can be loaded into the Materials Bay for additional science payout. Results pay out only 25% on transmission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGRAVMAX Negative Gravoli Detetector\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This instrument like the 2HOT Thermometer is toggleable, but is now essentially the biome-mapping instrument. Best used in a polar orbit, it pays off based on how much surface area it maps. It could have a detection radius of 200km or so, be 90% transmittable, but consume .25 e/s while running for balance. Once recorded, the biomes would be a visible in map mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDouble-C Seismic Accelerometer\u003C/strong\u003E \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 This now becomes the impactor instrument. Placeable only by level 4 scientists, it burrows itself in the surface, detecting a range of 300km or so, and pays out based on the overlapping area between its sensor range and the impact area, which is determined by impactor inertia. In addition to large science payouts, this could detect the richness of resource deposits within range. (In this paradigm, the resource detector would tell you where resources are, but not how rich they are without a surface sample or impactor study.) The experiment requires no outside electricity, and its results are 90% transmittable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general idea is that each of these experiments would be harder to execute, but yield larger rewards, and require less grind and repetition. Also because the data collected would be invaluable to future missions, the entire practice of sending unmanned probes to do preliminary research would be a major part of exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure there are other cool experiments that could be part of it, (high level scientists taking core samples, EM-scans, etc.) but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m just starting here to upgrade what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s currently available.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-18T15:15:26Z\u0022 title=\u002204/18/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnV","CreatedById":79006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T07:31:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn idea inspired by this thread: a logging instrument which records the results of other experiment parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can plot a chart of data you recorded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith it players get a flight profile of whatever they recorded: temperature, atmosphere density or gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means players can analysis the environment with stock tools, no need to check the wiki to find out the scale height of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-16T07:40:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2015 07:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SaturnV\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-16T08:58:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the problem is that science experiments are not persistent. Now, by that I mean that when you conduct an experiment anywhere in the solar system, you can lug it around wherever you want, then take it home and collect the full science reward.

It might even show ideal ascent profiles given your vessel\u0027s aerodyamics. Of course people could look things up and do the math to figure this out as we do now, but like making biomes visible in map mode it\u0027s really about the convenience and 1-1 kind of reward for gathering information before you mount a larger mission.
