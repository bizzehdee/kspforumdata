I do find it a pro on some of my craft to have this option. Whether I can drag Elevons closer inward or from back to front to distribute roll/pitch authority it is not always aesthetically preffered.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome of my planes have way more Roll control like CaptainTrebor mentioned. Moving Elevons inward may solve it all, but it may then look like crap.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis idea will prevent that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
