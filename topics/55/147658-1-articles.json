And who would have thought, but KSP actually works! The only \u0022problem\u0022 I\u0027m facing is that the UI spans over all screens, which, for my setup at least, looks really weird (having to move the mouse across two and a half screens just to exit the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E after part selection... yeah).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to fix it? Like, have one \u0022main\u0022 monitor and the others just for extended FOV. Native support would be great ofc, but a mod would also be cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do call myself a programmer, so I guess I could try hacking something together if anyone cood tell me where to start... I have never developed a mod for KSP though, and generally don\u0027t know the games code. And I suspect for something like that you would need to know at least some things about it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T17:28:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome light reading:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/132021-11-and-multiple-monitors/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the closest thing I found that sort of worked, was this:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/114181-wip-multi-monitor-screen-space/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope someone gets SOMETHING working soon, that doesnt require a seperate computer, or running multiple instances of KSP at once on the SAME computer... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoney3K","CreatedById":139954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-14T18:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, give us a multi-monitor mode that can display a flight view on one screen and the map view on the other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E or anywhere else but the flight screen, this could display the KSPedia or the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
