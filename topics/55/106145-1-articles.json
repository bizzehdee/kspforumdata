It\u0027s completely different from pre-1.0 versions. Throttle isn\u0027t nearly as much as a deciding factor as it was earlier. And no, you don\u0027t need wings or other extra parts for radiation.\n\nShort version: You want to spread heat through your whole ship so every part can do it\u0027s job at radiating heat. Nuclear T/W above 0.4 might be unsustainable now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T00:01:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Argon","CreatedById":103523,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:01:22Z","Content":"My wording, despite being biased does reflect the problem, the once steadfast nuke now overheats at half throttle unless a massive unaerodynamic array of wings is stuck to it, if squad wanted to make a dedicated heatsink part I would be fine, however they did not.
