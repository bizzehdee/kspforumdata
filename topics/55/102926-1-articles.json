Possibly the same for fuel transfers as well. \n\nWhat I mean is, if you are building a rocket and it\u0027s just over weight for your launchpad you can reduce some fuel in 1 of the tanks. Problem with this is you get unbalanced fuel/oxidizer ratio. Maybe make it so that when you slide the fuel down it will move oxidizer at the same time to match, so if you slide your fuel down and the tank has 89.9% fuel it will also have 89.9% oxidizer. Moving oxidizer should not be linked that way you can still have a tank with less(or no) oxidizer for your spaceplanes with air breathing engines. \n\nanother nice option would be able to type in the fields so you can easily set your engine trust limiter to 50 or 1.5 without having to fumble the slider(or maybe 2 arrow buttons for 100/10 that turn to 1/0.1 steps with fine control capslock/shift pressed)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T22:34:55Z","Content":"I heartily endorse the keyboard input idea. Moving a tiny slider to get a desired numeric value is sometimes an exercise in frustration, when we have a keyboard right in front of us designed explicitly to enter numeric values quickly and easily.\n\nLinked sliders are a good idea, too, as long as they are optional."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T01:05:26Z","Content":"I also support this with one change to the request...add an option so that tyou can choose whether or not you want to have the sliders linked (for the case of SSTOs)"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T01:36:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I heartily endorse the keyboard input idea.\n\nSame here.
