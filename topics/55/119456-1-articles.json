Compared to solids and gases, liquid molecules tend to be packed very closely while in their liquid state, and it takes vast amounts of energy to reduce these gaps at a molecular level, much more than can be supplied by mere electric charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Compression of substances generally only reduces their volume, while their mass remains the same. Other than the (hypothetical and trivial) weight savings from using less material for the tank pressure vessel, there is no way a compressed liquid fuel tank would be any lighter than a full-sized tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - There is no magic substance that can reduce/increase the apparent mass of a substance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T04:57:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI concur with Sumghai. There is nothing sensible about this idea. Not only are you proposing that something that is fairly incompressible be compressed so that you can carry 5x as much of it but... it doesn\u0027t see a corresponding 5x mass increase?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook, you\u0027re certainly free to play how you want though; it\u0027s your sandbox. I can\u0027t imagine though that you\u0027re going to get a lot of support for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T05:37:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is an infinite fuel cheat....\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
