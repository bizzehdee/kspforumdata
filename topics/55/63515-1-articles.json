After it is assembled, some years have to pass in game time and the inside of the dome will resemble the conditions on Kerbin (grass, trees, breathable air). After this happens, ordinary KSC-like base buildings could be built in the dome, rather than pressure vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T22:11:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m down for long term structures.
