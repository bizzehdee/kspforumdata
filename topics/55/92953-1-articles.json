I think we need a search bar to find the vessels we want in the clutter. I know we have filters but they don\u0027t help say if you have 20\u002B probe ships.

(If that\u0027s a word?) It would be awesome if I could search for vessels by name. While SQUAD is at it, I\u0027d really appreciate it if flags didn\u0027t count as flights. It\u0027s always mildly confusing that I have 38 flights, when only a dozen of those are active probes, stations, or manned vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaLVin-K","CreatedById":118452,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T22:06:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion is that satellites that are fulfill a fine print contract are placed in a separate category, perhaps called satellites?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T22:44:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaLVin-K\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaLVin-K\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother suggestion is that satellites that are fulfill a fine print contract are placed in a separate category, perhaps called satellites?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYa this is a good idea.
