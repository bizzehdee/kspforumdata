Then you\u0027d select career and pick what you want to have to do. Train Kerbals, collect money, collect science, whatever. If you check it (and everything should be checked to start then you have to gain it after starting with either none or a little. If you uncheck everything, the game is functionally similar to Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...which would make Sandbox not necessary. Maybe just as a button.
