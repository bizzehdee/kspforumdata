Well, it may take some resources, but it seems to me like the modders are doing it successfully for the past 4 years? And get this: FOR FREE!!! And this is my discontent with KSP. They have the resources, they make the money, they ask for the money people pay for the game. I think I\u0027m pretty entitled to request such things since I bought the game and the expansion and I am allowed to express my dissatisfaction with some of the product features. If KSP wants me to continue purchasing their products, as the customer, they need to also to consider my wants and feedback.\u00A0Look, I\u0027m not asking for dumb multiplayer or other stupid kinder stuff, I just want the game to be improved visually. If that seems like it is too much, then maybe I guess I\u0027m talking to the wrong crowd. Again, amateurs did it for FREE!

This is something that developers seem to ignore a lot and then end up on the chopping block and go bankrupt. There is a crisis in the gaming industry recently, where a lot of companies lost plenty of stock because they liquided enough players and told them \u0022if you don\u0027t like our game, don\u0027t buy it\u0022 and then the players didn\u0027t buy it. And then they accuse the players of being bad people for not buying the game. You know which games I\u0027m talking about. And by the looks of it, Take-Two has lost a lot during the last 6 moths, in stocks.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(check out the 6M values).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I\u0027m trying to say is: you may be a fanboi and consider anybody criticizing the game to be the enemy, but I have the wallet. And my wallet isn\u0027t infinite. My money will go to the developers that give a crap about their product and\u00A0their customers.

Well, it may take some resources, but it seems to me like the modders are doing it successfully for the past 4 years? And get this: FOR FREE!!! And this is my discontent with KSP. They have the resources, they make the money, they ask for the money people pay for the game. I think I\u0027m pretty entitled to request such things since I bought the game and the expansion and I am allowed to express my dissatisfaction with some of the product features. If KSP wants me to continue purchasing their products, as the customer, they need to also to consider my wants and feedback.\u00A0Look, I\u0027m not asking for dumb multiplayer or other stupid kinder stuff, I just want the game to be improved visually. If that seems like it is too much, then maybe I guess I\u0027m talking to the wrong crowd. Again, amateurs did it for FREE!

This is something that developers seem to ignore a lot and then end up on the chopping block and go bankrupt. There is a crisis in the gaming industry recently, where a lot of companies lost plenty of stock because they liquided enough players and told them \u0022if you don\u0027t like our game, don\u0027t buy it\u0022 and then the players didn\u0027t buy it. And then they accuse the players of being bad people for not buying the game. You know which games I\u0027m talking about. And by the looks of it, Take-Two has lost a lot during the last 6 moths, in stocks.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(check out the 6M values).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I\u0027m trying to say is: you may be a fanboi and consider anybody criticizing the game to be the enemy, but I have the wallet.

Notice that I was not complaining about the characters since I think they fit in the goofy aspect of the game. But not having BASIC lighting effects, atmosphere effects, reflections and so on, is just a poor show from SQUAD, in the current year. We\u0027re pushing 8GB texture limits on games and this game is so badly optimized for what it is offering. Remember how they discontinued the 32 bit version because it was constantly running out of memory? For what? The graphics to not justify this. If I had to look at the game in vanilla mode and have to guess the VRAM used I\u0027d say 512MB plus no more than 1GB or RAM. It isn\u0027t worth more than that.

But the lack of proper lighting effects, atmosphere and reflections, is something that make the game look unfinished and amateur-ish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid I mention Planet Shine? Yeah, you need that mod because SQUAD fails to implement proper lightning into the game.

Who demanded part revamping? How many requests were there? I know people asked for the parts to be FIXED, but not remodeled. A lot of people demanded the things I mentioned, but SQUAD keeps ignoring these suggestions \u0022not because they are easy, but because they are hard\u0022.

The 2012 graphics\u00A0isn\u0027t working for me anymore. I have been spoiled by modern graphics and I feel no attraction towards a game that sticks to turd outdated graphics. And I am not a graphics snob or elitist. I can enjoy a game that has been discontinued and got stuck in the past with the graphics. I can put up with vomit inducing outdated graphics if the game development stopped years ago, 10-20 years in the past. Some games even look fine with the old graphics, especially retro ones, but KSP wants to be a modern title, using a modern engine, still being developed. Time to stop being lazy.

The parts were also dying for an art pass, and it doesn\u0027t do much good to have a fancy lighting model if its shining on 6 year old models and textures. Most of us who have been around here a long time have come to know progress is never as lickity-split as everyone wishes. KSP is a unique kind of game and Squad has a relatively small staff. Some folks grumble, others of us are more patient. Im sure they\u0027ll get to things like clouds and atmospheric scattering.

Well, it may take some resources, but it seems to me like the modders are doing it successfully for the past 4 years? And get this: FOR FREE!!! And this is my discontent with KSP. They have the resources, they make the money, they ask for the money people pay for the game. I think I\u0027m pretty entitled to request such things since I bought the game and the expansion and I am allowed to express my dissatisfaction with some of the product features. If KSP wants me to continue purchasing their products, as the customer, they need to also to consider my wants and feedback.\u00A0Look, I\u0027m not asking for dumb multiplayer or other stupid kinder stuff, I just want the game to be improved visually. If that seems like it is too much, then maybe I guess I\u0027m talking to the wrong crowd. Again, amateurs did it for FREE! Let that sink in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this seems to you like it is me asking the impossible, then we\u0027re done here, but the thing is that I can play other games and then not bother with this company at all in the future, or their publisher. This is something that developers seem to ignore a lot and then end up on the chopping block and go bankrupt. There is a crisis in the gaming industry recently, where a lot of companies lost plenty of stock because they liquided enough players and told them \u0022if you don\u0027t like our game, don\u0027t buy it\u0022 and then the players didn\u0027t buy it. And then they accuse the players of being bad people for not buying the game. You know which games I\u0027m talking about. And by the looks of it, Take-Two has lost a lot during the last 6 moths, in stocks.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ttwo\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(check out the 6M values).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I\u0027m trying to say is: you may be a fanboi and consider anybody criticizing the game to be the enemy, but I have the wallet. And my wallet isn\u0027t infinite. My money will go to the developers that give a crap about their product and\u00A0their customers. And if KSP does not care about their game or the customer, I won\u0027t really bother caring about them. You can understand from this long post whatever you want. I have spoken EXACTLY what I think.

It can make you use math, but to use it, you have to know it. The only thing it does is teach you some basics about orbital mechanics, but nothing more. Everything else is broken in the sense that it does not make scientific sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a G4560, a budget dual core\u00A0CPU, not even close to your i7, and the same video card. I max out on all settings and run comfortably (60 fps)\u00A0any ship I designed (including the ones in my signature). I can record and post it here to prove it, I\u0027ll use MSI Afterburner to show the numbers.\u00A0I mean I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing wrong on your pc, but that should run better than what you\u0027re describing. You gotta invest in some ram, in case you\u0027re still running 4GB, because this game is so poorly designed it just gobbles up all your ram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there must be something wrong with your ships. Mine never have issues with performance. I usually limit my stuff to around 300 parts with minimal clipping. Again, that because I learned that the code is garbage and causes huge amounts of ram to disappear when you start building ships too large or too complex. If an i7 cannot keep up with your ship design, maybe it is time to rethink how you build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also, KSP is anything but minecraft in space, that sentence makes no sense. Minecraft is a resource gathering and item crafting game. What resource do you gather here exactly that allows you to craft? If you\u0027re going to say credits, then that means any RTS, city builder, or whatever game that involves credits is minecraft. Surely, they aren\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are looking for a minecraft in space experience, I would say Astroneer is what you\u0027re looking for, a game that, by the way, is running on the more demanding Unreal engine, is also kinda poorly optimized but I can still run at 60fps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystik","CreatedById":172088,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-05T08:35:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223575957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221554392819\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187168\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lisias\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Lisias said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has already decent graphics for me.
