There is of course a hack that several of y\u0027all probably know or even use that is handy for AMD/ATI card users. All that really needs work is the UI that is Unity styled as the Main Menu works great at scaling. For any fellow KSP players out there with any capability of testing out 4K (through native solutions (very rare and expensive at this moment), driver solutions, or hack solutions), feel free to post any screenshots or test results here. I know this kind of suggestion is of very low priority, but I thought I would put it on the table for future access. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-25T19:38:32Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2014 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Bandock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged the links around to consume less bandwidth.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T19:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to save bandwidth, link the images.
