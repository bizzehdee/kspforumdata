However I have one small problem with it, though the roads and pathways surrounding each building look good, shouldn\u0027t there be roads in between? I don\u0027t think the top kerbal military brass and super genius scientists want to muddy their shoes or get dirt on their fancy white coats.

It\u0027s a Alpha, it\u0027s forgiven. The code probably isn\u0027t that good optimized yet. They probably have to learn some programming stuff along the way. Unity has some issues on that part too. But I look past that. Someday that HAS to be better and or fixed. Otherwise your doomed.. If they want to finish a real, well working Kerbal Space Program version, they can\u0027t get away without a 64 bit version, and or without multi-core support. Cause that\u0027s the standard now a days. And I know they fight with all power to get at least a 64 bit version to get working property. Because the devs feel there limitations too when it comes to memory usage and stuff like that. I look past that cause with all the problems Kerbal maybe now has, it shouldn\u0027t be a problem in the future because it has at least a year, or two or maybe more to even consider finish. And if Kerbal reached that point, it should be running a lot smoother with a lot less memory/CPU problem and limitations as it has right now. So, no excuse..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
