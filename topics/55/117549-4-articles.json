Also, the cockpit seats 2 Kerbals side by side without helmet, where the crew cabin seats 4, in 2 rows of 2, with no useful props or instruments around them except for their seats.\n\u003E Capsules may not be pressurized entirely (instead, only the suits would be pressurized) so they need more room inside to accomodate EVA suits.\n\u003E \n\u003E A 1,25m 2-Kerbal command pod would theoretically fit, barely, but don\u0027t expect any room for your Kerbals to move in to, I don\u0027t know, move the ship\u0027s controls or push any buttons.\n\n2 people that didn\u0027t read.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It just means the cockpit is broken, too, frankly. Can the kerbals EVA? Is there an airlock? If not, the entire space inside the cabin is depressurized (as in a capsule) and they must have helmets on.\n\u003E The scale chosen by Squad was 100% arbitrary WRT the size and geometry of Kerbals and their gear. Perhaps the smallest size should in fact have been 1.75m, or 1.9m. That or they could have arbitrarily made kerbals X% smaller. Whatever path they take/took, the IVAs should be 100% inside the actual part model (with appropriate thickness of those external walls), and the kerbals should fit inside, fully suited if that is something the part requires (any part that allows EVA).\n\u003E \n\u003E That we are possibly saddled with parts that break this is bad, but it would be worse to add new parts that knowingly break this notion, IMO.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I just looked at the 2 mk1 parts in question, and there is room for the helmets. In the crew cabin, they should have them in place of the bundles of whatever it is under the windows. The head centers slightly overlap the hatch outline.\n\nThis is exactly my point, the size is arbitrary and therefore you can have a 2 man capsule in 1.25m format.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As I said earlier..

By this I mean a LOOSE set of \u0022best practices\u0022 for making stock-alike, crewed parts.\n\nFor example: \n\nShort duration flight cabins should have some minimum dimensions for the pilot seat and controls. Miscellaneous equipment and structure = ~X m^3 (slop, basically, might be expressed as a percentage of total volume). Note that this might also be linked to crash strength and heat tolerance. Life support for spacecraft should be ~Y m^3 per seat minimally, and Z m^3 for any part considered \u0022long duration.\u0022 I\u0027d also include a volume requirement (might vary by tech node level) for batteries/electronic, and the density of mono.\n\nNote that this might be fractional m^3 in most cases. Again, no LS actually specified, just the idea that a \u0022habitat\u0022 module should dedicate some part of the volume to LS equipment/supplies. Then you might look at the mk1-2 pod, and see that the crew is seated far forward, and the rear contains some volume for the other stuff.\n\nVERY simple here, with the idea being that you don\u0027t make a new part that \u0022just fits\u0022 X kerbals, but it might fit them, plus mono, plus some room for supplies, etc, etc.\n\nThe facing together seating arraignment had not occurred to me, nice job, Darnok!"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T17:31:28Z","Content":"That isn\u0027t a good what to sit during launch unfortunately.
