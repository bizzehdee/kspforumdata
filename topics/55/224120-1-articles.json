I play on PS5. I csnt figure out how to go into construction mode during an EVA. I also can\u0027t figure out how to open the inventory slots for the modules. I can only open the slots in the storage boxes. The only thing I\u0027ve been able to do with kerbals inventory is the ground science stuff nothing else. Is this not a ps5 thing? What happens when a solar panel gets knocked off? Do you have to deorbit the station and fly up a new one?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
