I don\u0027t think a Kerbal can fit in anything smaller.\n\nYou\u0027re hurting yourself trying to collect science on Kerbin as there is a reduction in the science you get. Go to Mun or Minmus for science and you\u0027ll get more faster. If you look at the rover from the perspective of it being a complicated remotely controlled robot, it makes some sense that it is further down the tech tree.\n\nI agree with you on the administration building.

Something where once you get your R\u0026D center to a certain level, it opens up an area where you can subject your craft to different pressure and airspeed conditions, and give you feedback on drag and lift. This would also let you plan aerobraking maneuvers better than save spam. I play with no reverts and no quicksave, because if I make a mistake I like it to feel like its a serious issue, but losing my pilots because the rocket flipped or the aerobrake was too high/low is almost random chance."},{"CreatedByName":"Wheffle","CreatedById":74893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:47:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E - The administration building now seems completely useless; too expensive for too little reward\n\nI do remember in 0.90 the funds-to-science strategy was ridiculously powerful, allowing me to fill out the tech tree before leaving Kerbin SOI.

Picture a blue-ish sphere with white lines for reference, where you set the size, gravity, atmosphere. And then you launch a copy-cat replica of a ship you created (say, it has the right shape and stages and all but it looks like it\u0027s a white plastic model for a wind tunnel). Then you can fiddle around with it ala hyperedit to see how it behaves. Hell, it could even be incorporated into career with different levels of simulation it can do so you have to upgrade it. It could even be it\u0027s own building!

Not having a passenger entrance doesn\u0027t stop you from doing rescue contracts though.
