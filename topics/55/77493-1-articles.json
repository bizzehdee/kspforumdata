Maybe this is because there are those advanced computery thingies near the smaller reaction wheel. So it both contains ASAS and a smaller reaction wheel wich is making it useful.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EThe idea is a new 2.5 m, simple reaction wheel, with the heavy torque of 80 ( like 4X1.25 m reaction wheel ).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E It would be useful for me, as sometimes I use quad-couplers with reaction wheels to have strong SAS in a vehicle.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EAnd if we\u0027re at ASAS, how about a thrust-controller system included in it or a new ring part, wich automaticly adjusts the trust of the vehicle\u0027s engines that the Center Of Thrust will be pointing towards the Center Of Mass?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E Here\u0027s an illustration:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mgbcaAQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mgbcaAQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EHere, the green arrows are the engines\u0027 thrusts. They could be adjusted by the mentioned computer that their summarized vector, the purple Center Of Thrust is pointong towards the Center Of Mass. The skipper engine\u0027s thrust will be reduced by this computer as fuel is being drained from the main tank and as the COM is moving towards the shuttle, making the COT moving backwards too.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ENormally, with shuttles, this adjustment is made manually, by right clicking the engines.

There, you have to counter the flipping of the craft by giving an angle to the COT.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EHow about a gimbal unit, wich could angle the engines you mount on them to make the COT pointing towards the COM?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E This could help those who would like to build the legendary shuttle.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CDwx8Dn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CDwx8Dn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat this unit would do is turning the engines -and the COT with them- towards the COM.

I use very strong wheels from mods, but a less stronger could come handy in stock too. About the gimbal: yes, In the original idea, I tought about not making it very overpowered, just frogot to write it down how. Edited.
