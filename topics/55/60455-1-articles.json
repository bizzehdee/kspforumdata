Maybe they could work something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. For every picture of a biome, you get science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If more biomes are in a picture, the more science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. the farther away, the less science (per biome)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Pictures on surface are good if they have certain features in them (like the lander, a crater, a Mun Arch)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Pictures of space are good if it is of another spacecraft and/or smaller body\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Certain pictures of something like a space station will add publicity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. And better cameras and telescopes later on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd maybe there could be an archive in the R\u0026amp;D building.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Philoman","CreatedById":88477,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T04:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually kind of like that publicity thing.. never thought of it.

And after we would have pictures from rovers, as the pictures done by Curiosity, on Mars or Huygens on Titan.

I just thought they could maybe give you like 20 to 50 science at a time, getting 75% science back with transmitting (problems with the photo, like getting grainy due to losses during transmission)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
