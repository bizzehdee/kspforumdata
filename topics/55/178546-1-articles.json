If it\u0027s possible to do, I think it would make\u00A0more sense to save the already-compiled game data (or as much of it as possible) to the hard drive\u00A0after everything is loaded so that it can be re-used for the next play session. Users would only need to rebuild their game data after changing something, such installing or updating a mod, and\u00A0faster load times would be a huge quality-of-life improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-26T12:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would put a lot of pressure and work on the hard drive, and you don\u0027t want that. Constant read-write instructions would slow down your pc (and shorten the life expectancy of your hdd/ssd) much more than loading everything from already reserved RAM space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-26T12:37:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK this already happens. The game still rescans all .cfg files to verify if anything changes, but if nothing changed, it just loads the cached/compiled versions. Which still takes obscenely long time but shorter than compiling them from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
