For some things, they do make a lot of sense, though, like wings and the existing stock fairings. I\u0027m starting to come around to procedural tanks, with the very least being content selection (this solves a bunch of problems and opens new possibilities). Procedural engines I\u0027m less keen on, to a large degree selection of engine is the biggest design factor in a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jab136","CreatedById":102504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T02:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif they did the procedural system correctly it would actually increase variety, they could just put a few textures in that can be swapped. as for welding, it would basically entail taking a fuselage and a wing and turning them into one part instead of two, which would allow for fewer physics calculations (you could still put some sort of failure criteria on the weld, but it would still probably help) also, the other benefit of procedural parts is that surface attach would work better for stacks of parts or wings, instead of just having one fuselage part attached via surface and the rest hanging off of it, they could surface attach along the entire length, thus increasing strength with less struts necessary, and thus less parts to model and apply physics to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: yah, come to think of it, engines probably wouldn\u0027t work for the most part, but tanks and wings would benefit greatly\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-10T02:14:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2015 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jab136\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T19:52:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust to counter-arguments,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural content, especially if they are active game-mechanic (engine \u0026amp; tank) rather than passive one (fairing), are so much of a pain to balance right that you recognize a game built around them by their simplicity and monotonous gameplay (MMO like Eve Online or Elite Dangerous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not to say that procedural generation do not have its use, quite the contrary.

I agree that the \u0022lego\u0022 style is a design choice, however it comes at a significant performance cost, and also makes the vehicles themselves structurally weaker. the lego style would remain, just with a few more procedural parts and therefore significantly more design options, which would only serve to make an already good game that much better.
