plasma enveloping the craft, the craft had LOS (line of sight) path to the sat, so that is why you had a connection there.\u00A0 Also, maybe, given the orbital speed of the satellite, your signal may have been occluded by Eve by the time your craft reached the point where it lost connection?\u00A0 Not sure, but it may not have been plasma depending.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo assuming your craft has LOS to the a sat for the duration of the launch and circularization, and your design allows your craft to get beyond the plasma zone prior to your circularization, you should regain control for performing the circularization burn.\u00A0 If you only have one sat I could definitely see having issues maintaining LOS if the sat is in too low or too high of an orbit such that its orbital speed causes your craft to not keep up with it (sat in low/fast orbit) or to leave it behind (sat in high/slow orbit) with regards to to signal occlusion by Eve.\u00A0 I\u0027m just

creates so much friction that the air turns to hot plasma around the craft which blocks radio waves.\u00A0 So if your velocity is very low or you are above the atmosphere you will have no plasma.\u00A0 I think in real life there typically isn\u0027t any plasma blackout on launch, only on deorbit.\u00A0 This is because launches from Earth are typically above air thick enough to create a lot of plasma by they time they are approaching those higher velocities.\u00A0 Consider that the camera feeds from a Falcon 9 launch are constant right up until the upper stage goes out of LOS with the ground station typically.\u00A0 So it has *nothing* to do with penetrating the atmosphere and is purely a function of air friction.\u00A0 I think that is where you are getting off track.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have never had any issue with LOS contact between Eve\u0027s surface and craft in orbit if I had LOS.\u00A0 Another possibility is are you sure your craft on Eve is using the satellite?\u00A0 With that weak of a signal and a big enough antenna you could be dealing with a direct connection to Kerbin and by the time you get up there in your launch Eve is in between your craft and Kerbin.\u00A0 What communications model are you using?\u00A0 CommNet?\u00A0 RealAntennas?\u00A0 RemoteTech?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you running out of

presence/density of atmosphere though.\u00A0 Atmospheric attenuation would realistically be very dependent on the wavelengths of the signal involved and how that wavelength would interact with the elements and compounds that make up the atmosphere so that would be a fairly big ask.\u00A0 It could get very complicated if you start taking into account ionospheres if they exist etc.\u00A0 On earth a segment of the HF band (maybe all of it, can\u0027t recall) radio bounces off the ionosphere allowing bouncing signals off of it and reaching points thousands of miles over the horizon when the conditions are right.\u00A0 But most non-HF frequencies go right through the ionosphere like visible light through a window.\u00A0 Water moisture tends to absorb microwave bands that are resonant with water molecules and so block it more.\u00A0 I have no idea what the filtering effect by band Eve\u0027s atmo would have, lol.\u00A0 I\u0027m pretty sure that RemoteTech, and maybe RealAntennas might do some atmospheric attenuation; you\u0027d need to read the docs on them to know for sure though.\u00A0 I gave up on RemoteTech as it is a resource hog and I found it to be
