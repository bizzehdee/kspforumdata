If it was like you right cliked it to change what type. This mostly applies to mk3 parts and mk2 parts. You could change something into a different part. It would be helpful when building large aircraft. Instead of a buch of tiny RCS tanks you could divide building time in half if you could change the long fuel tank to an rcs. Maby there could be a new part that works in some way as of changeing what it could be in flight if you have enough resources. This would add more variety to some parts and make base/station building much easier. Ex you launch a empty mk3 part and when you land at a base you change it into a habitation module.
