They said that there are features they still want to implement later. It seems to me that 1.0 is an arbitrary line that they have drawn for no apparent reason. Also I think quite a few people are overreacting such as the ones who are going on how the games is now ruined for some reason now that the version number has changed to 1.0. They explicitly stated that this is no where near the last update and that everything after this update will consist of many community recommendations. Everyone that is freaking out needs to calm down. On the other hand it is unwise to release all these features in one update and call it finished. But if they have one or two releases with these features it will give people enough time to find the worst bugs and Squad can then focus all of their efforts on bug squashing. But I also think it is too early, as someone else in this thread stated, to call if these features will make the game ready. In my opinion, if their are very few large bugs (the krakens will have to be gone and several annoying problems, looks at deouplers) and 64-bit is ironed out, the game is ready.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the problem is that 1.0 means the game is moving out of early access.

This level of modding indicates a game lacking in its subject representation or otherwise very limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally think stock KSP is nowhere near the level of bad that unmodded Rome Total War and Silent Hunter 5 are. It\u0027s a great game--for something that\u0027s barely beta. Because the devs enabled and documented how to mod KSP, a lot of modders have given it the polish to make it fantastic. But the shear breadth and depth of serious mods that many players consider essential indicates stock KSP still needs a lot of work, more than can be put into one release.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-24T20:00:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jacke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T19:58:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jacke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jacke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Esnip\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompletely agree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunken Hobo","CreatedById":52000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T19:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022 data-cite=\u0022klgraham1013\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t play to many early access games, but no. \u003Cp\u003EFor me, it\u0027s not that KSP isn\u0027t close to being done.
