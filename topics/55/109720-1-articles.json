You may even be right. But the current Nerva is just too damn small: the first vessel just doesn\u0027t warrant the use of nukes (IMO, all IMO -- can\u0027t stress this enough). Making the Nerva more powerful at the same TWR would rule out the small stuff, and would greatly improve the part count on the vessels that really need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease also note how even the totally overpowered, 5m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 tug still has a better fuel economy than a Skipper or Rhino.
