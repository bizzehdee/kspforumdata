It takes about six Pegasus pieces to get the range of a single Telus LV Bay, which means you\u0027d spend 6x the mass to get the same amount of ladder length.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T05:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso?

In real life ladders are usually built into parts so they stay balanced, there are not pieces of useless hardware mounted to the other side to balance them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only improvement I\u0027d like to see is the VAB/SPH to acknowledge their zero weight so the part description says zero, and placing it on the ship does not move the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
