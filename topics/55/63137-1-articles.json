I have been playing ksp for quite some time now and i\u0027m starting to love certain aspects of it. However most of these features are incomplete or just not meant to be implemented which saddens me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETerrain\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my favourite aspects of ksp are the planetary bodies it is so fun to go out to a planet EVA your kerbal and swim in Eve\u0027s oceans or laugh at Eeloo\u0027s weird texture it is so fun to jump and look at crates and weird terrain while also trying to find easter eggs scattered across the planets. What i would like to see is an improvement on this I want to see interesting terrain and \u0022events\u0022 such as volcanos, geysers maybe some planets having some kind of snow that kerbals walk slowly on and sink into it. A great example of this is the moon europe that orbits jupiter it is really cool as snow is created by geysers that lift up water into space turn it to snow and then stacks up in layers to create a snowy surface which leads me to weather on planets which would be so cool storms that you have to avoid and also snowstorms, sandstorms, heavy rain, acid rains, tornadoes the possibilities are endless first of all this would act as a beautiful for scenery and it would also make landing and EVA\u0027s much more restricted but mostly just for the amazing view that you get when you look out of your window and most of all I would really like caves that you can send rovers into to search the depth of the planets which would add an absolutely huge amount of new things to explore and maybe even sometimes finding interesting stuff that I\u0027m sure squad can think of that would be in there such as bottomless ravines that seem to never end, lava lakes and maybe even a whole ocean in what seemed to be a deserted planet but underneath astronomic units of liquid oceans to swim in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://news.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_article_l/public/media/sn-europa.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sn-europa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was so happy in the update where science came it made the game so much harder and so much more enjoyable for me as I needed to work harder and i would feel better after achieving my own goals. However the system is awfully unbalanced there is enough science in the kerbin system alone to finish the tech tree which is kind of dumb. You would think that You would complete the tree after going to the farthest reach of the solar system but apparently not. Science is highly unbalanced and needs to be toned down alot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDiscovering\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I don\u0027t like in ksp is that you know where all the planets are that just spoils the fun it would be really fun to add some kind of telescope that you would have to look around in space for a while and find a planet then you would lock the telescope onto that planet so that it would follow it and gather the body\u0027s orbit information which you could now see on the map. You would start with the ground telescope that is in KSC to look for the moons of kerbin and later on as you progress through the tech tree you get telescopes that you have to send to send in orbit which will see further. This would be a really cool aspect and would finally add a use to space probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.spacetelescope.org/static/about/img/hubble_in_orbit1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hubble_in_orbit1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me kerbals are a big part of this game they are fun to throw into the mun toss into the sun test if they can survive a 5 ton hammer hitting them and various other fun things to do. It would be really nice to see them be more developed. I would like to see new space suits, suits that you can buy using money and equip onto kerbals so that they can survive different climates and planets be it the supreme heats of moho or the bone chilling colds of Eeloo and maybe even weather resistant this would be a really cool implementation as those numbers appearing on the thermometre that nobody reads would finally have a use and would also make people send probes there first rather than sending a kerbal there head first into dangers. And eventually maybe have a kerbal tech tree to upgrade certain aspects of kerbals or even add new ones using science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbol\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing that I noticed when i was chucking a kerbal into the sun (for science!) I saw how undeveloped the sun is(kerbol) There is no texture on it and it is just there for nothing really other than to make the game realistic. I would like to see the sun have a dynamic surface where it moves like a liquid and for it to have sun spots that appear and disappear during the years(in game) and also for the sun to have a period where it has more sun spots and creates more solar flares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to see solar flares created by the sun that mess up probes and any technology that it hits and you have to send a kerbal there to fix it which adds a new level to gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemrav","CreatedById":91029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:56:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou certainly haven\u0027t looked at the ksp wiki of planned features..... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Planned_features\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esquad has already tested geysers and plan to give laythe lava....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethere are plans for an observatory buildings to discover planets...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have even been complaints of kerbol being too complex... that would be disastrous to people with slower machines...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm personally fine with Kerbals right now but squad does intend (i think they do at least) to add a Kerbal engineer to do some other things, he would probably at least have a new texture to tell them apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this sounds a bit negative, but I\u0027m trying to be more point form over text...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MSD","CreatedById":59320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T23:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022There have even been complaints of kerbol being too complex... that would be disastrous to people with slower machines...\u0022 is not a reason for not doing it, a lot of \u0022nice\u0022 features to have like terrain scatter, weather, clouds, wheel tracks, footprints and other stuff are disastrous for poor little machines too, but should be added.
