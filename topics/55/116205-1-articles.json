Basically, I think it would be a good idea to have some very large, named, non-procedural, on rails asteroids with very irregular potato-ish shapes. They could be a few km in diameter ( or however you measure something that irregular ) and be placed somewhere near Dres\u0027s orbit. They would definitely spice up that region of space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/q9wo0Lqm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022q9wo0Lqm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, look how amazing this would be to land on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T21:51:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Layereddiagram\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes please.
