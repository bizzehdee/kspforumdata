Basically, I think it would be a good idea to have some very large, named, non-procedural, on rails asteroids with very irregular potato-ish shapes. They could be a few km in diameter ( or however you measure something that irregular ) and be placed somewhere near Dres\u0027s orbit. They would definitely spice up that region of space.\n\n![q9wo0Lqm.png](%5Bimg%5Dhttp%3A//i.imgur.com/q9wo0Lqm.png)\n\nI mean, look how amazing this would be to land on.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-17T21:51:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2015 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Layereddiagram**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T21:51:34Z","Content":"Yes please.

Plus something that size would have practically non-existent gravity or none at all and due to its non spherical shape, they wouldn\u0027t be able to just have gravity radiating from a point at the center.\n\nThose are just guesses though.
