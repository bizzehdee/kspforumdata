The game pays you and you are then offered a contract for 11km. If instead you get to 12km on your first flight, the 11km contract is never offered; it skips directly to the 22km contract. If you make the mistake of going for orbit straightaway, you lose -all- of the altitude contracts and the money, reputation, and science that is associated with them. It makes a significant difference early in hard career mode, and it forces players to fly repeated, boring missions in order to max out the money from these contracts. Further, players who are unaware of the system don\u0027t even get the choice. A single contract with multiple parameters should solve this nicely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt appears that the planet/moon exploration missions function in this way as well.
