Players on low-g worlds like Minmus are heavily tempted just to use the jetpack rather than walk, and on Gilly walking is completely impossible. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice if the Kerbal could stick to any surface and walk on it? Even in the null-g of open space, your Kerbal\u00A0can take a pleasant stroll on the hull of your spacecraft, and tiny worlds like asteroids and moons suddenly become way\u00A0more livable. The camera would adjust to give a proper sense of direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027m suggesting that Kerbals on EVA should have magnetic boots that allow them to walk on any surface regardless of gravity -- of course, that means they could become SpiderJeb, but the devs could always make natural gravity, say, 1g, capable of overpowering the boots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-29T23:21:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMagnetic boots working on the hull, \u003Cem\u003EThe Expanse-\u003C/em\u003Estyle is something I\u0027m all in favor of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor asteroids and moons... First, the inability to stick to the surface is what makes it a challenge (look how much problems we have in real life with landers on asteroids).
