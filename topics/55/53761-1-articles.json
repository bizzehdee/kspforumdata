So, for example, if I were looking for a decoupler in the \u0022structural\u0022 page in the editor, sure now it\u0027ll take me but 2 seconds, but for a beginner it would be great to be able to click a \u0022Decouplers/separators\u0022 sub-menu and having the editor show just those parts. Or even having the option of just seeing specific-sized parts, like \u0022large diameter\u0022 and \u0022small diameter\u0022 and \u0022tiny diameter\u0022, depending on what kind of rocket I need to build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would let beginners get more acquainted with the editor (specialy if they jumped right into sandbox mode), and it would certainly help someone that has lots of custom parts in the editor and has a hard time looking for a specific one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more parts are added into the game the harder it is to remember exactly where one is placed. And even though this feature is not strictly necessary for some of the menus, like, for instance, control or science parts, it would make a great difference in propulsion and structural.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let me know what you think about this, would you like to see it implemented?
