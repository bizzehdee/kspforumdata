I put a lot of hours into it. As I discovered later it\u0027s behind the current release and it\u0027s tendency to corrupt save files is now legendary. So, I figured, let me try it on my Mac book pro. Mouse usage has been great. Flight controls leave a lot to be desired. When I connected up my ps4 controller, I couldn\u0027t help but notice that the controls are behaving like the keyboard. Yaw and pitch are just on and off, despite having full analog control on the ps4 version of the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy basic question is, does anyone know what the best ps4 controller setup is for Mac? I\u0027d like to be able to do more that just throttle on/off and binary movements. It\u0027s so bad that I\u0027m just sticking to the keyboard until I can find a solution to this. Before you say \u0022use big picture mode\u0022, I\u0027ve tried that and KSP hangs or crashes on startup if I enable big picture mode before starting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
