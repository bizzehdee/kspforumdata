I would like the following to be included in the stock game because they enhance the game in a way that makes it hard to go back to the stock version. I don\u0027t like mods that take away from the difficulty of the game as they are more or less a hack to alter the gameplay, but I am interested in mods that enhance the game without taking away the challenge, because I think that the game is easy enough to learn if you put enough time in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. SVE and Scatterer - I found that the SVE and Scatterer bring incredible enhancements to the feel of the game. The mod is clumsy right now, because you have to select different detail levels to install, but these can be integrated in the game to choose visuals. I know that there are other mods but really, any of them are nice, I\u0027m just liking this one more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Chatterer -\u00A0 Oh, how much this mod adds to the whole feel of the game. I love how the radio chatter and ship sounds add to the whole feel. There\u0027s something immersive when you slowly rotate your ship and the radio comes to life to hear some chatter as you look at the planet below. It brings a tear to your eye. It\u0027s a childhood dream for those that didn\u0027t go to space yet but always dreamed of going.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. [X] Science - This my be considered as a helping thing, but it\u0027s purely an interface thing, letting you know which biome and what science can be performed here. I am against automatic science stuff, because I think users should be the ones that perform the science, but it helps to know when it can be done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Engineer - This has many features and tabs, but realistically, I think the only things that really matter to users is the information regarding apoaps and time to apoaps while launching in orbit. I have to switch to orbit view to adjust the trajectory, but I would love to watch the launch instead of staring at the orbit view, just because it\u0027s so cool. Another thing that is important is the total Delta V and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E display, because this information is available already, but needs to be calculated and it is kinda clunky to do the math all the time. So the apoaps and time to plus the total delta v and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E information will provide valuable information for the user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Robotics -\u00A0 I see that is a cool mod, because it allows complex movements and stuff. I would love to see a Shuttle with a robotic arm to position satellites in orbit, like the real thing used to do, just for the realism of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the game. I used to play Spore before this because it was the closest I could have to space exploration and space flight.
