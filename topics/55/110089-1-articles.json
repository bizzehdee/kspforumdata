The higher level the engeneer is, the higher chance for successfull repairs and less time it would take."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:59:47Z","Content":"This is suggested from time to time, and [**there is an addon**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81794) that offers this feature, but I believe it has been expressly ruled out by Squad themselves as undesirable, the majority of players do not want random arbitrary failures, especially if they mount up in timewarp, to scupper their carefully planned flights."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T14:43:09Z","Content":"Sal\\_vager, indulge me for a minute...\n\nMost people don\u0027t want random, arbitrary failures, and this was certainly a \u0022don\u0027t ask\u0022 thing for a while, but that was also before skills, and it certainly gives engineers something to do, so it might be worth a revisit of the idea by squad, particularly as related to engineer repairs.\n\nEven without that, I think failures would be neat on **test parts**, instead of part testing contracts always succeeding when you stage, or \u0022run test.\u0022 In the case of parts that become available for testing outside a tree unlock, if it is explicit that they might fail, it\u0027s not arbitrary, it\u0027s a *choice by the player.* Note that if a part fails and an engineer fixes it they might get some XP, instead of arbitrarily landing them someplace---skill via doing what they are supposed to do.\n\nFailures could be more varied, too. Loss of gimble, leaks, Engine unable to restart after landing, intermittent power from panels, etc. Engineer EVAs and fixes it. I\u0027ve tried the mods, and they go too far the other direction and have things constantly failing."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:02:01Z","Content":"Especially fun would be fixing it just after liftoff...
