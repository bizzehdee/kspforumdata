Prop engines, adjustable landing gear, air brakes, texture/fuel switching, tweakable control deflection, landing effects... It\u0027s like a plane designer\u0027s Christmas list. Really, quite a few people, I think, don\u0027t realize quite how much of all the sweet new B9 functionality is from Firespitter. More or less everything in the HX series, to start with, and most of the rest. It\u0027s sort of like Firespitter with a load of structural parts and a futuristic theme. (I know, I know, there\u0027s the RPM stuff, the HotRockets stuff, and stuff from every single API I\u0027ve ever heard of, and quite a few that I haven\u0027t, but still, point is, Firespitter is useful.)"}]}
