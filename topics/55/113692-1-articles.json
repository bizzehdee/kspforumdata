This is the easiest because you don\u0027t even need to worry about disrupting other fuel flow on the craft. Bonus: you get to decouple the tank \u0026 fuel cell if you ever expend the dedicated fuel.\n\nStacked inline: TR-18A - FL-T100 - TR-18A (or TR-2V - Oscar-B - TR-2V for 0.625m), fuel cells on the tank, disable crossfeed and staging on the decouplers, bypass the section with fuel lines as necessary to enable unhindered fuel flow between the rest of the craft. The TR-18As can be offset into the tank without looking bad, so it only adds a few parts and just the length of the one tank to the craft.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-19T17:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2017 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis**\n  \nforum quoting shenanigans, and fuel cells can\u0027t be attached to toroidals"},{"CreatedByName":"MacLuky","CreatedById":138597,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-19T17:16:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Zeiss Ikon said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E What I\u0027d rather see with fuel cells is the ability to dedicate a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELf\u003C/abbr\u003E/O tank to fuel cell operation -- so if I burn my tanks dry with (say) a Kerbin return insertion burn, I don\u0027t have to get home on just the installed batteries (with no more way to recharge them, if I\u0027ve installed fuel cells instead of solar panels).
