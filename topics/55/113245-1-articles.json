Assuming the previous is correct, than with the avionics nosecone, even an engineer can fly a plane with full SAS suite (stuffing a scientist in a plane could be very profitable like this). Would probably need to test to verify.\n\nI should make it clear that having that line still requires the craft to be controlled (have a kerbal in a pod or an active probe core)."}]}
