This module would basically allow you to collect a tiny bit of science from each boulder(a rock sample) you encounter (boulders already in the game) with a sliding scale based on which planet (ie Kerbin 1-2 science per boulder Mun 1-4 etc) The science would be cumulative- in other words: you would be able to keep adding science per boulder you visit. Maybe some places have too many boulders, or maybe the terrain clutter is too variable, in that case you could have some rare \u0022science boulders\u0022 here and there. It might be just better overall to have some rare science boulders a player could look for as they drive around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s one good reason I\u0027m thinking of this idea: it would create a very nice use for rovers. It would give players something to objectively look out for and investigate when driving across a surface of a planetary body. The science could then be transmitted or taken back as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking beyond, it would be cool also if you could collect rock samples to sell for cash, but that might be hard to code for. I suppose the rocks could be essentially a non usuable fuel source, just adding extra weight, but worth money and science if you go through the effort to bring them home. Adding weight from moon rocks reminds me of Apollo 13, were they had to adjust their reentry for the moon rocks they were supposed to have brought back comes to mind. Could add some cool gameplay as in extra fuel requirements due to the accumulation of rock samples brought back in your ship. It totally complies with current space exploration which is also nice, ie Curiosity, essentially visiting rocks of interest and transmitting data(or in KSP Science as we call it) home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-15T21:08:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2014 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mcbmaestro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
