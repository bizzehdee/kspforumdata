Career mode is fine but it can also feel less like running a space program and more like completing a bunch of randomly strung together tasks. I\u0027m playing a Science mode game at the moment, so that I can get away from that and play a slightly more directed game without having to care about how I pay for things. Having Science Mode as full-career-mode-but-without-contracts, would be perfect - for me.
