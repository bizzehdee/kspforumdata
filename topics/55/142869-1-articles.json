It seems to have started with Windows 7, and it seems to be caused by the operating system allowing you to stop providing input before the process has had a chance to register the input. This may fix certain localized issues that happen in some very specific and extreme circumstances, but sometimes (read: pretty often) results in weird anomalies in which the computer should have or even did register the input but acts like it didn\u0027t. Sometimes this results in clicks seeming to do nothing, sometimes you watch the button go through its button-press animation yet it acts as if it wasn\u0027t clicked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorkaround: hold the mouse button down longer. Try to figure out how long it takes the process to register a click, and get used to holding the mouse button down for that long. The amount of time will vary by program and sometimes by what else you\u0027re running along with it. If the process is running very slowly, you may need to hold the mouse down for much longer, a few seconds or more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
