Uh...?\n\n2) Parts \u0027cool off\u0027 extremely slowly to the point of absurdity. Even in atmosphere, even in \\*water\\*, parts seem to cool down only by radiative methods.\n\n3) Certain parts, like jet engines, seem to handle heat quite oddly. In pre-1.0, the jet engines would heat up rapidly to a specific temperature but then stabilize. Post 1.0, jet engines very, very slowly heat up. The engines don\u0027t even glow anymore until you fly around for twenty minutes, and they keep bleeding their heat into connected parts all the while. I had landing gears that were nearly as hot as the engine exhaust."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T01:43:27Z","Content":"1) that\u0027s in Kelvin.
