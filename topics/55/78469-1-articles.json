So I took a look at the config, and as I suspected, it\u0027s been rescaled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I found a single line in the config file that confused me even more than the part\u0027s re-scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022PhysicsSignificance = 1\u0022 Putting this line into a part\u0027s config causes the game to treat it as having zero mass, and disables physics calculations on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalculating physics on a very small structural part can be buggy, so putting that line on the cubic octagonal strut for example, makes perfect sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, those parts don\u0027t change mass or apply forces to the craft they\u0027re attached to, so disabling physics only changes the craft\u0027s effective mass. Not a big deal with very low mass parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel tanks change mass as their contents are drained/refilled. No fuel tanks in the game that I know of have disabled physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines and RCS thrusters apply force to the craft they\u0027re attached to. There are 3 RCS thruster parts and 1 engine part that have disabled physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO-10 MonoPropellant Engine (New part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERV-105 RCS Thruster Quad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPA-7 Linear RCS Port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVR-N1ER \u0022Vernor\u0022 RCS thruster. (New part)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe O-10 engine\u0027s mass is stated as 0.03 in it\u0027s config. The LV-1/-1R has the same mass, but doesn\u0027t have disabled physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe PA-7 Linear RCS and RV-105 RCS quad both have masses of 0.05 according to their configs. That\u0027s more than the LV-1/-1R.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Vernor thruster has a mass of 0.08 in its config. That\u0027s only 0.01 away from the mass of the Rockomax 24-77.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe decision to disable physics calculation on these parts is problematic for at least two reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, simple math tells us that parts that have Zero mass and can produce thrust, will have a functionally infinite thrust-to-mass ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor: Thrust = X, Mass = 0, TWR = Thrust-to-Mass ratio\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust / Mass = TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX/0 = \u0022Undefined\u0022, \u0022NaN\u0022, \u0022\u002Bor-Infinity depending on sign of X\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfinite thrust for zero mass penalty? That\u0027s impossible to balance without changing the \u0022for zero mass\u0022 part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if the game engine started acting strangely in some way if it has to deal with a part that doesn\u0027t have any mass. AFAIK the symptoms could be anything from crashes to Kracken attacks to phantom forces, and anything in between. Nothing in the VAB or SPH, however. Only when game physics is running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the smallest Solar panels and the small radial battery shouldn\u0027t have physics disabled either, but that\u0027s a less severe issue)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or not, so I put it here where it might get some attention from those who know more than me about why it\u0027s considered to be OK to disable physics on these parts. If I put it in the wrong place, feel free to move it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
