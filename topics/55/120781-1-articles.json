Space Engineers, for example, has huge simspeed issues, and other games just kill fps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP does not do that. It even lets you adjust the ratio of physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I have a suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5/1.1 will bring multi-threaded physics into the scene. Since we\u0027re already diving the different things (i.e thermal, patched conics, and aero) into different threads, I have a suggestion to make on this matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s an example of what I mean:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VzXiUJt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VzXiUJt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe numbers are indicating the current limiter. Here, orbital calculations are slowing down the game drastically, because they have been set to an accurate setting. Part physics used to be causing lag, however, accuracy was turned down because the craft was not burning it\u0027s engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are four threads in this image. Each is adjustable in \u0022physics accuracy\u0022--this is currently what is edited by the current physics-warp system. Additionally, there will be a \u0022target\u0022 physics rate. This will be controlled by the regular physics warp. For example, let\u0027s say you had a craft with a very laggy thermal system. You could lower thermal physics accuracy, and get a large performance boost. Or, when experiences bugs when executing burns, for example, increase part and thermal accuracy. Planes at cruising speeds could do with less thermal and orbital accuracies. SOI transitions can boost orbital. The entire system would allow for performance on various core counts and PC specs, and, with a powerful computer and right adjustments, allow for x8, x16, or possibly even x32 physics warping!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-13T14:04:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2015 02:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by waterlubber\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMade title more interesting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T15:18:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E40x physics warp is already possible with a stable craft, but if it makes it more accurate and non-bendy i am all for this idea\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T20:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis makes no sense.
