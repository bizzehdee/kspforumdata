But for ...reasons... I\u0027d really like some sort of field promotion mechanic. I propose allowing us to bring a giant \u0022astonaut complex facility\u0022 the size of the largest 3.75m fuel tank (or maybe a large inflatable one that expands to 10m like the heat shield) that can \u0022process\u0022 kerbals one at a time *after* they gain enough new experience, to field promote them. Carrying a massive and bulky part would be the price for field promotions... and with.... say a 100 day processing time per level, 1 kerbal at a time, you probably wouldn\u0027t want to send rookies if you can\u0027t even have a fully trained pilot, engineed, and scientist until 300 days after arriving at the destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also propose an even bigger \u0022science facility\u0022 that allows one to boost transmissions to 100%, or nearly 100%\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPutting these two facilities at another location, combined with ISRU, would allow it to serve as a base of operations where new missions (using old craft) are fueled and launched, and returning missions come to drop off their science and promote their crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe they would only work when their status is \u0022landed\u0022 or \u0022splashed down\u0022, but I don\u0027t really see a problem with large motherships or space stations being able to do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, I\u0027m at a bottleneck in my astronaut squad... I can train kerbals to lvl 3 easily enough... but advancing beyond that required interplanetary journeys. I don\u0027t have a single kerbal past lvl 3, despite having 4 kerbals at eve, 4 kerbals returning from moho, and 6 kerbals on duna, who have been there a long time and will be there until the next transfer window - 6 kerbals on the way to Jool, 3 kerbals halfway to dres.... I\u0027ve also got tons of science, just waiting for transits and transfer windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a huge 330 ton station in orbit of duna... lots of ISRU capability there, its sort of a base where I was planning on having kerbals return to from the outer solar system, and depart from... except... then I\u0027ll never get that science back, and I\u0027ll never get kerbals promoted (I really want lvl 5 engineers and scientists ... especially the engineers for the drilling speed bonus to make lower ore concentrations still able to yield a net gain when using fuel cells... as I have OPM installed, and solar is so not viable past jool).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lobe","CreatedById":78710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-07T21:59:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second this.
