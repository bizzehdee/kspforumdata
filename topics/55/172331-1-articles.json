The LM only rendezvoused with the CSM, once the relative velocity was zeroed at a decent distance, the CSM would take over the closing approach and the final actual docking with the LM, with the LM only adjusting to stay aligned with the CSM.

But while the Clampotron junior looks OK on the MEM, it really doesn\u0027t work well on the Mark-1-3 capsule, only the full sized docking port works there, although that can be addressed with an intermediate piece - stacking a small clampotron on top of the full size one works, and allows for the capsule to dock with both the MEM and (after detaching the junior) any station you have that uses regular size ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut ignoring the esthetics, It does seem to have gotten at best a\u00A0quick, or no pass at all\u00A0through the old QA team,\u00A0\u00A0it is borked in at least three ways that impact actual gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) As already mentioned,\u00A0the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is\u00A0unbalanced and it\u00A0needs a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E fix - using the \u0022horizontal\u0022 plane\u00A0 (I,J,K,L or WASD key\u00A0depending on your preference)\u00A0translational thrusters produces a torque causing rotational spin in the opposed direction.\u00A0 While it is not terrible when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is on, it continually fires the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to fix the rotation, wasting fuel and making your docking maneouvers a little trickier. It is horribly obvious with\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off, so much so that I have to wonder if any of the devs actually flew the MEM while working on it, let alone passed it by any actual QA testers or beta testers. It\u0027s hard to believe that this problem would have escaped even a casual play through of a Munar landing with orbital maneouvering, let alone any actual docking maneouvers.

Adjusting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E is balanced will move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E horizontally, which means it will be offset from the centre of thrust of any engine placed on the normal attachment point, which will cause torque using the engine. That would be worse than having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E unbalanced as it will cause torque and yaw or pitch rotation\u00A0issues during powered ascents from the surface or when using the engine for orbital maneuvering. Using the move tool to offset the engine to get the thrust aligned is frustrating and fiddly, so you probably won\u0027t get it perfect. And then, assuming your descent stage is balanced itself, it in turn will have to be adjusted to get its center of\u00A0thrust back under the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. The only good fix is for\u00A0the devs\u00A0to rebalance the thrusters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Doing an EVA does send the MEM flipping as previously mentioned, but\u00A0that\u00A0is the case with some other manned parts, so it is hardly unique although it does seem to be worse than most.

I\u0027m going to start by saying I am not a fan at all of the take2 rebranding, the new UEA is pants and Squad have been relegated behind take 2s new \u0027brand\u0027 Private Division.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill I suppose if you sell your Sole you\u0027re going to end up getting battered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich makes me wonder how much of a hand they actually had in the DLC. This lem remake looks like a modeller outside Squad was given the task of making one without ever seeing any of the game\u0027s other assets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned its too small for the standard docking port, but its also a pain to connect to much else. As soon as I add an engine I get the starting of a fairing but that\u0027s wrong as the lem was packed behind the csm in Apollo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how to get a ladder attached - again these are out of scale with the lem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying to build a realistic lander stack leaves gaps everywhere ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is before I\u0027ve tried to fly the thing, which to be honest I probably wont both to do given all the problems that have been raised in this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice model, 0 QA hope this is not the way things are going to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-24T21:54:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/24/2018 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by LunchIn10Seconds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamqdlaty","CreatedById":88293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-20T20:44:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of this part is still not fixed.
