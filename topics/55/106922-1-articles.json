As you know, there are several mods that currently or have tried to implement such a system in an interesting way, but the nature of life support means that this system is going to be mostly passive. Each of these mods does things a little differently, but it ultimately boils down to \u0027do I have enough X resource on the ship?\u0027 rather than adding any meaningful gameplay decisions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I suppose one could ramp up the interactivity of life support mods and implement a system that would need to be monitored and checked and adjusted continuously. That may fix the passive problem, but then you run into the very likely situation that it becomes micro-management, grindy, or just plain annoying to deal with. So no matter which type of system you make, passive or interactive, there are gameplay problems that come with them, and not a lot of benefit to be gained. As well, there are varying opinions on how Kerbals should respond...should they die? or simply become inactive for a while? Or maybe even some other gameplay detriment/effect. There are many possibilities, so no 1 system can effectively cover what each player expects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best bet with this is simply to allow the player to choose which type of life support system (or not) they want to use. There are several mods that do the job wonderfully, but differently enough that they are distinct. If Squad implemented such a system into stock, it would maybe satisfy 1/4th of the players, while the rest are looking for something completely different anyway. I\u0027m not saying they couldn\u0027t do it...they certainly could...but their time is probably better spent implementing other features and fixes to the rest of the game, while leaving relatively minor stuff like this to the modders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NWDogg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NWDogg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E As well, there are varying opinions on how Kerbals should respond...should they die? or simply become inactive for a while?

A number of other features really do need to be present for that to work, most notably some sort of overview system that lets you track at a glance the current profile of each and every mission. We have a framework for that with the tracking station, but it would need considerable expanding for life support to work. We\u0027d need at-a-glance knowledge of how long each ship is going to last with current life support supplies, if nothing else. The VAB/SPH scene would also need a new widget to tell us how long the crew can be expected to survive on what they have.

I mean, I believe people will appreciate WHY space missions are difficult (and more expensive) for living beings (as compared to just sending probes) better, if such a system is in place in KSP. I mean when I first found out that KSP did not have one back in 2013, I said to myself, so there\u0027s practically no difference in sending Kerbals to do a mission, and doing the same mission with a probe, so why bother with Kerbals? Sure, sure, the addition of the science aspect, and now the resource collection aspect makes their presence on a surface more meaningful now that just automate the entire process with robotic explorers. But if Squad DID eventually allow for science and resource collection, I think the next great revolution is the implementation of a life support system, again, to GIVE MEANING as to why we use Kerbals for our missions. Remember the PC Gamer review?

Give every pod a certain amount of power drain, perhaps based on how many kerbals are actually inside, and then you don\u0027t have to worry about having enough of a certain amount of food or oxygen for a long trip. It also brings it in line with probe cores, where if electricity runs out, you can\u0027t even extend your panels or start the engine again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:03:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Grumman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Grumman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem with life support is that if you need it, \u003Cem\u003Erescue is impossible\u003C/em\u003E. There is no such thing as a failed but survivable mission that requires a follow-up mission if the survivor goes into hibernation with no way to snap them out of it. Anything that is turned off by a lack of life support needs to be something you can do without - like extra tourism money or the extra skills a Kerbal gains as they level up - or else you\u0027re making manned spaceflight a worse version of probes, but without the expendability.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoverdude\u0027s new LS mod is great for stock.
