Then the arrow keys move the green heading indicator (not the control surfaces). The control surfaces then adjust to the delta from the green indicator. The change is slight but huge in my opinion. As it is currently set up if you craft is perturbed right and you tap the left arrow to try to correct the craft will use the new heading from when the arrow was released. If this was right of the original heading you wanted your craft will now perturb further to the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a moder wanted to do this it might be quite easy to use the current maneuver node mode and modify it so that when there is no maneuver it behaves in this manor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis does 2 things\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. eliminates the need to be able to trim a craft as you can set the green indicator past where you actually want it to account for imbalances\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. reduces the need for a joystick as it is easier to make small adjustment without getting full deflection of control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:17:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI second this - although the current SAS Implementation is \u0022good enough\u0022 for basic piloting, it will be nice to have a manually adjustable target attitude as indicated by the OP.
