I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been playing KSP for some time now. Although it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s such a fun game, it is also very obvious to me how unfinished the game is. Having played through the Career mode twice now, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been thinking and taking note of ways I think the game could be dramatically improved. I\u0027ve come up with so many that it would be impractical make a separate post for each; instead, I figured I might as well just post them all here and hope for the best. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve grouped my suggestions according to category. Within each category, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve listed the suggestions in order of descending importance/ease of implementation. Hopefully some of you will agree with some of my suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EGameplay\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake career contracts which require landing multiple Kerbals onto a celestial object.

Trial-and-error can get you to the Mun or Minmus, but it quickly becomes frustrating for any other celestial body. At the very least, there should be a way to determine phase angles, and a reference which informs players of optimal phase angles. This capability could be unlocked in the tech tree. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal Engineer should be incorporated into the stock game.

These features of Kerbal Engineer can easily be worked into the tech tree. It is reasonable for players just starting out in career mode to be building and flying blindly, but it is unreasonable to expect them to stumble across a Moho-capable spacecraft through tedious trial-and-error. The Kerbal Engineer part also allows one to see apoapsis and periapsis values without having to constantly switch back and forth between the staging and map screens. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUnlock a Delta-V map with the tech-tree. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWith higher difficulty levels, Kerbals should die when subjected to sustained high G\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImplement re-entry heating and damage; enable this through difficulty settings.

The only exception I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found is for an unmanned rover landed on Eve, which for practical purposes, is stuck there forever. Even more useless are the Comms DTS-M1 and Communotron 88-88. Why do they use MORE electricity? The increased speed is basically irrelevant, as even the biggest science results take only seconds to transmit on the basic Communotron 16.

Except for rovers and the Ion drive, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve found that I can always get by with a single OX-STAT panel and perhaps a single Z-100.

For instance, I used to have the NavBall Enhancement mod, since that is such an obvious fix--Squad has since incorporated the changes and everyone is happy. Likewise, I think they should certainly incorporate the cosmetic enhancements of Distant Object Enhancement. In both of these instances, there is a clear improvement, with little room for complaint from any reasonable person.
