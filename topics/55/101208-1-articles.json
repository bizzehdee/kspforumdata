I don\u0027t want this to be taken as offensive, I\u0027m not gonna lie; I love the game, but I\u0027d suggest:\n\n1. First and foremost, I\u0027d suggest implementing a size that\u0027s between 1.25m and 2.5m. For me, the gap between the two sizes is too large, and I wish something would fill that, sort of like the size difference with the 2.5 size and 3.75. \n\n2. While I think the 0.90 overhaul of MK3 Parts is amazing, I wish that it wasn\u0027t so heavy to the point that it would need about six jet engines to get sufficient speed for flight.\n\n3. Some sort of probe \u0022camera\u0022 that can be part of satellites and gain science when pictures are \u0022taken\u0022 by it. Just a suggestion to make satellites useful.\n\n4. Speaking about satellites, I\u0027d suggest that experiments returned to Kerbin can be transferred to stations too, something like the European ATV which carries experiments - along with supplies - to the ISS.\n\n5. An option to start flights from the water, to make boats more convenient to use. If this were ever to happen, I\u0027d also suggest to make this feature use up funds, to compensate.\n\n6. Speaking of water, I ultimately want to suggest that water be more life-like; More tolerant with parts, and with less buoyancy. Instead of it\u0027s force being stronger than hitting on land, I think it would be better to make it so that it\u0027s actually less strong (much like Earth water).\n\nPost your opinions on my suggestions if you want. Please remember that this is just what I feel, and it doesn\u0027t remove the fact that I still love playing the game, and is appreciative of Squad\u0027s put effort into KSP. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T12:48:08Z","Content":"\u003E 1.

Speaking about satellites, I\u0027d suggest that experiments returned to Kerbin can be transferred to stations too, something like the European ATV which carries experiments - along with supplies - to the ISS.\n\nI would suggest some kind of science package delivery contract. you are given a science package module that you must transfer to an off world lab (or polar or what ever). once there, run the experiment and return or transmit the data for a science profit.\n\n\u003E 5. An option to start flights from the water, to make boats more convenient to use. If this were ever to happen, I\u0027d also suggest to make this feature use up funds, to compensate.\n\nnot sure how I feel about this. maybe if the water were fixed it would be worth the effort to support boat construction/deployment.

I\u0027ve been wishing for a set between 1.25 and 2.5 meters for a while now and as awsumindyman pointed out, 1.875 meters is the logical size. Some examples that show this is necessary are with building SLS replicas, the boosters are much too narrow and short when using 1.25 meter boosters on 3.75 meter tanks; building Ares I replicas or any rocket that uses a first stage that is narrower than its above upper stage; and for building radial boosters on 2.5 meter tanks \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC 1.25 meter boosters look a bit silly on these. I can\u0027t believe they made 0.23.5 without adding larger boosters, especially with the SLS theme, because you can\u0027t even build an SLS with the standard booster (you can with clipped parts but you shouldn\u0027t have to go through all that work in a polished game). What I also find ridiculous is how shortly for which the SRB\u0027s burn. There is no reason why a booster should run out before the rocket is even doing its gravity turn; i.e., unless you use clipped boosters with thrust limiter set down for longer burn times, you\u0027ll be dropping your boosters straight onto the launch pad.\n\nBranching off from bigger tanks is my wish for segmented boosters. Adding 1.875 meter SRB\u0027s would be a wonder for constructing large SLS replicas or large STS replicas. Another thing to note is that real life SRB\u0027s are usually in segments, usually consisting of the motor segment, the nose cone with built in separator rockets, and the actual fuel segments. Usually they increase the thrust when adding more segments, like is being done with the Space Launch System. The Space Shuttle used lower thrust four segment boosters whereas the SLS will use higher thrust five segment boosters.\n\nYou can see how it all ties together and it really makes sense. The 2.5 meter parts and 3.75 meter parts blend really nicely and you can make rockets with a 2.5 meter lower stage and 3.75 meter upper stage without looking silly. When trying to apply that to 2.5 meter and 1.25 meter parts it is simply much too small. The 1.25 meter SRB\u0027s can be nice as radial boosters.

(No offense, though! I love their STS replicas!)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E what about if they made the Raster Prop monitor mod stock? and allow us, in the VAB/SPH, to select whether or not we want to use the screens or not in IVA?\n\nI think so too. Screens would not only enhance the visual IVA experience, but it would be easier having flights in IVA to see what is happening beyond the window screens of your cockpit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You can see how it all ties together and it really makes sense. The 2.5 meter parts and 3.75 meter parts blend really nicely and you can make rockets with a 2.5 meter lower stage and 3.75 meter upper stage without looking silly. When trying to apply that to 2.5 meter and 1.25 meter parts it is simply much too small. The 1.25 meter SRB\u0027s can be nice as radial boosters. Examples below.\n\nThis is exactly what I felt! The huge size gap prevented me from being able to make sufficient MK3 Aircraft engines, create Hubble replicas that could fit in the Mk3 bay, as well as replicating the Ares family of rockets.\n\nIt\u0027s a shame how a seemingly small error became so critical."}]}
