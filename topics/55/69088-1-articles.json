A perfect example is ST:O where after you have designated the name of the ship, you actually get to see it printed on the hull. In addition to being able to slap a flag on random parts, the name of the vessel should also be an option. Having the name on the fuselage would just look so bloody cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T07:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou know what would be really cool?

You would have multiple of each size, and they would have to be made to fit flush with stock parts (all tank sizes, flat for wings and structural panels, and large medium and small of each, as well as portrait and landscape, and of course vertical, and it\u0027s appropriate sizes.) of course. I would personally love this kind of thing, and those of us who like to recreate real rockets, or make real looking rockets, this would be perfect. The good thing would be that it would be independent of anything you actually had set for the rocket, like the name or mission flag, as some people have some very weird names for rockets, and some are just named as the payload, so then your standard \u0022Raptor\u0022 launcher that has it\u0027s name on the side, gets changed to be called like Ulysses DRM probe or something. If it is done as an editable part, then you can also pick and choose exactly where you want it, and possibly do some very weird and fun things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I understand something would probably not be made until much closer to 1.0, but keep in mind SQUAD: This would be one of the most epic things et!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T17:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a really good idea and I reckon that it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult to program in as well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T17:15:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deathsoul097\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...(Mission patch folder anyone?)...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYES!

It may not have been hard at all though. I don\u0027t \u0022think\u0022 you would need to make pieces that fit each part, like you\u0027re suggesting. With the way UV mapping works, all you\u0027re doing is adding an extra layer to the texture, and it should just be flush with whatever part you slap it on (the only drawback might be that you\u0027d get a mirror image on the opposite side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if it couldn\u0027t be done that way, the parts could just be made procedural, so they automatically bend to the surface of whatever you\u0027re applying it to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d prefer they NOT be \u0027parts\u0027 though, as a lot of folks are already struggling with lag issues when building complex rockets.
