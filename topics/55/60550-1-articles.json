Of course, there\u0027s the risk the plane may not be straight by the time it reaches the end of the runway and possibly hit one of the lights on that end.

I usually tweak my planes until they take of at at least half the runway, or on brakes, if it\u0027s a vtol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat really helps when doing this, is knowing why your plane won\u0027t take off, because the chance is quite low that your plane\u0027s take-off speed is reached at precisely the end of the runway. What\u0027s most likely the case is, is that you have your landing gear placed inefficiently. Try to place your main 2 wheels, so that they are right behind the plane\u0027s Centre of Mass. That way, when rotating, the plane has to lift less, as it will pivot around the Centre of Mass, rather than some point far behind it. Keep in mind that correctly placed landing gear will also result in smooth landings, as you won\u0027t slam down, but simply lower your nose as you slow down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECombine this with a slight angle of attack, or trimming your elevators before take-off, and it should take-off like a charm. If, however, you can easily rotate your plane, but it won\u0027t fly, you simply don\u0027t have enough lift.
