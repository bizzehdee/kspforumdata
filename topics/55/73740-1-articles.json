At the moment they have only added features such as rotating your head and zooming in but i had a few ideas of how movement will work in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENEW PARTS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E First of all we would require new station parts. They parts would have little things in them like windows or silly eastereggs to look at as you go through the ship, also large areas could be added like living quarters though, only some of these would have an actual use.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECONNECTIONS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Another thing that would be important is how these parts would work together, basically if you have a part such as a cockpit, control room, or any parts that are connected that allow kerbals to move in between or large areas to just mess around in they would have a set opening and entrance, when two parts are connected that are capable of IVA they would make an automatic opening at the node point, however if they are not connected properly or if not connected to a object capable of IVA it would just have a blank circle there similar to what some vehicles have on there node points. Also airlocks could be added too, if a part breaks, all kerbals in the area connected to that will die but if there is a air lock then they will not, also lastly is docking. When a docking point is placed down it will make a little opening in the ship and when it docks to a station you can freely move in between the 2 ships IVA mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMOVEMENT:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Another thing is movement, in order to move it would be simple, all you would to is look in a direction and press they required key to move in this direction as long as there is any bit of an object around you. You can also press space while looking in a direction to jump which makes you fly in that direction until you hit something or you let go of the space key.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSAGE: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003EFor science usage, the lab part would be very useful, when in IVA a kerbal can go and do mini experiments to things in zero g or if on another planet, these experiments could be as simple as messing with liquid or testing life forms out, also of these would be done within the lab though or could have a little airlock thing to expose them to the environment. Science would be given based on where the experiment takes place and how many times it has been done before, also there would be many of these \u0022mini\u0022 experiments but they would not yield as much science as science parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redhotita1","CreatedById":90870,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T16:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, for the movement, it would be great if i could just press W or S for go forward and backward, for get in the seat, look out the window, or check the Oxygen tank pressure just double click in it, and the kerbal goes there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor how it is Kerbal Space Program, it\u0027s useless movement inside a spacecraft, there aren\u0027t roles, like Pilot, Lander Pilot, Commander, every seat has the same command, and Kerbals can\u0027t do stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AI would be so great in this game, an example could be, if there\u0027s a problem with a satellite, you make the kerbal go out and repair it automatically, instead of piloting the kerbal by yourself...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T18:10:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExpanded IVA would be very nice for the future but at the moment I would consider it a very low priority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea for different seats having different roles would go along with skills tied to the kerbals.

Remember, the game still has to track your rocket\u0027s movements while you\u0027re moving about the cabin. This reminds me of another game, Star Trek: Bridge Commander. Like KSP, the game has a fixed camera on the bridge that you can pan and zoom to interact with the other crew and the stations. The reason they have a fixed camera is that the game cannot track both the ship and the captain at the same time. There is a mod for bridge commander that allows you to move around the bridge, but the player\u0027s POV is still nothing but a camera, the mod just changes the X-Y coords of the POV and adds an up and down oscillation to make it look like the player is walking. My guess for KSP\u0027s IVA is they might give you the ability to move the POV around the cockpit and interact with controls that are not normally in your field of view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"travis575757","CreatedById":83941,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T18:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it would be nice if this implied better kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
