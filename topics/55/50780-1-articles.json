Far away from the sun, solar panels woudl not give larger ships enough power and RTGs are good only for small probes. So you have to use reactors. But they are somehow harmful for crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to place them AWAY from cockpit and any living modules. That woudl require to change way how larger ships are build. Now you can pack all parts next to each other, ships are bulky. With nuclear reactors players woudl be made do add long truss structures to separate reactors from rest of the ship. Or to separate cockipts from rest of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscovery from 2001 was build this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/8898039.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/8898039.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if we ignore danger for crew?

After all, the energy you can get falls off with the inverse-square of distance - and I\u0027m not sure whether it\u0027s implemented for solar panels in the game. So, there does appear to be a gap into which such a system could fit without unbalancing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, the nuclear reactors do not have to have a large weight penalty (Russia built orbiting reactors at under 400kg each, although they lacked shielding), but they would have to require a large science input. There should, by that logic, be two reactor types - one for probes (light, unshielded) and one for manned vessels (heavy, shielded).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T18:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is true that reactors need some use first as there aren\u0027t many power-hungry things in the game. The most obvious would be for resource mining and processing, which is probably why blutonium was featured on the chart and I don\u0027t think it was just to fill up the LV-N, solar panels would definitely be too little to power refineries. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think that they could make ion engines useful for bigger vessels assuming their power output to mass ratio would be enough to power large ion thrusters or big clusters of them. Then there is the possibility that we could get a VASIMR equivalent as a lower ISP but higher thrust engine requiring more power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
