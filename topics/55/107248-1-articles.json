Instead of using fuel, it converts electricity to electromagnetic waves with can produce a tiny amount of force. I\u0027m not going to get into specifics, but you can read more [here](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/).\n\nI think that adding EM Drives of different powers could be useful for long distance space travel and small changes in maneuvers. There is plenty of information and pictures in the article I linked, to help visualize it.\n\nThough this technology is still experimental, it has been proven to produce force multiple times by multiple parties, so I think that it should be added.\n\nThank you ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Patrick Kerbivan","CreatedById":114804,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:26:53Z","Content":"I\u0027m familiar with the EM drive and for real-world spaceflight it\u0027s a very exciting possibility, but I don\u0027t think it would play well in KSP because of the burn lengths that would be involved. Every discussion I\u0027ve read about applications of the EM drive are talking about how its potential comes from the ability to run it constantly through a mission, propelling towards the destination for the first half then slowing down again for the second. With the mechanics of KSP as they are you\u0027d have to run all your missions in real-time..."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T20:51:21Z","Content":"NASA may have conducted a few preliminary experiments, but the results are far too inconclusive to immediately declare them as a viable means of spacecraft propulsion.\n\nI would personally prefer that EM Drives not be included in KSP until they have already seen substantial use in real-life applications."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:04:34Z","Content":"Ok first thing is we don\u0027t even know whether it is real of an experiment error. That would need to be validated before being added to KSP.\n\nSecond thing is... where is the fun in an engine several times more powerful than the ion engine, less energy intensive, doesn\u0027t need fuel, and has infinite dV? Yes in the real world that is cool but in KSP is essentially god mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:08:46Z","Content":"Not less energy intennse, it needs more and more and MOAR energy. we\u0027re talking about GW of power..."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T21:12:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not less energy intennse, it needs more and more and MOAR energy. we\u0027re talking about GW of power...\n\nThe current test runs are producing several times more thrust than an ion drive per watt.

They only have in common the need of energy, but nothing else. Ion engines arte good just for probes, Quantum Vacuum Thruster, if we\u0027ll find a way to feed it with enough energy, will be good for manned missions too."}]}
