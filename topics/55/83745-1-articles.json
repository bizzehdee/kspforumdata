Still new to he community even though I\u0027ve been playing a while. I\u0027ve heard the next major patch is going to focus on spaceplanes/aeronautics so I figure now would be a good time for these suggestions. Anyway I\u0027ll just cut to the chase...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800000;\u0022\u003EQuick version: Adjust Jet engine/ Intake weight \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800000;\u0022\u003EHow- Reduce weight of every jet engine by 0.2-0.5 tons. Increase weight of every intake by that same amount. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800000;\u0022\u003EEffect- Shifts weight forward on aircraft. better realism. game is more accessible for new guys. increases weight cost of airhogging. More variety in aircraft design. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one change to a single stat on 7-10 parts can have a very positive effect, both in terms of realism, and accessibility for new players. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing as how most aircraft tend to place jet engines towards the rear of the craft (crazy I know), and an intake somewhere infront of the engines, currently this means an unstable weight distribution for one of the heaviest subsystem that aircraft: propulsion. Why does this even matter? Because propulsion (and fuel) are the primary design elements that scale up with aircraft size. Unless you do something silly, your center of gravity is going to be way towards the back. This also means that a look around the forums will see the same aircraft shape over and over again: wings way back under the heavy engines, and everything else far forward, trying to balance out the weight of those engines, struggling to make a stable craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For beginners, the solution is to balance things out using the only other heavy thing that scales with an aircraft: fuel. This is a trap that will make planes inexplicably go out of control due to the heavy weight at the back becoming dominant once that fuel is burned. Payload? Just like fuel, it\u0027s temporary, leaving an unstable aircraft. For more advanced users, this is an engineering hurdle to be overcome with every aircraft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what else is there to balance the center of gravity? Extra cockpits and hab modules? Batteries? SAS? Keeping forward trim tanks full? This is just adding dead weight. Thats where the (heavier) intakes come in. Combined with lighter jet engines this would give users much more control over where their center of gravity is. Compressors in jet engines in real life are a major portion of their weight, so it definitely is more realistic. Worried about overall weight changes? Its the same weight for any 1:1 combination of intakes and engines. Also as a sidenote, this will also increase the weight of airhogging craft. I\u0027m not sure this is an issue, as I personally see airhogging as an exploit, but your opinion may differ. Less airhogging is more realistic to me =P \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#006400;\u0022\u003EEDIT: Perhaps leaving 1 type of intake as is can allow those who like airhogging to continue to do so.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that this change is litterally, a change to a single stat on 7-10 parts, it likely wouldn\u0027t require much time to implement. Probably more time discussing/testing it than implementing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it is one of two perfect times to do this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA: when overhauling spaceplane, users will likely redo many of their saved craft. You dont want to implement a change like his AFTER that, as that is the time it would interfere with gameplay the most. With the overhaul, users will be rebuilding craft anyway. Changing it during or just before a patch like this would minimize it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E B: when redoing flight physics. same reasons as above, but this IMO would be the second best time to implement this change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what you think guys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdited title since it is no longer just before the spaceplane patch.
