(For example: \u0022\u003Cem\u003EKerbin upper atmosphere supersonic flights are easiest to accomplish just above 18 km, the higher you go, the higher the speed required to break the sound barrier due to lower atmospheric density\u003C/em\u003E\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For contracts with specific orbits - include windows for accuracy (eg. Kerbin low equatorial orbit should be circular (\u002B-30%) between 68 and 250 km AP\u0026amp;PE with \u002B-20 degree inclination) and an illustration in the contract description showing how orbit is suppose to look like. Additional, helpful hint could be a real time display of desired and current AP/PE/inclination in the contract description, though it is \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Enot\u003C/span\u003E necessary if a proper windows of accuracy are set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Avoid spawning contracts for massless parts. It negates an important part of a challenge in the design and leads to rare problems with people trying to balance craft with mass parts unknowingly unbalancing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd on unrelated note:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One \u0022plant flag\u0022 contract per moon or planet, please.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T13:15:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sky_walker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T22:06:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit that I hate Procedurally Generated content when it only feel like an advanced form of laziness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is MANY part-testing contract I will never take because I can\u0027t possibly carryout along something else, because they aren\u0027t interesting in themselves, and because the penalty isn\u0027t worth to getting free-access to a part sooner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like to think the Devs just didn\u0027t get the time to do it yet, and we are only seeing the placeholder and they really planned an use for satellite later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut just in case : Here is some short suggestions :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make part-test contract simpler with less silly fine-print (like test a Lv909 engine at an altitude between 10km and 10.01km, and a speed between 500m/s and 501m/s), more like (test the Lv909 in orbit.... that\u0027s all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make some filter so part are being used in actually good situation (booster as a first stage, lv909 in space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ...start making delivery contract requiring to put complex object/satellite at the right altitude so I(we) feel doing like something actually intelligent and worth it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mdosogne","CreatedById":68302,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T02:05:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/81/Fine%20Print\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efine-print\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-11T02:10:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2014 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mdosogne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainTurbomuffin","CreatedById":113456,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T07:52:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like is a \u0027realistic\u0027 option for career mode, where unrandom contracts would make your space program realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Courrently, you can get a ridiculously high ammout of credits comparing to science points, as I experience. Contracts force you to build unstable and unlogical rockets such as testing SRBs on escape tarjectories, or lower-stage nuclear engines, or wheels on lander capsules, but I think \u0027stupid\u0027 rockets like that are the style of this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E My idea is a hard, realistic game mode where you get nearly the same ammout of credits for each successful explorer (science earner) mission (going to other planets) as a support, making it easy to get to an orbit, and get science there, and after 2-3 launches to orbit, wich for you could get paid, (maybe have a rendezvous contract there?) you can manage it for a larger mission to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/Minmus, and get lots of science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Than, with lots of science and less credits, you have enough parts for several fine-print mod like credit-earner missions (wich for you would not get the support/mission payment) like \u0027Dock this modul to my space station\u0027 and \u0027Rescure X;Y ( from a broken ship maybe)\u0027 but mostly orbit pre-made satellites/ships, wich are useless for you, but you could get paid, and manage the crew replacement, and life support updates of others\u0027 space stations for money. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After a few rocket launches for others, you could have enough money for your larger own projects, wich with, you could get some more science for new parts (For example, manned Minmus mission, unmanned Duna rover, ect.) or your own space station(s), capable of earning science, or crdits, slowly, with special modules: A space station lab, wich would slowly produce science, or credits from lots of electricity ( you would need a few solar arrays), continously replaced crew (after 1/2 years, they would stop working effectively), and from manually replaced experiments/\u0026lt;something indrustal activity here\u0026gt; ( You would have an experiment-container item, something like a fuel tank, wich in, you transport up several experiments, and return those wich were completed. Revovering a container with completed experimens/produced materials gives you the science/credit.). Labs would do these very slowly, but when you are flying at full time warp to other planets, stopping to refresh your station would give pleasant science/credits. For long-term planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Long planetary missions would need special life support and larger ships, so you would need to get that money first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Summarization: You get science from exploration missions, and you need a few credit-earner missions to get the money for science missions. If you have some shuttles/planes, you will get money faster and need less of these. Going further means more science, wich from you unlock better/bigger parts, and from better/bigger parts, you get even more money from credit-earner missions, and from even more money, you can go even further, and get even more science, and... ...expand like this. The small money support ables a good start, and could adjust the difficulity.
