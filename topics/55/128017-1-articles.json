So the Start Converter action in the BaseDrill class remains Start Converter when placed in the VAB. As parts such as the Drill-o-matic which has 2 of these inherited classes (ModuleAsteroidDrill and ModuleResourceHarvester), has two actions named Start Converter and the player can not tell which is which.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce the vessel loads with the part already attached (either into the flight scene, or leave the editor and come back to it later) the action\u0027s name is displayed as intended, in this case \u0022Start Surface Harvester\u0022 and \u0022Start Asteroid Harvester\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy assumption is that the code to rename the action runs in the OnLoad method which doesn\u0027t fire when a part is placed in the VAB, but I can\u0027t actually confirm this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T15:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, so THAT\u0027s what was going on!\u00A0 This was driving me nuts when I want to try to set up action groups.\u00A0 Specifically, the tip that saving-and-loading fixes the duplicate names is a godsend, thank you for that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you \u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efile a bug\u003C/a\u003E?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T16:07:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the report - please toss it over on the tracker \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-18T18:26:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E No, I haven\u0027t filed a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105198\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105198-roverdude/\u0022\u003E@RoverDude\u003C/a\u003E Is the link Snark posted the same bug tracker you mean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
