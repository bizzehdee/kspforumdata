And I don\u0027t see how one option or another will be more suited for the really interesting addition for the game, that is something engaging to do at the destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLets take your idea of micro biomes with high payout.

Right now the anomalies are so small and so sparse you you\u0027d be lucky to find any without looking them up. Kerbnet helps because you can flag the little question marks and then go down to check them out later.\u00A0The better you are at precise landings the less you need a rover, which is cool\u00A0but doesn\u0027t yet reward players as an integrated part of the gameplay (--thats the separate issue micro biomes could fix). The visuals and the mechanics\u00A0are linked, though, from the player experience. My feeling is the visual\u00A0on-the-surface experience should be a part of it. Volcanoes and geysers--aside from being a bit more real--would necessarily be \u003Cem\u003Etall\u003C/em\u003E. If you landed anywhere remotely close you could see them on the horizon and would know to drive toward them. Other geological formations could be smaller but more common, and should also jump out to your eye as you scanned the landscape. Some of these could be scattered heavily in some biomes and not in others, ice crystals in the Mun\u0027s polar lowlands or fossils in Duna\u0027s canyons for instance.\u00A0Some of these features could be fixed, others could be randomized for each save. Its that interactive, exploratory\u00A0experience I think we should be after--mapping from orbit, scouting on the ground and discovering things in the moment that we didn\u0027t expect. Don\u0027t foist a particular storyline on players, give them a real landscape to explore and let them create their own story.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI don\u0027t think this would be nuts to implement, either. You\u0027d really just need few models and some visual effects that could be re-skinned from planet to planet.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-14T19:22:10Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2017 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
