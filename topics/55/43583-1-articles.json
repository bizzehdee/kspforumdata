Also, for a 16 year old, this man is ridiculously talented. On the subject of in-game music, however, I don\u0027t think it will work out very well because composing music that can loop well with itself and be able to transition with other music flawlessly at any point during the composition is borderline impossible. Not only is this task difficult, but after a few launches the music loses it\u0027s novelty and just becomes a repetitive annoyance. Yes, one could argue that it is possible to input multiple themes but they still fall victim to the same fate as a single theme. Lastly, would dynamic music be it\u0027s own sound slider in the settings, or will it be combined with regular background music? I personally like the current in-game music and, though I support this idea, I would sometimes want to just listen to the regular stuff instead of both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks For Reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceHole","CreatedById":79449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T06:18:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WHYFORYOU\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WHYFORYOU\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOTB1VfEn7g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei just watched an amazing guy do a rewrite of the original KSP sound track ... well it is hard to type in words but easier if i just show you the video ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMade By : AlvaroALorite \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOTB1VfEn7g?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry but no.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe soundtrack isnt bad but it just doesnt seem to fit well its way to intrusive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt somehow reminds me of Starfox or some other N64 game hmm\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso i think the soundtrack in general is too complex with too many things happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes less complex and less intrusive is the way to go.
