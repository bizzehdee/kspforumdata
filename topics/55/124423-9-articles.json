It used to work just fine in atmosphere and ion gliders were a thing, but that was never a realistic thing to do. Then 1.0 came along and hit the ion engine with a dose of reality, rendering it useless in thick atmosphere. All those lovely ion gliders that so many people built, \u003Cem\u003Egone, useless, obsolete\u003C/em\u003E. And there hasn\u0027t been a replacement, we don\u0027t have an electric propeller or anything else to do realistically what the ion engine once did unrealistically. And that wasn\u0027t even a change that really benefited the ion engine in other ways, there was nothing really \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E or confusing or problematic with it making thrust in atmosphere other than the lack of realism. But you know what? In my view, \u003Cem\u003ESquad did the right thing\u003C/em\u003E when they changed the ion engine in 1.0. And if we want to fly on Eve or Duna we have to find new ways, stock or modded.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESQUAD did do the right thing with changing the ion engine to not work well in the atmosphere. The ion gliders were completely unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is that this change actually does the opposite: It removes a craft type which is realistic. I don\u0027t want to see light to medium sized VTOLS removed or reduced to having to use rocket engines because of a cosmetic change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be nearly as bad as you\u0027re making it out to be, especially with new parts on their way.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it will be quite bad to any small to medium sized VTOL, especially fighter style ones, and anything which has a jet engine at an unusual angle. People building those will either have to deal with them looking aesthetically hideous or stop building them all together. For example, take my NAFA-18. It\u0027s already been through an update which forced some uglynization (Does anyone know if there is an actual word which can fit there?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/23970208915159394/F4B0F2CF130941313C6F72808072D86AFE2BEF0C/\u0022 alt=\u0022F4B0F2CF130941313C6F72808072D86AFE2BEF0C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis first image is of a NAFA-18-B. This craft ran on one basic jet to propel it upwards, and a second to propel it forwards. I even used goo canisters to make it look like it had closing intakes. Of course, update 1.0 rolled out and completely nerfed the basic jets to make them impractical on all but the smallest VTOLs. I was OK with this change as it did give the turbos a bit more value, though I do wish the turbos were a bit smaller, as you\u0027ll see in the next picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/621848412057775636/33569B686D86E5F4D51278319EE09AF5769F901B/\u0022 alt=\u002233569B686D86E5F4D51278319EE09AF5769F901B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what the NAFA-18-D looks like today. The basics had to be replaced with turbos, and an extra turbo had to be installed in the cargo bay. The turbos now have to clip through the top of the craft, and clip through the bottom slightly as well when the bay is closed. It isn\u0027t as pretty as the old setup, but is still looks good enough for service. If we get the longer jets, this all of a sudden has two massive pillars sticking out of it. The only solution would be to spam the new small jets and just hope that they aren\u0027t too tall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt isn\u0027t just my VTOL which will have this problem. Giggleplex\u0027s F-35-thing will have this problem, replica Harriers will have this problem, and those small VTOLs that Starwhip and Upsilon built will have this problem. VTOLs will either have to be ugly as heck, absurdly tall, rocket based, or spamming small .625m engines.

Of course, legitimate is probably a term I should through out here, but I\u0027m not sure what to replace it with. Maybe more universally accepted? A stock craft is far more accepted than a modded craft, as with a stock craft you don\u0027t have to change the game from its base product. Maybe that\u0027s why it feels slightly more legitimate to build something stock rather than with mods; you rely only on the tools provided by the devs of the game, which the devs intended to put into the game, rather than on tools created by a third party.\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the added on turbine provides no extra realistic function or even a hitbox, so it only looks realistic.

(Not a blanket statement there, I know there are mods which present different and sometimes more difficult challenges). I don\u0027t think it is them being scared of the modding community, but rather them showing restraint so they can push the limits of craft built from the set of parts designed to be used in the game; the set of parts everyone uses and everyone is familiar with.
