However, most of the jetpack\u0027s characteristics (linear and rotational thruster power, propellant consumption rate, etc.) is still specified in the kerbalEVA config rather than the jetpack config. It would be good if these were part of the jetpack rather than part of the kerbal, as this would open up the possibility of customized, specialized jetpacks in mods or stock:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDifferent jetpacks could have stronger or weaker thrusters.
