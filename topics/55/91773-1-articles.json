I wonder what you guys think of these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStaged Abort\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost aborts take 2 or 3 steps and sometimes more. However you just have one button, the backspace. This leads to action grouping. Besides wasting action groups, we now have more buttons that end the mission instantly if accidentally pressed. In addition these buttons are near other action groups like deploy solar panels. There are other things we can do in the stock game but they all are clunky and have downsides. If we could stage aborts just like regular staging this would be great. Example: First press dumps fairing, second press fires LES, third press jettisons LES, fourth press opens parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESafe Staging\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently we have the largest easiest to reach button on the keyboard do the staging. This button is next to some throttle controls, time skip controls, and the modifier key. It is surprising I don\u0027t ditch more capsules in orbit around Kerbol. There is a stage lock, modifier \u002B L will lock the stage. It will also fire your RCS, is clunky, and the alt key is next to the space bar sometimes defeating the purpose. If you forgot you have it set you might lithobrake when you didn\u0027t intend to. These don\u0027t happen often but they are thoroughly upsetting when they do. Just back from Jool with a million science? Oops. I suggest that there be an option to set staging to modifier \u002B space. The double key press required is not hard and the staging is normally safe instead of normally armed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T04:36:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI normally have engine toggle/shutdown in my action groups (mostly spaceplanes), these help in situations like uneven engine cutoff. With quick reflexes you can also cut all throtle with x before activating the abort sequence. but I\u0027ve seen that with a good escape pod design you don\u0027t need to turn them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, often times were having an emergency needed mission abort was while using solid boosters that unbalanced the rocket. And you can\u0027t shut those down, which leads to focusing on better escape sequences. Or just watch the fireworks. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the stage lock being somewhat clunky. I haven\u0027t had problems when locking as I normally have RCS off so SAS won\u0027t drain it. I think that having a more obvious stage lock display would be nice though. The little purple blinking light is a good start, but it\u0027s too far from normal focus to work efficiently. Adding a display in the navball might help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the double key staging, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good solution. Staging is so critical to the game that having it on the most reachable (and natural) key is a good idea. It could be enter, but it\u0027s too far away from normal control keys to be effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a stage lock bypass with the mod\u002Bspacebar combination might be something else though. Using mod\u002Bkey to do an similar/alternate action is somewhat intuitive design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry remapping your stage key to mod\u002Bspace and see how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-02T04:40:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Try remapping your stage key to mod\u002Bspace and see how it works.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t.
