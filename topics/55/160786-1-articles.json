Sometimes I\u0027ll do this on a modded install, and I\u0027ll notice the topics are a little out of order, and usually the stock pages are at the bottom.

So I suggest\u00A0adding some organization to these pages, either based on mod or alphabet, with the stock pages towards the top.

Something that allows it to be put in different orders, like we have in the part panel would be better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
