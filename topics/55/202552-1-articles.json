On the \u003Cem\u003ERendering\u003C/em\u003E Section, you will find a Slider called \u003Cem\u003ETexture Quality\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s usually on \u003Cstrong\u003EFull Res\u003C/strong\u003E, and the other options are \u003Cstrong\u003EHalf Res\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EQuarter Res\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003EEighth Res\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverybody is upgrading the Textures to 4K nowadays, and this not only is a waste for people gaming on 1080p, as it more than doubles the memory needed for textures both on GPU as on GPU (including loading times). By lowering this setting, the Textures will be downgraded on loading, saving you some precious memory. Even if you have a beefier machine, if you are playing on 1080p this setting would save some VRAM, allowing you to get better FPS or even rendering the game playable on\u00A0cheaper GPU cards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bad side of this solution is that Textures that are fine for 1080p will be downgrade too (it\u0027s all or nothing), and this can render the U.I. somewhat problematic (some widgets can get so blurred on Eighth Res that you can\u0027t tell if a checkbox is checked or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-05-26T20:36:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2021 08:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Lisias\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEternal typos of the Englishless Mind\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-26T18:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223977958\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202552\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221621859128\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199169\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kspnerd122\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/24/2021 at 1:25 PM, kspnerd122 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank Nerta for being awesome\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I kinda like to disagree with that statement, because, although nerta has made some good mods, you have to realize that first off, no tweakscale compatibility, despite it being ridiculously easy to add, 2nd, some of the mods they make are a lagfest on slower computers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI for one shall be very excited to test your\u00A0\u00A0full catalogue of unique parts, with those issues magically addressed,\u00A0when you release them\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-03T22:59:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIon engines are made for small probes.
