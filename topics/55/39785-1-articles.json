I mean, I know it\u0027s not a priority because it\u0027s simply aesthetic but it doesn\u0027t seem like something that would be particularly difficult or time consuming to implement. The reason I say this is because its only a colour change and not a model change, also they have it while in IVA and in their portraits while in flight. So, is there any ETA or even any official word at all of whether/when this will be implemented?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: I say it seems \u0022easy to implement\u0022 this feature but I have absolutely ZERO knowledge of coding and generally suck with computers so I apologize for ignorance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T02:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to the dev forum, most likely to have a more interesting discussion here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T02:02:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think because those guys are the first three Kerbals created when the game was launched.
