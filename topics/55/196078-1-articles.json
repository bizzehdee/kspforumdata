What do I mean with that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Be able to rebind the mouse buttons. My mouse\u0027s LMB isn\u0027t working so I reversed the R and LMB functions, and now I can\u0027t do things like open the vessel\u0027s info. Some people would also like more customization, and maybe left handed players would like it too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Have two keys binded for the same command (kinda like how GTA V lets the player bind multiple keys for the same thing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Make it so every key can be used as a bind\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: the two and third suggestions are already possible, so ignore them, but I\u0027d like the first one to be inserted into the game.
