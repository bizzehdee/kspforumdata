(Maybe replaced with secondary launch pads?)\n\nDefault Flag: Kerbin\u0026Mun Flag.\n\nDefault Name: Kerbal Space Commission.\n\nScience Mode:\n\n-The Space Program is in a super-funded mode where money is no problem.\n\n-Rocketry is still in it\u0027s early stages.\n\n-No Administration Facility.\n\nDefault Flag: Retro\n\nDefault Name: Kerbal Space Agency.\n\nCareer Mode:\n\n-The Space Program starts in a basic form, and is still struggling with politics and planning.\n\n-Rocketry is still in it\u0027s early stages.\n\n-The Space Center Facilities are low-tech and quality.\n\nDefault Flag: Kerbal Space Program logo\n\nDefault Name: Kerbal Space Program\n\n**New Modes**\n\nCommercial Mode:\n\n-The Space Program starts in a basic form, and is still struggling with planning and funding.\n\n-Tech is developed instantly based on the R\u0026D Upgrades. The Space Program does not have to deal with science at all.\n\n-R\u0026D Facility is renamed \u0022Manufacturing Facility.\u0022\n\n-Recoveries are more lucrative.\n\nDefault Flag: Satellite\n\nDefault Name: Kerbal Space Company\n\nCommunist Mode:\n\n-Space Center starts unupgraded.\n\n-Full funding has been diverted to the Space Program.\n\n-Different tech tree based upon starting with probes.\n\n-Space Center Upgrades require reputation (The Government upgrades the space center only if you\u0027ve done cool stuff)\n\n-Rocketry is in it\u0027s infancy.\n\n-Launch from the high-latitude KSC2 Launch Site.\n\nDefault Flag: Rings\n\nDefault Name: Kerbcosmos\n\nNote: The following is based on an imaginary concept of multiplayer in my mind.\n\n**Multiplayer modes**\n\nSandbox:\n\nMultiple Space Programs, all co-operating/co-existing in sandbox mode.\n\nSpace Race:\n\nCommunism v Career. 1\u002BAI to 2 players\n\nCompetition:\n\nCommercial v Commercial v Commercial etc... 2\u002B players\n\nRivalry:\n\nCareer v Career v Career etc... 2\u002B Players\n\nEnemies:\n\nCommunism v Communism v Communism etc... 2\u002B players.\n\nGlobal:\n\nMultiplayer between any type of space programs, aside from Sandbox.\n\nAll of these modes except for Sandbox and Space Race allow you to change which programs are allied/partnered and which programs are rivals.\n\n**Changes to Contracts**\n\nCommercial: No part test contracts, and explore contracts give much more reputation. Rescue contracts are more lucrative. Also, nondescript/secret payload contracts pay more (and also exist for other space programs, and are basically just like those in BTSM)\n\nCommunism: Military contracts to test missiles and deploying bombs and such.\n\n**Multiplayer changes:**\n\nWorld First Contracts aside from Launch A New Ship are taken by the first agency to complete them, and then any subsequent completions have much less payouts, and Explore Contracts give a LOT of reputation to the first agency to complete it. But there is another thing. When you do a part test contract, you make its node in the science tree cheaper (in science) for everyone. There is also diminishing science returns for science gained if it\u0027s already been discovered by another agency. And finally, when rival space programs get \u002BRep, you get -Rep.\n\nUnless you have a military contract, destroying another space agency\u0027s space center will cause you to lose your job.\n\n**Space Race**\n\nSpace Race has a single player and multiplayer mode. Single Player uses an AI to simulate another space program by spawning ships in orbit and changing its Rep\u002BScience\u002B/Funds values based on a chance of failure or success. They will never get a military contract to destroy the player\u0027s space agency. They have defensive missiles which will destroy the player\u0027s rockets/planes/etc, and at strategic points in their territory. Landing in another player\u0027s territory will cause negative reputation, so be careful."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T02:10:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Communist Mode\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\u003E \n\u003E Space Race:\n\u003E \n\u003E Communism v Career.\n\n***YES.***\n\nAhem- Sorry.\n\nSome of these do sound pretty cool, but I don\u0027t think SQUAD is going to add new gamemodes... and these feel like a bit too many, don\u0027t they?"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T03:23:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ***YES.***\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Ahem- Sorry.\n\u003E \n\u003E Some of these do sound pretty cool, but I don\u0027t think SQUAD is going to add new gamemodes... and these feel like a bit too many, don\u0027t they?\n\nI think Multiplayer would be just one gamemode, but with the server setup including what types of space programs are allowed and clients choosing out of what is allowed."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T04:01:56Z","Content":"Might be good as a mod, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:06:50Z","Content":"I would probably play more DarkMultiPlayer if I had anyone to play with ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:41:03Z","Content":"I like space race multiplayer mode.
