Once you bring parts(see nr.2 below) to your space station/ship in orbit, you can build! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETools must be brought into space in order to be able to build anything. (should be hard to research, and late-game items).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip compartment parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComes in 3 sizes, small, normal and large. Same sizes as the RCS tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn these you can store things depending on the size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the small compartments you can store RCS thrusters, struts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd larger items for the larger compartments. That way you can bring stuff to your ship assembly in space. A very good example for when it would be perfect:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen assembling a 2\u002B part ship in orbit, use the STRUTS to make your ship stronger and not become a bendy-straw that will wiggle and break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore EVA actions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if exactly this is suggested, but here goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Being able to hook kerbals together when on EVA. Kinda strap them together, so you can fly with 1 kerbals RCS and the other one just hangs after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Small constructions in space. Adding on to spaceships/stations using power-tools. (mentioned above)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Being able to hook kerbals to ships/stations.

I like #2. That storing struts thing could help. Like say when building an interplanetary ship IN ORBIT. It would be really cool, as well as part welding/ building in space. Like you bring up raw materials in a medium storage thing. And then use those raw materials to build a fuel tank, or capsule, OR ENGINE. Now this would be something I want to see!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DiEvAl","CreatedById":66247,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T09:48:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d be nice to have it in stock game, but for now you can use Kerbal Attachment System mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
