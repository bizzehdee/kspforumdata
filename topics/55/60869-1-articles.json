If you don\u0027t feel like reading, please refrain from commenting. This will be mildly ranty and possibly a bit disjointed and incoherent. I\u0027m pretty much pulling all this crap off my head, where it has been stuck for about three days. If something needs clarifying, just ask nicely. These are based off a lot of what I hear, as well as my own personal opinions and suggestions. I do not claim to represent the interest of everyone, but given the similar opinions which I have heard, I do claim to hold an opinion similar to a significant fraction of the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, science. What do I think? I think it\u0027s too monotonous. I think science is an exploitable clickfest which allows a skilled player to clear the tech tree in less than five missions (current record stands at 3). I\u0027d like to see science become more meaningful. Does that mean more difficult? No! Science difficulty is decent, however, I think the system by which it is implemented allows way too much in the ways of exploitation. Now, I will touch on a concept here called complexity scaling. In a nutshell, it involves an approach to difficulty which makes higher difficulties use more complex mechanics (larger, more varied resource trees, more realistic and challenging tech trees (rearranged, ScienceDefs remain the same), and possibly more part varieties. The most relevant part of that concept (which I\u0027ll write a suggestion on later) is more science tools. But I digress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do we improve science? A handful of ways. For starters, let\u0027s get into biome sensitivity. Biome sensitivity is little more than an exploit in it\u0027s current implementation. How so? Because experiments can benefit when they shouldnt. This brings me briefly to another topic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment type. For now, I have come up with three. Point data, local area, and visual. Point data is pretty straight forward. Point data is the type which all sensors fit into. These types of experiments produce numerical data. Numerical data science cannot be increased by laboratory analysis. It can always be transmitted at 100%. Local area are your materials lab, which I have some thoughts on later, the surface sample, the atmospheric analysis package, which I also have some ideas for, and the goo canister. These can have their science yield increased by laboratory analysis of results, which is another topic. Lastly, is visual. These are your crew reports and EVA reports. As you can see, the majority of experiments fall into point data and local area, which are only effected by the immediate environment. Orbit is orbit, regardless of what you are above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, this brings up some complications. Some instruments which should be stock, like the DMagic magnetometer, would return the same readings over the ocean as over the desert, but may return different readings over the poles and possibly the mountains. The solution I see is to set up instruments with a ScienceDef which corresponds to all biomes it will pull that reading from, so that a magnetometer would pull the same reading over kerbin highlands, plains, desert, oceans, etc. but pulls a different reading over the mountains, and yet another different reading over the tundra and poles. In this respect, certain instruments can gain limited biome sensitivity without being overly exploitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELocal area experiments, which point data is realistically a subset thereof, lose biome sensitivity (for the most part, as explained above) at the upper atmosphere, which starts at either 12000m or 32000m, I do not remember exactly. Biome sensitivity is only retained in the lower atmosphere. Beyond that, \u0027biomes\u0027 become altitude layers encompassing the entire body. There is upper atmosphere, low orbit, and high orbit, between which I feel the dividing line should be somewhere around a few thousand kilometers (it may be good as is, I do not remember where it actually sits). Local area experiments provide considerably more science. The atmosphere nosecone clearly would not work beyond the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisual experiments are tricky. I feel like EVA reports and crew reports are two versions of the same thing, furthering the clickfest exploitation of science. I feel though that they are both necessary as, in certain circumstances, the results yielded would be different. One such scenario would be when landed on a planet. A report inside the capsule would be extremely limited compared to that of one taken outside the craft. I do not pretend to have all the answers and would like some alternative input on how to handle EVA reports, as I currently do not have a good solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstruments. I think certain experiments need reworking. I\u0027m going to start with the goo canister. Rather than the warning about inoperablility, I\u0027d like to see some more immersion which conveys the same information. Here are some examples. When the goo canister is open in the lower atmosphere, some goo could leak out. In the upper atmosphere flying, some goo could be sucked out and blown away towards retrograde. I\u0027m going to assume that while closed, it is retaining kerbin atmospheric properties. When opened in space, some of the goo can be sucked out by explosive decompression, freeze, and fade away. This would make it more clear visually that the experiment is single use. Also, I\u0027d like to see different effects when the data is removed. Perhaps the screen cylinder can be removed. The same thing goes for the materials lab, but more on that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe atmospheric analysis package seems to be flawed. I think it should be redesigned as a piece which takes an atmospheric sample rather than runs full analysis. This would make laboratory analysis later believable and profitable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurface sample. Give this an animation please!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaterials lab. Right now, it seems to be little more than a stackable, glorified goo canister as it functions identically. I think it needs to be somehow set apart as more valuable, or else it becomes the EVA report to the crew report that is the goo canister. My suggestion would be to make it multi-experiment capable. It has a computer bank in there, so perhaps it could run some data based experiment, which is endlessly repeatable, and it could run a physical experiment, which would be consumed on use and could be laboratory analyzed. Also, the same animation suggestions about the goo canister apply to this too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaboratory analysis. I keep bringing this up, but there is more to it. I think whenever science is returned to kerbin, it is automatically analyzed by R\u0026amp;D, and should yield full science value. I think that since local area experiments are not transmitted at 100%, they can be analyzed in the mobile lab, and then transmitted back to kerbin for full science value. This would make the mobile lab clearly practical for missions which return is not planned, at least not for a while. This however, is a contradiction, since it takes kerbals to do the processing. Most people like to return their kerbals, yet the role of the lab in the above scenario is clearly designed for missions not returning. Again, I\u0027m not all knowing. I\u0027d like other input on this to help figure out the best course of action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes. Probes need love. For starters, I\u0027d like to see pretty much all of the parts in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24593-WIP-RLA-Stockalike-0-9-4-released-27th-November?\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERLA Stockalike\u003C/a\u003E go stock. This would give a lot more options of for 10 ton or less lifters and probes. It\u0027s full of great parts, is well balanced, and offers a ton of variety in an already near-perfect stock styling. For more orbital science, which probes are some of the best at, the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64755-WIP-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-4-1-%281-19-2014%29?\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDMagic Orbital Science\u003C/a\u003E pack needs to go stock. This adds two point data instruments and one visual. More point data experiments is always good to enhance probes. Since they, by this suggestion, transmit at 100%, it makes the return journey not worth the extra launch mass. Sacrificial probes would be perfect for doing lots of this, and RLA stockalike (and to a lesser extent, RLA power generation) gives them some great tools to get where they need to go to do science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, point data can\u0027t be what probes are limited to. There was the Viking lander, as well as the multitude of rovers we have sent to Mars. I\u0027m going to suggest creating a few tools for probes. First, give them a camera. I always think of a predator drone style camera as it gives good range of motion with decent resolution, as well as looking somewhat in style. This camera would let them take pictures, as many as they want. if a picture of something has already been taken, they earn diminishing returns (minus at least 50% science value off the current for each picture already taken). This gives them something to compete with crew reports. Another option I see is to make modified versions of the current experiments, particularly the atmospheric tool, in probe size. An atmosphere scoop could then feed into a probe processing unit. This tool does the same analysis as the mobile lab, allowing experiments to be transmitted for more. It requires a good ammount of power, but will not get it to 100%. I think a fair number would be 85%. There should also be a tool for probes to take surface samples, making rovers great tools. All in all, this gives probes a lot more of the respect they deserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETech tree. Now I\u0027m gonna get a bit more into that difficulty-complexity scaling crap. I think when starting a career save, you should get a popup. This window would ask you several things, some of which I\u0027ll mention in my difficulty-complexity suggestion later on. One of them would be tech tree type. It gives several choices. So far, I\u0027ve thought up 3. Default, Realistic, Ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefault. Clearly, this is the stock tree as it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnmanned. This starts you with probes. It quickly works you into manned, but your first mission to orbit, your first Mun flyby, and your first interplanetary transfer will all likely be probe based. At least, the tree encourages that. This tree should be balanced more in line with real world technology while still retaining playability (but you wouldn\u0027t get 2.5m upper stage parts before lower, and clustering engines would be cheaper then huge mainsails).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround. This tree would focus on starting with aircraft and wheeled vehicles. It forces you to do some kerbin exploration before you can leave your parent body and go elsewhere. Beyond that, it\u0027s balanced realistically, much like Unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStation science. I have a whole list of ideas for this segment but I\u0027m pretty burnt out right now, so I\u0027ll edit this in later. Be sure to check up when I do that, as it may ask for more advice. Stations are a complex animal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you read all that, good on you. If you read all that, you may now discuss, suggest amendments, and otherwise share your thoughts and possibly lend some solutions where I could not come up with any. And that\u0027s all I have for science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TADBTD","CreatedById":73888,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T00:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Sierra\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0026lt;snip\u0026gt;\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMAZING.
