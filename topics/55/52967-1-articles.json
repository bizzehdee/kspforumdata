That same fueltank I was also using to drain fuel from for the shuttle engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever with shift in balance, a big rocketmoter firing, in tandem with two big solid boosters, made that after about 100 meters of flight the tank was so light, and the shuttle still so heavy full of fuel, that it just filpped over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like for squad to implement a way for me to make a simple flight plan which lets me control the thrust of multiple rocket engines at the same time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr better still, make that the SAS doesn\u0027t only control the flightsurfaces and reactiontwheels, but also distributes the thrurst in such a manner that the center of lift, gravity and thrust are alligned at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"romanyk","CreatedById":92404,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T15:20:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of a flight plan that would let you plan the entire flight before taking off like pilots do a real life.

On the NASA shuttle for example, the orange tank is feeding the shuttle engines, then it runs out, then burns it\u0027s on-board fuel, and is only one way, and the flow is not controllable. However, in-flight, engine-discrete, thrust altering, is a real desperate need for KSP, as everything has to be perfectly symmetrical and even, or have gigantic gimbals (seen the Tiberdyne shuttle gimbal? LOL!). Although there are mods out there for it, they can\u0027t get \u0027round SRB\u0027s and other things, so they don\u0027t really work for much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope too that they develop some kind of other control other than SAS torque, however something tells me it is low-priority/not-planned since they may think that this would make things too easy if everyone could design some horribly asymmetrical spacecraft and it still fly because of discrete-thrust-altering SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget, there is great fun in achieving something difficult, like building a working KSP shuttle.
