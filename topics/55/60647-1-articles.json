There is a known bug where attaching struts to a fuel tank attached by radial decoupler nullifies the decoupler\u0027s ejection force. This is known and slated to be fixed. For now, Sepatrons are an amazing thing. If those aren\u0027t good enough, go look up a single part mod called Perfect-trons. They are mounted differently and back more force than stock sepatrons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
