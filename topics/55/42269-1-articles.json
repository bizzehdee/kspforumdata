I think it may be too much work to do full cutscenes for now, but some sort of shift in music, or a celebration animation when your Kerbal first sets foot on Mun, or achievements. Whatever you could do easily and build on later, for a number of major milestones in the game. It would be a very nice touch, even in Sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
