To have possible failures on components. This could affect literally anything. From batteries, engines, fuel tanks, de couplers, even parachutes, or ladders, lights, science equipment, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it breaks, your kerbal can do an EVA (if possible) to attempt to fix it. Which would mean leaving the spacecraft, going to the part that broke, set it as target, then right clicking your kerbal and clicking \u0022repair module\u0022. (The success rate of them repairing it would be based on their stupidity stat. However, even the smartest Kerbal can\u0027t always fix something. )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this can\u0027t always be done depending on the situation, but that\u0027s realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts would break at the moment of using them. (Since that\u0027s most likely when you\u0027d realize a part is broken anyway).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOlder parts, (components and items lower on the tech tree) have a higher chance of breaking. Because they are older, and of the first variety of parts, therefore aren\u0027t \u0022perfected\u0022 yet. While parts farther up the research tech tree have a much lower chance of failing. (But they still can).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think with parts being able to break would be a huge addition to realism (and fun), needless to say also adding quite a spin on challenging situations that may be thrown at you out of nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible Scenario\u0027s:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Imagine Bill kerbal attempting a Mun landing, only to have his De-coupler malfunction. Now he can\u0027t properly land on the Mun. Well this would open up several options.. Abort the mission and return to Kerbal. Have Bill attempt to repair it himself, and if that fails, send another shuttle up to attempt to do emergency repairs with a smarter kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Perhaps you use the TAC mod which requires Kerbals to eat, etc. And perhaps the Electrical power in your ship shorts out, and you now need to launch an emergency rescue mission to get the kerbal or 3 back home via a new ship before their food runs out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) That nifty satellite you have over Kerbal with the nice shiny telescope, and array of scientific components just broken down. The electrical power, and telescope both malfunctioned at the same time. Now you gotta send up a kerbal crew to repair the two parts and get that satellite back up and running.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossible new modules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) A \u0022Maintenance Bay\u0022 (Similar size to the material bay) for ships. Having this bay will increase your kerbals chances of successfully repairing a module due to having a much wider array of tools at their disposal (and \u0022How to fix things 101\u0022 manuals).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) \u0022Emergency Power Large\u0022 components built into Pods, including external ones for probes, or landers. The Emergency Power is quite hefty, but has a good amount of charge stored. It can\u0027t be used as an effective battery, but it will supply enough power to allow kerbals with TAC to continue breathing and eating for a little longer buying the rescue party time to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) \u0022Emergency Power\u0022 Built into some pods, and probe cores. These additional cores, or pods would be slightly heavier due to the additional emergency batteries, but will supply enough power to at least control the ship and allow it a bit more power to get your ship situated for the rescue party, either by allowing it a chance to turn and burn to an appropriate orbit, or slowing its speed etc. However it can\u0027t be used as a battery pack and can\u0027t be re charged. (later ones can be recharged)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-03T14:56:33Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2014 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edwardc","CreatedById":94663,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T14:46:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) You definitely want to be able to fix things.
