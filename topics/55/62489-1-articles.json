But it\u0027s probable you\u0027d have to do some clean up in a modeling program yourself before it could be submitted to Shapeways. Automated tools can get it wrong. For instance, I exported this (using a plugin I hacked together in a couple of minutes and some copy\u002Bpaste code from the Unity wiki):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6OxiR.png\u0022 alt=\u00226OxiR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it has some issues. For an obvious one, there is no face on the bottom of the launch clamp bases:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6OxGj.png\u0022 alt=\u00226OxGj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere isn\u0027t a need for there to be since no user would ever see it as it\u0027s mounted to the ground, but for printing that\u0027s an issue. I ran it through cloud.netfabb.com and while I have to say the results were much more impressive than I thought, there would still be a serious problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://puu.sh/6Oxv6.png\u0022 alt=\u00226Oxv6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see their tool removed the section of the radial decoupler that attaches the side tanks to the center, so the vessel is now visually in three separate pieces. The tool actually broke it into a total of 15 separate meshes; probably not a good thing when you want it to be all one object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a cool idea but I think in this case some modeling experience will be necessary for good results. These meshes were designed with rendering and not printing in mind, after all\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
