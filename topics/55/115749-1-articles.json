I assume what\u0027s going on in the game\u0027s code in the background, is that whenever a ship isn\u0027t loaded into physics and has research started, the game just applies the conversion at whatever rate, and electricity requirements are ignored because the ship WOULD need to be loaded into physics to compute how much electricity is generated by solar. That could be computationally expensive if you start adding a few research labs throughout the solar system. So the solution I would think would make sense, would be to just compute a quick number from the geometry and the type of solar panels on your ship, as to what percentage of incident sunlight is converted into electricity. Then, if the ship is illuminated, it generates electricity, if it isn\u0027t it doesn\u0027t. Essentially just do a really crude, as light as computationally possible, calculation of received electricity from solar, and then use that result in calculating how much data is converted into science. Yes, it\u0027s not that hard to add solar panels anyway and it only would cost 1000 or so funds to cover the generation requirements for a researching lab, so if the game takes the shortcut of ignoring electricity requirements it\u0027s kind of justified. But I prefer the idea of being sh*t out of luck if you didn\u0027t account for the amount of electricity that researching requires. I would also suggest that this solution be applied to drilling and ore accumulation... I\u0027ve not tested it but I assume it just ignores electricity requirements. And ESPECIALLY with the drill, it takes a LOT of electricity and half the planet it\u0027s on is in darkness half the time, so I would really like to see ore accumulation bottlenecked by electricity income when drilling vessels aren\u0027t loaded into physics, if it isn\u0027t already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIssue number 2 has been discussed a lot... I think the maximum amount of science you can get per year should be set to something like 1000 science or something, and then the rates are just calculated to satisfy this requirement. From my spreadsheet calculations, if you start with 500 data, and a level5 scientist converts 0.06% of all total remaining data that day to science at a rate of 5 science per data, then it would take 1 year to generate 1000 science. So the ONLY 2 numbers that we need to agree on are, \u003Cstrong\u003Escience per data,\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Epercentage per day (for a level5 scientist)\u003C/strong\u003E, and of course a few other details. I suggest that the maximum for these 2 numbers respectively be 500 and 0.06%, and maybe level0 scientists could get something like 0.02 percentage per day, yielding about 200 science starting with 500 data over the course of a year. Putting the numbers like that would nerf the MPL to the point that you couldn\u0027t abuse it, but if you really tried to have a bunch of them going and really tried to max out your science yield, only then would you get some tasty science.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T00:08:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bug_\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a terrible idea.
