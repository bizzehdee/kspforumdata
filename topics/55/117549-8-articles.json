Mercury was fine for upsy-downsie joyrides of a few orbits, but that\u0027s about it, while in KSP the Mk1 gets sent all over the system. No multi-crew spacecraft in real life has been anywhere near that small, for good reasons.\n\u003E \n\nThat is problem of life support not capsule size ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T09:50:35Z","Content":"I built MOLE to fill my perceived gap between the Mk1 and the Mk1-2, and to create early space stations before you get docking technology. Originally I just had an extension to the Mk1, but eventually I created a Gemini-like 2-kerb capsule. I settled upon 1.875m in order to accommodate helmets, which influenced my decision to make 1.875m station parts, but that also resulted in a need for a 1.875m launch system. I\u0027m pretty happy with the end result though. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nI think having a 1.875m 2-crew pod in stock wouldn\u0027t be necessary unless you had enough parts to complement its capabilities. What would the 1.875m parts do that the existing 1.25m and 2.5m parts don\u0027t, so that players would want to use them? MOLE, for instance, has a science system geared towards researching how to live and work in space. It also has wet workshops (once I fix a bug) that let you launch station modules as fuel tanks and then let you convert them into living spaces after reaching orbit. Without compelling gameplay options, the existing part diameters- and parts- work just fine.\n\nFor stock, unless they\u0027re looking to expand functionality, it might be easier to make a 1-kerb extension for the Mk1 that is also 1.25m. You\u0027d get the functionality that people are looking for without adding a lot of parts to the core game, and it wouldn\u0027t have to look like you stuck an aircraft fuselage onto the back of a space capsule. Such an extension might have additional functionality that other parts don\u0027t, such as a built-in fuel cell.\n\nSo go with 1.875m if you want a bunch of new functionality, or just make a small extension if you just need extra crew space early in the game."},{"CreatedByName":"78stonewobble","CreatedById":97559,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T11:44:44Z","Content":"I\u0027m sorry if this has allready been suggested... but in regards to fitting 2 kerbals in a small space due to helmets, couldn\u0027t you arrange them to lie/sit opposite eachother?"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-23T14:11:07Z","Content":"MOLE is awesome, too!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-28T19:07:16Z","Content":"MOLE is pretty awesome!
