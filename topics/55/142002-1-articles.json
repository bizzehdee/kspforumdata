A high AoA on re-entry keeps them out of the airstream, and you can keep them extended down almost to 35km altitude. I typically keep the nose at 45 degrees and re-enter with a relatively shallow angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf coming in from outsystem or minmus, you probably want to make a pass or two to bleed speed off first, but this works great from 3-500km AP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: This also lets you push your flight profile a bit on the way up; getting a bit more heat on ascent, without risking nukes trying to explode you when circularizing.
