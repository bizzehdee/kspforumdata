Ok, that sound fine but what\u0027s the price of struts... 250 that doesn\u0027t seem too bad right but going back to the average number of struts on a ship 64*250= 16000 ...that\u0027s only for struts you could buy Just under 19 LV-T30\u0027s with all that cash\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith the new update the cost of struts on some over engineered ships will be very game changing instead of slapping on 80 struts to make the thing solid as a rock we will have to find out new ways to make our ships stronger or we just have to be very conservative with our strut usage (i know scary right).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow then to some people this wont be a problem however to people who love HUGE over engineered ship (i\u0027m looking at you Whackjob) this will be a huge game changer no longer can we spam struts to get a extra dose of Dopamine (if you don\u0027t know what this is Google it) this might be a good thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T02:34:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have a decent point but DANG those run-on sentences made the whole thing hard to read and I wasn\u0027t going to say anything initially but really it was tripping me up so much I just had to point it out because a little is fine but at a certain point run-ons just make everything really confusing you know what I mean sorry if I sound like a grammar [see below] but it really is a problem when it gets this bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIN RELATED NEWS AFTER 7869345 EDITS, apparently the name of the German National Socialist Party is a swear word on this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, regarding the actual points made, in my experience the average ship since the 0.23.5 update has far fewer than 64 struts on it, not to mention that I get the feeling a lot of people still put a lot more struts on their ships than is really needed. Besides, I have a hunch that 0.24 and probably a few updates after that will include some rebalancing of prices for these sorts of things. Even if not, I think it\u0027s a good thing to challenge players to build sensible ships that don\u0027t need 64 or more struts to maintain their shape.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T02:40:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T02:37:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve moved this to Development Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease take more care in where you place threads.

Odds are decent that starting budgets are pretty generous (my guess is that initial funds were set to 150,000 at the time of that shot), to account for the fact that a lot of players are rather overkill in their rocket design.
