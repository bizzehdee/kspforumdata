The main counter argument was that if squad thinks its feature complete it must be by definition (as they are the Devs). I did not write anything much at the time, as the point seemed moot given that they committed themselves to additional development anyway.\u003C/font\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Calibri\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EHowever, with the latest updates being mainly languages and a thematic expansion it seems that If we are to challenge the idea that the game is feature complete now is the time to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. The point of this post is to highlight what feature compete means and illustrate that though most of those denying KSP\u2019s status as a feature-complete game are doing so for the wrong reasons, they are never the less correct. Therefore, to do this we must define the term:\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 8pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Calibri\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EA Feature is a way that the game works and a component of gameplay that is not content I.e. Not parts, planets, missions etc., but core gameplay functionality. For that reasons thought there is lots of content I would like to see added it is not relevant to this post.\u003C/font\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Calibri\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EThe more controversial part of the definition is what do we mean by \u2019complete\u2019? Obviously the devs have the main say in what complete means to them, but at the same time a game isn\u2019t completed based purely on their say-so. (To illustrate this, imagine a football game without any players implemented, It wouldn\u2019t matter how many times you describe it as complete, if it lacks the key functions to be described as a football game, it simply isn\u2019t true.) For this reason to be feature complete a game must be declared as such by the devs once it has achieved the following 2 things:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.

To simply overlook this issue, in your game, is comparable with overlooking fuel requirements. You\u2019re simply not addressing one of the main problems/issues facing a space programme if you don\u2019t address the need to life support.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 8pt 18pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont face=\u0022Calibri\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EThought it\u2019s an added consideration that some players may dislike (Just another thing to worry about) it could be toggle-able and gradable, just like comms requirements, money requirements or science/tech requirements. So leaving it out on the basis that not everyone would enjoy the added challenge is a poor excuse. In this category of missing features, we also previously had re-entry heat issues, and comms issues but these have now been successfully implemented in a considerate and sensible way that allows for scaling and selecting of the associated difficulty. So why not life support? Unless you address the need to maintain, food, water, air and health/sanity you are not a complete space programme simulator/game so cannot be called feature complete any more than you could without rocket engines.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;margin-top:0cm;margin-bottom:8pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 2.

There is no end goal or specific need to go to any other planets, and the nuclear engine is far enough up the tech tree that you\u2019re pretty much complete game-wise by the time you\u2019re effectively capable of going inter-planetary (at least as a new player). \u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin:0cm 0cm 8pt 18pt;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022 face=\u0022Calibri\u0022 size=\u00223\u0022\u003EAlthough, this issue has been mitigated with introduction of missions, they are too random and there is no need to ever prioritise the main story-line missions (the Milestone ones); they can just be ignored.

Having played for a long time, I know that Eve is the hardest planet for landing and returning a manned mission, yet it is right next to Kerbin. Whilst this makes sense in the context of their real world analogues, for a player unfamiliar with the difficulties associated with visiting Venus/Eve they are unlikely to go there last despite the fact that such would be advisable from a difficulty-scaling point of view. This is made all the worse by the fact that the current mission order specifically directs you to Eve straight after Duna. I am aware that at 1 point another gas-giant was planned with a collection of end-game moons to assist with this difficulty-scaling issue, and though any specifics of such a thing are clearly content, some sort of better method of signposting objectives based on increasing difficulty is clearly needed from a feature (game balancing) point of view.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-28T20:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107317-stephen10188/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022107317\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/107317-stephen10188/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Stephen10188\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0You haven\u0027t been here for... 4 years.\u00A0 Welcome back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-28T21:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Feature Complete\u0022 is not exactly \u0022Completely Featured\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m somewhat agree that the base game is \u0022Feature Complete\u0022 (what not means that all Features are completed).

So your recoverable Boosters don\u0027t disappear magically while your main craft is reaching orbit/ goes farther away from the booster. Though I am unsure how this feature would be designed in detail. I did expected\u00A0this from a space program\u00A0simulator and was severely disappointment when i discovered this was missing. I hope it will be implemented with a DLC focusing on modern space missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
