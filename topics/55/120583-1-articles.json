Also, engine performance is highest when exit pressure matches that of the atmosphere around the craft, since this isn\u0027t possible in space, they try to bring the pressure as low as possible to get the highest exit velocity and therefore highest Isp with the limiting factor generally being weight of the engine. this is just something that has been bugging me, and I realize it is at least partly so that landing legs only work with certain engines, but still, if we are trying to properly apply thrust/Isp curves with atmosphere, we should be getting proper models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote27","CreatedById":141964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-10T23:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if there was a vacuum lander engine with a retractable bell?
