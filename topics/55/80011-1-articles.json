But the rough cut is this--really cheap parts...they would look like the same parts, i.e. \u0022long fuel tank\u0022, but it looks really shoddy and dilapidated (i.e you can see rust, or paint peeling, or even actual 3D mesh parts peeling away from the structure) and the reliability and robustness would be less than its \u0027normal priced\u0027 versions. This would be hilarious--it would make some launches really scary, but the feeling of relief in reaching orbit or some other place with cheap items (RISK due to lack of funds!) would be interesting and memorable...plus the screenshots would look hilarious! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a type of development direction that puts the \u0022kerbal\u0022 back into Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, considering career is here, I was hoping that this kind of thing could be implemented. I really think it would add an interesting twist to how someone would run a space program. Will the person want to select dilapidated parts just to be on the cheap and thus save some roots, but at the same time, adding more risk to the missions? Or will he keep buying pristine parts, if only to ensure that the launches go near-perfect? Really interested in feedback from Squad about this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T21:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, Squad\u0027s said that nothing involving random failure will ever come to KSP -- failures should be solely due to decisions you made, not because the random number generator didn\u0027t like you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-29T21:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EReally interested in feedback from Squad about this.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will most likely not get any at all.
