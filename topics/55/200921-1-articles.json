Again... no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second reason is because of the sheer amount of changes required to effectively implement and play \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Practically *everything* about the game gets changed to make it happen. With all the implications for code complexity, performance, and reliability. As a self-inflicted mod set, people have to actively choose for themselves if they feel like bearing that potential impact to their game. Making it stock, no one gets a choice, even the large group who will not ever play that mode. So, no. (* Hats off nonetheless for what the mod authors have achieved with it so far)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird reason is the difference in overall ideology/direction between what the stock game wants to be, and what \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E wants to be. It\u0027s hard enough -evidenced by the current state of the game- to consistently implement ONE vision about how a game should be/look/behave.

No, thank you very much, no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E is exactly where it needs to be: as a mod.
