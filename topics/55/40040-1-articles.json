But I have found them severely lacking in several regards for which something really needs developing in order to bring them into their own place vs the rockets, which for me are still by far the main element of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you feel about these things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Ejection seats - so many times I\u0027ve wished there was a way to eject my pilot Kerbal before I crashed into the ground for the tenth time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Stall warning - its impossible to fly properly at the moment due to flipping out, we really need a stall warning and more sensitive flight controls so we dont stall as much, its very difficult to stall a real plane and impossible when travelling at any decent speed - in this game the stalling at speed is highly unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Aerodynamics - apart from the rubbish stall characteristics mentioned above, when you bank a real place the lift of the wings is translated into a turning vector so you dont actually need to pull up much in order to turn when banking. At the moment half of the stalling issue is due to having to pull too hard when in bank in order to turn at all. We really need to be able to bank and turn smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Nosewheel steering - tried to pick up a Kerbal the other day by landing near him but could I turn to collect him once I had landed? I had to disable a side engine eventually in order to turn my plane. We need to be able to taxi properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Drag/speed brakes - when landing its quite difficult to bleed off enough speed - better drag physics and especially speed brakes or reverse thrust in engines would help landing without excessive use of brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. VTOL jets/floats - if the jets could be rotated you could make some wicked VTOL jets for Kerbal rescues and if we had floats we could land on water for rescues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Passenger/storage cabins - I really want to be able to carry more Kerbals/storage in my jets for when resources appear in the game and I need to (hopefully) shuttle crew and materials around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything else people want for their planes/spaceplanes/gliders that I havent mentioned? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-30T09:56:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2013 09:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by nats\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T09:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Suggestions and Development Discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T10:16:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E8.

Nosewheel steering - tried to pick up a Kerbal the other day by landing near him but could I turn to collect him once I had landed? I had to disable a side engine eventually in order to turn my plane.

You can eject right now, but not so useful. KSP doesn\u0027t actually have stalling as the lift smoothy tapers by angle. The whole aero system needs an overhaul as for example the Cd is based on part mass and not geometry. Steerable and castering wheels would be quite nice in general as would landing gear bays that mount recessed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T05:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, Bac9 is working on creating content for KSP, so hopefully one of the things he\u0027s working on is finding suitable material with which to blackmail HarvesteR and C7 into importing B9 Aerospace as stock. Or is it extorting?

And also decouplers for the various fuselage types so not just the round ones normally used in rockets.
