Rovers... using these things is a pain in the asteroid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPREFACE: My attitudes on rovers may be caused by the fact that I\u0027ve only really used Rovers on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Under different gravity conditions, some of these problems are moot, but they\u0027re still a problem on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar surface which is one of the places rovers are going to be most commonly used, even after we get biomes elsewhere. I also understand that a number of the problems I\u0027m having are \u0022realistic\u0022, but simplifications have been made elsewhere in the game to make it more fun, so there\u0027s no reason similar changes can\u0027t be made to rover controls. That being said...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve developed a love-hate relationship with these craft playing KSP. They\u0027re useful, especially when you want to visit multiple locations on a body\u0027s surface, or can\u0027t land in the location you want to visit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT! Driving these things are PAINFUL!! they\u0027re slow, fragile, and can be as difficult to control as Jebediah during one of his post-recovery benders.

However, deactivating SAS in a rover makes things worse because the rover will bounce around so much it will knock itself into oblivion at any useful speed. As it stands, I have to babysit the rover during travel so I can occasionally turn off SAS, let the rover settle itself, and then reactivate it. This needs to be done almost everytime there\u0027s a change in orientation of the surface I\u0027m on: going over small hills, on the sides of a valley, etc. If there was some option to have SAS only lock the heading/yaw were set, it would make controlling the rover way easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ERelax surface impacts with Rovers\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERovers have to travel on rough surfaces and at speeds that exceed safe landing velocities (\u0026gt; 10m/s). It would probably be a lot of programming, but I would LOVE to see the durability of rovers increased by changing the impact rules for destroying parts on rovers due to surface collisions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWay points\u003C/em\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can set nodes in space that show us relative headings in 3 dimensions when we reach a point in time. Please allow this for rovers in 2 dimensions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThrottle maintenance\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet us set a speed, or throttle % the EXACT same way we do with landers. The rover throttle up/down is a headache, and resets to zero if you don\u0027t sit and hold the button. There should be separate throttle for gears/rover wheels and a separate throttle for rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAutopilot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know it says we can\u0027t suggest autopilot, but in space, we can set a speed and heading, then click time-warp so we don\u0027t ahve to wait 8 hours to hit the burn node. If we can do it there, we should be able to tell a rover to do the same thing: Set a speed and heading, go until you reach a point. This could involve a pathing algorithm, or, the game could test a straight line path between the current and target position and reject a path if there is too great a change in surface geometry on the straight line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see the devs addressing the throttle and SAS issues during development ASAP. In fact, I\u0027d LOVE to see a separate interface for rover control the same way they added a docking interface. When this mode is activated, the SAS control and throttle would be as described above, or in some other way that achieves the same ends. The other issues can wait, but they\u0027re still valid, and would make this part of the game WAY more fun to play and make rovers much more appealing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/234-0-23-Update-News\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHarvesteR said to expect more biomes in 0.23\u003C/a\u003E, so rovers are gonna get WAY more useful soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Emy opinion\u003C/em\u003E that these features absolutely have a place in the \u003Cem\u003Estock\u003C/em\u003E game.
