Their concerns are probably more structural than anything else. Also they are unlikely to have gone interplanetary, so if they strand someone due to a lack of Dv, it\u0027s still relatively easy to get them back, and a failed mission means a relatively small amount of real time has been wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the time you begin going interplanetary, you tend to be skilled enough that the things you learned when you were new become routine: this is the point where I think most people start installing mods like KER and MechJeb, because they simplify the building block skills and activites, letting you concentrate on the stuff that\u0027s more fun. For the record, I still run stock because I\u0027m lazy and not a technical person. Also at this stage, needing to know Dv is far more important, because a mission that gets stranded it\u0027s much harder to return them. A failed mission can also mean wasted real-time of several hours, especially if you launched your mission in several bits and docked them in orbit before sending them off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople more skilled than me can either already easily do the things a Dv indicator would help with, and/or have put mods in the game, so it would be useless to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf then a substantial chunk of players would not find it a useful feature, I definitely agree there should be some way of switching it off or hiding it.

Why do maneuver nodes show delta-v, probably because the only other option would be no numbers or just time for the burn. Again it could be interesting with only a rough 100% burn time on the readout. The game already has a lot of information in it, the ships delta-v is just about the only thing not handed to us on a plate. Delta-V, ship design and flying are the only things left to estimate.

This is not a logic fallacy but it creates the idea that male is normal and female is abnormal. The human mind is changed by what is defined as normal. Many people play with delta-V readouts and so do not see the problem with making it stock, the problem is it is impossible to see how a new player would find this situation. As stated earlier we all could play with f2 disabling our fuel reserve but we don\u0027t because it is normal and we make the game harder in other ways.
