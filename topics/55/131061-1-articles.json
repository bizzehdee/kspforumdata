problems clamoring for their attention, why should Squad take time to implement a feature that \u003Cem\u003Ethe game effectively already has?\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen Xavven suggested this, your counterargument as to why this isn\u0027t an option was,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...well, that\u0027s a problem with the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emods\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (or with your manual tinkering with them), not with the game.\u00A0 It\u0027s not Squad\u0027s problem if you\u0027re running buggy mods.\u00A0 Have the mod authors fix the problem.\u00A0 (Or fix it yourself-- most mods post their source code.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if the mods are so broken that they crash the game or whatever in career mode, what makes you think that they wouldn\u0027t do the same thing if Squad enabled contracts and such in sandbox?\u00A0 More to the point:\u00A0 there\u0027s no way for \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003ESquad\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to test that, either.\u00A0 Essentially, you\u0027re asking them to make a bunch of code changes that are likely to not even solve the problem that was the reason you wanted the change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason you gave for not liking Xavven\u0027s proposed workaround was\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy?\u00A0 It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eexactly the same thing\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Essentially you\u0027re saying \u0022I feel cheaty pushing a couple of buttons \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so I don\u0027t have to worry about funds or science.\u00A0 I\u0027d rather push a couple of buttons \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E so I don\u0027t have to worry about funds or science.\u0022\u00A0 Same thing.\u00A0 How is it any less of a \u0022cheat\u0022 to choose an easy, nerfed career mode that doesn\u0027t require you to have funds or science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...have you ever worked in commercial software?\u00A0 It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enever\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u0022just touch a few lines of code and you\u0027re done.\u0022\u00A0 You\u0027re asking for a new game mode.\u00A0 New UI to deal with it.\u00A0 Testing it in all sorts of configurations.\u00A0 Maybe testing it with a lot of the most popular mods, too, I don\u0027t know how much (if any) of that they do.\u00A0 There are so many ways that different pieces of UI can interact in a running program that covering all the interactions is a big job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short:\u00A0 it\u0027s almost certainly a much bigger ask than you think it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027m not saying that your suggestion is a bad idea-- it seems like having a sort of \u0022a la carte\u0022 menu for starting a new game would be handy in meeting different players\u0027 needs.\u00A0 (\u0022Do you want science?\u00A0 Rep \u0026amp; contracts?\u00A0 Funds?\u00A0 Building upgrades? Kerbal experience?\u0022\u00A0 etc.)\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Just that it\u0027s non-trivial, and I\u0027d guess it\u0027s going to be pretty low on Squad\u0027s list of priorities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do understand that my personal issue is that with mods and (probably) my screwing around with them. I just thought that others might be able to appreciate those options being on the surface, even if it\u0027s only a cosmetic difference to most. And to answer your question, no I have not \u003Cem\u003Eworked\u003C/em\u003E in commercial software, but it really depends on how you structured the code (at least when I have written programs, that may be different in the commercial setting, I don\u0027t really have a clear idea of how that would be different as far as modifying the code is concerned).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-31T02:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
