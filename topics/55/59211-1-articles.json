I had ship in low kerban orbit and I wanted to wait for the next launch window to Duna. At low altitudes like that, I couldn\u0027t go faster than x50. I took control of my Mun rover and I time warped until the launch window, then I went back to the ship in low kerbin orbit. Wouldn\u0027t it be easier if we could time warp faster in a situation like low kerbin orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, even at x100 000, it takes some time to get a launch window to Eeloo. There again, x1 000 000 time warp would be very useful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t found such a topic in teh \u0022already suggested list\u0022, so pardon me if it has already been discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlpheratz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"horndgmium","CreatedById":92543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:43:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64804-0-23-WarpUnlocker-v1-(faster-time-warp-no-altitude-restrictions)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64804-0-23-WarpUnlocker-v1-(faster-time-warp-no-altitude-restrictions)\u003C/a\u003E I hope this does what you need?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpheratz","CreatedById":99633,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T19:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh... thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
