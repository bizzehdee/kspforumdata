Random planetary starting positions (in reference to kerbin) are something I\u0027ve suggested myself and seen suggested by others on these forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is unclear if this option will ever be included in the stock game, I think I may have a work around for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll game start with time (\u0022UT\u0022, measured in seconds) set to zero, and positions are calculated based on UT. If you start a new game, immediately save (so no flights are underway), and then go into the persistence file and set the time to some random value, that should effectively randomize planetary positions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that using a uniform distribution with range of 0 to 156992048 (1 revolution for Eeloo around Kerbol, in seconds) should accomplish this nicely. It will give a nice large time counter, so you can RP that kerbals are starting their journey to the stars in some kind of \u0022Kerbal era\u0022, or KE. I think this will be even cooler after 0.23.5 drops so this time can be counted in Kerbin days and years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone tried this before? Are there major problems with this that I\u0027m missing? I think I\u0027m going to try this when I start a new career mode with asteroids... \u0022soon\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T20:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA mod could do this quite easily I think, if you apply a random number to the epoch of every planet, then this would accomplish the same effect as offsetting the universal time, without affecting the ingame clock display.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T21:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can just deploy command pod on launchpad and go to highest time warp for random amount of time (e.g. one coffee).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with 0.23.5 you can do that in tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would not recommend doing that manually in persistence file because if you happen to set too high values, you may start discovering precision-related bugs in time dimension which do not appear in games played normally.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T22:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was already wondering if multiplayer was going to have such a feature.
