Everyone has to learn somewhere and you can either watch a youtube video or you can learn from your autopilot. Either way, when I first started KSP, MechJeb was an invaluable tool for showing me how to plot a somewhat optimal course for various maneuvers, and now I can do them myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I like how MechJeb is implemented in career mode. It starts off without any autopilot features, so you still have to do stuff yourself. As you unlock more of the tech tree, MechJeb gets more advanced, allowing you to automate certain more routine tasks, i.e. change apoapsis / circularize, while still forcing you to do the more complicated stuff, like ascent, rendezvous and docking.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samhuk","CreatedById":221604,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T19:08:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, but the dev\u0027s are trying to avoid the exponential growth of this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, a small bit of hand holding is good to kick-start the player\u0027s knowledge, but the problem is, like what has happened with some other games, that idea gets out of hand as more people want more help and then bam, the game isn\u0027t even a game anymore, you just sit there and it does it\u0027s stuff like a movie.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see too many threads these days about people wanting ever more hand-holding, and one must avoid just getting carried away adding more and more of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESam\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T21:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hakkonen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hakkonen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt would be enormously helpful, for those of us who aren\u0027t as experienced at eyeballing orbits, to have a tool for plotting burns and such.
