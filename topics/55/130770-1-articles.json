I\u0027ve been reading a lot of posts complaining about parts being really bad, and also that could be replaced by others easily and do a better job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are a few examples i\u0027ve read in the forums:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Mk1-2 Pod\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems like this part was forgotten when the 1.0.5 version came out, at a heavy mass of 4.2 tons, it can carry 3 kerbals into space along with 150 electric charge and 30 units of monoporpelant, with\u00A0reaction wheels with a torque of 15.0, and a total\u00A0cost 3800 funds\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the new mk1 crew cabin things got pretty bad for this part, with a mass of 1 ton we can carry 2 kerbals to space, so basically if\u00A0height is not a structural problem for you, you can use it along with a mk1 crew cabin, an advanced inline stabilizer, a 1.25 service bay (for aerodynamyc pruposes) carrying a z-100 battery pack and a FL-R10 monopropellant tank and get a better version of it for just 3130 funds, also you can use structural parts to make it even smaller\u00A0if\u00A0height or the hatch are troubling you, this will off course make it less aerodynamic, but even with a fairing it wont be as heavy ad the mk1-2 command pod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Mk-55 Thud engine\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis radial engine surely needs more love, with a mass of 0.9 tons, a thrust if 120 Kn in and a Isp 305 (both in vacuum) and a vectoring range of 8.0, the uses of this radial engine are kinda limited since is outclassed by the LV-909 Terrier\u00A0and the RE-L10 poddle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn therms of Isp Both of them are better than the thud (LV-909\u00A0Terrier with 345 and RE-L10 poddle with 350)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn therm of thrust a single poddle haves a max of\u00A0250 Kn, meanwhile 2 thuds have 240 Kn so\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn therms of weight 2 thuds (1.8t)\u00A0weight more than a poddle (1.45t), and 1 thud(0.9t)\u00A0 weights more than a terrier (0.5t),\u00A0even if it is paired with a Type B nose(0.575t) cone or a structural fuselage (0.6t) for radial use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo overall, most times (if not all) we are going to have more delta V using a terrier or a poddle, with half the vectoring range of the Thud (The only thing the poddle is better than those two).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso If you\u0027re wondering most engines used in the atmosphere also outclass it in TWR and Isp (Reliant on ASL and Swivel on vacuum)\u00A0, so pretty much the most use you could have for it down there would be small shuttles (such as the Learstar A1 and the Slim shuttle) so there is little use for this radial engine right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell that\u0027s all i\u0027ve got for now, i wan\u0027t to know\u00A0your balancing issues with parts on the current version on the game, so we can get the best of them in new versions if they\u0027re balanced\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-26T18:29:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is what i suggested not long ago\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129962-parts-which-should-get-their-part-file-modified/\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/129962-parts-which-should-get-their-part-file-modified/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
