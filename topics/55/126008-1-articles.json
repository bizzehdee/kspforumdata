For example with shift and arrow keys angular velocity could be 1/20 of normal value. That would help to determine launch times for inclined orbits etc. It would not take many minutes to program or use any significant computer resources or cause any nasty side effects.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be even better if there were shown angular coordinates of camera with respect to the focus point, but I understand that it may be against Squads philosophy of numberless space flight. But fine adjusting with shift key would not be.\n"}]}
