During radio blackout, the image for the crew would turn to static. Also, we wouldn\u0027t know it they were dead or alive until blackout ends. So if they\u0027re dead, their image would disappear, like when they normally die and we would know that they didn\u0027t survive re-entry. But if they were to be alive, then the static would disappear and their image would reappear as if nothing happened. Also, not all of them will die, either, some might survive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-11T20:47:13Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2013 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by plainawesome\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI didn\u0026#039;t notice a typo :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T20:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m flying the craft, why should my pilots\u0027 status be blacked out?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T21:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think the kind of black-out you describe should be implanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, it would be cool to have a black-out system!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"plainawesome","CreatedById":76282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T13:42:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMainly because we wouldn\u0027t be able to know if they\u0027re dead or alive, like in real radio blackout\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rosmarus","CreatedById":57748,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T13:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWouldn\u0027t you be able to tell if they are dead the second you touch the controls?
