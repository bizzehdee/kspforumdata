I love it and I don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t think it can be much improved upon (maybe except for the missions wich could be a bit more about bringing ever-bigger loads into space and less about fine-tuning orbits but that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s beside the point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever there is one kind of game that has (much like KSP) never existed before and its a Aerospace Manufacturer Program! It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s much like KSP but except for flying into space you build, test, manufacture and sell Airplanes! The best part: Just reuse the Engine with slight modifications! I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m a Game Designer (Games Academy Frankfurt 2012) so if you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re interested i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4d be happy to drop by and give you more details and/or even work out a GDD...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest regards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELucas\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T23:33:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can do this in KSP pretty easily.
