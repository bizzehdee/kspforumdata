If I attach rotors to yaw/pitch/roll and thrust I am able control thrust but yaw/pitch/roll override each other so only one is effective. Thrust works because it\u0027s incremental while yaw/pitch/roll are absolute. At first I wanted do demand multiple overlapping controls to work additively (and they should) but then I realized that won\u0027t be enough. The collective throttle must lift the craft while axes control should only modify torque to control its movement and may work much weaker. So the torque for single engine could be calculated by a formula T=(1 - 3k)t \u002B ky \u002B kp \u002Bkr, where T is torque, t is throttle, and y, p, r are yaw pitch and roll, respectively. k is axes to throttle coefficient, let it be 0.1, for example. Now, this cannot be done.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I think the formula controller should be available for our creations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this will be usable not only in quadcopters. Why not control ailerons in function od speed? In supersonic flight they are too strong while in low speed maneuvering they could work stronger. We could\u00A0\u00A0also describe by formulas hinges\u0027 movements as a function of time or the controller\u0027s value (then a controller\u0027s path could be a variable, not necessarily bound\u00A0to a part).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
