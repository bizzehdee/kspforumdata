All it consists of is clicking buttons. I feel it is worth it, but extremely boring and unrealistic, to continue to gather data until you start getting below five points or so, which is a lot of button pressing. My suggestion would best be shown in the following example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say I\u0027ve just arrived in orbit around Eve with a probe, which is pretty easy around the middle of the tech tree, and I\u0027ve got a Science Jr. on board. Rather than activate the module twenty times each time I\u0027m \u0022near Eve\u0022 or \u0022high above Eve,\u0022 I\u0027d like to turn the thing on, have it continuously collect data, then transmit the data at my leisure. During continuous collection, the value of the data decreases as an inverse proportion to time. So, the first interval of ten seconds of research would be worth, say, 30 points, next interval, only 20, next interval only 10 (these are just illustrative values), and so on until the data you could collect at such a position isn\u0027t going to yield valuable information. This data is then stored in an on-board computer in the command module which has some capacity threshold to force you to transmit sooner or later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne nice gameplay effect of this would be that gathering data, a low energy task, could be done on the dark side of a planet and transmission could be done while in direct sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESummary:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Add data storage values to command modules\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Make research continuous\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-Research in a particular spot should be inversely proportional to time rather than button clicks\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-As stored data is transmitted, it frees up space in the on-board computer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemoricus","CreatedById":4141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA better way to improve the grind of science is to make doing science something interesting in its own right, rather than just needing to push a button to get the report for the location.
