I think the larger the range of possible values, the more likely it is to skip some of them, possibly due to rounding errors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that the smallest physical screen amount you can move any slider is going to be 1 pixel.\u00A0 It\u0027s not physically possible to move a mouse any less than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if the number range that the slider covers is bigger than the physical number of pixels that the slider occupies... it\u0027s unavoidable that values are going to be skipped.\u00A0 There\u0027s just no way for a slider that\u0027s, say, 200 pixels wide, to allow using a mouse to adjust to a range of, say, -177 to \u002B177.\u00A0 More numbers than pixels equals heartache.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this could be made \u0022better\u0022 by enlarging the UI scale (to provide more pixels and thus a greater range of possible values), but that seems like, 1. a band-aid with limited applicability (no matter how big you make the UI scale, there could be a slider bigger than that sometime), and 2. if you\u0027ve got the UI scale set where you want it for general playability, it would be kinda irritating to feel forced to enlarge it just for that one thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the pixels place an inherent \u0022granularity limit\u0022 on adjusting a thumb on a slider, that means the only way to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E solve it would be to provide some non-slider-drag way of adjusting the numbers.\u00A0 A text input box, like \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61954-majorjim/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002261954\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61954-majorjim/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Majorjim!\u003C/a\u003E suggests, could do that... though it might be a bit of a UI challenge to squeeze that into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E without eating up screen real estate and/or generating clutter.\u00A0 Another idea that occurs to me, which would be less UI-intrusive (but also less flexible than a text entry box) would be to put a little \u0022\u002B\u0022 button at one end of the slider, and a little \u0022-\u0022 button at the other, so that you can click the buttons to adjust the value up or down by one increment at a time. How big an \u0022increment\u0022 is could be a configured property of the slider (e.g. maybe it\u0027s 1 unit, maybe it\u0027s 0.5 or 0.1, etc.-- something appropriate based on the min/max scale of the range).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"severedsolo","CreatedById":80345,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T20:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know Snark won\u0027t like this because it\u0027s a bit UI heavy (which is fair enough), but I\u0027m adding something similar as an update to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/163711-151-paws-part-action-window-sorter-outer-1102-22122018/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPAWS\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDidn\u0027t mean to make this a \u0022there\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 post, and I 100% support this being stock, but for now at least...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSrTKr5f__o?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-17T20:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2019 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by severedsolo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-18T01:03:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, simpler, use a hotkey to slide in multiples of 5 (say \u0022shift\u002Bmouse click).
