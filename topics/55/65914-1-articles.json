When it loaded, the \u0022give\u0022 in the decouplers/docking ports would cause a shock load on the fully fueled ship, and it fell apart like candy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I realized.. I could remove all fuel from the upper stage, attach ground tanks that get decoupled before launch, and fuel AFTER the ship loads... this dramatically reduces shock load, see image below. It does not break apart at all with this set up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I propose, is that ships \u0022receive\u0022 fuel gradually, over 3 seconds, after they are loaded. This should reduce the springy shock load action immediately after load (root cause is that the ships load with \u0022nominal\u0022 spring height, and after physics activate, they seek a new equilibrium, which puts a large shock load on the ship).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238708512\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=238708512\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/487819021542240493/B293F41A9CBB0CA65609EB85840E6CEDB6AFD45B/1024x576.resizedimage\u0022 alt=\u00221024x576.resizedimage\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-15T21:53:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2014 09:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sjwt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T21:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou seem to have build a real beast of a ship, belive it or not, KSP does have issues with overly non-realitic ships like that.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could upload your craft file somewhere and advise what mods if any you have used and someone might be able to restrut/alter your ship so that it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dazhat","CreatedById":59413,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T21:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sjwt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sjwt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou seem to have build a real beast of a ship, belive it or not, KSP does have issues with overly non-realitic ships like that.. \u003Cp\u003EYou could upload your craft file somewhere and advise what mods if any you have used and someone might be able to restrut/alter your ship so that it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issue exists with realistic large ships too.

Kashua\u0027s is more of a generic fix though so it\u0027s preferable. What if you have lots of monoprop?

If you start the struts on your tower, when you launch you won\u0027t have any extra parts on the ship and will leave them behind on the pad. I think, depending on your setup, that you can even just run struts from the red supports to your ship.
