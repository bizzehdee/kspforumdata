Perhaps a pre-cooler part could be added to extend the thrust curve of jet engines to higher speeds.\n\nAnyway, however it\u0027s done, the jet engine rebalance should allow a well-built SSTO to have a larger payload fraction than a well-built multi-stage rocket (asparagus staging presumably won\u0027t be as powerful with aerodynamics fixes).

Jets, especially ones with the power necessary for the kinds of things we meed for KSP, are gigantic mofos. In particular they\u0027re *long.* The biggest problem I have making planes, particularly early in career, is trying to balance the plane. Engines *are* (somewhat) accurately portrayed as the most massive individual components on a plane, but all that mass is concentrated in what should be seen as the nozzle. In reality, the turbine is ahead of that, preceded by the combustion chamber, preceded by the compressor, preceded by the ducted fan (if they have it). And THAT\u0027S where the weight of an engine lies. The component CoM should be roughly midway up the fuel tank we normally have attached in front of it in KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T18:07:07Z","Content":"nerf the jets but keep the rapier how it is."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T19:33:47Z","Content":"The problem with jet engines is less due to the engines themselves and more due to how intake air is implemented. In the most basic sense, the gross thrust of a rocket engine or a jet engine is the mass flow leaving the engine \\* the velocity that mass leaves at (let\u0027s call them m\\_ex and V\\_jet). In a rocket motor, all of the m\\_ex comes from the fuel and oxidiser carried on board, so V\\_jet is the ISP. In a jet engine, a small amount of fuel is burned in a very large amount of air, and the resulting mass flow all leaves at V\\_jet. In terms of ISP, of a jet engine, V\\_jet = ISP \\* m\\_fuel/m\\_air. Because m\\_air is very much larger than m\\_fuel, V\\_jet is very much smaller than ISP. The important issue, though, is where the m\\_air comes from. In essence, an air intake is a reverse-rocket. Air enters the intake at a high velocity, and is slowed down to the speed of the aircraft. If the gross thrust of a jet engine is m\\_ex \\* V\\_jet, then the intake drag (ram air drag) is m\\_in \\* V\\_air (V\\_air is the aircraft speed). For a high bypass ratio airliner engine, a typical V\\_jet might be in the region of 300 m/s, and for a military engine for a fast jet might be 1500 m/s. For a rocket, V\\_jet might be something like 4000 m/s. What this means is, if you have a jet engine with a V\\_jet of 1500 m/s (a reasonable value for the turbojet), the combination of jet \u002B intake will generate full thrust while stationary, 2/3 of thrust at 500 m/s, 1/3 thrust at 1000 m/s and no thrust at all at 1500 m/s. Because the rocket engine doesn\u0027t use atmospheric air, it suffers no ram drag. While I\u0027m not entirely sure how the game models air intakes, the fact that jet powered aircraft can be flown up to well over 1500 m/s on jet engines alone, I strongly suspect that the impact of ram drag is not at all properly represented."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T22:27:47Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know what this hullabaloo about \u0022we won\u0027t be able to make worthwhile spaceplanes\u0022 nonsense is all about.

So the TJ still has 50% power at 2km/s, and eventually peters out at just past orbital speed. Lack of IntakeAir will also scale back an engine\u0027s power, but you can just spam intakes, and each of \u0027em will provide a given amount of intake air at a given speed and pressure (The TJ will require about 15x it\u0027s fuel intake in air intake, which is usually around 2 units/s or thereabouts, based on the right-click flow rates shown on the intakes).\n\nBased on what you said, a more proper value for the second key (assuming V\\_jet is 2400 here) would be about 0.58333..., and the third value 0.16666...\n\nHere\u0027s the BasicJet if anybody is interested:\n\n    \tvelocityCurve\t{\t\tkey = 1000 0 0 0\t\tkey = 850 0.2 0 0\t\tkey = 0 1 0 0\t}"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T10:44:46Z","Content":"KSP\u0027s jet engines already are about 10 times more powerful compared to real life rocket engines vs jet engines (assuming the Mainsail is equivalent to the F1). \n\nMaking jet engines yet more powerful would be more unbalanced.
