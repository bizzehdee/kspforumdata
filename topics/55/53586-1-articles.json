Therefore, with the new update and all its lovely features, I created it and saved it as a subassembly. However, this is almost equally as tedious as building the darn thing over and over. When I stick the launch core onto my rocket, it puts the core\u0027s engines into stages 0,1, and 2... Directly overlapping whatever I have already built. I then have to add more stages and redo the entire order of the engines, which was half the work of building the darn thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a fix for this? If not, I think it should be included in an update in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Places two cents on table*\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
