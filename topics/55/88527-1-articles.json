Some people have had success, others not so much. To be honest with you, unless you know exactly what you\u0027re doing with mods, the source code behind mods, graphics drivers, how to switch between OpenGl, DX9, and DX11, and just plain ole\u0027 stubbornness, you probably don\u0027t need to be messing with 64 bit builds on KSP on Windows. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that being said, I personally run Win64 KSP, and it is quite stable; I run KSP x64 with DirectX 11 enabled (DirectX11 is far more stable than the default DirectX9). However, I went way out of my way to ensure that stability, even to the point of opening up Visual Studio, modifying source code to several different mods, and re-compiling said plugins specifically for x64, and then figuring out what broke. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can say, from experience, that I believe that a majority of the bugs with Win64 KSP is Unity\u0027s handling of DirectX 9. I say this, because KSPx64 with DirectX 9 crashes even you simply fart in the same room with it; Windows Vista runs better that KSPx64 with DirectX 9. KSPx64 with OpenGL is quite stable, although the performance with EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements is not great. KSPx64 with DirectX 11, however, is almost flawless with only minor, non-game breaking bugs. At least on my machine, which can greatly influence results.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T03:09:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Raven.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T03:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo describe the stability of win 64x first you must picture a ball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen balance a plank on that ball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave an elephant balance on the plank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild a house on the elephants back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave an earthquake going on for good measure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee what happens to the house and you\u0027ve got a prety good idea of KSP win 64x \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your runing windows your better off runing active texture management to keep the memory low.

As mentioned in many of those threads, Unity\u0027s 64-bit support was (and presumably still is, judging by the nature of the current topic) quite unstable, and thus Squad in all likelihood was reluctant to commit to what was (and possibly would remain for some time) an unstable and untested platform. Then some particularly bright spark \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82118-KSP-64bits-on-Windows-%28this-time-it-s-not-a-request%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emanaged to find a way to get it working on his own copy\u003C/a\u003E and encouraged others to do the same and share their findings. Again, while I can\u0027t speak on behalf of Squad\u0027s motives myself and this conclusion is as much speculation as anyone else\u0027s, I have this sneaking suspicion that, seeing the community\u0027s enthusiasm and knowing that you can\u0027t unring a bell once it\u0027s been rung, the developers decided that they might as well release what they had already worked on so that players wouldn\u0027t be restricted to having to jury-rig it up themselves. Thus, many users ended up, in this one instance, getting exactly what they had asked for... though whether this was what they \u003Cem\u003Ewanted\u003C/em\u003E is, of course, an interesting matter to ponder \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: And I\u0027ve just been reminded by one of my peers that Squad did have a few words to say on the matter themselves as part of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/294-Kerbal-Space-Program-First-Contract-The-FAQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe FAQ to the 0.24 \u0022First Contract\u0022 Update\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-26T06:10:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2014 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferram4","CreatedById":21328,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T12:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are times when you don\u0027t give people what they ask for because it will cause large problems, and win64 KSP builds were one of those situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also note that Squad learned this lesson already.

Really?\u003Cp\u003EAll the problems appear to be pointer errors with addressing memory above the 32-bit limit, which implies a 64-bit pointer being coerced to 32-bit somewhere. Supposedly hardware affects this, but I\u0027m not sure how hardware could cover up the errors that would result from truncating a 64-bit pointer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, there some dinosaurs out there still running 32 bit OSes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe truncating pointer issue makes perfect sense.

Mods take up alot of ram and 32bit has a rather constraining upper limit on ram usage. Go over that limit and you\u0027ll crash 100% of the time. 64 bit raises that limit alowing more mods. If your runing only KAC you\u0027ll never even come close to the limit so the major draw of 64 bit is not there. There are a few potential benefits of runing 64 bit if everything goes perfect such as FCIsuperguy\u0027s FPS boost. However for the majority the instability is not worth marginal improvements and they wouldnt even risk it if they were not runing into the memory cap due to heavy modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:08:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always seem to post this, but, I highly recommend a Linux install for anyone wanting to run 64bit.
