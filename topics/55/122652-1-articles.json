I have mostly completed the game in a Career mode, until I encountered a game killer bug. All of my contacts disappeared from a mission control likely due to upgrade of mission control. My latest working save game is so far back that I am not going to replay the lost time. There are also a lot of problems with object/focus selection when multiple objects are in a group or picking a target vessel when two vessels are close to each-other. Here\u0027s a screen shot from picking a maneuver node which also activates peri/apoapis data. It\u0027s a shame that otherwise a great game has so many Monday problems with relatively simple things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://users.kymp.net/p501474a/KSP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBugs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The game is not saved when pressing enter in a save game dialog. Enter is equal to \u0022Cancel\u0022 not to \u0022Save\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Target/Anti-target \u0022Auto-pilot\u0022 is usually not available in SAS if the relative velocity is close to zero. This behavior is understandable with Pro/Retro-grade modes but not with Target/Anti-Target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unable to add maneuvers in some situations. I had three vessels launched to Eve at the same time near equal trajectories, only one of them was able to set a maneuver-node for a final approach correction about 30-40 days before entry to Eve\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Line of nodes isn\u0027t displayed if vessel\u0027s orbit is hyperbolic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Clicking time-warp control also clicks/selects objects behind the GUI element.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SAS will often stop working when running out of electricity, even if the power comes back on-line the SAS is jammed in Stability Assist mode, (Pro-grade, etc..) modes are not working. Game restart is required to regain SAS functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SAS will often over-shoot the target direction by 90 degrees and the initial direction is not anywhere near correct. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A Lab-Module can get about 1k-2k points of science from one surface sample. (1:1 ratio between data and science might be better)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Time acceleration limitations are insane on Gilly and Bop. Do allow higher accelerations on lower altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Time acceleration isn\u0027t automatically reduced properly. For an example when returning to Kerbin from the Mun and the periapis is inside the atmosphere. The vessel just explodes if the time acceleration is too high and it\u0027s not manually reduced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vessels landed on Pol are bugged, often appear floating when entering visual range and then just explode. Sometimes vessels in flight explode like hitting a surface even if the visual surface is still far below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Space tourists who want to land on Eve are severally under paying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In XP scores: Plant flag on Eve = 13, Plant flag on Gilly = 15, Plant flag on Laythe = 20, Eve is way too low valued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There seems to be quite lot a trajectory instabilities for an example if a vessel is orbiting the Sun and it\u0027s making a fly-by of the Jool and the periapis is located somewhere near the Tylo. Then, I decide to change the periapis closer to the Jool, so, I\u0027ll add a maneuver and start increasing a dV, I\u0027ll watch the periapis to move closer and then -Zap-, the trajectory disappears and it indicates that the trajectory doesn\u0027t go anywhere near the Jool anymore. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Radiators appears to be totally useless. Haven\u0027t found any use for them. Only thing that seems to be heating is the vessel during re-entry and aero-braking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeature Requests:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to transfer kerbals by clicking the portrait in a lower-right corner. Also, it could highlight the module where the kerbal is located when hovering mouse over the portrait. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Add an arrows to ADI ball to point in Pro-grade and Target directions like the Maneuver direction has.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Might be good idea to handle a data as a resource like a fuel so that it could be transferred between Lab-Modules. Allowing to have a multiple lab modules in a vessel and transfer the data from a vessel to an other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to display the line of nodes for a local equator. Could be displayed by default when no-target is selected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to select Target in addition to Focus in Tracking Station and display relative inclination and line of nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ability to rename and change object class in tracking station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T09:46:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a lot of great feedback here, but would like to address the game killer first. Typically when Mission Control clears out like that, it\u0027s because there\u0027s an error popping up in the log. If you can recreate the bug, then go into the KSP_Data directory where your game is installed, you will typically find output_log.txt. If you upload this somewhere for me to read, I should be able to diagnose what is happening here. A list of any addons that you might be using would also assist in diagnosing the issue.

I was trying to maneuver a station docked to an asteroid to a lower orbit of Dres. I got the station to an orbit I wanted but when I hit time acceleration the station exploded. I reloaded a quick save, undocked the station from the asteroid and it exploded again. Exiting to a desktop and restarting the game fixed the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also some problems with \u0022BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point\u0022 if it\u0027s used as a root object or a sub-assembly is decoupled from it, then it can cause problems like vessels exploding when undocking.

I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s designed to work, a mobile lab is a very good idea, but it just doesn\u0027t work that way. When I start the game it takes a lot of efforts to get enough science to unlock the techs those will enable a possibility to run a new type of a missions. When I get the \u0022Mobile Processing Lab\u0022 and I sent my 1st Duna expedition (1 vessel to Duna and an other to Ike) both vessels having the Lab. I\u0027ll just need to make one landing mission on a surface, get data to the Labs and wait a launch window back to Kerbin. When I am back on Kerbin the whole tech-tree is unlocked with a science the labs produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be good idea to implement some kind of \u0022Happiness\u0022 factor for Kerbals. Gym and some other kind of recreational module to keep the Kerbals in a good shape and spirit. Sad Kerbals would make less science and slower. Also seeing new moons and planets would increase happiness. A kerbal alone would lose happines faster. It\u0027s kinda crazy that kerbal spending 3 years alone in a one man pod is still smiling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-14T15:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jarmonik\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jarmonik\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Space tourists who want to land on Eve are severally under paying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- In XP scores: Plant flag on Eve = 13, Plant flag on Gilly = 15, Plant flag on Laythe = 20, Eve is way too low valued.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding on Eve is actually super easy, so I can see why the numbers might have been set up this way.
