Here\u0027s my opinion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Send a colonisation module (large, heavy part containing 4 Kerbals (fixed amount, no less) and some basic colony tools that will be stated later) to the body of your choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Land this module and select \u0022colonise\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Send colonisation parts (under a new section of the VAB/SPH labelled \u0027colonisation\u0027) in storage bays (varying sizes - from tiny to large - and heights - again, from tiny to large, with radial options). In these bays, parts can be stored and transferred to a colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The part that have been transferred to a colony can be used to make buildings. Oh, those basic parts? They will be used to make a farm in an enclosed, controlled environment (glass-shielded bubble?). Things like water, waste disposal etc. are built into the colonisation module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rather than having set buildings, the player can chose from the selection of parts they brought what building to make. This is chosen by different modules that define a building - only one per building - that are large. Where\u0027s the customisation? A building needs more than just a module to work, and while I haven\u0027t figured out what other parts would be needed I\u0027m sure the devs would be able to. I would suggest that some parts can improve speed or yield but only to a point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some buildings can create small craft such as rovers and planes, but nothing large.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Module can be used to carry out science experiments. This can be balanced however the devs wish, maybe with the ability to only do one every now and then, some that are ongoing (such as psychological studies) etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou like?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T16:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EColonization could be a solution to the problems that caused resources to be pushed back.

Such a position severely limits KSP to being, well, basically what it is right now. Sure, the economy and science mechanics can be expanded upon, but ultimately progression is capped by the thorough exploration of the Kerbol system, which isn\u0027t actually that hard to do. There\u0027s always the option of more planets, but just how crowded do we plan on making this system ultimately? Just proper colonization could add a considerable amount to what we already have and the future Jovian planets planned, especially if the \u0022no aliens\u0022 rule isn\u0027t take to mean \u0022all of space is entirely dead\u0022 and is instead taken to mean \u0022You won\u0027t run into any advanced civilizations that turn KSP into a combat game\u0022. The search for \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E form of life is and has been a major motivator in our own space programs and there\u0027s little reason to believe it shouldn\u0027t be similarly paramount for the Kerbals. A lot could be added to both spaceflight and surface operations if you went to another celestial body with the intent of \u003Cem\u003Elooking for something,\u003C/em\u003E regardless of it\u0027s being bacteria, a certain kind of mineral, or whatever; as opposed to planting a flag and leaving, or sitting there for all eternity as warm memories of Kerbin fade into distant images and are ultimately forgotten. It seems to me that the primary point in colonization would be, thus, to look for things. I do support mining and the synthesis of fuel, as industrializing space is a very real concept as well, but I am of the opinion that the primary purpose of colonies should be to bring us something we \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E already have, even if it\u0027s just a new type of fuel or something.

To date, KSP has been about building rockets, and I see little reason why it shouldn\u0027t also be about building colonies, but player involvement is key to that. I would favor a method that involved delivering specific components as payloads that may then be assembled on the surface in EVA, each having varying purposes such as habitation, life support, food provision, research, etc. Naturally these elements would be relatively heavy and bulky, making them difficult to launch, transfer, and land safely, and thus providing the game with a naturally occurring phenomenon akin to a difficulty curve without any hard-coded RPG elements like leveling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T00:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rusty6899","CreatedById":85172,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T02:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Balto-the-Wolf-Dog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPerhaps I\u0027m missing something, but I can\u0027t bring myself to understand the position of those who are both anti-extrasolar and anti-colonization.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I don\u0027t think that anyone would describe themselves as \u0022anti-colonisation\u0022. The biggest argument on the subject is how colonisation affects the mechanics of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe OP is suggesting that the game should incorporate a dedicated system for colonising planets, whereas I, and a few others who have replied, feel that the game could be altered to allow players to benefit from a colonisation project, but it doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be specifically catered to. I like the ideas you have put forward about needing to deliver specific components to a space base, as it does provide an alternative to levelling, which I don\u0027t think is in the spirit of the game. I do think, however, that even with those features, it is still a case of colonising, for its own sake, which is all good and well, but I think that there should be reward system for people who want to play the game that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the resources of money, science and reputation should be designated as three ways to \u0022succeed\u0022 at the game. Succeed with science by performing experiments, reputation by exploring and money by colonising (and mining). This would mainly be implemented with the ordering of the technology tree so that players could choose their appropriate path (At the moment I would say the tech tree is generally split into rocketry, spaceplanes, science). I also think that the implementation of these methods of gameplay may be able to reduce the need for difficulty levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENewer players would benefit from being able to perform more numerous science experiments on Kerbin, Mun and Minmus, to achieve a reasonable amount of progression before they are ready to go interplanetary, intermediates would have the ability to explore the Kerbol system relatively early on to gain a good level of fame, experienced players would be looking to make return trips with valuable resources, which would make them money. All it requires then, it to have a slight incentive in terms of progress speed to choose the harder options and you have an effective yet diverse game mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crazyewok","CreatedById":97592,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T12:30:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the Devs should just impliment a very basic system but which could be devoped into more detail by mods?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T12:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP is a game of fluidity, of giving the power to the player with no right way to do anything.
