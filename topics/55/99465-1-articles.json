First, attaching them wrong way out. Second, and harder to spot, is attaching them via the top node instead of the bottom, so that they\u0027re partly inside the part they\u0027re attached to. I use them in odd places, like on the bottoms of fuel tanks, and I can\u0027t count the number of times (okay, it\u0027s like five, but it feels like a lot) that I\u0027ve had to revert to launch, or de-orbit a station after spending a few minutes trying to dock and realizing that I will not stay in space today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked around for a thread for suggestions for the engineer\u0027s report but I didn\u0027t find one.

I know the Clampotron Senior has tripped up other people as well from the forums, so I am hoping they\u0027ll include a check for that in the Engineer\u0027s Report. I was wondering if other users had found any of those errors that are hard to spot until you\u0027ve spent four game years getting to Eeloo, that might be feasible to implement in the report.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T15:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello!

As far as I know about the Engineer doing reports and things, from what I can remember, it would be sort of like Kerbal Engineer, where they\u0027d give readouts for delta-V and things like that, not checking proper orientation of parts. I mean, honestly, I personally haven\u0027t had a problem with placing docking ports together weirdly or anything like that, but I can see where you\u0027re coming from. Perhaps some tutorials should go over such placement more thoroughly. I think I\u0027ll do some videos when 1.0 comes out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
