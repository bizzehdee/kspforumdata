Like remotetech. Every comms unit on any ship can be used to boost the signal of any transmission getting it to almost 100% science. It would encourage people to place sats around planets. Also, i think that you should be able to transfer data to another ship with a Data Storage Unit when you dock or transmit it and then they can take it back to land on Kerbin. The amount of data loss should be based on distance from transmission target. Say i have a probe at Jool. but it cant get back. So i transfer the data to a manned ship around Duna and i would only get like 65% of the data. then the Duna ship would take it back to Kerbin. If i have a Sat around Eve and Duna and Jool are on opposite ends of the solar system, it would boost the signal making me lose a little less science. It would give the game more depth.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T02:03:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see the possibility of using dedicated satellites as relay stations for this purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
