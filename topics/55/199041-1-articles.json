For example, imagine a pitot tube that could be configured so that as the IAS of your craft increases, an airbrake deploys more to keep your speed constant; or an accelerometer that locks your controls if the g-force\u00A0become too high. These are the only things I can think of right now but I\u0027m sure some other people may have other ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"se5a","CreatedById":156245,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-09T02:35:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup I was thinking the same thing, the existing pressure sensor could be used as an altimeter, throw in compass and attitude readers (from the ch-j3) and we could potentialy have our own autopilots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
