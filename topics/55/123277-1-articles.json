Symbols, Blocks, Assemblies various names same idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically a group of objects that stay together as one object. Edit the internal objects of the symbol and all of the instances of the symbol change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time I build something even simple things I wish sub-assemblies had the option to work like symbols.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is all the objects in the subassembly would stay together like a single object while building a craft in the VAB/SPH. I could go an edit the assembly without the distraction of the rest of the craft. Any improvements to the assembly while building one craft will carry across to other saved craft a might relaunch in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me this would be a big improvement for building wings for spaceplanes, rovers, boosters,..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-18T06:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like it. maybe have a \u0027unify\u0027 VAB/SPH widget like ofset\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
