I\u0027ve been observing the forums ever since and posting once in a while but I\u0027m not really the guy who is active in the comunity. I have almost 1000 hours of KSP on my steam account and I can say (sorry everyone) that I played alot more hours before I bought the game last summer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is by far the best game I have ever played even as it is or as it was on .18 when I first played it. Every update is just another small step into the awesome gaming experience that is in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a KSP semi-veteran I feel like I can already say what really are the most interesting things to do in KSP and how to get closer to that utopian status of infinite gaming fun. This of course is all a personal view based on my experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStarting with funds\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP could really add a tycoon series feeling to the game by giving us alot more stuff to buy and to achieve. For example, I\u0027m thinking of making some buildings buyable in the KSC while others would be upgradeable. The VAB could start out really small then need improvements for larger rockets. Same with the launchpad while the SPH and the runway would have to be built from scratch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso maybe have the ability to choose where the KSC first starts and the ability to buy a new one for example in one of the poles or in another continent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a lot of ways I feel identified with what Hyomoto wrote in this article \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1601-Funds-science-unlocks-progression-etc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/entries/1601-Funds-science-unlocks-progression-etc\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would surely love to see the parts you need as being ordered then entering your stock after some days. When you would recover them from a flight they would get back to your stock (which could be in a warehouse also buyable and upgradeable).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would finally turn KSP into a space program simulator instead of the space flight simulator with a sandbox approach that it is right now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn with contracts\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel kind of bad for myself right now. I\u0027ve been waiting for quite a while for this update and after some days of playing it I don\u0027t feel contracts are really that much fun. And I\u0027m scared it might be just me and my playing style, but here is my opinion on this. Procedurally created contracts look all the same for me. The fact that I\u0027m constantly being bombarded with dozens of silly contracts day after day makes me feel like I\u0027m in a hamster wheel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m not saying that they should disappear. Instead they should be substantially reduced. They should be like side quests for your main goal. An interesting way of geting a little bit more funds or science or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout this whatever. Contracts should reward other goodies from time to time, like an X number of parts to your stock or even to unlock a part forever. Even maybe a whole science branch. Or a new trained Kerbal to your crew (I know some already do but that doesn\u0027t add a lot to the game. I\u0027ll get back to that later on). Also this kind of contracts should be more varied and focus on real space missions. No one is asking SpaceX to test said parachute on their flight (I mean, it might be possible but it\u0027s not the norm). Instead maybe focus on real missions like sending satelites to LKO, HKO, GSO, Polar Orbit, put a kerbal or a probe on said location in Kerbin, perform a rendez-vous, send a kerbal to fix a satellite, land a rover on said planet and walk for X kms, build a space station or a mun station, send a constelation of satellites, possibilities are endless and way more fun than testing the Rockomax Brand decoupler splashed down on Kerbin\u0027s oceans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the non procedurally created contracts. This is for what I\u0027m playing right now. It gives a sense of accomplishment and of advancing in some way with the game. It makes me eager to see at least what are they going to ask me after I explore Duna and Ike. It should be extended with the stepping stones of a real space program. KSP starts out good with the Launch a vessel and achieve said altitude but then it just stops and just asks you to explore all the planets and that\u0027s it. Stuff like, achieve orbit, put a kerbal in orbit, perform a rendez-vous, dock two vessels in said orbit, bring 3 kerbals to the mun and also some of the objectives I mentioned in the procedural contracts would feel like I\u0027m really getting somewhere. Maybe even have a finale for the game after you accomplish everything on the main contract branch. I mean... If a game has a career mode you should expect it to bring you somewhere in the end. Otherwise it\u0027s just an evolved sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlso concerning crew and kerbals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is probably going to get a lot of attention in the next updates but still I have the need to put in my thoughts about it. Kerbals should spend a big amount of time in training and this training should be well paid. With this I mean that you shouldn\u0027t have an infinite number of actively ready to loose their lifes Kerbals. They would turn out to be another precious resource that you don\u0027t want to waste. Also, the rewards you get from a manned mission should differ slightly from the ones you get from an unmanned mission. As in, manned mission = a lot of reputation; unmanned mission = a little bit more of science perhaps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome thought could be put into this and articulate it with the reputation system. For example, have a low enough reputation and putting one single Kerbal in your ship could drain all your funds, maybe even prevent you from having a manned vehicle at all while your reputation is so low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, stranded kerbals should have a counter on them. Take too long to rescue them and they will die with everything that it implies for your space program. And by the way, also make the hitchiker container play a significant role in the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn reputation\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReputation should mean how eager your kerbals are to go inside your vessel. It means less money to put kerbals in a vehicle when you have a high reputation and vice versa\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso (and I think this already happens but since every contract is procedural I can\u0027t really differenciate between them) it should mean better paid, more risky and more fun contracts. Maybe it should even put a limit on the science you can unlock or on the buildings you can build or upgrade or on how many active kerbals you can have. Something that would feel like a character level in RPGs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it should grow real slow and go down a little bit when you have a catastrophic failure in a vessel, a significant amount when you fail a mission, and a lot when you kill a kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn the general gaming experience\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the first thing I did in .24 (to reproduce a fairly common forum topic) was start a new career, click F12 and activate the hardcore mode. And believe me... Right now, I can\u0027t imagine myself playing KSP in any other way than this one. So if you never tried it, if are thinking of doing it later or if you don\u0027t even like the concept, trust me,try it right now and you won\u0027t regret it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an incredible way to have a really different gaming experience and to really taste what it is like to rescue a stranded kerbal on the Mun for the third time and end up killing him in the process while your funds are decreasing really fast. But that\u0027s ok, because sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, and that\u0027s what gaming should be about. KSP has been about finding a solution to the puzzle, making small corrections to your solution, f5, f9, rinse, repeat. In hardcore mode it\u0027s about double or triple checking every design and dealing with the consequences of it. It\u0027s about testing every new launch system and trying to find solutions to unexpected new problems. It\u0027s about dealing with the fact that that ship is gone and there\u0027s nothing you can do except learn from it. Heck, it\u0027s a whole new experience from the previous sandbox mode and I\u0027m really glad Squad implemented this as I couldn\u0027t get away from the F9 key when my frustration peaked to a certain point. Unfortunately it will make the learning curve even steeper and higher. But as I\u0027m pretty sure you remember, this steep curve is what makes up for legendary games like XCOM and KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo sandbox should ultimately be exactly that, a sandbox where you can try and correct and have nothing to lose. While a career is also precisely what it is, a place where you have to deal with the consequences of your choices and understand the impacts they will have on your future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I finish I have to say once again that I love KSP and the .24 was as incredible addition to what is already a great game. This is just my way of giving away some constructive feedback to Squad but also to see if I\u0027m on the same page as everyone who visits the forums. So feel free to share your thoughts and ideas on what I just wrote or on what you think would be the logical development of KSP in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and have fun\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-23T17:27:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2014 05:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dombi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterPan","CreatedById":101101,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T04:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat post.

The problem with sending Kerbal\u0027s is that it requires less resources and is worth more science for the very minor setback of possibly having them die and replaced by another identical Kerbal. With quicksave and reverting, this cost of loss is reduced to nil so the only thing that matters is Kerbals can stay in space forever and a probe needs batteries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether you increase the cost of losing a Kerbal or introduce another type of cost is fine, but saying the player must launch probes first because they must isn\u0027t a solution.

They can obtain crew reports, EVA reports in a large number of locations, plant flags and take soil samples for no additional cost or weight. They can also clear out experiments and repair broken pieces. Sorry, but an additional 0.7 tonnes isn\u0027t a restrictive factor or consideration here.
