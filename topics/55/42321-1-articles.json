There\u0027s no pulse modulated option for RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Space Shuttle used the pulse mode to give crew performing docking manoeuvres a finite amount of impulse in one pulse. The idea was to be able to gauge how much you are accelerating. For example one pulse up, followed by one pulse down would lead to a net gain of 0m/s in vertical velocity. This would dramatically improve docking and similar operations when carried out by hand as you would no longer have to gauge burn time of the RCS thrusters by ear and would have an accurate measure. IT\u0027s especially useful at low speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust one of those things that crossed my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cloudx","CreatedById":59108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T13:33:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have similar experiences on SSM2007. For KSP, putting RCS rockets into a pulse - jet mode would allow much more fine tuning for docking.
