I suggest remodeling that part so it look like it has room to contain reaction wheels, because the current 2 Meter ASAS looks like there is just a few computer components.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T22:13:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI too don\u0027t like how it looks like an empty ring, especially when I have to mount something of smaller diameter to it.
