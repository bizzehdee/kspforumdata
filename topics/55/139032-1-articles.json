It would make it possible to play different games with mods that would otherwise break each other. And you could also install a new mod in a way it doesn\u0027t change a game you were already playing... Maybe even have different savegames all using a different solar systems, who knows?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe something similar was asked before but i could not find it. I don\u0027t know if it is possible to do something like this without having to do large portions of the coding, i just think it could be a very handy feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
