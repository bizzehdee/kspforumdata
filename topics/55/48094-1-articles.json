I\u0027ve noticed that any code module associations in the welded parts don\u0027t function as one might expect. While there are several things which probably shouldn\u0027t be supported in a welded mode (multiple crew hatches, moving parts, etc.) it would be very helpful to many modders to have a working code module association mechanism for each individual model being used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would be in line with the intended purpose of the model node system and further, I don\u0027t believe it would be game-breaking since it would be at the discretion of the developers which code modules and other systems would not function within the model node system. At the very least (and just for the sake of an example), one would think a four-way light part should be possible with the model node system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T08:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince part welding is actually possible now, I support this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joelflake","CreatedById":67536,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T09:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESince part welding is actually possible now, I support this! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fairness to the developers, it\u0027s been possible for a very long time now.
