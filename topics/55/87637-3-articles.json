This is what we originally set out to achieve with the old Resource Mining plan and saw ourselves running into a very tedious dead-end.

I don\u0027t think this will be a big deal - ion engines are mainly used for probes, and it\u0027s not difficult to include to include enough onboard xenon on a probe.

Oxygen gives you (wait for it...) oxidiser. Hydrogen \u002B carbon gives you liquid fuel (feasible but most of the chemistry is abstracted out for game-play purposes). Water could also give you monopropellant in the form of hydrogen peroxide, although in real life, the chemistry isn\u0027t easy to scale up. Alternatively, monopropellant could simply be shipped from Kerbin. Hydrogen could give you LV-N propellant if Squad get around to redoing nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor added realism mods, water and oxygen can be used to resupply life support systems.

Asteroids are the other obvious place, although to manufacture everything would require an icy and a carbonaceous asteroid reasonably close together.

The practicalities of building and deploying sufficiently portable, rugged and repairable equipment to do the chemistry is most definitely not straightforward. Fortunately, it\u0027s precisely those practicalities that can, and should, be abstracted away in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T00:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei think we should eliminate converters entirely. you drill for resources, what you get depends on where you drill. you can handwave all the processing equipment into the drills, and ignore chemistry all together. the drill just outputs one of the game\u0027s usual resources w/o any intermediate compounds and certainly not a magic resource that you can turn into anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think the challenge should be in the prospecting. rather than be told exactly where the resources are with a scanner, you are instead told where they might be. you have to get closer to find exactly where they are. perhaps have a visible indicator of where they are, such as a patch of odd colored soil/ice/whatever (different colors might yield different resources). these patches are limited in resources, but there are many of them, so you are encouraged to explore more to find them. this system should work on both asteroids and planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eatmospheres may be where you get xenon (i think thats where we get xenon irl). kerbin and laythe have oxygen. you might get lf from jool, and co2 from duna and eve (not useful as a resource but perhaps for a reaction mass). simply make intakes resource agnostic so that you get whats in the atmosphere. if you have storage for that resource, you tank up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoceanic resources would work about the same way. i figure most of the oceans in this game are water, but you might also have ammonia or hydrocarbons. the latter two can be monoprop and lf, respectively. water can be a reaction mass, or a resource for life support, or split it for fuel (this is the only place where a converter makes sense because you need a lot of power for this). for balance concerns id make laythe\u0027s oceans not water, because otherwise its an infinite fuel tank. it makes sense on eve because its really hard to take off from there so why not free fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-21T01:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2014 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Francois424","CreatedById":98138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T07:35:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve given it some thought... and I came to this conclusion for really simple resources\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou \u0022mine\u0022 Water (Duna, asteroid, Laythe, Vall, many others) -- bear with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWater and lighting (electricity) using a \u0022Greenhouse\u0022 part == Snacks!
