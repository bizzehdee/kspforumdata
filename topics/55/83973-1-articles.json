Scott Manley could practically get to Eeloo with a ship entirely made of SRB\u0027s. So that brings up this suggestion. We need a new, harder planet. Something that poses an extreme challenge to get to. A planet that represents Sedna and is up to 5 times farther from Kerbol than Eeloo. The first challenge is getting as far as that. The second challenge is getting into orbit. Sedna would be slightly smaller than Eeloo, and have a much smaller SOI. This means you\u0027d probably first need to get close to Sedna then keep making maneuvers until you get an encounter. The final challenge is landing. Sedna would have small oceans of ice, which are bad for landing as your ship may slide around and tip over. It does have a couple areas of abundant land which have flat-ish terrain which is good for landing. Then you just need to land safely like any other planet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfx","CreatedById":37282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T20:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething like you described would just impose artificial difficulty aka patience while waiting for a burn/intercept and fine tuning of maneuver nodes which is already abysmal without mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic challenge (match planes / Hohmann it/ fine tuning) would be exactly the same as for Eelo etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T20:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomething more like recovery of a specific rock on a specific (existing) planet is more like a \u0022challenge\u0022. Fuel and time are not a real challenge, just a bit of patience, and all the stats in the world just boil down to fuel and time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo something with skill or planning would be specific flight locations, landings and or fly bys. Such as \u0022Misson for tour of 2 Jool moons\u0022 or \u0022return rocks from Minmus\u0022. Once something along the lines of re-entry heat or Life support are added, things will be REALLY challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T20:57:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually far out only means just more time warp. As the suns gravity is weak out there, it also means you need just a bit more fuel and Planets have larger SOIs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look for a hard-to-get place, I\u0027d go for low kerbol orbits with extreme inclination/eccentricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
