I think these lighting effects could be a meaningful way to translate that a specific area requires closer examination. (Yes, I\u0027m aware certain sat-mapping and telescopic/camera mods can pinpoint these Easter eggs from great distances, I\u0027m talking about a stock method of detection from low orbits and/or 10k to 15k away from the objects.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoaded physics for longer ranges on active probes. I like dropping science probes on various parts of kerbin like bombs, and trying to orbit them the whole time it takes them to fall to the ground within the 2 or so k that allows the object to still exist is a bit bothersome. I don\u0027t mind loitering until it\u0027s grounded, but the current loading distance is a bit restrictive. I also think greater loading ranges would help with RDV\u0027s of large objects because the frame rate drop is likely to come and go before a breaking burn. I really hate it when I pass a station because of frame drop, or I was just \u0022this close\u0022 to having a science probe or rover landed on a mountain before I lost it (despite all my best efforts to stay in range.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think everything else I want for the game before it\u0027s 1.0 is pretty much already on the drawing board. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomething like it) becoming stock would be a great add too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:15:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know it is possible to change the physics bubbles size cuz some mods do that, and knowing that, Squad could maybe add a \u0022physics bubble slider\u0022 in the settings? with pop-up warnings when you make it larger than default?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand glimmers would be cool, esp if it extended to looking at orbiting stations or satellites from the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T13:17:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by r4pt0r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T13:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely would be a nice thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESort of Distant Object mod in a stock game (especially now when D.O. is riding a bumpy road with development).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysics bubble slider would be a very nice thing to have too.
