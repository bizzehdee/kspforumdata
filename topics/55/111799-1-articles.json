Basically it turns pilots into an automatic PID tuner/damper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWaypoint Locator: allows a pilot to designate a marker from the map menu to register as a target to make flying or driving about a little easier. At a higher level it could even allow the player to set their own waypoints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas linked to specific pilot skill levels:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Ability to stay at a fixed heading: this would make pilots useful as rover drivers so that rovers maintain their correct heading despite terrain affecting how the rover performs. Obviously this could also be used for aircraft in certain circumstances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*** Ability to stay at a fixed pitch and heading: this would allow aircraft with pilots to maintain a fixed pitch (say 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or whatever is designated at the time) and heading which would allow aircraft to fly large distances at physics timewarp without having to adjust it every 10 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E**** ILS overlay: a simple ILS overlay that makes landing at KSC - or perhaps other locations as well - easier. It continues the trend of using pilots as navigation aids rather than actually doing the flying for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E***** Transfer aid: a high level pilot should help the player, when a planet or whatever is selected as a target, create a point on the node which makes it easier for the player to place a maneuver node for a transfer burn to the target. I\u0027m not suggesting that the node should be automatic, just that it makes it easier to find and place it without having to hunt around for it for 5 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else think this should be in the game? Or would this stuff be best left as a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:56:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn Autopilot for Rovers would make Pilots infinitely more useful, I would love to see that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T07:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Unfawkable\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Unfawkable\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAn Autopilot for Rovers would make Pilots infinitely more useful, I would love to see that.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
