After reading that, I\u0027m wondering if it could be adapted to wings - pure automagically shaped wings lose flexibility, but if we could \\*build\\* wings without using 50,000 parts, that\u0027d be awesome."},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:01:24Z","Content":"I think I heard something about getting some larger wings intended for Mk3 aircraft coming in 1.0. Not only that, but I think they will be \u0022wet\u0022 wings that contain fuel too. Presumably these would be much larger and should help with part counts."},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T09:26:46Z","Content":"Still, the idea seems good. You create a wing by adding panels like Harvester said it\u0027ll be with for fairings, this way you only have one part for the wing instead of many."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T11:21:03Z","Content":"Have to wait and see how fairings work but yes I was reading Harvesters description and thinking it sounded like it could work for custom wings as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T16:45:22Z","Content":"There are two issues with this:\n\n1) one big wing vs. smaller wings put together: sounds good until a wayward SRB takes off your wing tip (multi part wing may be able to lose a few pieces and keep the craft stable, one big wing instantly vanishes, along with all hopes of stable flight)\n\n2) Squad said no procedural parts, fairings being the only exception (for conveniences sake). That is because it would remove the lego like construction of ksp, which is all part of the challenge: do what you can with what you got."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T17:16:24Z","Content":"I certainly hope we get procedural wings, the current wing system is literally terrible. Constructing what should be a single, uniform shape from many little pieces and then figuring out how to strut it together is not only tedious, but really hard on the processor. Anything to reduce parts count in a sane and reasonable manner is laudable."},{"CreatedByName":"smart013","CreatedById":106088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T17:19:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I certainly hope we get procedural wings, the current wing system is literally terrible.
