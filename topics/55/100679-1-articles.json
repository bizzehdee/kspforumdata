After reading that, I\u0027m wondering if it could be adapted to wings - pure automagically shaped wings lose flexibility, but if we could *build* wings without using 50,000 parts, that\u0027d be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T08:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I heard something about getting some larger wings intended for Mk3 aircraft coming in 1.0.
