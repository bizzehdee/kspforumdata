Its all about rocket-science right now. I have to admit that I use a more realistic flight model (Ferram Aerospace Research) which made it way more challanging to bring someting to space and back to the KSP in one piece, or even construct a flyable plane. But if it works, its way more rewarding I think...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the last time I had to laugh really hard... uh, its hard to remember. Hmmmm.... a short time ago, there was a (long-time-hidden) object placing-accident while laying out a mun-lander, which ended up only having one landing strut when I finally came to my designation. That was a true kerbal moment... especially after I managed to land this piece of junk anyway, with its upside down and extended the lonely landing strut. (but needed another launch to get my pilot back from Mun). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore this, I had to rescue a Vessel that lost its parachute and was out of fuel, but carried around pretty needed science data. Fortunally I had a mod running that provided me with stuff like robotic arms and another one that offered stuff like winches and grapping hooks... well, you might know, how this did end. It was pretty entertaining. And hairy, after the two objects startet so sprin around a common barycenter, just by a black rope... guess how I did provide the needed loss of delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUh, and I had to drop a big fuel-tank during recently space-shuttle-testing. It left a lasting impression... uh, well, no, to be honest, it left a crater where once the Adminstration-Building was located at. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, and there was the time I was testing a \u0022science-utility-vehicle\u0022, which was just a science-lab with wheels attached and a robotic arm at its back. And winches. And... stuff. Well, that thing was able to pull itself at the top of the rocket assembly building. And doing science up there. But it crashed the game, when I tried to pluck a tree with its robotic arm ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, why am I telling you this? Because that what I think the kerbal way of rocket-science can look alike. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, the contracts are pretty... uh... to be honest, I feel offended by most of the contracts. Not because they are to easy, but all of them include parts I can\u0027t use right now or want me to build surface-bases at planets I don\u0027t can reach with the stuff I have at this very moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd placing satellites in orbits for ten seconds (which I can dump afterwards or maybe bring in another orbit), send science-data from a specific place (thats why I have probes in orbits around all moons of kerbin), or a specific science-experiment (ha, my rockets can\u0027t even lift the parts necessary for this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E ), or rescue someone in orbit (how did he end up there?) or do surface surveys (which are likely to crash the game because they eat up RAM like nothing) and EVA in areas, where nothing is present...
