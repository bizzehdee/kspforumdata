In reality, if you\u0027re going at all fast, water behaves more like a solid surface to start with: you would skip or ski on the surface until you slow down enough to sink. Consequently, things like seaplanes do not behave like in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this was made more realistic, seaplanes, fast boats, and similar craft would become possible. Conversely, splashdowns might become more dangerous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProblem 2: Ground effect\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, a plane flying close to the ground experiences a good deal of additional lift from an air cushion that forms beneath its wings. This makes aerodynamic landings easier and vessels like hovercraft or ekranoplans possible. Since KSP does not model ground effect, we can\u0027t do this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be a pretty simple change as you\u0027d only need to adjust the amount of lift generated by distance to the surface up to 15 m or so to get close enough that it felt more or less right. This would significantly expand the range of craft we can make, as well as making planes easier to fly and things more realistic in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T17:43:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh, both of these things totally make sense, and I\u0027ve never thought about them before.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T20:46:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike most of the ideas on here : Great, but not as important as some other things *cough cough stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E cough cough*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XLjedi","CreatedById":175658,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-02T20:53:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would add to the list... or even be happy with just:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFix the landing gear\u00A0interaction that is currently destroying every base on every planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dimas152","CreatedById":179714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T03:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomeone discussed about this in the facebook group, they said the ground effect is too hard to model, even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E refused to add it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-03T12:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223308965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171520\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221520046834\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022179714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022[INDO]dimas_1502\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, [INDO]dimas_1502 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomeone discussed about this in the facebook group, they said the ground effect is too hard to model, even \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E refused to add it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure it would be very hard to model\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eaccurately\u003C/em\u003E.
