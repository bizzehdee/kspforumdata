There needs to be a true invulnerability option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just ran a mission to Eeloo where I had landed safely and hit F5 to quicksave after I gathered my science and planted a flag. Later on my ascent I needed to reload my quicksave and parts started to explode on the physics load for the lander on Eeloo\u0027s surface. I tried everything I could using those debug options and these parts still blew up every time I tried to F9. Eventually I had to scrap the whole mission and chose to use hyperedit to return the remaining half of my ship safely to Kerbin. That may have been a bug with physics load and the colliders for the lander and Eeloo\u0027s surface, but I still would have expected the debug options to protect the vessel and they do not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apelli","CreatedById":152373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T17:49:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you are right, it is very sad that it does not save ship parts from any damage, although it would be really easy to implement ;(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone who has the information will enlighten us...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
