Let\u0027s say, we want a map on the variances on Duna\u0027s gravity, or the surface temperature at a location around Laythe. You could set up a probe to do measurements of either the whole planet from orbit, or from an area on the surface. You could then send back science depending on what area you measured and what you wanted to measure. Back to the examples, you could, for instance, place a satellite to measure gravity around the equatorial regions of Duna for \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E days, and send it back for \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E science for mapping \u003Cem\u003Ey\u003C/em\u003E amount of Duna\u0027s gravity (and the science value would vary depending on it). You would also get an actual map (pre-made in the game, of course) of the gravity fluctuations when done. Same for Laythe, send a probe to land on it and measure temperature fluctuations for a decent time time, then get science based on the data gained. Yes, there are contracts that do this, but this wouldn\u0027t be to, again, avoid just clicking and using an experiment once, to be more in depth, and to make science more interesting. And of course, these are only a couple examples to explain the concept. On top of that, some new parts, like advanced magnetosphere instruments, cameras and alike could be added for similar purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPutting it simply, this could make science in KSP much more in depth for \u003Cs\u003Esome\u003C/s\u003E many players, and has been talked about for as long as science gathering has been a thing in the game.

I\u0027m no mathematician, so forgive my layman\u0027s terms, but for example one interval of no science shouldn\u0027t immediately cripple your budget, but perhaps 3-5 intervals would see the budget seriously handicapped. A suitable interval length might be a quarter or half of Kerbin\u0027s orbital period. Incidentally, I see no reason to scrap contracts funding, but they should be the cream off the top, something with some panache (like tourism), while the science work is the staple diet of any space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-20T13:23:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222763960\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022148102\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221474245460\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/19/2016 at 2:37 AM, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy bother doing it for n days when I can timewarp that and more.\u00A0 You might as well just give me the science in an instant, which is what the game does.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadio Yerevan: in principle you\u0027re right, but I think science-over-time can be palatable and even a good gameplay element if you frame it well. Have you ever used Scansat? Mapping a planet takes time, and yes, you can timewarp right through it. Yet it feels right, while the stock method of just handing over the map as soon as you entered polar orbit is jarring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe better you can give the impression (1) that something is actually happening while you wait, the better it will work. Scansat is hard to beat in that regard, I can\u0027t think of anything that would come even close. But generally, setting a timer when deploying an experiment and providing the science points when $INTERVAL has passed would be bad. A solar observation satellite that yields a few science points every couple of weeks might go over better. Or a seismometer left behind on the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus point if you can frame it so that people don\u0027t feel like they have to timewarp-milk it for all it\u0027s worth, but can just accept it as something that keeps going while they do whatever they want to do next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) or illusion, as the case may be.
