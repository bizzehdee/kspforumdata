Flags increase this count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at a save where you\u0027ve visited the Mun a handful of times, Minmus a few, Duna several times, and planted a flag for each mission as I do to commemorate the survival of the Kerbals (and to a lesser extent the success of the mission) along with a nice amusing note of about who did the mission/what happened during the mission, then you end up with a savegame saying you have 20\u002B flights in progress. Toss in every satellite in orbit (especially if you use Remote Tech) and space station and the flights in progress gets astronomical as well as useless. I\u0027d rather have a count of MISSIONS in progress where I get to designate what is an active mission and what is not, but that goes beyond the scope of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimply put: flags, which are landed objects and markers of past missions are currently counted as flights in progress on every save game and we believe this is erroneous/misleading/a bug/just an issue that should be addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
