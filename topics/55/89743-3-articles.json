It seems really odd to me that there are these artificial groupings of parts, which inevitably leads you to researching a potentially expensive node for a simple utility part contained with in it. Plus I think there is more satisfaction of feeling like you are really running an R\u0026amp;D program when you have that sense of learning from the parts you have, enabling building of similar but bigger/more complex versions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there could still be cross-linkings that enable or reduce the cost of similar parts in other types.

For example, one might spend a lot of time/resources going directly for a bigger rocket, after which building a smaller one would be trivial/cheap. However, it would be much more expensive to go that way than going through a more stepwise progression -- like a crash Saturn V program vs. a progression of R-7 rocket derivatives, or shooting straight for a Space Shuttle rather than building an X-15 and then a Dyna-soar. Although perhaps there might be some very large-scale tech \u0022eras\u0022 -- maybe just 3 or so -- where you can\u0027t see to the next level until you\u0027ve completed enough of the one you\u0027re on; you don\u0027t even know to try to build a scramjet until you\u0027ve worked out a good bit of jet power, aerodynamics, and materials.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the surface it seems like having a per-part \u0022tree\u0022 would lead to an immensely complicated UI, but I agree with those here that suggest that it doesn\u0027t have to be so.
