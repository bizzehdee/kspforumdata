Before explaining, the comments against the current one is that it\u0027s either too grindy, too boring or far too easy. I find myself with the second issue personally. So this career mode should change things up and allow players to pursue more options, more creativity and more logical challenges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first aspect I have thought on is having players work to design crafts for others. A big aspect of aerospace engineering in real life is designing spacecraft but those engineers don\u0027t allows get to design the lifter for it, or vice versa. So players should have to build lifters to carry pre-built payloads or build payloads to other\u0027s lifters. The latter option is a greater and far more realistic challenge, as companies who want to get things launched by SpaceX or the ULA, have to make sure they\u0027re payload fits within the payload base and the fairing. This concept could also be stepped up so that players can use lifters from others for cheaper than the regular price tag if made by themselves. This could be a cheaper alternative and force the above payload figuring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe above idea could also be spread to aircraft. Contracts can be given to take pre-made aircraft to select areas, and possibly return carrying crew, cargo, or anything else. There could be many potential configurations when fully thought out. This would give\u00A0a greater purpose to aircraft parts as I see them as useless once you\u0027ve collected all the science from Kerbin which likely, by the time you do unlock the mk3 aircraft parts you\u0027ve already gained all the science from Kerbin and the only other place you can use the mk3 aircraft parts is Laythe and seeing as more weight is costly your more likely to use something smaller which could likely do the same job if not better. Note by mk3 aircraft parts I\u0027m referring to the fuel tanks, the Goliath, and the larger landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second aspect is that players should be forced to complete select missions before unlocking new and superior contracts. This would be for contracts like the first Kerbal to orbit, or first Munar landing and so on. The rewards for completing these contracts will be valuable and will work with the third aspect mentioned below. This is so that players feel that contracts have a bigger more substantial impact on their career rather than being tedious tasks. One thing I would add though is a major success \u0022tune\u0022 after completing these major milestones. It should be about 6 seconds long, just something that puts the success of their actions into them. Lots of games do this and it wouldn\u0027t hurt the game much. This portion of this idea is debatable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third aspect\u00A0is that the tech tree should be slightly modified so that some parts are locked until select activities are taken. So that players are forced to pace themselves and science spamming will not complete everything. Players also should be able to unlock select tiers or part of tiers by completing certain missions. The missions will be similar to the aspect they are for (so that these missions aren\u0027t something weird like diving under the ocean to unlock new solar panels or flying a craft to the north pole to unlock a new fuel tank).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fourth is a reworked administration building and larger scale and duration mission projects. Now these can be anything from missions to launch a constellation of satellites into orbit, landings on the moon, or aircraft flights to select locations. Now I disagree with others on that I like the Administration Building and what it offers, but maybe this aspect can be given to the Mission Control building as a secondary feature. The point being that contracts should be longer and slower to do without the aspects of the contract becoming \u003Cem\u003Etoo \u003C/em\u003Etedious. I will note that being forced to do the same style of thing repeatedly for any reason can get monotonous (We landed on the MOON, the biggest achievement of all time and by the third landing it was \u0022like a trip to Petersburg\u0022, so ANYTHING can get tedious no matter what we do) is a sad side effect but hopefully doing the missions themselves can yield some benefits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe to add to the above aspect, there can be missions to go to X location and await further instructions. Sometimes astronauts have to follow commands from Mission Control before they can do them. This is a debatable portions so maybe it should be added maybe not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last aspect is simply more contracts and variations upon them. A few ideas I have are contracts to find lost Kerbals or crafts. Now this is unlike the \u0022recover\u0022 or \u0022rescue\u0022 contracts as unlike those these are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E in the map mode and have to be located by looking and searching. This contract can also call for the selected Kerbal and or craft to be returned to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E before recovery. There should also be missions to complete tasks when the crafts are already in space. Maybe it\u0027s to drive a spawned rover to X destination, or move modules on a space station around. There are many many \u003Cem\u003Emany\u003C/em\u003E contract possibilities still to be made and I feel some of them might give more enjoyment than the current set. I suggest that Squad possibly look to movies and or history for more inspiration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad could considering opening a new subsection for this section called Contract Suggestions? So players could submit their ideas for contracts. It would be a great way to get outside minds to at least shine some new light on ideas no single person may be able to think of. Just another one of many ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I finish, I would also suggest that Squad add more to the base game once the basic game becomes stable again from this transition to Unity 5. I suggest things specifically to add to EVA. If you look at real life, astronauts can perform many hours of EVA work and they did. Whether it be Skylab, Mir, or the ISS, astronauts can spend long periods of time completing tasks in space. Apollo 17 was the last mission to the moon and it spent the longest duration on the surface. The crew spent longer performing scientific studies than any other previous mission, and yet NASA utilized every second they could as to not waste resources and therefore money. Now in KSP we don\u0027t have all the hold-ups such as preparations for activities, performing the activities and so on, so as such, it won\u0027t take us as long. However even if you did absolutely everything you could possibly do in EVA, it would only take you ten minutes. So I suggest looking into mods such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and adding them since many EVAs have astronauts assemble or modify vessels in space. For example, the Apollo Lunar Rover was deployed from inside the Apollo Lunar Module but had to be unfolded by the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust some of my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jovus","CreatedById":117163,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T15:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pretty much completely disagree with your vision for a career mode revamp.
