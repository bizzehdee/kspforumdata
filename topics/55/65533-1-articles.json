But i can\u0027t help but wonder what is suppose to come first. For those who don\u0027t know, the Dev\u0027s plan to release the next update in at least 2 parts, due to the sheer size of the NASA mission pack and other base additions, such as contracts, part connection changes and changed tutorials. (1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarv mentioned the next update as the ARM update, probably referring to the new grapple that will be used to move asteroids which somewhat confuses me, as i would think the asteroid redirect parts would stay with the NASA pack, or will the grapple (or arm?) be part of the \u0022stock\u0022 game and thus come first with the other changes, BEFORE the NASA pack gets released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also am curious about how much do we get without the NASA pack, will we still have the grapple, will we still have asteroids, will we get asteroids in the sandbox mode and will we still have the speculated larger parts?(as the NASA SLS is confirmed to be a new part size(1))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso is the grapple a robotic arm, or something of the like, or did i just get the ARM idea totally wrong?(2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, will the observatory finally get some use (its modeled in the Science Facility) with .24 update, that is only if asteroids are also implemented or will the observatory be part of the NASA pack or not part of either update and still planned for the future?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to find some answers before KSP .24 goes live! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee yall in orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MKI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereferences \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1)\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68894-Newest-Squadcast-Highlights-lots-of-new-info-about-24\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68894-Newest-Squadcast-Highlights-lots-of-new-info-about-24\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2)\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/79311516702/devnote-tuesdays-the-forward-progress-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/79311516702/devnote-tuesdays-the-forward-progress-edition\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T09:04:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWith GDC upcoming, i guess it wont be long until .24 is released.

The squadcast highlights seems to indicate more generic parts, like the larger rocket pieces, will be stock from 0.24, so it seems likely the more specialized pieces (like the grapple), will be only in the NASA pack.
