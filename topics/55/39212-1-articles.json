The placing of attachment points and the width of the part would have to be kept standard, but otherwise, there is nothing stopping the parts from being reskinned at will as far as I can see. Instead of just having the X-32 tank with only its heavy banded, riveted design, or the X-16 with its strange(ly pool-like) crimped texture all down the sides, why not add variations so they can all be crimped, or all banded, or [x] or [y] texture consistently, or any other combination?
