It\u0027ll stay on rails until you get around to it. It could be fun, however, to have certain emergency contracts that would pop up and give you a short time span to accept and complete them, but it might fit better with KSP to simply act like it\u0027s urgent when it\u0027s actually designed to be fine on its own indefinitely until you get to it. The escape trajectory contracts could give you a lot of time till it escapes, and you can still go after it even once it is outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, it\u0027s just more difficult. One way to make an escape trajectory contract a lot easier is have the ship heading toward Kerbin and give it a few days before periapsis, that way you don\u0027t have to chase it down if you act quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool feature could be to have the ability to call other space programs to your aid.

Making the ships more complex either involves making a variety of mission derelicts, which either results in loads of work making many variants or a small list that gets stale quickly, or building an AI for putting these together that will have a tendency to make wonky and crazy designs until you tweak the parameters enough to prevent it from doing that.

I was definitely thinking myself though that it would be great if the ships you rescued could be salvageable in some way, especially if doing so would allow you access to a formerly locked part. Just sticking a docking port on the pods might be a good start in that regard. I also feel like the game, at least the one I\u0027m playing now, is just generating way too many of these contracts. My last four missions in my current hard career game have involved picking up 2-4 stranded Kerbals with a MK1\u002BHitchhiker-based bus and carting them to whatever the destination du jour is. Not only do I get to fill the roster of my space program for free this way, but they all also get lots of experience just for being along on the ride! When I land, there always seem to be 3 more rescue missions available. This seems like kind of an exploit to me, because given this possibility there is apparently no reason ever to hire a Kerbal from the applicant pool. Why pay for a raw recruit when you can get paid instead for an astronaut with instant experience?
