I see that some things might not be well defined, like things that were attached to a missing part. In these cases I would often be happy to have such parts put somewhere in the editor, as long as the set of parts and their tweaks are preserved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T04:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think simply replacing \u0027unknown\u0027 parts with a placeholder part would work fine, really. It could simply have a predetermined size (for things that are surface-mounted) or scale as needed (say, between two node attachments that the mod part is attached to). It needn\u0027t look pretty -- heck, make it as awful looking as possible to encourage players to remove it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E That\u0027d solve all the problems in one go.

That\u0027s the standard shortcut (on Windows and Linux, on mac it is probably a similar key set) to close a program. By closing KSP with Alt-F4 (or going windowed and closing with the exit button) it won\u0027t save to the persistence file and any ships removed from missing parts will magically reappear (since they weren\u0027t removed from the file itself yet). So if you unexpectedly find that your 100 hours of Mun-base are missing because of a single radially attached part from a mod you don\u0027t use anymore, you can Alt-F4 out, reinstall the mod, then fix the problem with some creative use of KAS or Whack a Kerbal \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If you change scenes (like going into the VAB or tracking station) or if you exit to the main menu, it\u0027s too late and you can\u0027t do this anymore, but you may be able to load a quicksave (you may have to do it manually by renaming the quicksave file, but I\u0027m not sure on that)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
