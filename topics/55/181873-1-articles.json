In the mission builder, you are able to have a node that makes a part \u0022Fail\u0022. Then you can make a Kerbal\u00A0go on an EVA and\u00A0fix it, and so on. But what if parts would randomly break normally, and only an engineer could fix it?

However, of course, you could always make an option in settings. I didn\u0027t know that there was a mod for launch failures, and I kind of like that - but anyway, I didn\u0027t really mean that parts could randomly explode or anything - just every so often an engine would stop working and you would have to send an engineer out to fix it. Also, I did mention that only very low-tech-tree parts would break often, while more advanced ones would\u00A0break less.
