A science contract might grant you extra reputation if you recover the science instead of transmitting it. A rescue mission might only require the return of the pilot, but give you extra science if you bring the derelict back for examination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking this change to the contract system to allow optional objectives that are not necessary to successfully complete the contract would give you a bit more leeway in adding interesting challenges, since you would then be able to offer rewards for doing interesting or challenging things without risking flooding the contract offers with contracts that are too difficult to complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
