I kinda miss the explosions in the older versions, because they were more realistic, with burning rocket fuel flying off (not very detailed, though). I know that explosions lag a lot, but some of us like big explosions, and not the cute little explosions we have now. So a slider to ramp up things would be quite satisfactory, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T20:35:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ll probably rework the visuals at some point. I don\u0027t imagine that\u0027s a very high priority because it doesn\u0027t serve any real purpose beyond the visual experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I agree, I\u0027d like to see some prettier explosions someday as well...and have the option to turn them down if they melt my GPU a bit XD\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T11:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, prettier explosions would be nice. Also bigger explosions if you have fuel involved (atm a full orange tank is same as a small empty tank)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T17:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment one problem I have with the explosions is that they seem to be the same size regardless of the part being exploded. A thermometer exploding shouldn\u0027t create as large a visual effect as a fuel tank exploding, but it does. When I have Deadly Reentry enabled this can be annoying as tiny parts on the periphery burning off the ship produce large booms and a big cloud of fire that obscures sight of the craft and I can\u0027t see what happened and I need to use the F3 debug log to find out what actually broke off the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mitchz95","CreatedById":82292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T18:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely agree. In real life, when a rocket crashes and explodes the fireball is many times the size of the actual ship due to the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
