Now in ksp we have like 4 types of fuel tanks, 1 - for rocket fuel, 2 -for planes fuel, 3 - for RCS fuel and 4 - for xenon gas, my idea is to make form them the same fuel tanks and add an option to fill it with what you want (just fuel, fuel \u002B Oxidizer, RSC fuel or Xenon gas), there will be no more making the same size of fuel tank for different type of fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Add option for transferring fuel in docking ports, so everybody can transfer fuel from one rocket to another without clicking every fuel tank in rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Multi fuel tanks transferring fuel, with right mouse we can select as many fuel tanks as we want, but we can only transfer fuel from one to another, it\u0027s very hard when you have couple fuel tanks around your rocket and want to keep balans in all your tanks, this can be fixed with other one, add option for equalize fuel in tanks when you select 2 or more fuel tanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Add new \u0027External Fuel Duct\u0027, i\u0027m thinking about 2 types, one, the fuel in all connected tanks will be used in the same level, and two, the fuel will be used from bigger tanks first, and then, when the amount of fuel will be the same will work like the first one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also a old one: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/42751-Make-all-decouplers-not-cross-feed-fuel\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMake-all-decouplers-not-cross-feed-fuel\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-06T23:15:15Z\u0022 title=\u002211/06/2013 11:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr_Auto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-06T19:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice if there was an option to transfer liquid fuel and oxidizer at once in the right proportion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T05:20:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMost of this is covered under \u003Cstrong\u003ETweakables\u003C/strong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9, which is apparently coming in the next update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
