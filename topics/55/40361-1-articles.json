Other notions along the theme might include aging the buildings after increments of game time or the launch pad itself (possibly include bigger/more numerous/more advanced tanks) after numbers of launches (the memorials on the forbidden list also fall along this theme.) I think it would also be need to scribble sortie marks somewhere on the space center: little fireballs for explosions on Lonch\u0027s real estate, circles around planets for orbital missions, and little hyperbolas for interplanetary ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the blackboard mentioned elsewhere would be neat to have just as a background item in the VAB and SPH, maybe with the already present bespectacled clipboard dudes going to them every minute or so to scribble an impression of whatever you\u0027re building at that moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all stuff that I\u0027m indifferent about, though.
