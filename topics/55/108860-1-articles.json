That is to say, all hard-core, true realism space sims, as much as the hardware of the day could handle. I played these because they were the only things going that had any actual rocketry in them, as opposed to \u0022airplanes in space\u0022. Anyway, these sims were educational and challenging, but they were decidedly not fun. In fact, they totally crushed my dreams. I grew up watching the space race on B\u0026amp;W TV so as a child I expected that by now I\u0027d be living on Europa. But with the harsh realities of real spaceflight, there will never be any meaningful human presence anywhere off Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I found KSP. It was the ideal combination of just plain retro-fun from an era when dreams of meaningful human space presence were still possible, with just enough of a nod towards realism to make it a bit of a challenge. But the challenge never got in the way of the fun, and thus unfettered imagination could take you as far as you wanted to go. So I uninstalled Orbiter and havne\u0027t looked at it since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut then 1.0 came out and all this changed. Now KSP is a wannabe Orbiter and all its previous charm is gone. There are now harsh constraints not only on what a player can do at all, but also on how he can do those things still possible. As a result, KSP is now the worst of both worlds, trapped in the limbo between simulations OT1H and a fun game OTOH. It isn\u0027t and never will be a realistic as Orbiter, but now it can\u0027t be played like a game anymore, either. And once again, I feel my dreams have been crushed. Even meaningful Kerbal space presence is now more trouble than it\u0027s worth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, enough preamble, on with specifics of what I don\u0027t like. First off, there\u0027s this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ECE5xOF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ECE5xOF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s even worse when the definition of \u0022reality\u0022 is \u0022just like on Earth\u0022. Nothing in the Kerbal solar system can possibly be just like on Earth because everything there is demonstrably made of some exotic form of matter that can\u0027t exist under Earthly laws of physics. None of the chemical elemets that make up Kerbals and their planets has anything in common with any element we know. Therefore, it is simply wrong to impose Earth-like aerodynamics and melting points on Kerbal stuff. The new stuff is actually more wrong that the old for this very reason. The only way to impose an Earth-like atmosphere on Kerbin is to make Kerbin the same size as Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, in 1.x there seems to have been a deliberate, calculated effort to prevent players from having fun with the possibilities offered by various parts, and instead force them to build stuff all pretty much to the same template. Want to build a spaceplane? Well, now you\u0027re pretty much stuck with RAPIERS thanks to the nerfs to things like the 909\u0027s atmospheric performace, and you need some huge monstrosity compared to previously. Want to build an interplanetary ship? Well, now you\u0027re pretty much stuck with conventional rockets due to the silly, utterly unrealistic heating of the LV-N. Want to get science in career mode? Well, now you\u0027re stuck with the long grind of the \u0022Great Blueprint Scavenger Hunt\u0022, looking for the plans for new parts in every biome instead of getting science for testing parts, building stations, placing satellites, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you transcend this and still do your own thing? Yes, with sufficient toil, you can break the mold a bit, but you can\u0027t stray very far affield, so it\u0027s not really worth the effort. At least when you remember what you could do before 1.x. Maybe new players, who don\u0027t remember the good old days before KSP got self-conscious, won\u0027t feel this way, but how many new players will you get once the buzz wears off and \u0022reality\u0022 sets in? How many old players will you lose due to disillusionment?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsed to be, if you wanted to impose all these limits on yourself, there were mods for that. And I used them myself. I always had 1 game with FAR, DRE, RT, life support, and all that, side-by-side with a pre-1.x stock game, just to compare the 2, and remind myself of why I had fun with KSP and not with Orbiter. So what happened to the idea of making all this misguided \u0022reality\u0022 stuff as difficulty options?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/vent mode]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I for one don\u0027t like KSP\u0027s new direction and I\u0027m saddened by the fun being sucked out of it.

To the OP, you\u0027re completely wrong, you\u0027re not giving 1.0 a fair chance, you\u0027re refusing to adapt to necessary change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-909s were never meant to be a space plane engine, they are a low profile, low gravity lander engine. It\u0027s entirely possible to build reasonable space planes using the turbojets and some other rocket engine, you are in no way forced to use the RAPIER. The bad silly stuff with turbojets has mostly gone, such as the absurd air hogging, insane speeds and altitudes, etc; but it has been replaced with HUGE power in a realistic sweet spot for a turbo-ramjet hybrid (SR-71 territory). The flight technique to get a space plane to orbit has changed radically, with the vastly improved atmospheric physics, you just need to learn how to deal with the much better model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-Ns were a bad thing about old KSP, as they gave too big an advantage over just about everything else. Balance was very much needed there, and now there\u0027s actually some skill needed to create good, efficient interplanetary ships. The LV-N is still very much useable, you just need to learn how and when to use it, and when not to use it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs has already been pointed out, if you don\u0027t like a particular aspect of the current game balance, go right ahead and change it. It\u0027s all there for you to setup exactly how you\u0027d prefer it to be for maximum enjoyment, either in the debug menus, or the various .cfg files. It\u0027s really very easy to change just about any aspect of the balance to personal taste. Honestly though, KSP 1.0 is every bit as much fun as old KSP, you just need to let go of most of the \u0022how to do x,y,z\u0022 stuff from pre-1.0, and do things the new way. Once you\u0027ve learned how to work with the new behaviour, it\u0027s a much better game overall than it ever was pre-1.0. Squad have done their bit in filling in the gaps, balancing, producing a great 1.0 release, now you have to do your bit and re-learn stuff that absolutely had to change. There is no way that KSP could have been released with the old horrible, broken aerodynamics, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was obvious that things had to be balanced from rough and ready alpha, to full release. Is the balance perfect? No, it\u0027s not, there\u0027s still scope across the entire game to better tune the balance, put the polish on bits that didn\u0027t quite get enough polish for 1.0, etc. Overall, however, the balance and polish isn\u0027t all that bad, it\u0027s in the general area of reasonable for most stuff, but some things are better than others. I fully expect the existing 1.0 feature set to be pushed close to perfect by 1.1 and 1.2, we just need to give them a little time to get it done. As it stands, 1.0 is a vastly higher quality product than some big name AAA studios put out under flagship brands and vast budgets. Some big names have put out basically unplayable 1.0 releases in recent memory, taking 6\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015312 months after release to sort out serious problems, and even then not actually fully delivering; other notable names have slapped a 1.0 sticker on it, fired the dev team, and walked away to leave customers with an overpriced, broken, incomplete game. KSP is ranked in the top 10 of all games on Steam sorted by customer reviews (not the world\u0027s best metric, I admit, but still a fantastic achievement for a small developer on their first big games project), and it deserves to be up there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T07:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew player here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBought the game it came out, version 1.0.

A nuclear thermal rocket engine uses the heat from a nuclear reactor to heat up the propellant and eject it out in the exhaust. The heat gets carried away with the propellant...and the temperatures in the core of the NTR are LOWER than the temperature in the combustion chamber of a chemical rocket engine. It HAS to be this way because the solid core of the NTR must stay below the melting temperature of its components. The rest of the engine is regeneratively cooled by the fuel flow just as with chemical engines (and the nozzle is radiatively cooled, just as with most chemical encines). Before the completion of the engine burn, the nuclear reactor is \u0022turned off\u0022 (control drums are rotated to face neutron-absorbing materials toward the core, causing the chain reactions to cease), and the fuel flow is continued to carry off heat as the reactor core cools down (as the very-short lived fission products decay away). When this cooldown process is complete, the core of the reactor is at a temperature (around 505 degrees C) where the heat dissipation can handled by the outer parts of the engine radiating it to space. A NERVA-style NTR does NOT require extra radiators. It does NOT melt without extra radiators (the NERVA was designed to be restarted multiple times). It does NOT cause the rest of you ship and the propellant in its tanks to heat up to 1500 Kelvin (I\u0027d like to see anybody try that with any realistic propellant tank). NTRs that get really hot during burns are entirely unrealistic. If this is meant to be some sort of game-balance mechanic to nerf the nuke, there are entirely realistic ways of nerfing the nuke (just lower its Isp) rather than teaching Bad Rocket Science.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll be extremely blunt.

The reason space exploration has stopped is entirely political, and not that it\u0060s impossible. You would have to try to say that and we don\u0060t anymore. Particularly in the USA, NASA was set up as a government-directed economic sector to do several things: 1: Produce jobs and economic growth, 2: develop technology and 3: Long term colonization/human presence on other planets. Since then the USA, and the west in general, has moved into a new system of economic fascism where public resources and the public sector in general has been privatized. And the old NASA doesn\u0060t fit into this model because its activities aren\u0060t directly profitable. Therefore the corporations who have swallowed up the public sector don\u0060t want to spend any money on it. From about the time of Reagan NASA had already been warped into a geostrategic resource and it was apparently more important to have lasers, satellites and God only knows what in orbit as military threats than to explore anything. And then of course the space program was dismantled entirely by Bush JR and Obama and no longer exists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for human presence in space it\u0060s certainly hard. You would need some way to shield radiation properly for it to even be possible. Just leaving the atmosphere is hazardous and a radiation spike could kill you in low orbit if you\u0060re unlucky. And even if that can be done there is of course the problem of propulsion and distances to contend with. But there\u0060s no reason at all not to keep working on it.
