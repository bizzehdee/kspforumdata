With this itself I don\u0027t have much problem, but I see one potential gameplay element that could come out of this. Since asteroids has certain element of randomness to it, why not add a rare asteroid? Instead of just categorizing them based on size, there should be also a categorization based of composition and shape. Not all asteroids are boulder-shaped, some could be in weird shape like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.com/search?safe=off\u0026amp;client=firefox-a\u0026amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial\u0026amp;biw=1360\u0026amp;bih=644\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;q=kleopatra%20asteroid\u0026amp;revid=1982512886\u0026amp;ei=2xVBU4n0IMaxrgeGqIH4BA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKleopatra\u003C/a\u003E, and could made of different elements like titanium, iron, and water (which at the very least should give them a cosmetic color difference aside from being dull gray). These rare asteroids could give higher science than common asteroids, and while we\u0027re at it, maybe when budget is implemented, you can safely land them on Kerbin or mine it in situ and sell it for money? I hear asteroid mining could be quite lucrative...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
