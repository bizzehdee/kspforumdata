Months? Weeks? I simply want to know what\u0027s the general time difference now that we\u0027re in beta... 1 update a year? 2?

AFAIK, it\u0027s not against the rules for legal reasons so much as there\u0027s no point in predicting a release date for a game that\u0027s a work-in-progress and only available online. It will be released when all the targeted features are finished enough and the worst of the bugs have been resolved. There\u0027s never going to be an answer until it\u0027s actually ready for release, at which point, why delay?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
