Of the orbital map, not having it until you unlock it would be the \\*opposite\\* of good progression: it means that initially you need to already know orbital mechanics and spreadsheet your rockets in order to get past LKO (actually, you\u0027d basically have to do that to \\*enter\\* LKO as well, as you otherwise wouldn\u0027t know you were in LKO until you\u0027d finished an orbit and so would end up expending all your fuel and wouldn\u0027t be able to land without getting out and pushing, which you can\u0027t do right away). Altimeter/barometer is likewise a really odd choice of progression: I guess it could theoretically be used, but when your first contracts ask you to reach a given altitude, it\u0027s somewhat cruel to not tell you what altitude that is."}]}
