One that can fill it to full, halfway, and empty(at minimum) without having to find all the tanks. This is insanely helpful for testing. Or will this be in 1.0?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething as simple as setting each tank to full empty or half would be great. Anything more would be wonderful. I do alot of testing with my planes aerodynamics and the single most annoying and time consuming thing is calculating and changing out the fuel levels to see how it acts as the fuel adjusts. Anything that makes it faster to adjust the fuel levels of the entire plane would be a godsend. Even when I know the number(which I normally do) the process of finding all the tanks I use is insanely tedious and wastes huge amounts of time I could be actually testing in flight or using the ships for missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T00:01:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T04:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think what I\u0027d find most useful would be fuel adjustment buttons on the right-click menu of the docking ports: buttons for \u0022transfer as much fuel as possible from this side of the docking port to that side\u0022 and vice-versa.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T05:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime: RCS Build Aid includes markers for dry CoM and average CoM, and the FAR analysis screens include an option for \u0022empty\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AbacusWizard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AbacusWizard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think what I\u0027d find most useful would be fuel adjustment buttons on the right-click menu of the docking ports: buttons for \u0022transfer as much fuel as possible from this side of the docking port to that side\u0022 and vice-versa.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T06:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Either in a side window you cold bring up and/or in a screen in the IVA. I think they should maximize the IVA then make alternative windows for everything in flight mode potentially. they have the buttons and interface in the IVA\u0027s potentially regardless. No reason not to use them all. Could be an advantage of each cockpit. some have more button features than others. Even the individual seats could have different stuff and you need kerbals to be seated in them or move the one kerbal around to do it. Then we would have realistic cockpits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven something as simple as Shift \u002B Right click or Alt(right shift) \u002B right click to select all of that one tank type or all tanks would be nice.
