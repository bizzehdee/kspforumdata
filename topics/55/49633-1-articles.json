Since many new players may wind up killing their Kerbals on initial attempts like these, I suggest we go easy on them by giving Kerbals the ability to shut down most biological functions once they are deprived, like a tardigrade. This way they can remain in space indefinitely until a rescue craft comes to give them a kick/splash them with water/revive somehow with a new cache of food.
