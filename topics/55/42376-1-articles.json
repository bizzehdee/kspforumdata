I can understand when doing \u0027far\u0027 switching that the target is lost for the time being, as you\u0027re basically unloading one instance and loading up another, but when doing close range [ ] instant switching the target should be retained.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T20:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes yes yes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd implementing would simply be a matter of saving \u0022controllingPart: ....\u0022 and \u0022targetThing: ....\u0022 as two settings saved per vessel.

So if you have 3 craft, A B and C, you can target C while controlling A, and when you switch to B you\u0027ll still be targeting C. However as soon as you switch to C, that target will be cleared. There\u0027s currently no way to keep two craft targeting each other\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
