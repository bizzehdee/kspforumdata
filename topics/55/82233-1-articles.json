My background is mostly in economic simulations, which I excelled at creating when I was 14 and even made some for school projects later on. As the new career mode opened up the flood-gates for some true space program sim mods (Kerbal Construction Time, Dang it!, the venerable Final Frontier, Mission controller, fine print, etc) I have been considering creating plugins to expand on the Space Program management side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Concepts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScientific Goals\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving major scientific goals on individual worlds/moons that become accomplished after studying enough biomes (possibly with custom biomes support) and generating enough research points at a specific world. Each one will have one or more major questions to be answered... such as \u0022Did Duna harbor past life?\u0022 or \u0022Does Laythe have current life?\u0022 possibly with some randomization involved. These questions would allow targeted research missions to have more purpose, and the rewards could be cash, reputation (which I want to expand on), additional research, or a possible new value I have thought of adding... Prestige. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpace Program Bureaucracy\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so many of us play KSP to avoid the nitty gritty of dealing with public relations, congress, etc.. (to build our DREAM program, without idiots changing things). But in a hardcore career game, sometimes it may be fun to deal with the bureaucratic side of running things. This could be tied to the contract and Scientific goal system. Either it would turn reputation into a value also representing public interest, or adding a new value, such as Prestige, or Public Interest (PI). Public interest would essentially increase by completing contract goals and scientific goals, and decrease over time (think Apollo 11 as completing every goal, and then the other Apollo missions working against a slow decrease of interest). Decreasing interest would impact budget (annual budget, another possibility) or reputation. It would encourage a few \u0022Bam, WOW, SCIENCE!\u0022 missions between building the 4th com sat or launching the 5th fuel pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth of these concepts would be somewhat dependent on Kerbal Construction Time, which extends the game\u0027s time-frame in a way to require things like annual budgets and degrading rep/prestige. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, the possibility of an \u003Cstrong\u003Eannual report\u003C/strong\u003E, detailing missions completed/failed during the year, kerbals lost, science gained, and cash granted. Possibility of adjusting things each year, such as percentage of budget spent on research, development, or operations. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEffectively, this plugin would be designed to tie together many others (Final Frontier, KCT, etc) under a \u003Cstrong\u003Esingle framework\u003C/strong\u003E. It would not require any of them specifically, but work better with them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, \u003Cstrong\u003Erandom events \u003C/strong\u003Ecould be added. Gus Kerman may die in a tragic accident during the year, or a space race could heat up with the Kerbiet Union (generating additional funds), or a vicious Kongressmen could try to shut the program down, stirring up distrust. These could be simple decision nodes, limited to the annual report, that may affect the future of the program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd specifically, it would be designed primarily to enhance the career mode, and designed to provide a \u003Cstrong\u003EHistorical Framework\u003C/strong\u003E to the game. I want the player to feel like they are nurturing their space program through ups and downs, failures and triumphs, losses and gains, and by the end.. feel like they played out the alternate history of space exploration of an entire planet. The ultimate feature would be to take all the event recording the game does, along with any screen shots taken, and allow a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehistorical log\u003C/strong\u003E to be created and shared with the community. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may be a bit too ambitious for someone who hasn\u0027t written code in nearly 10 years, but if it gives other, more talented individuals a good idea or if anyone else thinks this could be fun, let me know. I may try to tackle this concept in small portions, tying it together later or collaborating with others. It frightens me a bit that this may interest some, but I think I need some pressure to get motivated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-23T21:54:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2014 09:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by autumnalequinox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"autumnalequinox","CreatedById":114782,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T19:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am writing up a full outline for the goals of this plugin, what dependencies it may require, and the basic functions that it will perform.

I have almost finished a rudimentary outline, however, which will approach this progressively.. starting with simply the annual report (with budget) and yearly events. If I can get that much coded then the tough part will be working with other modders and integrating functions together. I\u0027ve dreamed of KSP having a strategy element since I started playing, and it would be kewl to add a new sub-style of gaming. Soon it will be.. pilot, builder, and bureaucrat!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
