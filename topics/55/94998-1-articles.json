Presumably, and rightly, this will need to change at some point to protect Squads business interests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of my fears is that I may be forced to access the game online through Steam (or similar) each time I want to play as I currently do with CoD. This is fine for online multiplayer gaming, but I resent needing Internet access each time I want to play a single player game that I have bought, although I fully understand the need for security and copyright / piracy protection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI purchased mine through Squad directly and will continue to update that way too for as long as I can. Has there been any thoughts or communications on how Squad will address these issues and handle this aspect of sales and distribution in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T13:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a key code type thing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elthy","CreatedById":63317,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T13:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethis will need to change at some point to protect Squads business interests.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy?
