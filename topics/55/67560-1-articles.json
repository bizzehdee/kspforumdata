Then you could send a scouting party to check it out and get samples. Also you could probably get different science from it then a asteroid that has not impacted. Nothing special would be needed for a crater though.

Just let the asteroid part explode like any other part including detaching it from all other parts ... and then generate two to four smaller size asteroids within its initial volume and give them some impulse at different directions.
