His upgrades of the non-updated aero parts are amazing. Those control surfaces now perfectly fit with the Mk2 and Mk3 line. But some of his designs or design elements don\u0027t fit the game as well. Some diverge from stock too much, for no good reason. The 6-way hub comes to mind. That would\u0027ve been much better with just a HD redo instead of that weird color scheme stuck halfway between realistic and Kerbal-style. Other examples are the windows on pods and the new solar panels. Those were fine before and the only thing that they do now is conflict with the established stock style used excellently by mods such as Tantares or RLA. Other changes actually impact my enjoyment of the game. All his fuel tanks have exposed pressure cylinders (or whatever those internal tanks are called). That looks fine on a launcher (which I why I don\u0027t mind it on the 3.75m tanks), but 1.25m and 2.5m fuel tanks are also used without the same sized engines or other parts obscuring the back end. On space stations for example or worse, when putting a smaller size engine on a larger size tank. Then the open end of Ven\u0027s tanks make it look like the engines are attached to nothing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T11:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only recently started using visual improvement mods and this is one of my favorites.
