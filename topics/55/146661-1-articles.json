Things would probably still default to the current options (like debris) but I feel like it would be good to add in the ability to personalise the classification of a vessel as well as just its name. Therefore people could reclassify things to \u0022spaceplane\u0022 or \u0022decommissioned vessel\u0022 or similar without having to ask for a new classification for each one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, another useful feature along the same train of thought would be a search function in the tracking station that can search either by name or by vessel classification. I know you can narrow down what you see already, but for people who have a lot of flights at once it would be useful to be able to be more specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aperture Science Employee","CreatedById":157190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-28T17:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know why SQUAD hasn\u0027t implemented this yet, it solves this issue for everyone!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T00:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple answers are often best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple for us I mean, maybe not so simple for squad.
