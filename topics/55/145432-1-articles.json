Well, I played it for an hour and was totally disapointed.... So I dropped the idea of buying it. It\u0027s only yesterday, after seeing some nice conversations on a Skype group I\u0027m in, that it somehow woke me up and that I decided \u00A0to give it a try again. Went Youtube, read a little about it, took a look at the reviews etc etc. I decided to go forit and bought it on Steam. And I have to say I don\u0027t regret a cent I invested into that game!

sluggish.\u00A0 I\u0027m sure they don\u0027t want to update it to 1.1, it\u0027s kinda the worst version we\u0027ve seen because they changed the entire game engine and now they have to clean it

If we\u0027re talking a year or more, the demo has probably already seen a major overhaul since then. If it\u0027s more recent, I guess it\u0027s also possible that you got an outdated demo version from somewhere. On the other hand, maybe you\u0027re right - I haven\u0027t played the KSP demo since 2013! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyhow, you\u0027re among fellows here in that we all love KSP too.

I feel the demo would fair better if updated to 1.1, as all the frequent bugs are experienced outside of standard rocket building (especially beyond the features of the demo).
