I\u0027m thinking something around 2 or 3 minutes at most (skippable, of course) where Jeb shows the player the ropes by giving a tour of the Astronaut Complex (where lessons are being taught on proper technique for getting into space), the SPH and runway, the VAB and launchpad, the tracking station, the R\u0026amp;D department, mission control, and any other new facilities the game integrates later in development. It could be done with no intelligible dialogue (or on-screen text explaining anything), which is quite a plus since that\u0027s pretty much what we\u0027ve come to expect from official KSP trailer videos anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A simple opening sequence like that could easily serve many purposes, including introducing new players to the core mechanics behind getting started with the game, giving some understanding of the theming of the Kerbals themselves, giving perspective on how it\u0027s not a big deal if you screw up early on, and letting the player get an idea of what every building is for and where those buildings are located before they\u0027ve even been deposited at the Space Center. Just something to think about, and I would be entirely unsurprised if SQUAD has already given the idea of a sequence like this serious thought already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
