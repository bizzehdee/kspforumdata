It pains me to see supersonic craft with swept wings...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea on how to balance the lift/drag ration, but I think that the ship should be much more resistant to aerodynamic forces than it is in FAR: possibly, even removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd stalling... *almost* removed. Again, we are not shooting for a proper flight simulator, just for a model that is accessible to everyone while being somewhat realistic.

He was concerned that old/broken features that need updating will be difficult for veteran players to accept changes in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, like I have said before, I have no problem with the FAR aerodynamic model becoming stock. I played through career mode once with stock aero, then got FAR and never looked back. Why are people so against FAR-like aero in stock? It works intuitively, unlike the current model. I actually found it easier to pick up than the stock model. Of course, I went in understanding aerodynamics a bit in the first place, so my case may be different from others. Of course, even then I have to figure out how to deal with mach effects and, more recently, high dynamic pressure (That particular bit of physics where your planes will spontaneously fall apart I wouldn\u0027t mind being left out of stock aero). To deal with people who are new to KSP and know nothing about aerodynamic physics, I would recommend adding a setting in the menu to change between advanced, FAR-like aero, and simplified, easier to work with aero (though still somewhat realistic. Have things like no/lessened mach effects and more forgiving stalls). The two systems should be similar enough to where any craft designed in advanced mode should be reverse compatible with simplified mode, just to avoid confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-28T13:09:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo put it simply: People want either broken old features to remain for the sake of nostalgia or a very cloudy \u0022the same functionality of XYZ mod, but not the mod itself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
