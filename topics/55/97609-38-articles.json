Sorting through reports becomes a mammoth task when the overwhelming majority of them are of extremely low quality. The amount of extra overhead this causes ends up having a worse effect that just staying with our core group of really experienced, super efficient QA Crew. Branch testing for QA started as soon as it was possible, and has gone on since. Add to that the fact that we\u0027re effectively scheduling the longest experimentals period in the history of our game, and we can be reasonably certain that most major things will be caught by then.\u003Cp\u003EHappy to answer!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I ask how many of your \u0027Group of really experienced testers\u0027 have hugely expensive rigs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WuphonsReach","CreatedById":130759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T22:49:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Maxmaps\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs we\u0027ve said before, we have met the criteria we originally designed as 1.0, there no incredible desire as much as us being responsible.
