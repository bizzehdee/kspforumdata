(Or some other dwarf planet if Eeloo is relocated.) Pluto and Charon are two binary dwarfs, orbiting each other. Leaving it out but leaving in a Pluto just isn\u0027t right.

We\u0027ve already got a Ceres analogue (which Squad may need to update after the NASA encounter). We also need analogues for Vesta and at least some of the big \u0022flying mountain\u0022 asteroids. There are a lot of opportunities for interesting places to visit. There are a variety of irregular \u0022potato\u0022 shaped bodies. There are contact pairs. Some of the bigger asteroids have been found to have smaller asteroids orbiting them! There wouldn\u0027t be any harm in allowing players with a sufficiently upgraded tracking station to be able to detect moveable ARM asteroids in the main belt. This would allow players to clutter their asteroid belt with lots of smaller bodies if they wish to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool currently offers gravity assists to an outer solar system that doesn\u0027t exist. We need analogues for all four gas giants. Jool and GP2 aren\u0027t enough. The real gas giants have very complex systems of moons and captured asteroids. They also have large numbers of \u0022Trojan\u0022 asteroids orbiting their L4 and L5 Lagrange points. KSP doesn\u0027t support Lagrange points (they\u0027re on the what not to suggest list), but it could support Trojans. Placing a single Trojan at each planet\u0027s L4 and L5 points would offer an easy way to simulate some of the Lagrange points by the back door without messing around with physics. Instead of orbiting the Lagrange point, orbit the Trojan instead! Additional smaller Trojan asteroids could be added as \u0022moons\u0022 of the main asteroid at each point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe need a Kuiper belt for end-gamers to explore. The Pluto/Charon system is by no means the only example of a Kuiper belt dwarf system, and that shouldn\u0027t be the case for the Kerbol system either. Some have eccentric orbits that take them far away from the Sun towards the edge of the Oort Cloud. The Kuiper Belt has the additional advantage of a shorter development time, since it is already being spelt with a K anyway, negating the need to invent a new name of it! (For the record, as far as Pluto/Charon is concerned, I voted for Cerberus (Mass Effect 2), not Vulcan, but we ended up with Kerberos. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E There wasn\u0027t even an option to vote for Kerberos! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E I\u0027m not sure what the Illusive Man would have thought about that! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E BTW, there\u0027s been a recent movement to have Neil deGrasse Tyson declared as the IRL Illusive Man!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we have the Oort cloud. The IRL Oort cloud extends roughly half way between here and Alpha Centauri. Obviously, anything beyond that belongs to Alpha Centauri\u0027s gravitational SOI, not ours!
