That\u0027s not to say that you can\u0027t use them, just they are clearly not intended for that purpose. The good thing is that the stock game should now have the internal gubbins to support cargo bay doors. So, in theory, it should now be \u0022easy\u0022 to add random cargo bay type parts, in a very resource-light and supportable fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not 100% certain, but I think that rocket fairings (fairings are usually the way you do that type of thing on expendable rockets) were always a \u0022probably will do\u0022 thing for Squad, just not a priority in the past. With the game moving from alpha to beta, I\u0027d guess that we\u0027ll start to see many such things start to appear over the next few releases (the skeleton and critical organs are now more or less complete, now is the time for the random missing flesh to be added to the bones, or at least that\u0027s how I interpret what they have said recently).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, \u0022Procedural Fairings\u0022 is a cool little mod that may well give you what you want. B9 has 3.75m cargo bay parts (HL series), and there\u0027s various others out there (possibly some in KW, not sure offhand).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T04:42:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei run proc fairings for sure, but, thats more for a: strap this payload to the nose\u0022 kinda thing.

Obviously the normal use of that will both split the rocket in half and reveal a payload, so not a cargo bay, but an alternative that\u0027s useful sometimes (e.g. Apollo did that type of thing for the lunar module).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Higgs","CreatedById":121852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T06:11:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EId not considered that.
