For some short-term missions I could use just a battery, no solar panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a mixture of batteries and capacitors, you should get two energy bars in the ship\u0027s fuel gauge, one for the batteries and one for the capacitors. You can watch the capacitor bar gradually recharge even without an energy source if you have batteries draining their power to recharge the capacitors-which they would do automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put up a sketch for batteries and capacitors in the OP, and I used 1 charge per minute as 1 volt. Guys, feel free to let me know how much power you think is actually represented by these energy units, because I have no idea. 1 volt for 1/min seems way off, but for now it makes a good stand-in. Also, it makes the 2xAAA pack into a 3-volt while the larger battery is a 9-volt, and that makes them similar to the batteries we have at home. I changed the naming convention for batteries away from the charge storage to instead reflect their power output. Using voltage instead of units per second makes a more easily digestible value for the end user. This way they know that a 45-volt unit requires either five 9-volt batteries or nine 5-volt batteries to run non-stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-17T02:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2014 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T03:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EVoltage costs of currently existing parts, for those who are interested:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall probe core: 1.7 volts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25m or 2.5m probe core: 3 volts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInline Advanced Stabilizer: 27 volts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced S.A.S.
