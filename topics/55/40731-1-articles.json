There are bound to be changes, reimaginings, and so on, due to ongoing developments and how having an economy will impact the usefulness of different parts. For instance, tweakables - the Next Big Thing of a sort, in regards to \u0022under the hood\u0022 developments - will likely remove the need to have a separate \u0022drogue\u0022 and \u0022normal\u0022 chutes. You\u0027ll be able to set the deployment/cutoff heights of parachutes you attach, manually setting them to work as \u0022drogue\u0022 chutes. It\u0027s also the reason nobody works on the existing spaceplane parts - everybody knows that they are going to be completely overhauled when spaceplanes next become the focus. In the meantime, everybody is free to use mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
