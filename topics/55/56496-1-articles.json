As it weighs more and has no benefit, but wouldn\u0027t it be kinda cool if this had the new/current SAS handling and they were to nerf the others and the command pod torque even more so? Just different handling, jerkier or more responsive on either end of the spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note on similar parts not having enough of a difference, wouldn\u0027t it be cool if with the antenna, you were actually capable of gaining more \u0022Science\u0022 if you use something better to send the information with, so the differences in antenna would be more noticed than just send speeds/power usage, because in the end with that, people avoid the 88-88 because it uses too much power to send things a little quicker. Unless you\u0027re using Antenna Range or Remote Tech2 or some such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to just finish off this rant that seems to segway wherever, is there any word on \u0022stats\u0022 being visible in KSP? You know, so when you\u0027er building things in the VAB/SPH you can see your fuel/weight/TWR ratio, maybe some dV calculator for each stage and over all? Same for in flight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Current Ap/Pe so you don\u0027t need to flick back and forth to the map, or even just IVA stats like some mods seem to provide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime to impact, air pressure, G force (So you know if you need to thrust down for when you for some reason make things with a higher than 2-3TWR and they take a bit of a beating), air pressure for space planes and all that jazz. Would just be sweet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, to be extra annoying. Is there any actual reason Squad won\u0027t be doing achievements for steam or even actual in game achievements, that maybe reward science like a particular mod? Hitting a certain height, docking, launching however ships, landing succesfulling 5-10-15 times or whatever, all that sort of stuff would just be kinda cool \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E As well as some form of manifest that has a \u0022log\u0022 (For your Career history) and as you fly, you can log information (Just basic, where you are in what ship etc) so then well after that flight is done, 15 launches down the road, you can still have a look at who went up in what to where (That you marked, so multi destinations would be possible) and what Science they collected, or if things didn\u0027t go as well, where and when they died, G force, top speeds and distance travelled, so just the end flight report but like recorded with a few extra doobies. Anywho, sorrt to rant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is not to be construed as complaining as this game is most definitely one of the greatest games I\u0027ve ever played, up there with Zelda. Constantly amazed at what new ideas it inspires, how certain things learnt in the game can be taken into the real world (to establish an orbit, or interplanetary transfer, to get more out of it without putting too much in, don\u0027t fight things, let it flow and gravity turn/align a litho break, let the enviroment/forces work in your favor by dancing with them and not fighting too hard, just a little, but this doesn\u0027t only apply to using energy in space even if that\u0027s all we ever will essentially do), how every new bit of information about what\u0027s coming is just incredible, especially how they have implemented Science and are deciding to nerf it a little, while at the same time, letting you move info around, so you could send a rover somewhere, gather butt tons of info, have a kerbal come by, pick it up and fly back it it, seems pretty awesome and would actually get people more inclined to want to land and return (Maybe in something super light without Science gear) next to a small base/rover that has already gathered heaps of science, allowing designs for missions to be very different. Pretty excited, so much so that I\u0027m still up at 3AM in AUS waiting for .23 Waiting for a game about space as the sun will begin to come up soon and this planetary rotation doesn\u0027t in real life, to nudge me to stop waiting for this virtual world to grow doesn\u0027t work... Must play... Must wait. Need RAPIER engines, plus kinda waiting to see if this will crash all saves, kinda hoping it does a little, seems like it should just based on the whole Science re-work, atleast game crashing for your Career modes, but idk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/end massive rant\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joel Dryden","CreatedById":76304,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:11:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, those suggestions I know are all covered by a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just wondering if I\u0027m going to have to rely on Kerbal Engineer to know certain stats, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe handling differences are going to be in remote tech to a degree (lagged control for distances) which is sweet, but something like that to make it handle more like it did when the Kracken would get you with the lesser SAS control and then like a bullet/bird with the other, would be wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just honestly curious about achievements/any form of acknowledgement of what\u0027s done besides repeated texts for experiments until it becomes useless \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe some tracker that just say\u0027s where you are, so when you\u0027re landed it could change to say that, maybe even the biome as well, just all that jazz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould actually be nice to know what biome you\u0027re in/over without having to perform an experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d rather have a simplified version of RemoteTech 2 or a more advanced version of AntennaRanges as stock, because if you make some communication parts get your more science than it will almost always be the one that gets chosen over the other. And the antennas are not that large that their mass differences require completely different spacecraft/launchers. A system where antennas have ranges and antennas can act as relays (without all the advanced stuff of RT2, like line-of-sight) would allow for much more choice. You can design a lander around a big antenna, or you can have a separate orbiter carrying the big antenna and a lander with a small antenna relaying through the big one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joel Dryden","CreatedById":76304,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T16:59:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027d be pretty sweet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If that\u0027s what you\u0027re after without the line of sight \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-22-AntennaRange-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/56440-0-22-AntennaRange-Enforce-and-Encourage-Antenna-Diversity\u003C/a\u003E There is this, doesn\u0027t add antenna but puts a range on the current ones, which works pretty well, but they don\u0027t link up to makes grids, etc in the same way as Remote Tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that would be a fun stock thing, my main thing really is just stats, I don\u0027t want to have to check the map everytime and then mouse over to see my Ap and Pe, to know if something has more than a 1TWR or not, although you can simply try launch and it won\u0027t go up if it\u0027s lower than 1 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But being able to know things like that prior, or it\u0027s over all dV really seems like something that would\u0027ve already been stock, pretty sure the mod just access information that is already in the game engine, so it seems reasonable that it could happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso good point, maybe making massive weight changes, etc would be good, so you could have a heavy sat in orbit while a small rover is down there with a short range like antenna to send the info into the relay and back to Kearth, or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
