For example.,User Installs two Thrusters on a component. He does not want those particular thrusters to burn. Currently you have to manually select each of the thrusters individually to toggle their settings. In my opinion it should be symmetrical as most symmetrical subsystems are keyed to a single action even (Turning on of off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESailor Zen\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T00:28:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to Suggestions and Development Discussion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-03T00:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, sometimes it would be nice to click on something placed symmetrically and have the action be executed by all parts.
