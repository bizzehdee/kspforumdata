Not a lighting designer by trade, but I do have some experience designing/hanging lights and running a light board. I have to say, KSP\u0027s lighting system is...surprisingly good (save for dawn on some surfaces being way too dark, but that involves programming atmospheric light distribution, and isn\u0027treally the scope of this discussion). Mostly, I\u0027m referring to the various light modules, particularly the ones in stock, the Illuminators Mk I and II.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that with career mode asking me to do so, I\u0027m building more bases and stations, and lighting them first went from, \u0022Can I see it in the dark of space or on the dark side of the Mun/planet it\u0027s orbiting for docking procedures? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E to \u0022Okay, I slapped a few lights and glowy things on. :blush:\u0022 to \u0022OH MY GOD WHY IS IT BLINDING MAKE IT STOP :confused:\u0022 and, now I\u0027m realizing that the lighting system is actually a lot more intuitive, and I\u0027m using my theater background a bit better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, I have an off-set topside docking port on one of my ground bases for a \u0022hopper\u0022 style reusable lander to dock. There are mounting areas on the modules surrounding it that make great lighting positions where I can utilize key, fill, and back lighting. By altering the action groups slightly, I can have the base lights run on a separate hotkey from \u0022docking mode\u0022 where the clampotron rises out of its fairing, is lit by lights specifically designed to light it, and all the other base lights are killed save for maybe a few running lights on its perimeter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this sounds cosmetic, and it\u0027s certainly not rocket science (though it is lighting theory, which is pretty darn close), I\u0027ve run some test designs during Kerbin night, and it actually works really good. The difference between all lights at 1.0 and key at 0.75, a blue fill at B somewhere around 0.5, and a backlight also at about half, is, for one, really cool, and two, of marginal use, but helpful nonetheless. And since the function exists, why not spend hours perfecting it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, right now, in order to best test the lights, I have to time warp to Kerbin night, focus the lights in the SPH/VAB, go out, test them, revert back to the construction phase, and refocus from there, only vaguely able to see the difference until I\u0027m back out and unable to move them again. Any lighting designer will tell you that lighting focus is best done in the dark, and while I\u0027m not saying the SPH/VAB should have an entirely dark (0 ambient light whatsoever) setting, something just above that would be really nice, if just to see the effects of different lighting plots/arrangements on a craft, station, or base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that were to happen, I\u0027d love to do a tutorial either in slideshow or Youtube format on how to best utilize the lighting options to help players get the looks on their stations/crafts that they\u0027re going for. It\u0027s not that this is currently impossible\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACthere\u0027s just a step in the middle of streamlining the process that could, I think, be eliminated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, please, think of the station lighting. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/d8PahDp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022d8PahDp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Aaaaalso, just saying, stock RGB options for modules with running lights (i.e. Mk II cockpit/crew modules, but also maybe cupola module and science lab if you ever give those running lights) would be just \u003Cem\u003Efantasic\u003C/em\u003E.
