Maybe with RTGs slowly putting out less and less power over the years and maybe (not sure what would happen in the nuclear engines case so please give other suggestions if this is wrong) the NERVA could get less efficient? (It would get an efficiently and atmosphere Isp boost).

But it might warrant attention in the future if more planets are introduced. Just like the semi-major axis of Earth is the basis for the Astronomical Unit (AU), the distance of Kerbin can also be used for a Astronamical Unit of its own. The solar system of KSP is scaled in pretty much the same way as that of real-life. Mars is 1.5 Earth AU, Duna 1.5 Kerbin AU, Jupiter 5 Earth AU, Jool 5 Kerbin AU, etc. The only outlier is Eeloo. That Pluto analog is only 6 Kerbin AU from Kerbol, while Pluto is 39 AU from the Sun. If the Kerbol system is expanded I imagine, we\u0027ll see Eeloo move as well. If Eeloo were positioned at the same relative distance as Pluto is IRL, it\u0027d take on average 49 years to get there. Then the half-life of the RTG suddenly has an impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor nuclear thermal rockets there is no reason to model half-life decay. Nuclear reactors use Uranium-235, which has a half-life of hundreds of millions of years, compared to 87.7 years for Plutonium-238 (which is used in RTGs). What nuclear reactors like those in a nuclear thermal rocket do have is a fuel cycle. Nuclear fuel in a reactor gets irradiated, determined by its use (want a lot of power, the nuclear fuel gets irradiated more quickly and vice versa). After a while the fuel gets so irradiated that it\u0027s no longer usable to get a nuclear reaction. This you could quite easily simulate in KSP already, by having nuclear thermal rockets use a NuclearFuel resource. After a few missions it\u0027d run out. You could use that as a way to put a limit on the life of nuclear-powered space tugs, or through adding something like mining mining you could replenish your NuclearFuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T14:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think keeping the old RTG as an infinite trickle-charger is a nice game-friendly feature.

I\u0027m not sure whether I\u0027d enjoy having around another line of tanks; but if you went that far, you could also declare them to hold hydrogen. Then again, that could cause trouble with the planned ISRU -- making hydrogen is much easier than synthesizing hydrocarbons. I\u0027m not even going into the option of having both Kerosene and Hydrogen fuel -- I don\u0027t think that would ever happen.
