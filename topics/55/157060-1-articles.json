What would be ideal are even more advanced settings than the ones we have now. So this is how I\u0027d imagine it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery element of the game that generates or consumes the aforementioned \u0022resources\u0022 would be toggled in the settings. You go into the settings and see:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuildings -\u0026gt; upgrade with: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTech tree -\u0026gt; unlock with: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScience experiments -\u0026gt; generate: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nContracts -\u0026gt; reward: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVessels -\u0026gt; cost: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbals -\u0026gt; cost: money/reputation/science\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd so on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe X/Y/Z elements represent the options that can be enabled or disabled. That way we would have the classic career and science mode as\u00A0the presets and everyone who hates (like me) one or more elements of certain mode would be able to disable them. It would also be an opportunity to experiment a bit. For example, someone who would want to upgrade the buildings with science and reputation and launch rockets by paying reputation (or other crazy things like that) could freely do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[OPINION] Maybe it would be a good idea if SQUAD also pre-released this mode creator to us (the community) before it gets fully implemented in order to find these sweet spots of easy/medium/hard difficulties for every possible preset. Maybe. I mean, they have their test team but asking the community to find the balance of all these things would make the time needed to develop it much shorter. People would just create their custom game modes, others would try them out, vote for which ones feel the best and most fun and then the test team would pick these and improve them even more. It could even be in a form of competition (just like the company flags things) and people with the most votes would win something. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a good idea, but I feel like the game could benefit from\u00A0this.

Since there are three resources that can be toggled on/off then what\u0027s the point of having them all if one can do just as well? BUT if you want to keep the current game modes as presets then it needs to stay. I know it doesn\u0027t make much sense, but since the devs aren\u0027t willing to redo the career mode from the scratch then at least this (I\u0027m not saying mine because I\u0027m not the only one with this concept in mind) way we could make the career more enjoyable and just mod the rest in. I haven\u0027t seen a single mod that gets rid of science points and uses money for unlocking the tree. It has to be bypassed by many mods working together but it\u0027s worth the effort IMO (the proof is in my signature).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-27T23:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2017 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T13:56:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that the hooks already in place are never going to be changed, and we\u0027re never going to see a better campaign system, this seems like a good idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-01T14:58:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222969425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488208991\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002239636\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/27/2017 at 9:23 AM, Veeltch said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery element of the game that generates or consumes the aforementioned \u0022resources\u0022 would be toggled in the settings.
