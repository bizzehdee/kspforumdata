I think it could be pretty easily implemented into the game. You have an inflatable mobile \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E that has energy, cooling,\u00A0comms and personnel\u00A0requirements (the more engineers you have on site the faster you can build things, and the more scientists you have present the faster you can upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E), and you can put a limited number of these in the solar system (to not go overboard).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou start out with a small \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with basic printers that can manufacture things like simple solar panels, monoprop tanks, shortrange comms etc. As you upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E (with money and resources), the structure gets bigger and faster and you\u0027re able to build larger fuel tanks, drone cores and engines. Up to a limit, though. Kerbin is still the primary launch site, so the most complex parts will still have to come from there.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe same way you extract fuels from ore you now extract carbon compounds (for stuff that need polymers)\u00A0and metals from the ore, and they are put in separate holding tanks on your mining vessel after extraction. These two new resources are used when building components and upgrading your mobile \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s important where you put your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. You can either put it down on the ground of the planet/moon where it is close to the resources, but you will have to build a simple launch pad and won\u0027t be able to build some of the heavier stuff, or you can put it in orbit, where it\u0027s easier to assemble heavier stuff, but harder to reach resources. Manually transporting resources to orbit would get tedious very fast, so an easy way to prevent this would be to establish a logistics link to the miner on the surface: basically, you put a mining vessel on the ground, mine for resources, get it back into orbit a couple of times and then the game gives you a stream of\u00A0resources automatically (to prevent glitches, problems etc the mining vessel would remain on the ground but you\u0027d still get resources as if you did every run yourself). To balance things out the inflow of resources to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E in orbit (even with several mining vessels) would be noticeably lower than to a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E on the ground.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA couple of other things that a mobile \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E could do but wouldn\u0027t be a priority in my opinion: parking an existing vessel near it in order to reposition components, add new stuff, or cannibalize them for resources.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a developer, so I don\u0027t know how much work would go into implementing these changes into the game, but the new stuff would be an inflatable dome/bubble that when deflated\u00A0can be shipped to its destination on a regular rocket, a smaller and reskinned version of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E when going to the construction screen, one or two reskinned ore containers for the new resources, and a link (visible in the tracking station)\u00A0between your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and mining vessel.
