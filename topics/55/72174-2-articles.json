IMHO, so many add-ons drew to the game so much attention of general public of players that it made possible further continuation (and not the least from the financial point of view) of KSP. In the mood of old russian saying which i put on title of my reply: IMHO all the improvements to the game might had been not possible not because squad developers are unable to master them, but because to develop, test and implement all possible ideas, that already done by 3rd parties, entire lifetime of limited number of squad team wont be enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, squad might just buy the code of desired ad-ons into official KSP just to save their and our time (though they don\u0027t have to).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T03:36:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vasya pupkin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duxwing","CreatedById":42282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:03:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tntristan12\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tntristan12\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EARM did a few things under the hood that I really admire.

Perhaps if they had integrated the ARM concept itself better into the current science implementation I\u0027d be more forgiving, but as it stands asteroid collections serves no purpose with respect to features already implemented.

This is because it was talked about so much, I wasn\u0027t here at the point but from what I\u0027ve seen it might be the single most requested feature. Multiplayer was announced a few months ago now, people know it\u0027s coming, so why would they put it on their wish list? Unless that is you are talking about before it was announced. The same goes for resources, it was in the works for quite a while, when I joined up if I hadn\u0027t read the wiki or WNTSL I would never of known about it. But when it was announced it wasn\u0027t happening at this point in time the forums exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, for the sake of argument I will concede that resources are more popular than multiplayer. Then my argument goes to it\u0027s the devs game, yes it\u0027s not a smart idea to do that, but if the devs don\u0027t enjoy what they are working on then the quality will suffer. The feature won\u0027t get fleshed out as much as other features and would be degraded due to that. I won\u0027t (too late now) bring up the EULA though, as I see it as a cop out in this perticular situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know starting off you argument of why a point is true by saying \u0022because said point is true\u0022 is not a good thing to do (though I might of misunderstood your wording), again no anger or hate, just trying to prevent some annoyance in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regards to your added part there I am curious as to how it would work myself, though not knowing how it would work is hardly an argument against it.
