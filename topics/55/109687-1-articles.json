Mature replies only please....\n\nI was experiencing a lot of crashing myself under OS X (fortunately fixed by turning down the texture quality), so until recently I would have agreed. Not being able to play with full graphics settings is unfortunate but is a long way from being a gamebreaker for me.\n\nI would actually flip that statement on its head and argue that the seeming lack of outrage so far (and I\u0027ve personally never known a gaming community of any stripe that was shy about complaining about bugs and crashes), suggests that the game is stable enough for most players. It\u0027s not exactly representative, but taking the Steam reviews for example, I\u0027m seeing 21,265 positive reviews to 385 negative ones. From a quick skim of a couple of pages of negative reviews, there are quite a few complaints about bugs, together with a mix of others including a number of variations on the theme of \u0027this game is too hard\u0027 or \u00271.0 is less fun than 0.9\u0027. It\u0027s also difficult to tell whether \u0027bugs\u0027 on a Steam review are serious game-crashing bugs, minor annoyances, or intended features that aren\u0027t working as the reviewer expected. So even out of those 385 negative reviews, it\u0027s unclear how many are due to game instability.\n\nSo, OP has my sympathy and I hope whatever is causing the crashes gets fixed soon, but I don\u0027t think Squad were jumping the gun on 1.0."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T19:24:10Z","Content":"Same thing is happening to me, and at least a couple other people.

It\u0027s just from a bug /technical point of view, it\u0027s a poor release for being 1.0 and out of beta.
