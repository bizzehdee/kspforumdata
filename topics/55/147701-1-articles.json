Big ideas and big gambles come with space flight and rocketry. \u00A0KSP with its tongue in cheek nods to the loss of astronauts in mishaps, existing references to Pendant war criminals, potential to leave heroic kerbonauts stranded far from their home planet introduce kids and adults to these big ideas. \u00A0This can be done without having a mature rated game. \u00A0It just takes some good artists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs an aside, I just wound up on the other side of earth having used satellite navigation and laser accelerometers.
