The long fuselage are as long as one FL-T800 fuel tank and have twice the internal volume, but only carries as much fuel as one FL-T800 tank. Doubling the fuel in each Mk2 fuel tank would easily solve your issues of not having enough fuels (which is only a problem with SSTOs surely, as jet planes are so efficient they can fly around the planet on a single tank).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
