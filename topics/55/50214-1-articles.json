More than just unlocking parts and providing humorous blurbs of text, the results of science experiments and measurements on other worlds should provide functional knowledge about those worlds. It would be neat to start the career in a state of ignorance about the Kerbol system and then acquire knowledge about \u0027what\u0027s out there\u0027 through missions and experiments. In essence, this would be real \u0027exploration\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have to admit that when I started the game, I was a little disappointed to be able to pan around, zoomed out, in the map view, and focus on and examine the planets and their moons. I could see their basic appearance, get a sense of whether they had an atmosphere, and make decisions about which ones I wanted to land on. This was all by just paning around. On this basis, I discovered a terrestrial moon that became a priority for a manned visit. I feel that this access to knowledge about the Kerbol system was too free. We should have to earn it through science and missions. Perhaps this could be a \u0027Hard Mode\u0027 or \u0027Kerbel Prize mode\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can imagine a starting situation where we have basic astronomical knowledge: we know the orbits of the major bodies in the solar system. But we don\u0027t know much about them except perhaps, the class (e.g. planet vs. gas giant). We then do missions to discover the moons and the particulars of the individual planets. Importantly, to see them, and to learn about them, you must go there. Information that I can envision being hidden initially and revealed through missions might include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) atmosphere profile: whether or not there is an atmosphere, and it must be profiled by a descent probe. There would be a corresponding density graph to look at and use to plan future entries, fly-bys, gravity assists, aerobraking maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E existence of moons; while perhaps a bit unrealistic because they can be found through astronomy, I would like to discover moons by visiting the main bodies. Along those lines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec) precise orbits of smaller objects. It would be neat if we didn\u0027t know the orbits exactly, and had to guess a bit and correct on the fly. The gravity meter might be used to determine the exact mass of the main body, and the moon, thus refining the player\u0027s understanding/model of their orbits. To take this further, the orbits could be defined as bands (e.g. confidence intervals) - a band that we know the body will pass through; The width of that band gets thinner as you know more about it. That way there would have to be some careful guessing/calculating to make safe orbits; this would be especially interesting if you don\u0027t know atmosphere composition. Uncertainty would be cool!!! Remember that it doesn\u0027t have be uncertainty in the underlying model, but rather just uncertainty portrayed to the player.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ed) restricted vision: focusing on, and zooming in and out of planetary bodies allows you to inspect their surface. I think surface inspection should have to be done by hand. Either have probes that orbit the bodies allowing you to inspect them in real time, or even better: take photographs that you can review. Imagine you are orbiting focused on a satellite, and you spot a feature of interest, you roll and photograph it and it tags the position and gives you a still shot that you can review. You can then make decisions about where to send a lander. I don\u0027t like being able to examine the surface at leisure in god\u0027s-eye-view and pick a landing spot. Similarly, when landed, I don\u0027t like being able to zoom out to half the planet\u0027s width and inspect the surface features in that zoomed out way. To look over that next ridge, I should have to go there (or fly over it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee) physical characteristics of the bodies; material composition, magnetism, volcanism, etc. (I know this might be geeking too hard).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease suggest any other knowledge that you think could be initially hidden and then revealed through science! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could imagine a Kerbolpedia that would be filled in as you accumulate knowledge in Career!
