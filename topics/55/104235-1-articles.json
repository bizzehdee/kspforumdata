Couldn\u0027t find anything through searches or the do not discuss list.\n\nQuite simply, I\u0027d like a way to essentially record the game data so that it can be played back, manipulated (speed) and viewed from various angles. This provides far superior tools to work with when creating videos as opposed to just recording as it happens.\n\nRather than pre-define a few different camera angles, give the user the ability to place the camera where they want, allowing them to zoom as required, and most importantly include an option to track the spacecraft\u0027s center of mass and automatically zoom based on distance. This would allow us to replicate most standard broadcast cameras.\n\nObviously I wouldn\u0027t expect this to be anything more than a low priority addition, but something I would like to see nonetheless."},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T08:01:59Z","Content":"Wouldn\u0027t that mean massive amounts of data, for large or multiple crafts?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobe","CreatedById":95803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T05:32:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wouldn\u0027t that mean massive amounts of data, for large or multiple crafts?\n\nPerhaps?
