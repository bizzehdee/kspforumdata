One of my main gripes/problems is the fact that for the wheel model to look right against the ground, the entire part also has to be. This either means wing mounting the landing gear or having your flying machine on landings be like as unstable as a standing up pencil, assuming you are working with mk1 parts and have your landing gear in the fuselage. IRL, planes can have landing gear that can extend also outwards from the craft to some degree increasing landing stability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExamples\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022F-18_F_Super_Hornet_01.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022https://images.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1\u0026amp;image_host=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/F-18_F_Super_Hornet_01.jpg\u0026amp;u=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/F-18_F_Super_Hornet_01.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee how the landing rear landing gear sticks out to the side a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221858325.jpg?v=v40\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://cdn-www.airliners.net/photos/airliners/5/2/3/1858325.jpg?v=v40\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso here.

Why not make landing gear that can be retracted and act in a similar manner to the ones above, also moving to the side? This would certainly help in making smaller craft more stable upon landing and takeoff, and who knows, may have other uses (Stock elevator/piston kinda thing, perhaps?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore anyone mentions mods, yes, I know mods for these exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T13:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter there are exactly as many KSP landing legs as wheels, they could look into this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T15:36:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Adjustable Landing Gear, (now it\u0027s included in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155056-130-kerbal-foundries-continued-tracks-wheels-and-gear-03-05-17/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Foundries Mod\u003C/a\u003E) you are able to angle you wheel outside the base, So the wheelstrut itself is not angled, but the whole wheel is angled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022v47suUX.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v47suUX.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u00225c36efd2bb15e712eaeb9441c6e5ea58.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.gyazo.com/5c36efd2bb15e712eaeb9441c6e5ea58.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s not what you meant isn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T17:23:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223092479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022162109\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221497540970\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165712\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DrLicor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, DrLicor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith Adjustable Landing Gear, (now it\u0027s included in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155056-130-kerbal-foundries-continued-tracks-wheels-and-gear-03-05-17/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EKerbal Foundries Mod\u003C/a\u003E) you are able to angle you wheel outside the base, So the wheelstrut itself is not angled, but the whole wheel is angled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s not what you meant isn\u0027t it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee disclaimer at the end of the post.
