The rag doll stuff has to go. It gets ridiculous fast. Or at least as a kerbal levels up make it so they don\u0027t fall as easily. Seriously it\u0027s funny the first few times, but it gets old quick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes Kerbals should be able to stand on slowly moving platforms without bugging out. Honestly imo the kerbals themselves are one of the most underappreciated asset in the game. They got females and a new suit...
