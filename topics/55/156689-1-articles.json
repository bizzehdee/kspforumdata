I thought I could grab the Kraken\u0027s eye and bring it back to Kerbin, only to discover that Easter eggs are not movable. They seem to be part of the terrain. I think it would be cool if there were a special class of Easter eggs that one could move around and collect. Maybe something in the lines of a vessel that does not show up on any maps or the control center. Sort of like souvenirs or trophies you can put in your very own Kerbal museum. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StubbornJeb","CreatedById":175092,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-19T15:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah,me too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brent Kerman","CreatedById":167451,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-22T13:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere already is this.
