Either the experimental team failed to notice obvious bugs or you rushed 1.0 out the door. Either one shows that there needs to be a big change in how these versions are handled.\n\nSquadcast seemed to hint that 1.1 will feature the long awaited KSP in Unity 5. If this is the case then PLEASE PLEASE do not rush it! If a Unity 5 bug itself is preventing a bugfix. Wait it out! Do multiplayer work or something to pass the time instead of pushing 1.1 out and blaming Unity for everything.\n\nTest.

Let\u0027s see... There were the open-to-the-public experimentals for 0.15 that swiftly resulted in SQUAD recruiting an actual testing team instead of letting the community as a whole test the game. There was quite a bit of upset about the delay between 0.18 and 0.19, particularly given how much changed between 0.17 and 0.18 versus how comparatively little changed between 0.18 and 0.19. There was quite a bit of derision thrown about when 0.23.5 came out, mostly because of the assumption that 0.24 was delayed to work on it. They survived these upsets just fine, despite quite a lot more fuss being raised at the time (especially for 0.19; I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever forget the rage I saw emerge when that version came out).

This is entirely subjective complaining and no real assistance given to the team in identifying REAL problems. So, try that yeah? Instead of being resistant to change, instead of REFUSING to accept that the problems are with YOU and YOUR Designs and blaming squad for these things, how about you post bug reports. Ya know, like one I brought up today, and that being that ore does not have an HSP (heat value) set in the resources definition config and every other resource does. Is this in intended? Is it a miss? Give REAL data for real issues. \u0022Resources suck!\u0022 is subjective and your opinion. \u0022This system is missing this, does this when I use it, crashes here, etc...\u0022 that\u0027s real feedback.

Telling a team to go faster or slower without any knowledge of their planned workload is a formula for destroying trust.\n\nThat said, I would highly recommend the Dev team consider showing a small bit of love for their dedicated OS X users in the next update. I don\u0027t even know what it is anymore - memory leak, poltergeist, Ghost of Steve Jobs, who cares. KSP is nearly unplayable for more than 10 minutes before graphics meltdown or crash to desktop. This is not a bug report - that\u0027s been done many times by many players. This a call for prioritising OS X reliability on the 1.1 agenda - take what time you need boys... I\u0027ve got a old POS linux laptop I can sputter on with in the meantime - but I love KSP so much more on my 27\u0022 retina display (TL;DR eye-gasm)."},{"CreatedByName":"a2soup","CreatedById":68260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:54:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There are more voices now, but the overall quantity of actual complaining is far lower relatively speaking.\n\nGood point, let\u0027s not lose perspective here. As someone who\u0027s been around since 0.17, a 1.0-type release with loads of awesome features with some bugs is much better than a 0.19-type release, with few new features at all. \n\n1.0 has expanded the game more than any other release. It was silly call a release with such big changes, which were bound to need tuning, the \u0022complete\u0022 1.0 version instead of another beta build (0.91) that would be released as 1.0 with the bugs worked out.
