It turns out that the new joint system causes struts to hold on to radially decoupled parts a little bit tighter. This was causing some of the SRBs to crash back into the rocket. So I just struted the SRBs to themselves (the struts are nearly invisible now, but they are still there), this way the part-count and part types remain unchanged.

I didn\u0027t get much of a decrease in performance in 0.23, so this difference will be more dramatic with weaker GPUs, but it is still quite visible. The blue and green tests are the standard, looking-up tests, while the orange and grey are the worst-case tests, with the horizon kept centered in the frame. The decrease in performance is still there in 0.23.5 (in orange), but it is almost unnoticeable for me. And in real-world cases, where I would have V-sync on and the framerate capped at 60, I would probably never see it. It is still a good idea to keep the camera pointed up while running the test though, this helps to remove a lot of GPU dependency, especially on weaker systems or laptops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ma1WARj.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ma1WARj.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoustonDave","CreatedById":102118,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-11T04:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just upgraded my system from a 7-year-old HP AMD Athlon 2.x GHz Dual Core with 3GB RAM, to the following system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntel Core i3-4330 Dual Core Processor 3.5GHz \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGigabyte H87 LGA 1150 MOBO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8GB RAM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESamsung 840 EVO SSD\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMobo graphics only, no graphics card.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalled Ubuntu and KSP stock 23.0 on it with no other software or mods.

I ran several tests on my Surface Pro 2, which has a weak enough GPU to be significantly effected by the terrain detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran six tests, three on 0.23 and three on 0.23.5, all at the same graphics settings and all with the terrain quality set to default in the settings menu. Two tests were run in the standard, looking up mode (orange and yellow). Performance here is pretty similar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next set are more interesting; after applying the ocean terrain quality tweak I launched the rocket again, this time keeping the horizon centered throughout the entire run. You can see that the 0.23.5 run clusters together with the first, looking-up, tests (green). The 0.23 run shows a significant drop in performance though (grey), only improving when the vessel gets above 160km where the terrain switches to a lower detail mode (indicated by the blue arrows).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last set are the most telling. With terrain quality set at default, and no changes made to ocean terrain settings, you can see that there is a huge drop in performance in 0.23 (brown). I was also watching CPU usage during the test (I run KSP in windowed mode) and I could see that after I was above 50 or 60km the CPU started throttling back. Normally it runs at about 50% utilization at 2.3GHz, during this test it dropped down to around 25% and the speed dropped down to around 1.5GHz. Clearly the game was GPU limited at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I tested it in 0.23.5 a completely different picture emerged (blue). Performance while keeping the horizon centered (which I\u0027ve generally found to be a worst case scenario in terms of terrain related performance) was almost the same as it was while looking up, and looks almost identical the run with the ocean terrain settings tweak. Compare the blue and green lines, most of the difference appears to be from stage timing rather than performance. If you look carefully you can see that the framerate does begin to suffer as the part count drops. In both of the horizon runs under 0.23.5 performance is capped at around 30 FPS until the vessel gets above 160km, so I still recommend looking up while running the test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless, the performance change is pretty impressive. Above a certain level of GPU power you aren\u0027t likely to notice it, but with mobile computers and older graphics cards it can be a major, and very welcome, change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Compare the brown line to the blue line; huge jump in terrain detail-limited performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bbM6sjm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022bbM6sjm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022humptydump\u0022 data-cite=\u0022humptydump\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, that is true, but there are several reasons for such a feature or mod: ...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll see what I can come up with for this.

Is it safe to allow it to run all of the time, will it affect performance, will it clash with something else? Should I rely on users to uninstall it after collecting data (a terrible idea)? Should it append results to a single file, create a new file for each run, or overwrite a single file? And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of these are really problems, I\u0027ve already come up with something that seems to work and gives results that are identical to FRAPS. I think the best, and safest, solution is to make it as restricted as possible. The way I have it setup currently will only run when you are using my CPU rocket (it relies on the craft name, so any changes will cause it not to run) and only starts once you have activated the first stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see any reason to collect any time data (game time vs. real time, fixedUpdateTime, ect...) because like you said before, it\u0027s all directly related to FPS anyway and that\u0027s the simplest method of displaying results. The framerate is the end result anyway and it\u0027s what actually affects how smooth or stuttery the game feels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin starts up in the flight scene, checks the craft name (and does nothing if it doesn\u0027t match), then starts a timer (based on the computer\u0027s clock, not Unity\u0027s) and collects the amount of frames rendered each second, outputting these to a single log file in the GameData folder (we aren\u0027t allowed to create files elsewhere). I need to test it to make sure it\u0027s working properly, gets destroyed without issues, and to see if works on multiple platforms.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
