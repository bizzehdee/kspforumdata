That\u0027s rather uneven, the step between x1 and x5 is more than twice that of the step from x5 to x10 (only times two). At higher time warps (beyond x100) steps are always x10 which is a lot and that often leads to problems, especially with current rather long transition period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest is to implement time warps in steps of x3 and x10/3, for all existing levels, i.e. x3, x10, x30, x100, x300, x1000, x3000 etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the number of arrows in the UI would grow so I suggest to use \u0022half-arrow\u0022 when x3 step is used, and \u0022full arrow\u0022 when x10 step is used. That would acutally reduce the number of arrows needed by two. In the following picture is an example how it could look for warps x3, x10, x30, and x100 respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z8Owrpw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z8Owrpw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother two nice to have things would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- key to direct jump to x1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- configurable length of warp change transition period\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T21:08:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, jumping back to 1 from high warp would have a high chance of awekening the Kraken\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T21:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree the steps between at the high end are a little to big.

However, if the devs were to change that, I think it would be best if they redesigned the interface to be more modular -- as in, show the warp speed as the actual warp speed in text instead of the arrow bar, and have a drop down menu to directly select a warp speed to go to, or something akin to that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverWarior","CreatedById":80669,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-02T18:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ejumping from very high timewarps back to x1 can indeed wreck your vessel entirely.

When you switch to a craft it\u0027s going very quickly from rails to active, and in that split-second, the craft is going from static to every component suddenly reflecting an actual velocity. Ever hear that wind noise when switching to a craft on the ground? I think that\u0027s an indicator of what\u0027s happening during the load. The ship on the ground isn\u0027t moving RELATIVE to the ground, but the planet itself is moving through space. During that moment while physics are being calculated, the ship is experiencing the sudden acceleration while relative velocities are being worked out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat also explains why solar panels left deployed are suddenly broken off when switching away from and back to the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on-topic: I agree it would be nice to have a shortcut key that just killed the time warp, just like there\u0027s one to cut the throttle. It doesn\u0027t have to be instantaneous; the game should be able to scale the warp back down safely enough to keep things intact, but it can probably do it much faster than the player mashing the \u0022\u0026lt;\u0022 key.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
