Rather than only 0% and 100% as wheel powers, make some kind of throttled speed control. It could be an additional throttle, or just have the wheel power ramp up as the key is held down longer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Variable braking. Have brake pressure increase the longer the button is held down, rather than being on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Variable steering. Like the previous two items, this is either straight or hard left/right, which makes it impossible to safely steer at speed without reaction wheels (i.e. it\u0027s better to tap the rotate button than try to steer the wheels). Steering more in a given direction with a longer key press is an option, as is making it persistent with a new key to center the wheels (i.e. steering works more like a throttle from left to right, with a shortcut to go completely straight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Bearing friction. Right now, wheels spin completely freely with zero friction, which leads to absurd speeds going downhill (I recently got up to \u0026gt;53m/s on Minmus). Make rover wheels more like Earthly EV wheels - when not actively applying power, they use regenerative braking (and yes, that should recharge batteries a bit). Doing this makes a better case for having a dedicated wheel throttle instead of a gradual increase on keypress, since you\u0027d need to have constant throttle to even go downhill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to disable brakes on the fly would be a helpful addition for the interim, as it\u0027s easy to forget to set the action groups before launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, has there been any indication that changes like these are planned for KSP at any point in the future?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartwo","CreatedById":58131,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:39:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey have to fix wheel physics first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BItd4T8Vhc?start=54\u0026amp;feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver a year on and this still happens.(30 seconds in)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T20:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELack of analogue acceleration, braking, and steering honestly isn\u0027t a big deal.
