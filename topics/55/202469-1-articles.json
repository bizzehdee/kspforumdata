The lander could use a pilot (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E), engineer (repairs, power modules for Breaking Ground stations) and a scientist (experiment resets, science modules for BG stations), and for LOR* missions, a second pilot remaining in the command module for rendezvous with the lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, i.e. Apollo-style missions where the command module stays in-orbit with a separate lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there are workarounds, many are not particularly aesthetically pleasing, e.g. having a Mk. I lander can on top of a Mk. II can. Adding 3.75m pods, or even taller 2.5m pods with \u002B1 crew capacity could help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of legs, there\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0needs to be larger landing legs which extend past the nozzles of longer engines. Otherwise, you get awkward things like putting additional fuel tanks outboard of NTR engines just so you can put landing legs which can actually reach beneath those long NTR nozzles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Single stage to ocean","CreatedById":210256,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T15:32:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003Enot needed for civilized dlc players. ;) use pistons\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspnerd122","CreatedById":199169,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-18T17:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use DLC, and for you people who play with mods, I recomend near future spacecraft and kerbal reusability expansion, both mods are pretty good and have some of these(3.75m pods, Large landing gear)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously tho, Stock purisim is kinda a big thing in KSP(even tho KSP is MEANT to be modded, some people like playing with no mods) So these mods dont help EVERYONE, but they are a start and they ARE useful to have\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
