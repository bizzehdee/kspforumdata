Maybe by adding code to number when and what should go together. I assume this has to be done without gargable collecting problems or in a way it never needs it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could be done to target extremely large vessels. Maybe allowing a sweet spot for varying hardware where it\u0027s purposely laggy but possible uses the extra cores to get relatively better performance than you would get with single core. Especially as CPU\u0027s start getting much larger numbers of cores.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current large vessels can run from 10-30 seconds real live to 1 in game second on the clock. Anything beating this would be a lifesaver. it could be good for testing large craft and for video makers. If I can go from 10-30 seconds to a guaranteed 5 seconds per second with multicore/threads it\u0027s worth it if it\u0027s stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a simple way to implement this that \u003Cs\u003Ewould\u003C/s\u003E wouldn\u0027t require a lot of hassle on the programmers afterwords? Even if it\u0027s wonky, it could be done for testing and development. And being KSP, it might be fun for the explosions/weirdness as it\u0027s developed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m proposing it even split the craft up. 8d Maybe a selection of cheats as to which things it splits across cores. Then you can select joint or aero or other things to be split up for testing. Maybe the feedback could be collected on the forums to help maintain it over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is in the previous ideas thread but I was hoping this was a different enough varient and with new hardware going the way it is going it might be useful in different cases for different people. Could be good for the future of the game. It might not be long until we hit hundreds of cores per CPU. Let alone my measly 6 cores. I would love to get some better performance on my old CPU. Even if it\u0027s just a little. Large craft are potentially counted in hours of play to get into orbit. Anything would/could help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could also be very good for docking with large parts counts. There is a lot this could help. A minimum stabilized load could help game performance overall. Even if it\u0027s doesn\u0027t always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: 720 posts. One of my favorite numbers to use in game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-11T20:58:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2018 08:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
