IT would be pretty awesome to have an end-game possibility of terra-forming the planets and moons.. Honestly all that would be required is a machine that periodically releases some atmosphere (using resource conversion) and after a while, the tint of the the planet changes to green and you start seeing the \u0022already available WIP\u0022 trees, etc.. water turns blue.. and an actual flyable atmosphere.. Maybe have some kind of plantable kerbal civilization.. think \u0022spore\u0022 civilizatons.. where you can plop them down after you have enough materials or money... only without the spore \u0022suck\u0022 factor. Just someplace where they would walk around.. like in the VAB.. Possibly make them a mining town where they can gather resources over time, and you could transport them back home for cash, or transform them into fuel.. It would give the game some atmosphere and some pretty awesome endgame without being TOO complicated. Just an idea..
