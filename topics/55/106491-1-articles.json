Also, on a similar topic, it doesn\u0027t look like the aerodynamic model handles them being partially occluded by other parts, which also amplifies their usefulness. Simply making it so an airbreak that doesn\u0027t have full airflow only gives a very small portion of its breaking potential would go a long way to fixing that.\n\nThat said, keep that gif. It is funny as hell."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T05:41:56Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think that is overpowered.
