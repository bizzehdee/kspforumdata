When it comes up to destroy a smoke puff, instead of destroying the last one, destroy a random one from last two thirds of the queue. The last in queue then can be placed over the destroyed one to prevent having to rearrange the queue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will lead to much longer and more realistically looking smoke trails.

From watching Kethane dev stream I recall that there is no real control over any \u0022queue\u0022 - you just set up particle generation speed and randomize particle speed, initial movement vector, force and TTL. So every particle \u0022dies\u0022 when it\u0027s supposed to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Winter Man","CreatedById":11358,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T10:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr you could just have them fade to invisible before destroying, with a bit of code that sees what the particles nearest it are doing and *almost* goes with it. That way you\u0027d have the trail dissipate faster or slower in different areas leaving only sections of trail here and there, much like dissipation through a real uneven atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T10:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how it is implemented in KSP. I have no experience with Unity. My suggestion is just based on general programming experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf queues are not possible then it may be possible to assign the smoke puff random lifetime within certain limits, using e.g. poisson distribution. That would lead to about the same results. Or it is possible to have number of pre-defined smoke puff particles with various pre-set lifetimes and select from them using correct random distribution. There certainly are ways how to make things work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xvdBanksbvx","CreatedById":30451,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T11:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike many visual/sound effects, they are still just place holders until they get towards the end of development on the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T12:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere don\u0027t seem to be too many visual placeholders.
