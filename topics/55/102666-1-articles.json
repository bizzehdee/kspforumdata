For example: If you have more prestige than your rival(s) more contractors will contact you instead of your rival(s) driving them bankrupt from lack of funding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrestige should be earned by been to first in orbit or researching a tech instead of bringing a Kerbal back safely (That\u0027s an achievement). Just say you get to orbit first and you get 100 prestige all the rivals following will still receive prestige\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut not as much as been first to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotifications of events such as a mun landing should be notified to players when they enter the space center screen telling them all the stats necessary such as how much prestige earned and if they did it first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you might be worried that the game would take a performance hit from having rival(s). You simply don\u0027t load space centers and huge rockets. For example: They land on the Mun. A ship never went there but the game calculated if they could go to the Mun of where you where in the tech tree and the difficulty setting of the AI. How ever you could see and go to a space station the AI launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all I can say right now, and don\u0027t just judge, build upon this idea! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T15:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eproper subforum\u003C/a\u003E for this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd rival space agencies actually have been discussed there quite a bit, so your idea falls in line with the ideas of several other forum users.
