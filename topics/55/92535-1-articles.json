Now for Docking, how is cycling through every nearby target (as you said not on rails) better than just clicking on them? Getting targets is fairly easy, anything within like ~70k shows up for you to select and click. Anything farther should be just a map view and target select away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you want a little more accuracy, and help in a docking situation I can understand the usefulness of cycling through say every docking port nearby. This would be helpfull but somewhat of a crap shoot. How would you differenciate which docking port you have selected from afar? Once your close enough to see, well you mightest well just rightclick and select it as a target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just do not see any use in a cycle targets key when you have the mouse which provides better information, ease of use, and better overall functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wayland","CreatedById":16204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T22:57:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe issues I encounter that make me want this key are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) In certain docking situations, the target is sometimes lost. It would be faster to simply hit a key, rather than take the time to bring the mouse to the target and click. This is especially true when using a key mapped joystick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Certain complex terrestrial operations (related to kolonization), involving multiple vehicles and modules, could REALLY use an ability to quickly cycle targets. Simply finding the target by name rather than look for it in a field of a bajillion modules would be really nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theend3r","CreatedById":97560,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T23:14:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that this could be very useful especially since the mouse clicking is fickle in some situations.
