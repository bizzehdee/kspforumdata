KSP runs fine on lower end machines, it\u0027d be nice if it stayed that way.

As for random star systems replacing the Kerbin system, why not?

It depends on the code optimisation, and while KSP still has some way to go, loading times are more than acceptable.

Water related craft\u00A0are currently a pretty minor part of the stock game and developing this aspect properly would require a lot of time. I personally feel like rocket parts are in dire need of attention: 1.0/1.1 added lot of plane parts, 1.2 added a comms system for probes, 1.3 added localisation; overall rocket parts have received very little attention in the last few updates, a shame for a game where launching craft to orbit is the start of everything (some rocket parts will be added in the upcoming DLC but that doesn\u0027t improve the existing ones). There are already a lot of mods adding marine parts and I\u0027m satisfied with it staying\u00A0mod domain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-01T20:15:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2017 08:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gaarst\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFormatting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"qzgy","CreatedById":160994,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-02T20:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8) I would say is unrealistic.
