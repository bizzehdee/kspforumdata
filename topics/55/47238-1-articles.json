That question obviously concerns prettying up for the gala rather than the rough-and-tumble fixing and building so it works right, so if any answer is given, I\u0027d presume the update of such would be implemented much closer to version 0.9X or 1.0 rather than anything impending.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, there are 5 particle effects in the games, and my thread concerns three of them; Rocket Thrust Plumes, RCS Puffs (which are the same as EVA Jetpack Puffs), Explosions. The other two which I think are fine as-is are the Burn-up/Kerbal death *poofs* and the sparks caused by rocket engine fuel exhaustion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust Plumes, RCS Puffs and Explosions all have seen improvements since the game\u0027s inception, but still lack some details to make these effects more realistic. One detail many may have noticed is a player/time controlled illumination texture in rocket engines to make them look like they glow and heat up, but I\u0027m more concerned with the plume of thrust itself, and similar details thereof.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C1ay4bW.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/C1ay4bW.png\u0022 alt=\u0022C1ay4bW.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost notably, the particle generation for these effects is based upon a velocity and vector derived from the local orientation of the spacecraft only. Now I have no idea how difficult it would actually be to make the connection, but I do know that one simple-to-explain way to make RCS Puffs and Explosions drag in the atmosphere is to parent the particle\u0027s movement to the local atmosphere--more specifically, a velocity of 0 relative to the ground (until weather or air turbulence is implemented). Then, increase that parent-velocity\u0027s magnitude and influence over the particle\u0027s movement from 0 at generation to 100% when the particle is soon to die. This would make RCS puffs drag in the wind, explosions streak across the sky (rather than maintaining a position relative to where they came from, if the explosion was caused middair) and would make thrust plumes arc dramatically if their attached vehicle was at a disconcerting angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA thing that concerns only the Puffs and Plumes is changing their appearance with local pressure and how over/underpressurizing would appear. This is probably just-as, if not more complex than the previous, (not even mentioning shock diamonds, as the last thread did) but would be a very fine level of visual polish, to make rockets look as they \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvB-8CWw9eU\u0026amp;t=4m38s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edo in real life when firing in space\u003C/a\u003E, rather than what Star Wars would have us believe. I imagine it would require a large overhaul of what manner of particle effect was used for the rocket engine thrust plume in order to both have it be able to taper into a self-affecting cone, and, dynamically controlled by atmospheric pressure, taper outwards into a dilated, curved, nearly-invisible plate-like entity emanating from the engine bell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course all these, Squad might already be aware of and just have them much later down the production line: I just wish I knew if that were true or not. Or if they\u0027ve already been considered but decided not to have due to framerate budget, lack of visual cue for engine firing or something like that...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-03T05:31:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2013 05:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kodiak42","CreatedById":62082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-04T16:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe large problem we might have with this (assuming the math isn\u0027t too hard for squad) is that this could graphic detail could slow down the game considerably.
