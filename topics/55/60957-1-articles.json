First off to explain how all of this would work in the first place is that you would hire a kerbal of a specific profession or one that is untrained and can be set to a profession. Each kerbal would have their own skill tree for their profession (or would be assigned one by the player if they are the untrained type, meaning you could have Jeb be anything from a pilot to and engineer) which you would advance by spending experience points that that kerbal would obtain by going on missions and doing work as well as spending money in order to pay for training! This would definitely make recovering kerbals more appealing as well as keeping them alive. Basically if implemented you would have a non roll-play reason to build escape systems for you rockets, returning your crews back to kerbin, and reasons to bring a larger crew of kerbals along! (maybe even keeping some spare members in your Jool station as a backup crew?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo finally here are my thoughts on the actual professions themselves\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Pilot/Commander/Test pilot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-would start off being able to be more stable while flying planes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not entirely to sure on what this class should do but here are some ideas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to balance RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to keep the spacecraft pointed at its target \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to cancel relative velocity with its target/ move at the same speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to keep a docking port on the same plane as a targeted docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the things mentioned above could actually be used as a semi passive auto docking/rendezvous system!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More stable landings/kill some sideways motion and keeps you pointed up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rather inaccurate and inefficient auto pilot/rendezvous \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tries to prevent rovers from flipping (would try to fight risky player input)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Engineer/Mechanic \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-would start off being able to repack parachutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1st upgrade would allow them to repair landing legs and wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2nd upgrade would allow them to repair solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther upgrades that Engineers could have are as follows\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to force activate a decoupler, engine, solar panel etc... while in Eva (could be interesting to mess with broken parts/ make use of partially destroyed or damaged assemblies or even save probes which you didn\u0027t have their solar panels open) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to manually attach/detach struts and fuel lines while in Eva\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to transfer resources such as fuel and electricity(could be used to jump-start powerless probes) while in Eva\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to remove/blow off/detach parts from a vessel while in Eva (could be useful for getting rid of derbies or jammed parts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to pick up, move, and attach small parts to a vessel in Eva depending on the environment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to weld docking ports together\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to stick a mini radial probe CPU (has a solar panel built in on top, looks a bit like a mini radial mech-jeb box) that would allow you to utilize old/potentially useful derbies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Scientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-would start off being able to transfer science data from experiments and modules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-1st ability would allow them to get more science from Eva reports\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2nd ability would allow them to get more science from surface samples (they know their job is to collect a variety of samples and not to just grab all of the shiny rocks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-3rd ability would allow them to get more reputation (to be implemented with budgets apparently) from Eva reports and surface samples (they wrote a book on their experience or something which boosted public opinion of the KSC)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-4rth ability would allow them to do an exclusive experiment (maybe drill a surface/core sample? Take specific readings with special tools? Take a picture???)(has to go and get a new one after each use, like how flags work with capsules as a resupply point)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore Ideas are probably still needed for this class\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Eva/planetary activity expert (could be merged with the scientist if need be)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Would start off with the ability to run faster on other planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso not entirely sure what this classes rank progression should be but here are some ideas (please add more)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gets a more durable space suit (can take more damage)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gets a parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gets more Eva fuel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Gets A bigger/more powerful maneuver-pack(could be the current one with other kerbals getting a tinier less powerful/less fueled one)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. New Recruit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Can choose/be trained in any of the above professions for a price (once they get their profession they are at rank 0 like everyone else)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Tourist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(OK this is not exactly a profession however it is a way to fund your space program)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Would have specific areas/planets they would want to explore as well as a certain time table for how long they want to be there/in transit/etc. Basically you can get money and good or bad reputation depending on how well you meet their needs (IE don\u0027t leave them on Eeloo for 20 years when they wanted to go to the moon for a month...). They would also want things like plenty of power, food, Eva fuel, habitation space, and bandwidth!(give them an high power antenna with a constant power supply)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yea that\u0027s MY take on how Kerbal professions should work, Please share your Ideas and concerns!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-24T19:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I am not entirely to sure on what this class should do but here are some ideas\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to balance RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to keep the spacecraft pointed at its target \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to cancel relative velocity with its target/ move at the same speed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ability to keep a docking port on the same plane as a targeted docking port\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the things mentioned above could actually be used as a semi passive auto docking/rendezvous system!!!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More stable landings/kill some sideways motion and keeps you pointed up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rather inaccurate and inefficient auto pilot/rendezvous \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tries to prevent rovers from flipping (would try to fight risky player input)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecould have a class called a navigator for this although balancing rcs would be an engineers job\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DerpenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E 4.
