This mode is somewhat disfavored in current KSP as it is not possible to get that much funds for recovering whatever remained from such ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is reusable approach, using ships that are able to return to KSC (or just to the ground) mostly intact and returning most of their value on recovery. This one appears to be the most profitable in current KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird is again reusable approach, this time using truly reusable ships, i.e. without recovering, just refueling the ship on KSC or in another suitable place and sending it to another mission. This third approach is rather tedious in current KSP but is possible and may start being used if it turns profitable so it must be considered in all balancing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I am trying to balance these three modes, particularly to close the relatively huge gap between the \u0022classical rocketry\u0022 and \u0022reusable with recovery\u0022 modes without opening another gap towards \u0022true reusable\u0022 mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea lies in a kind of part aging. This aging would, though, not take place in time, but in part usage. Particularly, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeach part would be built/purchased to withstand certain dv\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- on purchase, price of a part would depend on amount of dv the part is designed to withstand. This would be made tweakable, so you would be able to mount the same part designed e.g. for 6000 m/s dv (cheap) or for 60000 m/s dv (expensive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- on recovery, the refund would depend on remaining dv budget of each part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- on usage, if a part in a ship depletes its dv budget, all ship\u0027s engines/RCS would automatically block (except currently burning SRBs)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003Eit would be possible to repair parts\u003C/strong\u003E for amount corresponding to \u0022repaired\u0022 dv budget. Such repair should be possible anywhere under some reasonable conditions (e.g. presence of a Kerbal and the ship must not produce any thrust for certain time) and should be possible both for individual parts and for whole ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- there would always be a visible \u0022aging meter\u0022 showing how much dv budget is left on the weakest part of the ship. That would allow the player to issue repairs in time and/or consider whether the ship is capable of planned task or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the part dv budget would be depleted by engine thrust. The depleted amount would be calculated as vector sum of all engine thrusts divided by mass of the ship (i.e. two rocket engines burning in opposite directions would not deplete anything as they produce no net thrust). Sitting on launchpad would not deplete anything. Reentry would not deplete anything. Gliding in the air or falling on parachutes would not deplete anything as well. Even torque-driven helicopters, as crazy as they are, would not deplete anything. Just engine thrust (SRBs, rocket engines, jets, RCS). Sitting on launchpad with an engine producing thrust upwards not sufficient to lift the rocket would deplete the rocket\u0027s dv budget, though. The idea is it is not actually the dv but rather vibrations and mechanical load caused by the engine what\u0027s making parts aged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this, all the three playing modes would IMO get way closer. You could design a staged rocket and give its parts just enough dv budget that it almost depletes when you stage them. Then it\u0027s almost irrelevant if you try and recover them (receiving next to nothing as their budget is almost depleted) or you just stage them off and forget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESSTOs would of course still be an option but they would pay less on recovery, or require periodic repairs for comparable price. That would prevent opening a new gap between the two reusable modes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it means there would be higher money circulation as parts aging would require either paying for repairs or cause bigger money loses on recoveries. That means more and better paying contracts would be needed but I believe there is no major problem balancing that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-19T22:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s an interesting suggestion, and thoughtfully expressed.

Another thing is that I don\u0027t believe the game monitors dV in any way, just fuel levels... however, time is already kept by the game and would make adding this feature simpler. As far as intensity of operation, I\u0027d vote rather for using time as the primary metric and maybe have g-force act like a \u0022multiplier\u0022, creating excessive wear and tear. G-force has the added benefit of being another stat the game tracks already, and also has a more logical connection to something that might be considered to increase wear and tear on parts that aren\u0027t engines. It also has the effect of scaling damage with respect to what a vessel is doing. For example, nuke engines are built to last a long time... they have to be, having one wear out before it\u0027s depleted it\u0027s fuel on run #1 wouldn\u0027t make much sense, any high-dv/low-thrust engine is going to suffer a raw deal if dV is the measuring factor (and they already get a bad rap for usually being heavy with poor TWR).
