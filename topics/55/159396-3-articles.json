If you take the time function of time warp out, you are forced to remove it from the entire system. Kerbin, its moons, the entire solar system, every object in orbit around the sun. If I accelerate myself via some magic warp, which is in essence what you are suggesting, it makes 0 difference where I aim. My target simply will not be there when I arrive. I was accelerated alone. My target remained in its time contiuum and did not go on rails like you see in the game right now. THAT is the issue at hand. You cannot warp 1 object w/out warping ALL objects at the same velocity in terms of chronological speed or some value of velocity of meters per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt simply cannot be done in a way that doesnt break physics wide open and invite division by 0. This is but one reason why multiplayer for KSP isnt a suitable option. From time constraints \u0026lt;my launch window for some transfer, your maneuver to say another player trying to land on Dres \u0026lt;\u0026lt;yay dres awareness\u0026gt;\u0026gt; someone or all persons will lose something\u0026gt; to any number of ways folks can troll, to deliberate collisions with stations, to messing with comsats to who knows what. KSP is one game where multiplayer simply isnt a good idea. Now, that said, it should be noted I love multiplayer aspects when it makes sense, like BF1 or MWO or FFXIVARR but, in a game like KSP, its like trying to use a water rocket to reach Eeloo and back.
