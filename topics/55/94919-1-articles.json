What I mean is maybe more \u0022dedicated\u0022 parts. Like some chassis for the rovers. I also would like to see pods that are shaped like that of a car(like, say a Big Rig\u0027s \u0022Pod\u0022 would look like the Exterior of one, of course. this would reduce part count and make my life easier). Lastly is more wheels. I know this sounds stupid, but I would personally like very stable, fast, and reliable ones.

You may find the gameplay boring, but rovers are already too FAST to be at all realistic, frankly. (Mind you, I do think there are issues with overly-fragile rovers, but it seems to me that this is because parts fail in exactly the same way and exactly the same speed whether they barely scrape the ground on a rover or smash head-on into each other with the momentum of a thousand-ton spacecraft behind them. It would be good methinks for Squad to take another crack at object collision logic; at minimum, separate collision resistance values for \u0022normal\u0022 and \u0022shear\u0022 collisions.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T20:11:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m with you. Rovers are still kind of a fringe element. But seeings as Space planes, satellites and Space Stations just took a leap forward- it gives me hope Rovers won\u0027t be too far off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Srpadget said, speed is a little crazy as it is- but I\u0027m willing to let that slide if one element was simply fixed: stability. Unless you build a super wide and long rover even on Kerbin, it has a tendency and almost desire to flip over. I had a 6t Rover going 20m/s flip over itself yesterday just because I put on the brakes. I was a bit sceptical that was realistic.
