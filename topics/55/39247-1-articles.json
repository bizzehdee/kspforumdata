Thus, you are looking over the shoulder of the Kerbal in flight. I suggest that the option be provided in which the Kerbal flies in first-person view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can do that now in-capsule with the C key and IVA. Therefore, the algorithms and coding are already in place for first-person perspective. Once on EVA, the player could toggle first/third person with the C key. The controls (WASD,SHIFT,CTRL) would remain the same. The player would look forward in the direction of travel. A \u0022free camera\u0022 view would be provided by holding the RMB, as is done now in the orbital map. Upon releasing the RMB, the view would snap back to forward-looking view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a later release/enhancement, the player could designate a target (by right-clicking on it in the third-person view). Upon switching to first-person view, a colored dot at the edge of the screen would indicate the direction of travel to the target. Once the target is in view, the colored dot would disappear. This would help our EVA player to not get lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first-person view would be fun. It gives the player the experience (almost) of a real-life EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J0hnsmine","CreatedById":66501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T23:18:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat idea, i think the Lazor mod does this, although it is quite glitchy.

Right now it seems a bit iffy whether or not the kerbalnaut will re-orient to the camera view - it seems to only work if I\u0027m really FAR off from facing forward. It\u0027s hard right now to get the kerbal to change facing by about 45 degrees or less. It only changes facing when its really far off from the camera, not when it\u0027s just a little off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mach56","CreatedById":57826,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T10:51:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStock first person view, zoom in as far as possible then use the pan camera key (MMB)to clip the camera inside the kerbal\u0027s head.
