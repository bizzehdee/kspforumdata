It looks very, very plain during that time. Once I get it to working they way I want it/My clients want it, then I start making it look pretty. My clients usually only get screen shots or report samples. Rarely do I let them play with it while I\u0027m still working on features. We have a plan and I follow it. If they should change their mind, I stop working until we have a new plan. I make them very much aware that the timeline I gave them no longer applies with the new plan and a new timeline is created. If they have a hard deadline, then they have some decisions to make. Or I try to find more resources to throw at it (which means more costs to the client).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad does not have a deadline that we know of.

The game provides you with a challenge: earn money (I\u0027m not even going to call it science, money is a *much* more accurate way to think about this) to unlock new parts. I therefore need to earn a lot of money. What would you do instead? Launch 5 rockets where 1 would suffice? Why? When you say \u0022just don\u0027t do that\u0022, what do you propose is the alternative?\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, it seems I was misguided in my criticism right from the start. The R\u0026amp;D system is not designed as \u0022new and interesting content\u0022, it is basically a tutorial system. As I mentioned above, felipe essentially states outright that experienced players might as well just stick to sandbox, because the R\u0026amp;D system is not for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, he says that he expects R\u0026amp;D won\u0027t be \u0022for them\u0022, essentially. \u0022Why\u0022 would I do that? Because I want to play the game, not beat it. If your objective is to beat the game then great, you can beat the R\u0026amp;D system in 3 launches, good for you. Try and make it 2 launches. But I would suggest that if that were the case then the finished career mode would not be for you. I personally look forward to launching reasonable rockets and taking each thing step by step, doing things specifically so I can progress. It\u0027s pretty easy not to exploit the game mechanics in order to produce extreme results. And you should call it science because money will eventually be something else entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Also, as people have said this isn\u0027t an absolute final draft.
