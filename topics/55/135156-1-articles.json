The science career can be quite a boring grind for the first 2 or 3 tiers until you reach a tipping point, when you unlock the lab and solar panels and you can mine thousands of science points without a lot of effort, making the late tech tree very easy to unlock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving more variety in the experiments and activities you can do to get science would really make the science career more rewarding. Especially when that\u0027s combined with a penalty for using the mobile lab too often or a more challenging tech tree in the late game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
