After this there was a marker placed on the surface where there was some extra science to be had for doing some EVA sampling or something similar I imagine. So i was wondering if anyone else might think this is a good/neat idea or if im just having the dreams of a crazy person.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T02:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh, yeah.

My first choice would be for a vessel mounted telescope that could directly view the surface (and could be used to scan for landing sites etc), but I\u0027d settle for a magic detector like the ISP Mapsat mod has, or the crew \u0027noticing\u0027 things with their sharp eyes, as you describe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MythicLionMan","CreatedById":90146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T15:23:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a very similar idea. I was hoping for a general waypoint feature (like my GPSr) to allow me to mark a location that I observed from orbit. I was thinking of discovering anomalies (I have yet to find one). The waypoint would be like a flag with no geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the idea of extending this to science experiments as well to suggest a ground landing location. Science is currently very mechanical and this would make it feel more like actual discovery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Llez","CreatedById":37067,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T18:09:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe idea I think behind it is additional challenge with an appropriate reward.
