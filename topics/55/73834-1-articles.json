The Turbojet also acts as a mix of a ramjet and a turbojet. It can lift off under its own power like a turbojet, but produce thrust up to a ridiculous Mach 7. Separating the two would solve this problem. If you want to go fast with an airbreathing engine, you\u0027ll first have to get it up to quite a decent speed before it starts producing meaningful thrust. Also jets are modeled as if they were rocket engines, even though they work quite differently. In reality all jet engines lose thrust as the air gets thinner in high altitude, while Isp remains the same. However in KSP they lose fuel efficiency not thrust.

The turbojets, as I just pointed out, are fine. The fact that the pictured craft can fly at all points to the atmosphere being unrealistic. Try flying those with FAR, you won\u0027t make it past 10km. But that aside, the jets are still fine. The only thing wrong in the game is the fact that air and fuel can flow through parts whose mass and drag aren\u0027t factored into any equation and that aerodynamics don\u0027t affect the crafts - only the mass and available IntakeAir do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a though experiment, consider a turbojet with one intake. Put a chair on it with some fuel. Guess how far and fast you\u0027ll be able to go. Hint: It\u0027s pretty far. This is my biggest pet peeve when people complain about OP parts - they intentionally misuse them. You can make a 3 part SSTO rocket with a probe core, Jumbo-64 fuel tank and a Skipper. Is the Skipper OP? You can easily escape the Suns gravity using the biggest SRB and a chair. What on earth did you expect to happen..? You have 650kn of thrust pushing about 200kg.
