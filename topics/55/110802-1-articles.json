This way, you can see on the navball if the landing spot you\u0027ve chosen is level (granting a safe landing) or not (granting a spectacular explosion...sometimes).\n\nI think this feature would come in handy in particular for IVA pilots."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T20:00:32Z","Content":"So, a slope indicator?

And they do not need them as this marker would be misleading (curvature of orbited body, which isn\u0027t accounted for in the marker, and new players could fall in this trap and crash due to the crash marker, irony and pun intended) and would indicate a landing spot on which the player isn\u0027t going to land anyways (slowing down by atmosphere or touchdown-burn, changing the spot and thus the slope significantly). The fairly close thing is indeed essential."}]}
