But that isn\u0027t enough to eyeball if a rocket can fly to Jool and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA player like me needs additional information like (remaining) burn time, delta V, TWR, etc. to quickly understand what a rocket is capable of. And I need access to this information in the VAB and during flight. Do you really expect us to get some paper and calculate the numbers by ourselves or always resort to KER, MechJeb \u0026amp; similiar mods?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInformation like the ones I mentioned are \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eessential\u003C/span\u003E for simulation games. Look at car racing games, nearly all of them provide statistics of how fast they accelerate, gear ratios, etc. for the player. And even games like Distant Universe show them where these kind of numbers aren\u0027t as important as in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example the current gameplay for a beginner and intermediate player looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Rocket doesn\u0027t reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.

After several hours you finally reached orbit. Now you repeat all that again until you build a rocket which can fly to Jool. Arriving a Jool you run out of gas and - you guessed right - revert to the hangar again to modify your creation so you can get back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary: 5\u002B hours of building and trying for a 1 hour mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that building is a big part in this game but it\u0027s not done right.
