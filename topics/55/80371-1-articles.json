Then you just save the craft to file and load it up when at home on your KSP folder and test for launch!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen any suggestions on the forum about something similar, but on reddit i found a thread about a web-based VAB, it got some interest so i think the portable standalone should too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it could be further (and further in time) expanded including some sharing tools(e.g. dropbox or similar, img hosting services).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother cool thing would be the possibility to assign the file extension to the program so you double click a ship and it loads up on the standalone VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other suggestions could be included in this top post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
