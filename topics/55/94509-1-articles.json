So...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The engineers new main job, instead of repairs would be a type of \u0022resource manager\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At levels 0 to 5, he might reduce the use of electric power by 5%, 8%, 11%, 14%, 17% and 20%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At levels 1 to 5, he might reduce the amount of fuel and oxidizer used by 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At levels 1 to 5 he might increase active thrust by 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the engineer would still make repairs, just a bit differently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Repairs would be one of three levels of magnitude - minor, moderate or major.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Minor repairs at level 0, moderate repairs at level 2 and major repairs at level 4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Or maybe: minor - level 0, moderate - level 1 and major level 2 or 3. ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Repairs would also require \u0022spare parts\u0022. How many that are needed for a repair would be determined by the magnitude of the repair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Each command pod would carry a limited amount of \u0022spare parts\u0022, and of course the Mk-I would carry the least and the Mk-III would carry the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Extra \u0022spare parts\u0022 could also be carried in a cargo bay, if one is available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Repairs also take time to complete, with minor repairs taking the least amount of time and major repairs taking the most time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The amount of \u0022spare parts\u0022 and time required to complete a repair would decrease as the engineer levels up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis new repair system could also lead to new repair contracts, that would be similar to a rescue mission but you go up to repair disabled ship so it can safely land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso at level 0, the engineer can gain no science form scientific equipment, Science gained from contracts, crew reports and EVA report are unaffected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E At level 1 the engineer ( the pilot and scientist also ) have completed their basic astronaut cross-training and can now use the scientific equipment to gather full science and use SAS systems for basic craft piloting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot - Only a few tweaks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 0: No science from scientific equipment, Science gained from contracts, crew reports and EVA report are unaffected. / No repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 1: Full Science from equipment / Can effect simple repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 3 - 5: Use less RCS fuel by 3%, 6% and 9%? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientist\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 0: Can gather full science form all available sources. / No SAS / No repairs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 1: SAS usable / Can effect simple repairs. / Can identify currently occupied bio (this could be displayed at the bottom of the resource tab/window or maybe next to the nav ball?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 2: Can determine, but not identify, if a different bio is nearby and can give directions to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 3: Can now identify a nearby bio and give directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 4: Same as level 3 but at a greater range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Level 5: Same as level 4 but at a greater range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll other abilities remain the same.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-25T20:39:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2014 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by tetryds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
