This could increase the age range of gamers and give people a much harder challenge if desired. For instance my kids like the game but it is very difficult for them to design a ship that actually flies much less get into orbit. Personally I am finding that its becoming easy to do anything without mods that make it harder. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I don\u0027t see much that you could do short of adding a multiplier for how much science you generate in career mode. For instance on beginner a surface sample on Kerban might give 10 science, on normal maybe 5 and so on.. But as you start implementing a lot of the features that are planned I can see a lot of places where you can make things easier or harder depending on what we are looking for in game. Here are just a few suggestions but this could quickly be expanded into all current and future areas of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Very easy to get science. Increase multiplier to maybe 2x and be able to unlock the entire tree by just visiting Kerban and 1 moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Have future Kerbans suggest where you can go to get more science or provide contracts for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Parts and equipment could be more rugged to survive collisions or harder impacts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -No deadly re-entry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Capsules or pods float in water.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Reduced atmosphere mechanics / physics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Easier flight and control in general.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Normal science multiplier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Very vague recommendations or contract on where to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Normal strength for parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealistic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Reduced multiplier for science. Force them to visit most of the outer planets to be able to unlock the entire science tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Limited kerbals and perma death.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -No reverting after your rocket explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Realistic atmosphere mechanics / physics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Realistic flight and control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -Stuff sinks if you land in water (without parts to make you float)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Strikerklm96","CreatedById":102539,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-23T18:36:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of difficulty levels except,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

What they have shown interest in is separate knobs for different things. So a knob to turn reentry heat on and off (once we get stock reentry heat, that is) fits with what they\u0027re thinking, but not a single knob to change several settings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I kind of agree with Flight. If and when we get an improved aerodynamic model, it should apply to all games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, real command pods are floaty... right up until you open the hatch. We lost at least one Mercury capsule, and almost the astronaut, that way. Still, flotation devices are something that should be built into the command pods, not some extra part. The devs have already argued against adding more types of necessary parts, and the last time they discussed it, their plan for reentry heat didn\u0027t involve discrete heat shield parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-24T17:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENone of those \u0027beginner\u0027 things is going to make it any easier to actually DESIGN a ship, so your entire argument as to WHY you\u0027d want difficulty levels is completely moot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd WTF is \u0027reduced atmosphere physics\u0027 supposed to mean?
