The Jool system would be fun tho and those things could potentially happen if you either want them to happen or if the entire system aligns for it to happen.

Yes, there are ways to do it quite easily with today\u0027s computing power... in real-time (mostly)... \u003Cem\u003Ehowever\u003C/em\u003E... the more bodies you must account for, the more complex the situation gets -- exponentially, if I recall correctly. In addition, it will quickly become far too much for pretty much any machine in existence to simulate real-time if you have to do it for every craft in the game... which means unfocused craft will probably still have to use patched conics (the \u0027rails\u0027 system)... which means that you\u0027d only be able to utilise the useful bits of n-body simulations (i.e., Lagrange points) while you are focused on that craft. Soon as you switch craft, it\u0027ll be in a \u0027standard\u0027 orbit which will very likely not stay in the L-point. In addition, you couldn\u0027t run n-body physics at the speeds required to be able to use time-warp beyond about 100x... and even then, it\u0027d be unstable. Time warp would also have to switch back to the regular patched conics \u0027rails\u0027 system...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of that basically means the n-body simulation would only work while you are not time-warping, and have the craft in focus... and since the primary use of L-points is to have craft sitting there for long periods of time for various purposes (with some small adjustments every now and again, as most L-points are not truly stable), the limitations of the system would make it, well, useless...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the implication of this is an \u003Cem\u003En-body simulation\u003C/em\u003E... which is on the [thread=30064]What Not to Suggest List[/thread]. As such, we\u0027re gonna have to close this for now -- it\u0027s been brought up a million times (well, it feels like it, anyway), and every single time, the above limitations render the discussion either useless or destructive as arguments ensue, without many real ideas of how to circumvent the limitations such a simulation would impose. Mind you, the limitations are largely due to the engine KSP is presently using -- namely Unity, and PhysX. Some other engines could \u003Cem\u003Epotentially\u003C/em\u003E work (good luck finding them useable enough), but... changing engines at this stage in development would mean basically recoding almost everything from scratch. Not the best of plans, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I think that\u0027s probably enough on this for now... let\u0027s close this, shall we? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
