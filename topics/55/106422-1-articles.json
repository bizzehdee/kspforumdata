Heat should be much more localized to the place where the heat is generated. In what reality does the cockpit of a spaceplane heat to 1500\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C from burning a rocket engine? Sure, the engine might get hot (well, actually, just the nozzle and combustion chamber of the rocket will heat or else there will be serious problems...), but now -my entire spaceplane- becomes glowing hot. So, decreasing the heat resistance of parts (that shouldn\u0027t have heat resistance) is not really possible, as these parts would then be destroyed as the spacecraft becomes \u0027uniformely hot\u0027 during an LV-N burn or re\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABntry. The solution is obvious: increase the thermal capacity of parts; decrease the thermal conduction between parts; then heat will become much more localized and only then the heat resistance of some can be decreased.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T10:23:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Chris_2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
