There should be an Orbital button and you set it to 70,000m, it will give you data on how much delta V it requires and how much fuel it will use depending on your staging and rocket. This would be good for sandbox mode and maybe career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T23:04:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr maybe a high-speed simulation which tells you if a rocket makes it, rather than HOW to get the rocket to orbit? If it took just a second or two then tweaking the design in the VAB would be much less hassle than doing \u0022test\u0022 flights for every tweak!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T23:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is: depending on your flight path, you may not use the same amount of fuel that the game would think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the delta-v it is known, you will need between 4200 to 4550 in average of DeltaV to get to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat if you could setup a flight path, and it could calculate that way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T00:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you mean no time to test it?
