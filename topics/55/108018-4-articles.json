I think it was right and I will explain. The TES games are published by a major publisher, and at that level it\u0027s either \u0022meet the deadline or we will scrap this project\u0022. If the devs had held it back, I sincerely doubt we would have had Daggerfall at all. Furthermore, one can speculate what would have happened if the publisher had pulled the plug on the game. Would we have had Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim? Look at the Ultima series. There it was the publisher who forced a release that effectively killed an entire gaming franchise. The failure of Ultima 9 was the direct cause we did not get any more Ultima games. Ultima Online was released later but that was a title that was already well under developement and killing that, well I\u0027m not EA but they did release UO and that was the last Ultima game released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example of a release that should have been worked on but was published is Elite 2 Frontier.
