So I know what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to discuss my suggestion of making planetsize configurable as a difficult option. Because stock is fairly simple and can give some wrong assumptions about astrophysics and rocketscience, \u003Cstrong\u003EBUT\u003C/strong\u003E stock is also fun and can give you the possibility of making cool things like giant space stations or space ships. Stock is a very good entry point for newcomers, who have no idea what they are doing and probably don\u0027t even know how something get\u0027s to space properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo on the other hand stock gets pretty easy over time and leaves wrong assumptions about how physics work and how hard it is to get things to orbit. So here something like 6.4x(without TWR/ISP overhaul) or even 10x(with TWR/ISP overhaul) comes in. This is for experienced players who aren\u0027t into modding. (There are a lot of people, who don\u0027t even know about mods or more frightning some people don\u0027t even know there is a community with forums. And some people are afraid of modding.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere maybe should be another option somewhere in between, because the jump from stock to 6.4x/10x is pretty hard even for experienced stock players. 3.2x is a pretty good step in between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would name these options 1.0x: \u0022Arcade\u0022; 3.2x \u0022Advanced\u0022; 6.4x \u0022Expert\u0022; 10x \u0022Realistic\u0022. This gives people the possibility to get a good entry point, but doesn\u0027t leave false impressions about physics and difficulty in rocket science, because they know they only play \u0022Arcady style\u0022 difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen they start understanding orbital mechanics, orbital insertion, landing, aerobreaking and so on, they can start moving on to greater challenges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease leave your opinion. I started this thread, because some people complained about giving people false impressions with unrealistic difficulty and physics in the 1.0x stock system. I agree with them, but since it is a game I want people to have fun and a fairly realistic (on a gameplay/balance point) start into the hard world of rocketscience.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T12:05:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 12:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jhonny007\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebetter title\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
