It could also become a challenge point if you have a small roster and have no remaining kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T23:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a few mods that do this already, I forget their names. Crew rotation, or something like that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA common theory (one that I personally support) is that Kerbals have at least some evolutionary root in plants. Their green skin is due to chloroplasts that allow them to receive energy from the sun, and survive years-long missions with no life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T23:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61510-104wip-plugin084318112015-keepfit-kerbal-fitness-degradation/\u0022\u003EKeepFit \u003C/a\u003Eis really good one. It tracks the effect of low and very high gee effects on kerbals over time. Kerbal health degradation is dependent on the type of capsule they are in. A cramped Mk I will degrade health quickly while a spacious hitchhiker will be more comfortable. If you have a mod with a rotating hab part to provide gravity then their health will not degrade at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T23:52:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Nightside\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrection\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
