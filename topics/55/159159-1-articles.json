One approach that could work to some extent is the same approach EA took with SimCity and how different Cities can interact with each other despite being on different years. Its definitely not a simple thing to do, and if it ever happens a lot of realism will have to be sacrificed.

Player 1 quickly plots a modestly fast intercept, burns, and cranks up the warp. Player 2 more carefully plots a faster intercept, burns, but warps less aggressively. In game time terms, Player 2\u0027s intercept happens sooner, but Player 1 arrives sooner in real time due to more aggressive timewarping, then claws\u00A0and moves the asteroid. Under DMP\u0027s timewarp scheme, the asteroid will not be there when Player 2\u00A0gets there, because Player 1\u00A0has already interacted with it and Player 2\u00A0will need to sync up with that subspace. So, even though Player 2\u00A0plotted the better intercept and would have gotten there faster in game time terms, Player 1\u00A0wins the race through more aggressive timewarping which allowed him to get there faster in real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t have to be an explicit race, either. Imagine this scenario:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer 1 and Player 2 are playing with spaceplanes supported by an orbiting fuel depot. Player 1 quickly ascends to orbit and decides to do a Mun flyby (using timewarp), and when returning to Kerbin docks with the depot and drains the fuel from it. Player 2 plays around sightseeing in the atmosphere before ascending to orbit, taking more real time but less game time than Player 1\u0027s flyby and docking. He then attempts to dock to the propellant depot. Is fuel available for Player 2 there? Should there\u00A0be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese sorts of issues are inherent to asynchronous warp, there\u0027s not a technical solution for it. Synchronous warp means waiting, most of the time.

The sync issue remains. Change it up to Player 1 colliding with the station and destroying it and the problem is still there. A player that timewarps more aggressively can reach into the past and affect other players even though they get there earlier in game time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what? \u00A0We aren\u0027t talking about 20 player servers here, we are talking about small co-op games with 2-4 players. \u00A0There are many options to mitigate the issues and those that cant are not going to be common. \u00A0Even when they do haapen, it\u0027s just one of those\u00A0quirk of KSP you would have to accept. \u00A0There are already worse incongruties in the game. \u00A0None of this is a reason that multiplayer can\u0027t happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
