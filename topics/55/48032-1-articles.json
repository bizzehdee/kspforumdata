It\u0027s not the rocks that teach you how to improve rocket tech, it\u0027s the fact that you had to build rockets to get to the Mun. Now, don\u0027t start flaming. I\u0027m not arguing against the tech tree. I love the Science-based gameplay element, and I think \u0022sample Mun rocks\u0022 is a much more compelling goal to unlock a tech tree node than \u0022Fly 10 missions\u0022. Having a purpose for missions is good, a gradual progression from small to large rockets is good, I can see the science-based tech tree implementation being a perfect fit for KSP gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I think KSP gameplay could be further improved by adding a much simpler, much less flashy Engineering subsystem that gives the player benefits for not just \u003Cem\u003Ewhat \u003C/em\u003Etheir space program has accomplished (Science), but \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E they did it. This relates to lifter, payload, and overall mission design. Real space programs don\u0027t build custom lifters for each mission, or these days even custom boosters for each lifter (eg Delta IVH, Falcon 9, etc). I think players should be encouraged to re-use and develop their designs instead of building from scratch every time. Not that you would be limited from building from scratch if that\u0027s what you want - go nuts! But there should be a cost incentive to re-use\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that we are mostly talking about engines so far, because they are the most central parts in KSP and are easy to define upgrades for. Please feel free to suggest appropriate upgrades to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow an Engineering system would work:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe system would focus on keeping track of what you have launched - let\u0027s call it \u0022Engineering Experience Points\u0022 (EEP). Once you have unlocked a part, you gain 1 EEP towards that part for every one you launch. Build a rocket with 1 central LV-45 and 4x LV-45 boosters? That\u0027s 5 EEP for LV-45s from a single launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther possibilities for earning EEP include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Inspecting parts in orbit after their operation, like taking a Kerbal EVA to take pictures of an upper stage engine after firing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Recovering used parts, and presumably tearing them down for inspection\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Test firing engines on the pad\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are clearly concerns with balance and the potential to \u0022farm\u0022 EEP from the last one - these must be addressed. Economics will play a strong role here, and test firing engines must incur significant expense for this system to work. If cost recovery is 100% for used craft, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52318-Engineering-system-to-complement-Science-based-tech-tree?p=690580\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post690580\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eboomerdog2000 points out\u003C/a\u003E that it won\u0027t be long before people are launching 25-Nerva-powered rovers and recovering them immediately to gain the EEP. It might be important to define a \u0022launch\u0022 more strictly for EEP purposes, and award points only for orbited parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, this type of balancing would be done later on in development; the current focus is to get the core concepts of the EEP system fleshed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor each part:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach EEP would marginally reduce the cost of the part. This wouldn\u0027t be huge or game-breaking: I\u0027m thinking a maximum of 25% cost reduction after around 500 EEP or some other large number. The cost curve would be smooth, meaning that every EEP gives you a small benefit instead of having EEP thresholds. The curve would not be linear but pretty heavily front-end loaded: after 20ish EEP you would see a 10% cost reduction, it would take 100 EEP to get to 15%, 300 EEP to get to 20%, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, at certain EEP thresholds you would unlock new versions of the part that would increase the cost but improve the performance. There are two ideas going for how the upgrades should be handled:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1) NASA-style \u0022block upgrades\u0022, where the Block A/B/C/D/E designs are fixed and there are 3-5 of them.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeilC\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52318-Engineering-system-to-complement-Science-based-tech-tree?p=697927\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post697927\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoriginal intent\u003C/a\u003E was for upgrades that continuously improve the engine within the confines of its type: LV-T30s and Mainsails are first-stage/booster engines so their upgrades improve thrust and sea-level ISP, while LV-909s and Poodles are upper-stage engines so their upgrades would raise vacuum ISP and lower weight. These upgrades would stack, so each block improves on the previous one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic cost structure for these block upgrades looks something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DChurchill\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DChurchill\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA costs $100\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI develop B, A now costs $90, B costs $100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI develop C, A now costs $80, B costs $90, C costs $100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have an interesting choice to make: do you build the good old Block A for cheaper, or pay for the fancy new Block C?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52318-Engineering-system-to-complement-Science-based-tech-tree?p=697185\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post697185\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ealternative idea from Zaeo\u003C/a\u003E is to have each block upgrade be more suited to a different role so that you could specialize your engines to your current mission. In this case the block upgrades would not necessarily stack, and each one would be a more substantial bonus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, this would be implemented as a \u0022tweakable\u0022 in the VAB interface, not a separate part - we don\u0027t want 5 copies of each engine in the GUI!

They start out at stock values on the left, and each parameter can be increased to a max of stock \u002B15-25% subject to balancing. Every increase adds cost to the part as well. You can move any of them freely, but the max total improvement is limited by your current EEP - spend it all in one place, spread it evenly, or keep building cheaper stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFor each Subassembly:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis concept also applies really well to the new stock Subassembly system. Every time you launch a subassembly - lifter, booster, payload, whatever - you gain EEP with it and the cost starts to come down with the same sort of curve. the shape is up for debate, I would suggest a smaller (15%?) max benefit at less EEP (200 max?) but also less front-end loading - you learn less about welding things together with each part than you do about engine design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would only apply to assemblies that are re-used without changes. If you loaded and changed a subassembly, you would be prompted to either overwrite and lose all EEP or save as a new subassembly. The idea is to encourage re-use of common modules and improve your space program\u0027s efficiency by developing new things to do with existing hardware - like if NASA had actually done anything the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Applications_Program\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EApollo Applications Program\u003C/a\u003E suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAstropapi1 \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52318-Engineering-system-to-complement-Science-based-tech-tree?p=698189\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post698189\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epoints out\u003C/a\u003E that it may be difficult to get the cost reductions to play nicely with the subassembly system when you are repeatedly adding/removing multiple subassemblies. More investigation is needed here once we get to play with the new system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these numbers are subject to balancing, of course, and my intent is these should not be overwhelming benefits that give you an incentive to stagnate your program on 1.25m engines.
