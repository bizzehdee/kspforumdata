Beyond that a ship has new storage pods which weight slightly more than the value of what they contain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that rather than launching a whole base and rovers up already assembled, you send all the components disassembled and tightly pack, but slightly heavier in a storage canister. It gets there. You build your base, or rovers, or new rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome details:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuels would not be transportable in this state. Only empty fuel pod which have been (In theory, not shown) broken down into sheets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would be a limit to storage set somewhat less than the specific canisters perceived mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be possible to define a construction as \u0027Base\u0027 meaning parts could be sunk into the ground and would not be physical, allowing larger bases with decreased lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, if you flipped a rover, and broke a wheel off, but it was not destroyed, it would be possible to reattach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the limit in build distance between the storage and the building site, it might mean the player would end up building cargo transports and transfer the cargo between a docking port somewhat like fuel transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also argue that kerbals should have a single inventory slot for one part. Perhaps limited to under a certain mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T22:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready a mod..
