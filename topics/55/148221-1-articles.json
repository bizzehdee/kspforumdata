Are you satisfied with how it works currently ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe action menus seem attached to the camera : they remain displayed even in EVA as long as you stay close to the parts, but disappear when you are too far away (until you right click / pin them again). I personally would prefer if the action menus where bound to their vessel : If you go into EVA or switch vessels you don\u0027t see the action menus anymore, but when you switch back to your vessel, you would still find your action menus where you pinned them. What do you think about it ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe that\u0027s not the easiest thing to explain by text, please tell me if that\u0027s not clear enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
