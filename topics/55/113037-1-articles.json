Every now or so I find that an aircraft is too high above the ground, but becomes too low with other, lower sets.\n\nI believe that the fairings, while being a good concept, still need a rework - The textures are rather odd, they separate in a \u0022confetti-like\u0022 manner, and all the like.

So it\u0027s easier to develop a plane with CoL and CoM together.\n\nThis is not true. Most, if not all, horizontal stabilizers generate lift. A majority of them actually generate negative lift to counteract the pitch-down effect from having the center of mass in front of the center of lift, like most aircraft do. Having the COM in front of the COL is more stable than having them perfectly matched, and gives a bit more leeway in the weight and balance configurations."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:35:51Z","Content":"A small texture pass would be nice, but is not overly concerning."},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T03:46:11Z","Content":"Time is still basically meaningless in gameplay terms."},{"CreatedByName":"Perry Apsis","CreatedById":97519,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T04:43:04Z","Content":"Lights should be much brighter when you look directly at them.

I\u0027m playing since two or three weeks, and I\u0027m already feeling that the process of **gathering science could be more interesting**.\n\nIt would be nice to have more reason to perform experiments and seek for science on distant places. More than the mere collection of science points to unlock parts. Because in the end I am unlocking parts to repeat the same pattern on a different environment/planet. The process is becoming a bit repetitive.\n\nIt would be great to have a variety of reasons to spend more time exploring distant planets and for building science stations in their orbit. Perhaps more exploration with the purpose of mining, or for identifying where to perform some specific experiments, or where to place a base so that\u0027s optimally located.\n\nAn other things I would like to see in KSP is the necessity to take in account for the **survivability of the crew**. Oxygen, food, water, electric energy, etc. Perhaps newbie could switch it off in the difficulty panel. Having to consider those factors while sending a manned craft instead of a probe would help balancing when choosing the former or the latter option."},{"CreatedByName":"Requia","CreatedById":112924,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T20:57:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Lights should be much brighter when you look directly at them.
