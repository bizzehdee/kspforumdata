Hopefully someone can change the code to allow modders, or hell, even the KSP devs, to generate asteroids elsewhere. I think it\u0027d be great to see random asteroids show up in belt orbits, or Jool trojans, or whatever. Would help make the rest of the solar system really come alive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T18:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we need are more boxes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JohntotheBrogan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JohntotheBrogan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhere are the meteor showers, comets and asteroid belts??\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know exactly where they are.
