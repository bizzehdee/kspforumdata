It allows designs to have more visual mass without having to add heavy fuel tanks. The problem is that it only comes in one size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy simple suggestion would be to add a variety of structural fuselages that come in the different fuel-tank sizes for both 1.25m and 2.5m parts. So essentially, there would be a structural fuselage counterpart to each fuel tank currently in-game. This would add a lot of versatility to rocket designs for aesthetic and functional purposes. It would also be fairly easy to implement, because they\u0027re just cylinders.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrxak","CreatedById":25597,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T06:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see a lot more structural parts, in general, of varying lengths and sizes and shapes.

I too use the 1.25m radial attachment point and structural fuselage parts a whole lot while building, and I would really like to be able to make some 2.5m things such as large roving tankers and space station modules that aren\u0027t purely shaped and sized based on the parts that have a specific utility - padding is extremely useful in some cases. Also on my wish list: 1.25 fuselages as long as the 90-unit and 45-unit fuel tanks. This must be one of the easiest part sets to model and implement in the game, since they literally do nothing except snap on to something else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-26T17:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe perfect option would be to be able to put a structure/tank and just select \u0022make battery, make fuel tank, make structural, make strut\u0022 etc. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-27T00:53:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Escrew aesthetics, I want these because I want to use just one part to extend my rocket, not fifteen combined girders and struts that will buckle in a stiff wind.
