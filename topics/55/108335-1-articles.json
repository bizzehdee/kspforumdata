What\u0027s needed is a second part in the same style, but suitable for mounting on a wing attached to the middle of a mark 1 tank. I.e. existing small gear for mounting to the bottom of the body, longer variant for mounting to wings, and the combination of the 2 used together resulting in a plane that is horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
