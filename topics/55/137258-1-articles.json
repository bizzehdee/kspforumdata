One the surface very often is the emptyness of the mode \u0022story wise\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe SQUAD should consider adding some kind of story mode, where the space program advancement would be molded on some story line.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already seen more than enough fan lore to create an interesting, and Kerbally funny story. It would also allow for some \u0022 lore harmonisation\u0022, as we would now have an official version of what the Kerbals are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick Idea, just to show what i mean:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s year 0 of the new Kerbalian era. After having lived for many many centuries hidden in their underground cave, the Kerbal mold people scientist realised alarmed that there was a problem with the planet Kerbin core. For some unknown reason, temperature are rising, drying out the cave and making it harder and harder for little Kerbals spores to hatch into fully formed Kerbals. With the normally reckless nature of Kerbals, we have now reached \u00E0 point were deat surpass birth. As it have been deemed impossible to manage Kerbin core temp\u00E9rature, a group of the more elite Kerbals (still) alive was sent to investigate the surface. Will they find a way to save Kerbalkind?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvidently, this would require \u00E0 new tech tree, allowing to first explore Kerbin, then after some test one discovery that the surface is no better for Kerbals survival. Yet, they saw this rocks in the sky, maybe there is cave there that could house Kerbalkind. So we move to space travel, where we evidently learn Mun and Minmus won\u0027t do (not even an atmosphere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHiring crew could be changed, you invest found to grow new spores to maturity, but they start dumb and fearful. You gotta spend science to make the growing techniques better and get smart and courageous Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final focus of the game would then be the explore the system in order to find that spot where Kerbalkind could survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s first draft Idea, feel free to comment and hopefully add flesh on my Idea bones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also got every right to think it\u0027s a bad Idea, just stay civilised about it please!

That way reusing would actually make sense. You start off with small engines and go bigger and better.
