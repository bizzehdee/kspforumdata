Their mass-per-crew-member is just way out of whack from everything else. The lander can is especially ridiculous-- why should having 2 crew instead of 1 cause it to have 4 times the mass? It\u0027s so bad that I never use that part if I can possibly help it, and certainly never in a \u003Cem\u003Elander\u003C/em\u003E (those are usually small craft, and therefore the command pod tends to be a big part of the craft\u0027s mass).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only time I ever use the 2-kerbal lander can is when I\u0027m building a very large, massive orbital ship with a 2.5-meter stack, and need the command pod to be inline with other components-- a situation where the can\u0027s outlandishly high mass doesn\u0027t matter as much (since it\u0027s a relatively small fraction of total ship mass), and the convenience of 2.5m-to-2.5m form factor outweighs other considerations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is kind of ironic, given that the avowed purpose of the pod is to be in a lander.
