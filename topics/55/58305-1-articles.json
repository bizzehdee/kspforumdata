It will alleviate the 3.2gb memory limits and thats it. You problem sounds like integrated or otherwise very outdated graphics. Is it a laptop per chance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven so, you will not see a 300% increase regardless of the optimising they do, which means you aren\u0027t going to get above the 30\u0027s for FPS while looking around. Not without an upgrade. For that matter, i doubt they\u0027ll achieve a 200% performance bump overall through optimising, so I doubt you\u0027d ever see 20\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve turned everything off and performance is still so poor, that\u0027s a very clear sign that what you have is not the right tool for the job. And it doesn\u0027t matter what the game is, its always true. Once you have to turn everything off and it still runs poor, the message is clear. What you have doesn\u0027t match up to what they saw as the minimum viable hardware. Maybe it was good when you bought it, maybe it was low end, i don\u0027t know and it doesn\u0027t matter.
