The ability to transfer exposed mystery goo or materials from a science bay directly to another module would make less sense though, it should at least require a Kerbal to go EVA to do it if it\u0027s going to be possible at all and perhaps should result in some loss of stored science value to account for the Kerbal having to handle goo in zero-g while wearing bulky space suit gloves instead of doing it in on the ground in a well equipped R\u0026amp;D facility.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour data transfer idea goes nicely with my suggestion about transferring surface samples and EVA reports from one pod to another: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53588-Ability-to-transfer-surface-samples-EVA-reports-etc-between-docked-ships\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/53588-Ability-to-transfer-surface-samples-EVA-reports-etc-between-docked-ships\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpeach","CreatedById":34566,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T23:50:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven for the sciences bay it make science:you can alway take the Goo and put it in another bay!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrHotdog","CreatedById":88572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T00:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022 data-cite=\u0022goldenpeach\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEven for the sciences bay it make science:you can alway take the Goo and put it in another bay!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but as with the goo cannister the science in the science bay is in the form of samples (it is implied in game that the science bay is a collection of materials science experiments). For it to make sense to transfer the stored science from one module to another in space you do have to assume that they have been designed so that it\u0027s possible for a Kerbal in a space suit without specialised equipment to open the container, extract the samples without damaging them (much) and put them into the other container. You can argue that one either way, while having transferable samples is undeniably useful making it possible to do in space would add significantly to the complexity of the science modules so there isn\u0027t a compelling reason to assume it would definitely be the case. Personally I don\u0027t have a problem with this being made possible but I think it should definitely have to be done via EVA if so and should involve a small science value penalty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith data based science it is obviously different, it makes sense for that to be easily transferable with no loss. With surface samples I think it\u0027s reasonable to assume that a bag of Mun rocks or whatever could be chucked through a docking port into another pod if required. EVA reports are part data (hence the 50% transmission rate) and, presumably, part memories of the Kerbal that did the EVA so stored EVA reports should follow the Kerbal if they move from one pod to another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
