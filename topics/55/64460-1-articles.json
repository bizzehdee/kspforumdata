I fly with a Joy Stick and in order to map all the controls properly, it took me quite a bit of back-and-forth of going in game, trying the controls that I mapped out, realizing that Axis 0 needs to be inverted (for example), quitting to the main menu, making adjustments to the controls, trying it in game again, then realizing I didn\u0027t map the controls for EVA, quitting back to the main menu...etc. This would be much easier if i could fly into space, pause the game, adjust the controls, test them, make adjustments as needed, test them again \u0026amp; be done with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, only a few of the graphics settings are available in game. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s because changing these settings would require the game to be reloaded or something. It would be nice to be able to change these settings in game too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some thoughts. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll have more to come too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shna_na","CreatedById":14950,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T23:04:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPretty much all of the graphical settings in the game can be changed. I assume you\u0027re referring to changing them in-flight though, yes? If so, I kind of agree, though I wouldn\u0027t like to see development time being spent on this. It\u0027s time out of development being spent on something that\u0027s pretty minor in terms of gameplay. I\u0027m not even sure if it\u0027s possible, but then again I know nothing about programming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T13:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUsually you see in most games that most graphical settings cannot be changed while, we\u0027ll say the renderer is being used. So that\u0027s often a main-menu function only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d imagine that someday we should have the ability to map controls from the pause menu. What would really be great is being able to have a control scheme cycle so you can alter your controls based on what kind of ship you are flying. Kind of like being able to switch between staging and docking control and the game shows you what control set its using at that time. Much like switching camera modes you could hit a button and change the control scheme on the fly (like say you have a rover that all of a sudden needs to be flown like a lander, so you you hit a button and switch between rover and rocket controls), maybe even attachable to an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
