I expect that such a feature would be technically challenging, since mod loading happens at program startup time, before a particular save has been loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m asking for here seems like it would be technically simpler, since it would be at app startup. To make it work, the program just needs to have a \u0022manifest\u0022 that specifies what parts/files/etc. are part of the core game, along with their fingerprints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere would need to be some handling of edge cases, such as if the stock game has been manually tinkered with, but that seems straightforward, just have the game compare the stock files that it\u0027s looking for against their fingerprints in the manifest and show a warning if any are missing or altered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d need to find some way of dealing with save games, i. e. what happens when a player tries to load a modded save while in safe mode, but that doesn\u0027t seem like a showstopper. Since it\u0027s a debug tool, it would probably be OK to take some simple shortcut such as having a separate \u0022safe mode saves\u0022 folder, or the like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-25T23:36:28Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2015 11:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T23:18:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, a stock only mode would be nice\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T00:47:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP has no drm.

That\u0027s what I was trying to say. I do this for every version that comes out. Start with a stock-only install. Copy and paste to a new folder, then add mods. If the modded version acts up, you can go back to the stock install to verify whatever. Even to go as far as differentiating between modded installs. The \u0022readout mods\u0022 like KER are pretty safe. Visual mods however are resource intensive and may or may not justify additional installs depending on your pc\u0027s capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-31T18:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh yes, quite so.
