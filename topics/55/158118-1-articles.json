So \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E can be holding pitch for you. Your craft can be rolled a bit and you want to level out. You inputting roll-only commands for some reason turns off the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E hold-pitch inputs. So now you\u0027re rolling manually while pitching down unless you input some pitch as well. You may or may not have to add yaw input as well. It\u0027s an absurd system that made fine-tuning attitude nearly impossible without mods to compensate (Pilot Assistant being the primary one I used until I found AA; using both now.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway,\u00A0isolating the axes for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E goes a way to solving the wobble-after-input problem. (It\u0027s be only one axis you need to fight, not possibly all three.) Another thing that may help is limiting max control surface deflection (or deflection speed?) based on dynamic pressure. (Dynamic Deflection does the former.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would still find the method mentioned here useful as well. It does sound kinda dumb using only\u00A0an absolute zero-point (no trim control) rather than a relative zero-point (trim-based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I mentioned, all the axes are \u0022linked\u0022: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is all or nothing in stock. Either it has full control of your craft or you are in control. So trying to correct just one axis\u00A0manually (say, yaw) makes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E disengage completely until there is no more user input.

As such, it\u0027s pretty aggressive and coarse with adjustments. This can be havoc on controls depending on control surface area, atmospheric density, and speed. Fine Control mode mitigates this a little bit, but it depends on how fine you want your deflection rates to be.
