I have hit a small snag though it seems. Currently I\u0027m using them for control on re-entry. I\u0027m trying a dragon style Space X re-usable craft. With mid stage returning to Kerbin. However, when I \u0022flip\u0022 it back up, the control surfaces seem to be working in reverse. They will work one orientation (falling front first), but when I\u0027m flipped for landing, are then configured backwards, and control in the \u0022wrong\u0022 direction that I need. If I mount them backwards, they then won\u0027t help with re-entry, only for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn \u0022invert control\u0022 would allow me to flip their control direction when flipping the crafts flight direction. Without this, I\u0027ll have to use a ton of SAS to flip, and the breaks for landing instead. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI admit that it may just be me and I\u0027ve got something on the craft back to front. So feel free to move this to the \u0022help\u0022 section. I may just need to play with COG/drag and control setups. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T22:26:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Technical Ben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
