It\u0027s got about half the thrust of a real-life RL10, which is in line with some other examples, (e.g., Vector vs SSME).\u00A0 There\u0027s also some piping on the side of the engine bell that might be expander cycle plumbing.\u00A0 This could also be the Descent Propulsion System from the Apollo Lunar Module.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESpark\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0- my best guess for this one is the Lunar\u0027 Module\u0027s ascent engine.\u00A0 The LEM-like lander can from Making History all but requires you to use a Spark if you want to do a staged ascent.\u00A0 If true, this strongly suggests that the Terrier is the descent engine (an perhaps the reason that neither LEM engine was duplicated for Making History).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a tangent, I would not mind seeing a few more of the original engines re-skinned.\u00A0 For example, since the F-1 is represented by the Mastodon, the Mainsail has no real-life analog.\u00A0 (After all the F-1 was the largest single combustion chamber engine ever flown).\u00A0 The Mainsail design is just also a little blah, in my opinion.\u00A0 It might spice things up for Squad to rejigger it into something like the Russian RD-170 engine, which had four\u00A0combustion chambers and bells, but more total thrust than the F-1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, the Rhino is kind of an odd\u00A0outlier at the moment.\u00A0 It has a few things in common with the J-2X concept for the Ares /\u00A0SLS, but the J-2 is now represented by the much smaller Skiff.\u00A0 And even more than with the Mainsail, the Rhino also seems too powerful for a single-combustion chamber engine.\u00A0 Perhaps they could also turn this one into a compound\u00A0engine.\u00A0 One idea would be a Mammoth-like conglomeration of 4-5 Skiff-like engines, somewhat like the Saturn V second stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-23T01:22:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2018 01:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-26T00:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
