It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not that can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwe could, theoretically. But I think that KSP being a game where you can build your own spacecraft, play the game in your own way, and have essentially a completely different experience from everyone else\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 the only thing tying these experiences together is that the universe is the same. So if we were to add procedurally generated planets outside the current solar system, you would end up with places and destinations that don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t exist for anyone else. And then it would fail in terms of you being able to relate to someone else\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s experience. You wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be able to say, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey guys, I landed on Duna, this was really cool!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 And everyone knows what Duna is and what it stands for. Instead, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d get, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHey guys, I found this planet, it looks kinda like this.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 And people would be like, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201COh...

Like Starbound.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way, someone can be like, \u0022I landed on the third planet of the second star in the system at (galactic coordinates)\u0022, and then, people might not \u003Cem\u003Einitially\u003C/em\u003E know what they\u0027re talking about, but they can just head for that system and find the exact same thing there. There\u0027s still a disconnect in that the galaxy would be too massive for everyone to come to know what it all contains, but that happens with anything on this scale. It\u0027s basically unavoidable without just rejecting the idea entirely, which seems like a really dumb idea when there are \u003Cem\u003Eso many people\u003C/em\u003E that want this to happen, or at least be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to the next point: If the devs won\u0027t implement it, they should make it possible for modders. Because if they just decided to stomp on the idea entirely and not even make it possible for modders to accomplish in some form, that seems like it would be a really big letdown to a lot of people, and it would probably mean less people actually buying the game. (unrealistic FTL travel is far more popular and therefore profitable than no FTL at all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll admit that I don\u0027t entirely understand the prioritization on realism (there are so many things in this game now that are still extremely unrealistic, and \u003Cem\u003EI think\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s been stated that KSP is a game first, and a simulation second), but if that\u0027s how they want to make their game, I shouldn\u0027t try to change that. All I ask is that they at least try to enable the people who \u003Cem\u003Ereally, really\u003C/em\u003E want this to happen to accomplish their goal without having to make another game entirely or have to do some extremely drastic, difficult, and loophole-y modding to make it work. I mean, implementing your own planets has already been shown to require extensive modding and workarounds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut currently I haven\u0027t seen Squad mention much about the potential relation between FTL, other stars, and their expansion packs. I\u0027d like to think that, since I think they said that the expansions would include content they don\u0027t consider to be within the scope of vanilla KSP, could they make it into an expansion? It seems like a good idea; people would pay good money for that. Plus, I think the fanbase would break in two if Squad decided to not make it into one (or, again, make it possible with mods.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso: Notice that I\u0027m not mentioning how exactly I think they(modders or Squad) should do it, what FTL system they should use, or anything like that. That\u0027s because that\u0027s not the point, the point here was explaining what can be done to solve the only problem I\u0027ve seen Squad pose with a procedural galaxy, and explaining why I think they should at least let the community do it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T03:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca
