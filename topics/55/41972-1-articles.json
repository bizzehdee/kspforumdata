Like I said, I was was just panning around my craft by left clicking and dragging the view around... just checking to see if everything was done right and there were no extra repetitions of parts due to symmetry bugs... and unfortunately I clicked on the NEW box by mistake and whoops... all gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also dragged parts for Subassembly Loader onto the wrong box (yeah, partially colour blind here) and it the part I want to save gets deleted like I\u0027ve dropped it in the bin. That\u0027s another thing I would like to see stop as well. Maybe have a dedicated bin area where parts you want to dispose of can go. Currently if you drop your part on the menu OR on the boxes at the top of the screen (bar the Subassembly Loader icon) and it\u0027s gone for good. Even Ctrl-Z doesn\u0027t undelete it if you drop it onto one of the menu items at the top of the screen. It\u0027s definitely a bug there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
