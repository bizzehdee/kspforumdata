That\u0027s when I got an idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that cities and landmarks are on the \u0022what not to suggest\u0022 list, and I also know it is a planned feature, but what if there was some kind of contest where modders would create cities, other players could vote, and the best, say, 10 cities would become part of the game? I\u0027m pretty sure that modders would love to see their work in the game, and I think this would also show the dev team how players visualize how kerbals live, which could lead to some very interesting ideas. Or maybe, instead of having people vote on it, devs would choose those they see more fitting. Also, I think this could also be expanded to landmarks and other geographic points of reference as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would, at the very least, give some ideas to the devs about how to approach this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I don\u0027t have much time in my hands, and I really suck at 3D modeling, but if you had the opportunity to have something you made in the final version of the game, would you take it? Even if there was no real reward (such as money or mention in game credits) involved?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T04:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo get the mod kerbtown allows placement of static objects but you gotta download content for it though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chi","CreatedById":67720,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-01T04:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know that there is a mod for adding cities, but I\u0027m talking about something more permanent and a little bit more professional looking. Right now, since everyone can make a city for kerbtown, most of them don\u0027t look that great or kerbal-ish enough. By making a competition, the objective is to unite modders in a single, massive project, and thus creating much better quality material.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
