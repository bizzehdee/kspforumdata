Anyway simply put is I think there should be more gain for placing something in space and leaving it there for extended periods. Currently you rarely ever have more than one active mission at a time, because once you launch something and finish the goal you had in mind you leave it/return it and move on, because it has no value anymore. The idea is simple and non-game breaking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start I would like to say all the current aspects of science should stay, they are good and I like them, this idea adds to it rather than changes it. I feel there should be modules you can launch that when activated start to accumulate science over time, not an unlimited amount and not at a constant rate. There should be an estimated amount of time for the experiment to run, and this should put you in a position where you want to put something in orbit for an extended amount of time rather than launch it, orbit once, and land or forget. As time passed I think the experiment could be tied to \u0027Discoveries\u0027, a chance based phenomena that gives a good amount of science and possibly unlocks a new module/s and/or increases the efficiency of others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effects of this would be, extended missions, also you may have to plan around personnel (For instance, placing your best scientist on an extended research mission rather than taking him on the mission to dune), as well as giving you a reason to keep space craft active after their primary objective is completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EThat\u0027s the majority of the idea, but there are some ideas that could add to it below.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor one, launching a survey mission to study the terrain of a planet would be a good example of a long term science mission. I like the idea of sending not being able to see the terrain clearly until a survey probe has photographed and mapped it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother small idea would be that there could be contracts associated with certain research missions. For instance, a group giving you a part they want you to launch in to space for a set amount of time or attach to your \u0027official\u0027 space station for research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel this idea would add a lot of game play and put a lot more into running your space program\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T08:08:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat would prevent us from just time warping?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t have elements that give you something over time if there isn\u0027t something to punish doing nothing for long periods of ingame time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime doesn\u0027t matter in stock, if you don\u0027t have contracts active you can just timewarp 1000 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor something like this to be added more time based elements would be needed.
