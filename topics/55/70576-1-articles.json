I would also like to give kerbals a \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4promotion\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 And change their suit colour to say... Blue or somthing. For example in my save I have a kerbal called gilfren, he was hired to standing for the big three when they were on an eve mission, I would like to make him stand out more, it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, just add an extra line for each kerbal in the persistence.sfs. I would also like a kerbal attachment system way of moving parts around that can only be done by \u0027engineer kerbals\u0027 and science could only be refined in the lab by \u0027scientist kerbals\u0027 and piloting could be done by all, but a non-pilot must be trained (at the cost of science or somthing) in order to fly the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would only be implemented in career mode but would be optional in sandbox. Another thing the engineer kerbals could do, after more training is fix solar panels. I imagine a whole mini tech tree for each kerbal. It would be sort of like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPilot I. Scientist I. Engineer I\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket pilot II. Scientist II.

And the difference between a rocket pilot II and a space plane pilot II is a rocket pilot II allows access to multiple manoeuvre nodes, where as a pilot I only allows 1 manoeuvre node, and a space plane pilot II allows access to more science in the atmosphere (such as the goo and materials bay becoming realtive to biome whilst flying).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals would start off with traits much like the stupidly and bravery traits we have now which will determine how much science would be needed to train them, so a really stupid kerbal would require x3 as much science to train than a \u0027intelligent\u0027 kerbal, but the kerbal might be really brave so he could be trained as a pilot really cheaply. You wouldn\u0027t be able to train them once you reach the third level (rocket pilot II, scientist II or engineer II or space plane pilot II) because they would already be specialised in said area and it would make it unrealistic (I know it\u0027s just a game but considering the entire system I just made up, it would be a shame if you could just make a super kerbal, as it would ruin the whole purpose of a role-playing game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd allowing non-standard Latin characters in the titles of ships with out them glitching out (by non Latin characters I mean things like \u00C3\u00C2\u00B9\u00C3\u2018\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00C2\u00BE\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C3\u00C2\u00BD\u00C3\u00C2\u00BF\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B4\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BE ect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: this takes the record for my longest post\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T12:46:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be much more interested in seeing core functionality added to the game to give information (eg; KER, MJ, VOID, KAC, docking alignment) and purpose (SCANSat, RT2, Kethane) rather than anything specific for career mode. Nothing that is done with career will stop us being able to do things \u0027our way\u0027 in sandbox, of course, but by definition career will always be \u0027one way\u0027 to set objectives and structure missons. At the moment it\u0027s \u0022get science so you can get parts\u0022, which is just a difficult way of getting to sandbox. 0.23.5 is a big improvement over even 0.23 and I\u0027m looking forward to seeing what the team does with career, and the rest of the game, but don\u0027t need to \u0022score points\u0022 to give me a sense of achievement.
