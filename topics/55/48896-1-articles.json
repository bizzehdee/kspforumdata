Get out, do EVA report, get in, transmit, get out, do EVA report, get in, transmit, get out, do EVA report, get in, transmit etc... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though I\u0027m sure a Kerbal that did his 5th EVAmight still have learned something worth sharing, this grinding for science points is a problem. (As it is pointless, booring and should be offshored.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there should be a link between unlimited energy and reports... If you have nlimited energy, your only limiting factor is the time to do the science, (for example the measurements you take during launch, you can only do so many before you are in orbit. Same for science you are doing while buzzing at high speed past an object when you are not in a stable orbit.) so maybe a continues measurements button, where you automatically keep recording and transmitting over a period of time to get all the science points you can get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe points you get from bringing something back home, should be seperated from the data you can transmit. Brining a termometer back from space is pointless, but the value of rocks brought back from a mission is priceless. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThinking about it... \u0022value....priceless\u0022 maybe the value of bringing something back should be in cash. You can sell the stuff for money that came back from space. It\u0027s no longer about science it\u0027s about money.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T07:21:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022running\u0022 data-cite=\u0022running\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe points you get from bringing something back home, should be seperated from the data you can transmit.

That would be a simple fix to the problem: Pure data - like numbers from science instruments, should be worth the same if transmitted as if carried back manually (if they\u0027re carried back all that means is you\u0027ve carried paper copies of the electronic data you already sent. ) But, physical items, like samples, must be returned to be worth anything. So you completely split up the data into:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstrument Information only - transmission just as good as returning - so no reason to return it. (100% value for transmission).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhysical things - samples and material bays - only worth something if returned: (transmission disabled- no value for transmission).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat gives you two different types of mission to go on, without a lot of overlap between them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
