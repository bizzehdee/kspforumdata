Yes, \u0022because I can\u0022 appeals on some degree, but not when I\u0027m playing career mode. In career mode, I need a valid requirement in order to build it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027d love to have a REASON to build an SSTO in career mode. And I can only think of two reasons to have an SSTO:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Building a rocket takes time, whereas if you have already built an SSTO, it would essentially be ready to go. So, a \u0022needs immediate rescue\u0022 thing would be a good excuse to have an SSTO ready. Of course, in KSP, building a rocket takes no time at all, so none of that really applies. Yes, I know there\u0027s a mod that puts rocket building time into the equation. But that\u0027s quite a time sink added to the game just to make SSTO\u0027s pertinennt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Require as a contract that something must be returned to the KSC to be successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice I didn\u0027t say \u0022must land at KSC\u0022. While that would definitely make an SSTO attractive. But just requiring that it \u0022returns\u0022 to KSC means that if something goes wrong and I have to land somewhere else on Kerbin, I can then dive into all sorts of contingency plans to get the stranded craft back to KSC. Heck, now there\u0027s even a reason for that huge cargo door on the plane (aka C5 door)....go fly where the downed capsule is that fell short of KSC and bring it back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn career mode, I\u0027ve RARELY ever landed on the runway, because....well...there was no reason.

To charge for recovering a craft is essentially saying that the cost of transporting the craft is actually \u003Cem\u003Ehigher than the value of the craft itself\u003C/em\u003E. That simply makes no sense. When they landed the space shuttle at Edwards AFB in California, it\u0027s not as if they threw it away and built a new shuttle in Florida because it was cheaper that way. I don\u0027t know what it cost to move the shuttle from California to Florida, but I\u0027m willing to bet that it was a heckuva lot cheaper than the cost of a new shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a practical note: if you were to implement such a feature, all you will accomplish is get people to throw away craft more. Gee, here I am, I just landed my 20-ton ship successfully on Kerbin. So I simply don\u0027t recover it. Or, I mount a decoupler and pop off just the little command pod, and recover \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E. It means if I\u0027m in orbit with a 20-ton ship, then instead of being rewarded for the challenging task of actually landing the whole thing on Kerbin, I have a financial incentive to throw away as much as possible and just land the command pod. That seems totally bassackwards to me. Yes, it\u0027s better to land near KSC than far away. But it\u0027s also better to land far away from KSC than it is not to land at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to encourage general ship landings near KSC: that\u0027s a particular play-style choice, and it seems to me that that\u0027s what strategies are for. Maybe add a strategy that appeals to the spaceplane folks? There are a lot of ways to slice it, but one way it might work would be: if you adopt this strategy, then you get a bigger financial reward for completing contracts, at the cost of increasing the cost of all components at build time (doesn\u0027t matter if you recover them, right?) and maybe increase the distance penalty for recovering craft. This would give you much of what you\u0027re proposing, but people who don\u0027t like it can simply not adopt that strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to the OP\u0027s idea of having bring-it-back-to-KSC contracts: I think that\u0027s a brilliant idea, would love to see it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Adds a fun challenge for everyone, and if you happen to want to do that with an SSTO, so much the better.
