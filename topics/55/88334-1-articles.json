Although I understand this has been discussed a lot before, there was one more thing I wanted to suggest before giving up because it seems particularly easy to implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about letting us set each tank\u0027s draining priority number in the stage hierarchy under its tweakables? As I understand it now, tanks within a given stage are drained in the order of furthest from the motor to closest. Simply allowing us to set that order rather than have it be always pre-determined by the physical arrangement of the tanks would make keeping things balanced immensely easier. It would be better still if we could assign two tanks the same priority within the stage so that they would drain simultaneously. I apologize if I am beating a very dead horse here, but something like this just seems so dirt simple to implement and IMO would improve the gameplay experience so much that I feel it bears some harping on. Anyway, I would love to hear whatever anybody else might have to say about this question or what the devs plan to do about it if anything.
