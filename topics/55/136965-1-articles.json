None of them seem to work, unless I install the Fly-By-Wire mod. It\u0027s a nice mod, but can the software of the mod be made stock? There are a few issues I would like cleared so using my joystick and gamepad is less buggy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T23:45:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you be more specific on the issue?\u00A0 I know controllers are something Squad has struggled with but simply referencing the functions of a mod doesn\u0027t help a lot unless you explain them in detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-15T00:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222514387\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136965\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460677537\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022110959\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n40 minutes ago, Alshain said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you be more specific on the issue?\u00A0 I know controllers are something Squad has struggled with but simply referencing the functions of a mod doesn\u0027t help a lot unless you explain them in detail.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy issue is that the button assignments I give to the mod can be incorrect as well as when I was assigning commands it would override other assignments.
