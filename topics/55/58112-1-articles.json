One type of engine may lose efficiency when made 2x bigger, another may gain it. Enlarged landing legs wouldn\u0027t be able to support proportionally enlarged loads as well etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jursh","CreatedById":98989,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T03:05:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vexx32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022vexx32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESuggesting new parts is one of the many things on the [thread=36863]What Not to Suggest List[/thread].
