I was thinking it would be really useful and very cool to have built into the game a unified panel, hopefully looking apollo-cool, that displayed the status/settings of all the parts, with the ability to do on-the-fly tweaks and limits right through that panel. It could be hidden on one side of the screen (right?) that can be brought up much in the way the navball works. This would not only look awesome (hopefully), but also add convenience so as not to have to click on every part to do ad-hoc tweaking. It\u0027d also make hard-to-reach parts accessible.
