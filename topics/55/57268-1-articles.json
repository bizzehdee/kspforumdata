Maybe a little bit, but generally the KSP forums are more civilized than other communities you find out there in the dark, untamed wilderness that is the internet. I don\u0027t see a problem with the idea of having difficulty sliders for certain things, but the thing is with KSP a lot of the difficulty is intrinsic - There\u0027s just a certain basic level of ingenuity and wit required to get the hang of rocket building and space flight that you simply can\u0027t quantify with a difficulty slider. So while you may be able to set the difficulty for things like \u0022how much science you get per experiment\u0022 or \u0022how quickly your engines overheat and explode,\u0022 past a certain point you just gotta learn and grow on your own. Fortunately there\u0027s a whole community here to help with that! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jcraft","CreatedById":42471,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T11:20:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile adding science-gain adjusting slider would be nice idea, ultimately it doesn\u0027t seems to be a good solution to balancing the tech tree - in my opinion what we need in this case is not less science to get, but more advanced tech nodes to unlock - tech nodes that would require substantial amount of science but in return give really advanced techs like upgraded nuclear engines or even fusion drive at some point. Science system needs simply much more things to unlock - no less science to get.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
