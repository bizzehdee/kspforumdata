I think that it would make sense that after the bulk of the game is finished AFTER version 1.0, the devs should start work on transferring KSP over to a new engine. Once they have that whole job of rewriting and re-implementing done, than KSP version 2.0 is born. The engine could be their own custom engine, or could just be a different, more well-fitted engine for KSP and KSP\u0027s genre.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ringerc","CreatedById":128140,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T05:47:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis suggestion appears under the \u0022don\u0027t suggest\u0022 stickied topic. Because, well, it\u0027s hard, and not a good use of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot overstate how hard moving to a new engine is. Even upgrading to the latest Unity would\u0027ve been a lot of work. A new engine means making a new game that re-uses most of the design and the assets (sounds, meshes, textures, bitmaps, etc) of the old one, with some tweaks and conversion. It\u0027s a great way to set progress back a couple of years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s another analogy for why it won\u0027t happen. You\u0027ve got a Ford, but the engine is getting a bit dodgy. There\u0027s a GM with wrecked bodywork, but a good engine. You can\u0027t just pull the good engine and slot it in anywhere; everything has to be compatible (or adapted to become compatible), from the engine mounts, to the transmission, instrumentation, auxiliaries (hydraulics, compressors, cooling, etc), and so on.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worse than that. It\u0027s more like \u0022You have a Ford with a wrecked engine, and a small jet engine from a Learjet that you want to use instead. Unfortunately it takes different fuel, it needs somewhere to send the searing hot exhaust, it\u0027s the wrong size, and it spins thousands of times too fast to use for direct drive of the transmission. So you land up taking the Ford apart, heavily modifying a few parts, and re-using them on the completely new vehicle you build around the new engine. It takes five years, and the result still doesn\u0027t work as well as either vehicle did originally.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t write software it\u0027s hard for me to fully describe how huge a job changing a game engine is.
