Feel free to move/merge this if this was wrong. I would also like to point out that I have been thinking of posting this for about a year, so these ideas are not something I threw together hastily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I do feel career mode in general is fun, but I miss something in career mode, and that is a Strategy layer. That\u0027s why I have some suggestions to make it feel like you are more in charge of a space program. Some of these things have been suggested before, I know, but again, my point is the sum of all these suggestions, not only one or two of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in order to make you feel like more of a manager of a space program I suggest the following (they are in no particular order, with for example point 1 being dependent on point 2 etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Have a weekly economics summary, where it is shown how many launches you\u0027ve made, the cost of rockets/planes launched, the income from recovery, the income from contract advances, the income from contracts completed, the weekly income from NAKA (see below), the weekly salary for all kerbonauts, the weekly pension fund for MIA/KIA kerbonauts etc. This summary would probably have to be tweak-able, so it doesn\u0027t show up every week of your year long journey to Jool, perhaps by progressing as the game progresses from weekly to monthly to yearly summaries.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Have overarching missions from NAKA (National Aeronauts and Kerbonauts Administration) where you are left with a choice of 1 of 2 to begin with - Explore space or -Explore Kerbin. (Later examples would be -Kerbins moons or -Inner planets, and -Space stations or -Outer planets) You would get (like a contract) some roots in advance and then some (diminishing) roots every week until the overarching mission is completed. You would also loose an increasing amount of reputation each week until you\u0027ve completed the mission (so you get an incentive to hurry up, but it should be so small that you can ignore it for a while if you like. Perhaps starting\u00A0 at -1 the first week and like -5/week after 10 weeks or whatever balance feels right.) You should be able to change mission should you like, but would then get a reputation hit (-100 or whatever) and loose out on the roots advancement. The point would be to make ordinary contracts \u0022side quests\u0022 and these mission \u0022main quests\u0022. Completing a main quest would give you quite a lot of reputation (but almost no more roots, since for example NASAs missions hardly gives any roots when completed, but a massive boost in reputation.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Only 1 allowed launch per Kerbin day (there already is the \u0022warp to next morning\u0022, why not use it for something useful). Maybe airplanes could be launched 2 times a day, if there is a way to prevent \u0022cheating\u0022, by launching rockets from the runway (for example the runway being destroyed very easily by rocket engines). This way, a maximum of 7 rocket launches in a week (and perhaps up to 14 plane launches), which is manageable for the summary in point 1. Perhaps this limitation should be upgradeable to 2 or 3 launches later in the game. Would also give a better momentum of the game in conjunction with the regular contracts, especially if their deadlines would be shorter. (And it is after all a bit unrealistic with unlimited launches each day, while the construction time mod feels a bit too limiting. I want to launch my rocket when I\u0027ve designed it, not wait for a \u0022random\u0022 period of time. Warp to next morning is fine I think, and quite intuitive in a gamey sort of way.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. An integrated wiki/self-updating encyclopedia, as proposed by me before \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/98052-wiki-integrated-into-ksp-career-mode/#comment-1685496\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E where suddenly the whole point of career mode would be to explore the entire Kerbal universe, filling in all the blanks in the encyclopedia/wiki. This could work well in conjuncture with point 2 in acting like an overarching \u0022main quest\u0022, something to go back to when you don\u0027t know what more you want to do, but at the same time not something you have to do, being free to explore/play as you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Exponential cost for the tech tree, where you simply can\u0027t unlock everything without leaving Kerbin SOI (unless, perhaps, you chose to focus on -Exploring Kerbin and -Space stations when asked by NAKA, and thereby unlocking better bonuses for the science lab enabling you to get much, much more science. So there should be a choice) so you really would have to \u0022struggle\u0022 to get to Eeloo to gather the millions of science required to unlock those last big fuel tanks (and then the next mission to Eeloo would become easier. The point being that the tech tree would be balanced so that you are always challenged to find that next science to unlock that next step, but would also be so abundant on worlds farther from Kerbin that it never would be considered grindy; one hard, long mission would be enough to unlock the next tech, you should not have to do 332 kinds of science on Kerbin to be able to unlock it. Unless you chose to, of course.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Delta-vee readout, coupled to science (based on/functioning like KER). Haven\u0027t checked the atmosphere disposition in lower and upper Kerbin atmosphere with the Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer? Then the delta-vee (KER) readout can\u0027t show you how the engines are expected to perform at different altitudes. Haven\u0027t landed a probe on Mun and done a gravity scan? Then delta-vee can\u0027t show you expected TWR on Mun. Etc. That would really (in conjunction with point 4 and 2) encourage exploring and simply be fun in my opinion. Talk about mission planning, where you have to send out \u0022scouts\u0022 to learn more of the planet/moon before actually doing your \u0022real\u0022 mission. It also gives unmanned exploration with science-gathering by radio a bigger place in the game by paving the way for the more complex but more rewarding manned missions. Of course, such a system would have to have very clear tooltips telling the player what experiment they need to run to unlock the requested feature in the delta-vee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat a long post this turned out to be. Sorry. Well, the point of these suggestions would be to change focus in career: the contracts would no longer be the point of career mode, the contracts would be a stepping stone, a helpful tool to explore the system, something which at the moment aren\u0027t encouraged at all. (In sandbox it shouldn\u0027t be encouraged, but in career mode, I really feel it should. As an overarching goal.) In my opinion, when you have done all the experiments in all the biomes, completing the in-game wiki/encyclopaedia in point 4, you would actually win the game (with an option to keep playing of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt feels like I had a couple of more points to suggest, but I can\u0027t remember them right now. Well, if anyone is interested in these ideas, a developer or a modmaker, I can expand my ideas more if you want. Otherwise, thank you for reading. (I do realize the chance of these ideas making it into stock or a mod is slim to none, but if they do, I would play the hell out of it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T21:27:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnytime someone wants to make the game more difficult I have to stick with you can simply turn science down to 10%.

My favorite is having a weekly budget with both income (like government funding) and expenses (like astronaut and staff salaries). Maybe upgrading a facility should not only have a one-time upgrade cost, but also increased ongoing maintenance and salary costs, since I can imagine the upgraded facilities require more personnel to run. This one change, all your other good suggestions notwithstanding, could make a HUGE difference in how KSP career plays.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobraA1","CreatedById":18757,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T07:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1 I\u0027d be fine with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2 - I like the idea of overarching missions.

The whole purpose of tech trees in games is to offer players a series of branching choices. If one branch of the tree is so strong that taking other branches first is unthinkable, then the entire point of having a tree rather moot. In the case of KSP as it currently stands, you have to go down the area with the science, otherwise you\u0027ll be hurting. It would be much better if the science stuff was integrated into the other areas of the tree, rather than having its own area.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVery little way to gain science via contracts. 4 science from a contract, when I need hundreds of science for the next item on the tree? That\u0027s a joke.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNot to mention very few contracts seem to encourage me to do things to get more science. I could probably get a lot more science if I weren\u0027t on a tight budget and needed the contracts to keep up on income.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI didn\u0027t do much on the Mun, and there\u0027s more I could do there. But, since I\u0027ve gone off to Minmus, the Mun stuff is gone now.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI would REALLY like a better way of assessing what science still needs to be done.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately, I think I\u0027d like some way to \u0022direct\u0022 the contracts I\u0027m getting. Some ability to say \u0022I\u0027d like to focus on science for a while,\u0022 or \u0022I\u0027d like to do some Mun missions for a bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArgenTum","CreatedById":136611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T07:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222443942\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133360\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457227434\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100398\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, Xavven said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe upgrading a facility should not only have a one-time upgrade cost, but also increased ongoing maintenance and salary costs, since I can imagine the upgraded facilities require more personnel to run.

And it would be a way to balance mid- to late game, where you often have very much money. If the upgraded facilities cost more every week, your budget would be bigger, but\u00A0you wouldn\u0027t necessarily have more (or at least not near infinit)\u00A0money to spend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for you wondering about my 1 launch/day suggestion, it is mainly a way to balance weekly costs. Otherwise you can do hundreds of launches in the first week, which is not only unrealistic, but would be kinda cheaty\u00A0if your expenses for the first week is in the area of 2000 roots or whatever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
