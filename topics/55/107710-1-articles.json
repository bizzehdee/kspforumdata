You\u0027d be able to position your camera arbitrarily in relation to any physics-enabled object or the surface of any planet in a way that mostly resembles the current external camera, but with some restrictions removed (i.e. no more restriction on panning the camera away from the focused object.) You\u0027d also be able to look out from any IVA within physics range, whether or not a Kerbal is present in the IVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome information elements (heat / drag overlays, resources, etc) would be available when focused on a physics-enabled object.
