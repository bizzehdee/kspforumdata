Maybe transmission values are too low, however, I think the new store-everything-in-the-pod system may also be op. I like being able to store stuff in my pod, but a limit would be nice, so I couldn\u0027t do all the biomes on Minimus in a single seat pod. (you know kerbals don\u0027t sample pebbles, it\u0027s they return a sack of rocks that makes Santa jealous) If this was the case, you would seriously consider the 40% transmission rate on an interplanetary mission, and you would most certainly bring a lab if Squad was to add storage to it or something.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, given that most of the \u0022experiments\u0022 are little more than readings anyway, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s such a big deal to be able to store lots of them at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT, it might be interesting to have surface samples actually ADD WEIGHT to the capsule as they\u0027re stored. You\u0027d have to plan a lot more for your return, trying to build in more delta-v to accommodate the surface samples too\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T13:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just use it on my space station because it looks cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
