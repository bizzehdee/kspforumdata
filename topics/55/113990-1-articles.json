The apollo capsule was 4.4 m and had only a small space devoted to astronauts. Kerbals are in the same proportion to their apollo pod and yet appear to take up almost all of the space. To be at the proportions in the IVA they would have to be 1 meter tall at the least, and looking from the outside it could easily fit seven kerbals, just like the CST-100 does. The shuttle has the same problem. In real life it had huge amounts of interior space and also fit an airlock and seven humans. Yet in KSP, the IVA shows four kerbals with barely any room. The new IVA\u0027s are awesome but both of these pods need to be re-done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T15:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Apollo capsule was 3.05 meters in diameter...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Orionkermin","CreatedById":91013,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T15:43:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stock IVAs are also already scaled up compared to the outside as well.
