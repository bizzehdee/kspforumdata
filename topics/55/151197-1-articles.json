I do really like the first idea. It\u0027s a great thing when doing apollo-style missions. Maybe something that would regonize different crafts, so you get the staging per craft. As if you can select more then one root part per rocket. You could think of the seperator in the stagemenu can fuction as a storage for a lander. Once you seperate the craft, the seperator thing unvolds as in a dropdown menu.

empty fuel tank, usually enough fuel remains (unless its a bladder style tank which is another story as you can kinda compress those until every last drop is used) to still cause some explosion (and tanks that are low on fuel should actually cause a larger explosion since the amount of vapor (the stuff that actually does the exploding) is greater.\u00A0 Filled tanks should burn for a long time, empty ones should create a large explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, while a bit off topic, i really think fuel tank explosions (if there is sufficient fuel inside) should create a shockwave and increase the heat level of parts nearby (tearing off very weak parts like science equipment, overheating weak parts, and most of all creating a chain reaction that will set off fuel tank stacks).\u00A0 Right now an explosion is purely visual, but itd be so much more immersive and fun if a 3.75m tank goes up and then has the explosion propagate through all nearby \u0022explosive\u0022 parts obliterating an entire stack of fuel tanks (not only is this realistic but i think its pretty damn kerbal to have the entire fuel stack go up in flames if one of the tanks blows)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-08T07:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022
