This mod would allow two players to interact with the same craft at the same time. Both of them in IVA mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Imagine having two of three seats in a Mk1-2 occupied by a live pilot and commander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey communicate with each other and handle different tasks. The commander can stage and fly during launch using the console buttons and MFDs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pilot can handle transposition and docking. He\u0027d also become the pilot for landings. Just imagine the voice chatter and feeling of immersion this would bring.
