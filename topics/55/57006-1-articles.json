Oh my gosh yes! The game needs to remember crew selection! Twice today I basically rage quit KSP because I got towards the end of a tedious mission realized I had forgotten to add a feature my rocket needed to complete the mission went back to the VAB changed said feature redid the mission and then again more than 15min of work in realized my empty pod meant to rescue a Kerbonaut had Bill and his stupid face sitting in it! (or filled hitchiker was now empty) This seems like an easy thing to change: When I hit save I mean save the whole ship including which seats should be filled. I can see difficulties in it being specific Kerbals but just someone would be an awesome start!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T09:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESuggestion : Rather than save Crew selection with the ship, why not save it only as we hit \u0022Launch\u0022 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say that because if you aborted a launch and decide to launch the same Kerbal another way, the game would need some filter/rules to avoid duplicating Kerbonaut.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T11:32:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaybe a way of designating which seats are to be filled by default and which are to be left empty at launch? i\u0027m more concerned about \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewhere\u003C/span\u003E they are sitting than \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ewho\u003C/span\u003E they are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeg: build an apollo style rocket/mission. but because the root part is the lander can my crew are seated there by default. leaving the CSM empty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaybe a way of dragging/changing the crew pod hierarchy?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-20T11:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, all it needs is to move the button right next to the launch button - so you don\u0027t forget to check your crew before you launch - and the crew pane to slide out on the other side so you don\u0027t have it too far if you want to adjust something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
