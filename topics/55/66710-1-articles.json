When you build your rocket, you have to look at those little arrows/triangles on the decoupler. They point at the side where it will decouple. Decouplers only disconnect one side, while stack separators disconnect both sides. Use a decoupler when separating stages of a rocket. Use a separator if you have two separate spacecraft that you want to break apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T14:36:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve experienced this issue, but only with KW and DRE decouplers used in conjunction with debug clipping (sometimes) and the KW struts.
