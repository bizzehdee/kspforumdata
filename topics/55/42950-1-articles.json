Maybe even just me. I have a stereoviewer (Victorian Viewmaster type thing) and enjoy making my own cards for it. I can take photo pairs pretty easily by just holding the camera over each eye in turn while taking a picture (as long as nothing is moving very quickly ... stupid pedestrians).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile retiring my old 0.18 save I had the idea of trying to take some stereo shots of my old workhorse ships. While I was able to achieve pretty good results just by hitting the screenshot key and then rotating the camera view slightly to the side and taking a second one, the speeds at which things are moving sometimes means that the planet below has moved far enough to mess things up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be pretty cool to have, possibly as a menu option, \u0022stereo screenshots\u0022. You hit the \u0022stereoshot\u0022 key and it pauses the game for a moment, takes a single screenshot, swings the camera to the right slightly and takes the second, maybe even labels them \u0022screenshot123-L.png\u0022 and \u0022screenshot123-R.png\u0022 to make keeping pairs together easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven with the crude method described above, I was able to make this pair - it is a \u0022cross your eyes\u0022 pair, so you don\u0027t the special viewer, just lean back, cross your eyes and then try and focus on the hitchhiker module in the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img829/6105/5p80.png\u0022 alt=\u00225p80.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
