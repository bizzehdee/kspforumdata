They have said several times essentially \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter every plane part reveal\u003C/strong\u003E that the rocket revamp is coming after the plane revamp is done. The simple fact of the matter is having started planes they can\u0027t leave them half done. What if porkjet leaves them as you are proposing he does? If that happened before planes were done it would create another division in style that their employment of porkjet for these revamps was trying to resolve, and so to at least insure that any division that may occur is as clean as possible they must progress through clear milestones the next of which being finishing planes entirely. They are progressing about this very reasonably and logically it\u0027s certain people\u0027s unwillingness to read that is perpetuating this attitude that the devs are really so dumb as to actually focus exclusively on planes with no intention of doing the same to rockets so I move that this thread is irrelevant.
