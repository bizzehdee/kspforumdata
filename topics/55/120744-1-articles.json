I would love to know, but I\u0027m afraid it has a fixed animation where it just lowers itself to a certain point and doesn\u0027t care if the ground resists it\u0027s opening powers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it seems like the network system will be based on Kerbin, not KSC, so if you\u0027re anywhere near Kerbin you\u0027ll always get the signal no matter if it\u0027s on the other side of the planet, or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-14T08:36:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2015 08:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T08:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Either all of Kerbin will be able to talk to the probe, or you\u0027ll gain that ability when you level up something (Probably the tracking station). We have not heard definitively on this, or if we have I missed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I don\u0027t understand this question.

All we have seen so far is parts that clip, or parts that do not clip but still fully animate. IMO the better of the two is clipping, considering the alternative is the comical but disastrous possibility that your cargo bay door will send your ship flipping into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
