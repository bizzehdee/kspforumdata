Not only on my own, but it allows me to spend both a fun time, and educational one at that with my nephew. So one afternoon, both of us (my nephew and I) were building a command module, and then we decided we wanted to build a space station and he and I both had the same thought. Why does the program make you start off with a command capsule before you can build, and secondly, if you build a really cool capsule, why can\u0027t you load it, and then load say, a delta IV booster set to connect to your already saved project. In other words, lets look at it like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Spend time building a cool Orion replica service module and saved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. In order to launch it, I have to build the boosters on top of the Orion replica. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption here: What if I just want to build the boosters so I can attach them to another neat item I want to put into space? Like a shuttle, or cargo, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, let\u0027s say you have the boosters configured, when you take away the command module, the rest of the items on the screen are now useless, unless you put another command module on the current screen, and you can\u0027t load something else, because it wipes out what is currently there. I\u0027m hoping this makes sense. Basically this is what I was wanting to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Create space station and save it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Create Orion service module and save it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Create Delta IV booster set and save it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when I want to launch either one, here\u0027s what I\u0027d like to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Load Orion Service Module\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Load Delta IV boosters, and attach to previously loaded Orion Module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing with space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Load space station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Load rockets to put station in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch station into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you guys do this? Would make the game a lot more fun, instead of having to load so many parts to get things going. Many thanks, and if this has already been discussed, I am sorry, but as I said, I\u0027m new to the game and am loving it. Also, why in the world does the game require so much memory (last count, it was holding on to 5 gigs of memory, and eating up my swap file rapidly...bringing the game to almost a stand still at times...) Many thanks, and fly safe everyone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHank:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-24T04:57:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP 0.22, you can already save partially-built vessels as as subassemblies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here\u0027s how your workflow would actually look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
