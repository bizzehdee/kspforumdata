Sadly I didn\u0027t manage to get a copy of 1.0 saved away to test in.\n\nThe rocket was built in Sandbox mode with, top to bottom: Mk16 parachute, Mk1 Command Pod with a Pilot Kerbal, 1.25m separator, FL-T800 fuel tank fully fueled, LV-T45 engine set at 51% max throttle and kept there for the entire duration of the launch. SAS was enabled on the launchpad prior to ignition and the rocket was kept pointing straight up until the fuel ran out, at which point I recorded the following values.\n\n0.9 with latest compatible version of NEAR:\n\nFlame-out at 83,566m. Final apoapsis 351,074m\n\n0.9 stock\n\nFlame-out at 35,434m. Final apoapsis 90-ish km\n\n1.0.1 stock\n\nFlame-out at 45,626m. Final apoapsis 141,060m\n\nAs we can see, the new-new aerodynamics are still slightly more lenient than the old stock aerodynamics, probably owing to drag occlusion alongside a more \u0022old-stock\u0022 like amount of drag. Having played with FAR/NEAR for a long time, I very much enjoyed the 1.0 aerodynamics and its lower amount of drag, but I can understand these changes if the goal is to have aerodynamics like old-stock with more realistic behaviour."},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:45:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The rocket was built in Sandbox mode with, top to bottom: Mk16 parachute, Mk1 Command Pod with a Pilot Kerbal, 1.25m separator, FL-T800 fuel tank fully fueled, LV-T45 engine set at 51% max throttle and kept there for the entire duration of the launch.

And FAR is imo a fantastic mod, but it\u0027s definitively not the right thing for stock KSP.\n\nThe new Aero is a compromiss: It has to be restrictive enough to allow and to some degree necessitate depth in plane construction, but it has to be lenient enough so you can still throw bricks into the sky, provided enough fuel and some special lifters. Of course that\u0027s a hard thing to do, there is no right balance. A realistic aero on the other hand \u0027only\u0027 needs to worry about being as realistic as possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T13:29:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerbis","CreatedById":124555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:27:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The main difference is the Isp drop from 0.90 to 1.01.\n\nYou\u0027re absolutely right, but the rocket still went further in 1.0.1 than 0.9 despite the dV difference!

My lift rockets weren\u0027t able to get to orbit when they could in 1.0.0, but \u0022equivalent\u0022 rockets in 0.90 had much smaller carrying capacities, so essentially the effort needed to get to space isn\u0027t really more after all. Rather it\u0027s simply necessary to build bigger rockets in this patch than the last one.\n\nAnd I may have discovered the secret to making stable rockets in 1.0.2: it\u0027s very, very sensitive about where the center of mass is vs. the center of drag / aerodynamic pressure. You can\u0027t see where that is in the editor, but it seems to generally be roughly in the middle of the ship. Thus rockets that drain their fuel from the top are doomed unless they have some pretty powerful fins. But rockets that drain their fuel from the *bottom* have a much easier time of things, or in other words, you have to block fuel flow to the engines and then run a fuel duct to them from the top of the ship. It\u0027s hard to make ships this way that aren\u0027t ugly, but once I started getting the hang of it my launches immediately became significantly easier. So, uh, \u0022pro tip\u0022 I guess.\n\nOh, and other pro tip, regarding landing big stuff in water (I may make a proper tutorial later): asymmetrical parachutes. Have most of the parachutes clustered around the empty center of mass (in rockets this is often surprisingly close to the bottom), and one or more pairs of parachutes at the far end, with the pairs on opposite sides of the rocket so it stays aerodynamically balanced, but NOT bound by symmetry. On one side, set them to open with the rest of the parachutes, e.g. at 500m, and on the other, have them wait until 50m. When the parachutes go off, the \u0022center of parachutes\u0022 will be off to one side of the rocket due to one side opening first, and the rocket will tip sideways. When the second group opens, the rocket will start to straighten out, but there won\u0027t (hopefully) be enough time for it to right itself all the way before landing. Thus on landing it will find itself tilted, and thanks to the improvements in 1.0 parachute behavior, the parachutes near the top of the rocket will stay open and guide it to a gentle repose.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T13:36:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by parameciumkid**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rithsom","CreatedById":114646,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T13:39:41Z","Content":"I didn\u0027t see anything wrong with the 1.0 aerodynamics.

You get a nice advantage with this; you can pick which propellant tank is close to the engines, and which is closer to the nose.

I\u0027m soooo confused.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know how helpful this is, but here\u0027s the old physics.cfg from 1.0:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     dragMultiplier = 6.0dragCubeMultiplier = 0.06angularDragMultiplier = 2liftMultiplier = 0.038liftDragMultiplier = 0.03bodyLiftMultiplier = 8aeroFXStartThermalFX = 2aeroFXFullThermalFX = 3.5aeroFXExponent = 3thermalMaxIntegrationWarp = 100spaceTemperature = 4solarLuminosityAtHome = 1360solarInsolationAtHome = 0.15convectionDensityExponent = 1convectionVelocityExponent = 3fullConvectionAreaMin = 0.2fullToCrossSectionLerpStart = 0.8fullToCrossSectionLerpEnd = 1.5machConvectionStart = 2machConvectionEnd = 3.5partEmissivityExponent = 4radiationFactor = 1convectionFactor = 40newtonianConvectionFactorBase = 1newtonianConvectionFactorTotal = 1conductionFactor = 10internalHeatProductionFactor = 0.03aerodynamicHeatProductionFactor = 1standardSpecificHeatCapacity = 800DRAG_TIP{\tkey = 0 1 0 0\tkey = 25 1 0 0}DRAG_SURFACE{\tkey = 0 0.02 0 0\tkey = 0.85 0.02 0 0\tkey = 0.9 0.0152439 -0.07942077 -0.07942077\tkey = 1.1 0.0025 -0.005279571 -0.001936768\tkey = 2 0.002083333 -2.314833E-05 -2.314833E-05\tkey = 5 0.003333333 -0.000180556 -0.000180556\tkey = 25 0.001428571 -7.14286E-05 0}DRAG_TAIL{\tkey = 0 1 0 0\tkey = 0.85 1 0 0\tkey = 1.1 0.25 -0.02215106 -0.02487721\tkey = 1.4 0.2287166 -0.01326022 -0.001389867\tkey = 2 0.275 0.03981932 0.03981932\tkey = 5 0.3333333 -0.003474526 -0.02333333\tkey = 25 0.1428571 -0.004285714 0}DRAG_MULTIPLIER{\tkey = 0 0.5 0 0\tkey = 0.85 0.5 0 0\tkey = 1.1 2 0 -0.6\tkey = 2 1.2 -0.5444444 -0.5444444\tkey = 5 0.6 0 0\tkey = 10 0.8 0.06700063 0.06700063\tkey = 14 0.93 0.006815632 0.006815632\tkey = 25 1 0 0}LIFTING_SURFACE_CURVES{\tLIFTING_SURFACE\t{\t\tname = Default\t\tlift\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 1.965926\t\t\tkey = 0.258819 0.5114774 1.990092 1.905806\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.9026583 0.7074468 -0.7074468\t\t\tkey = 0.7071068 0.5926583 -2.087948 -1.990095\t\t\tkey = 1 0 -2.014386 -2.014386\t\t}\t\tliftMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.3 0.5 -1.671345 -0.8273422\t\t\tkey = 1 0.125 -0.0005291355 -0.02625772\t\t\tkey = 5 0.0625 0 0\t\t\tkey = 25 0.05 0 0\t\t}\t\tdrag\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0.01 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.3420201 0.1 0.1750731 0.1750731\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.4 4.557837 4.557837\t\t\tkey = 0.7071068 2.828427 4 4\t\t\tkey = 1 4 4 0\t\t}\t\tdragMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0.25 0 -0.8463008\t\t\tkey = 0.15 0.125 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.9 0.375 0.7227947 0.7227947\t\t\tkey = 1.1 1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 1.4 0.65 -1.29191 -1.29191\t\t\tkey = 1.6 0.5 -0.4376471 -0.4376471\t\t\tkey = 2 0.42 -0.1475873 -0.1475873\t\t\tkey = 5 0.275 0 0\t\t\tkey = 25 0.4 0.0006807274 0\t\t}\t}\tLIFTING_SURFACE\t{\t\tname = BodyLift\t\tlift\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 1.975376\t\t\tkey = 0.309017 0.5877852 1.565065 1.565065\t\t\tkey = 0.5877852 0.9510565 0.735902 0.735902\t\t\tkey = 0.7071068 1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.8910065 0.809017 -2.70827 -2.70827\t\t\tkey = 1 0 -11.06124 0\t\t}\t\tliftMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0.3 0.167 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.8 0.167 0 -0.3904104\t\t\tkey = 1 0.125 -0.0005291355 -0.02625772\t\t\tkey = 5 0.0625 0 0\t\t\tkey = 25 0.05 0 0\t\t}\t\tdrag\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t}\t\tdragMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t}\t}\tLIFTING_SURFACE\t{\t\tname = SpeedBrake\t\tlift\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t}\t\tliftMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t}\t\tdrag\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0.01 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.3420201 0.1 0.1750731 0.1750731\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.4 4.557837 4.557837\t\t\tkey = 0.7071068 2.828427 4 4\t\t\tkey = 1 4 4 0\t\t}\t\tdragMach\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0.25 0 -0.8463008\t\t\tkey = 0.15 0.125 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.9 0.375 0.7227947 0.7227947\t\t\tkey = 1.1 1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 1.4 0.65 -1.29191 -1.29191\t\t\tkey = 1.6 0.5 -0.4376471 -0.4376471\t\t\tkey = 2 0.42 -0.1475873 -0.1475873\t\t\tkey = 5 0.275 0 0\t\t\tkey = 25 0.4 0.0006807274 0\t\t}\t}}\n\nI need this!

If you just go straight up to 10 km there\u0027s no way you can perform an efficient gravity turn.\n\n1.01/1.02 drag is more unforgiving if you want to perform an efficient gravity turn. While it only takes a couple 100 m/s more to get to space (3200 is my lowest so far), you have to be much more accurate so that the trajectory begins to flatten out just as the atmospheric density begins to drop really fast. If you pitch is a bit to weak you end up flattening out much higher than nessesary and you loose a lot more to gravity losses. Pitch a bit to hard and the trajectory will flatten while you are still flying through the dense atmosphere, and even if you can save it you are punished severely for it in atmospheric drag losses.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m no rocket historian, but I\u0027ve never heard of a rocket that drains from the top first. You\u0027d need to segment your tanks and put pumps in each one and the weight penalties would be enormous. \n\u003E In real rockets, fuel and oxidizer are in separate tanks, which each drain from their bottoms. You get a nice advantage with this; you can pick which propellant tank is close to the engines, and which is closer to the nose. The Space Shuttle put the LOX tank at the top of the external tank and the LH2 tank at the bottom. LOX is many times more massive than LH2 at the same volume, so the ET\u0027s CG was always nearer the nose. \n\u003E \n\u003E In KSP your tank just drains top to bottom as if the fuel and oxidizer were pre-mixed.\n\n\\*Ninjad\\*\n\nWhen made the core for my SLS mod I split the hydrogen tank from the oxygen tank to make sure this effect was present.... and it\u0027s really strong. Try as I might, I could not flip the core stage, even with the 30 degree gimbal range of the RS-25 engines. Anyway, real life rockets never deviate far from the prograde vector during atmospheric flight, because they do not have the structural integrity to survive the aerodynamic stresses this create."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T14:57:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When made the core for my SLS mod I split the hydrogen tank from the oxygen tank to make sure this effect was present.... and it\u0027s really strong.

Would the fuel:oxidizer mass ratio also affect it? KSP uses a nearly 1:1 fuel-ox mass ratio, whereas I believe in real rockets the oxidizer is a few times more massive than the fuel."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:06:15Z","Content":"I just tried a gravity turn that was pretty efficient both in FAR and in 1.0, in 1.0.2 and then launched the same rocket to 10km, cranked it hard 45, and then followed my old 0.90 gravity turn.\n\nThe old 0.90 gravity turn saved me about 50m/s ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nNOTE: This was with as aerodynamic a rocket as you can make in the early tiers.
