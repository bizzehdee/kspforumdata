This part then becomes available for you to build with so long as the contract is active. This is a very nice mechanic that lets you access some critical parts without having to research a whole node to get them (small landing gear I\u0027m looking at you). My problem with it though is that you don\u0027t get to keep the part after you complete the contract. I often find myself taking a contract and then ignoring it while I fly around with my shiny new part. I only complete the contract once I\u0027ve finally gotten around to actually researching that node. It would make sense if you got to retain access to the part after completing the contract and it would give you more incentive to do these types of missions (in addition to 1.0.5 making the testing contracts friendlier in general).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T02:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it seems to make more sense to me that I get to keep using the part and maybe get a small discount on the node science cost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould make the test contracts more feel less grindy if they had direct effect, instead of a generic \u0022reward\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
