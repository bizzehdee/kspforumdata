However the problem with this is it kills pretty much every single VTOL design in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the solution would be adding a 1.25m lift fan (F-35) and smaller place anywhere swivel jet nozzles (Harrier) so that people can still continue to build VTOL craft. For many people they have always been a huge part of KSP and it would be a shame to have the ability to make them taken away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T17:47:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d be willing to make this compromise but I fear it wouldn\u0027t make it in the game before 1.0.5. I feel that they shouldn\u0027t add the turbines until they are ready to make proper VTOL. I\u0027m not against the turbines, I\u0027m just against breaking VTOL for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T18:44:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the option for a dedicated VTOL engine. Perhaps make it have a 90 degree swivel (so it isnt 100% dedicated to VTOL and can act as a regular engine when facing backwards). Ofc this would need to be balanced (id guess lower ISP and perhaps optimized for seal level only (as in terrible thrust anywhere but near the ground).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a lift fan, i think thatd be too specialized to bother with. yes itd let us make F35 replicas (not that we\u0027d want to, since a p51 mustang would probably fly circles around a F35 that is fitted with VTOL abilities), but aside from that (unless its thin enough to place nicely in a wing), itd be very situational and hard to use on most designs, whereas one of those place anywhere harrier style thrusters with (hopefully) toggleable position from horizontal to vertical would be great, and could be placed almost anywhere since they aint large.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T00:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELift fans or a dedicated VTOL engine would be the tits!! and sounds like a compromise\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T00:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah originally I thought separating the turbine/compressor as a separate part was a good idea but balancing weight and thrust with different nozzles and form factors and all that would probably be a nightmare.
