Are we going to see the ISRU generating heat again?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T21:36:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Paul Kingtiger**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:41:35Z","Content":"\u0022Here\u0027s some radiators.

Heating was an interesting problem to solve in 1.0.2, we just didn\u0027t have dedicated parts to solve it. Now we have the parts and not much of a problem to solve with them.\n\nAlso, I should point out that engines aren\u0027t the only heat source in game. The sun adds heat to vessels, and it can become a real concern when visiting the inner planets."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T14:13:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Here\u0027s some radiators.
