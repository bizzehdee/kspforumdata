Unfortunately we\u0027ve also lost something. There used to be a \u0022vertical snap\u0022 feature exposed by the game but not implemented in the editor. This allowed you to perfectly center-align surface attached parts. For example, you could make sure that two of the same fuel tanks had perfectly aligned ends. The editor extensions mod enabled that functionality and I used it extensively, but apparently in 0.9 it is no longer exposed by the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPlease\u003C/em\u003E bring it back so that EE can use it even if it\u0027s not implemented in the stock editor. The EE author is valiantly trying to build a workaround but this would be so much simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T12:11:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, it\u0027s massively useful... it\u0027s great for balancing asparagus engines when you do them in 2x symmetry, along with many other applications.

With angle snap switched on it snaps to increments, although it is a little inconsistent sometimes about where those increments are.

I\u0027d rather \u0022fiddle\u0022 and get it the way I want than to have it snap somewhere and I\u0027d have to live with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve not yet had the problem where gizmos don\u0027t snap correctly. Usually I just have to turn them on and just grab the vertical arrow of each part to get them to snap to the correct location. This (for the above reason) is far preferable to me to a forced snap to the very center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I have no problem with it being implemented for those who want it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
