I think it would be an amazing featur to add, to be able to literaly create your own part in game, thanks to some tools, with a new building.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarting with something like real fuels did in his mod. Be able to select the size and\u00A0the shape of your fuel tanks. And it would be limited by the techTree, and the type of engine you are able to take. This way you would be able to implement more and more featurs without much work on part creation. Of course you would have much more work somewhere Else, but it will increase the amount of possibility. At the start you would be able to change tanks, or engines power, size, shape but at the end you could creat your own pod, the materials you want to use on such part\u00A0etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the ones who don\u0027t want to spend so much time on it you can give basic parts. But you can change the way they work (adding parachute in the hull of your pod, adding detechable parts etc...). Something you could add is the type of material used for each parts etc..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end you would be able to creat a custom station with custom parts inside, science experiments etc. Create rockets the shape you want with any materials like Iron, wood \u00A0whatever with there own caracteristic. Even Create your own cockpit for planes or capsuls. (with IVA mod it would be great.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-18T12:28:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162185-donchielo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162185\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162185-donchielo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Donchielo\u003C/a\u003E, welcome to the forums. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quite like that concept, I can see this as a good \u0027official add on\u0027 idea, though for the stock game it may be a bit out of scope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-18T12:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/18/2016 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 18, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by pandaman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
