But it works. Basically. Every person gets their own time reference frame. You can warp just like in single player, but you disappear to everybody else not in that time frame. When you get out of warp, people will be behind you in time. Don\u2019t think about it too much, just as long as you can\u2019t travel backwards in time (wich you cant) there won\u2019t be any huge paradoxes. Other people can view the multiplayer menu and \u201Csync\u201D to your time frame. Now you can see each other again. They get pulled very rapidly into the future and everything is dandy as long as you aren\u2019t sub-orbital. If they warp ahead, they can no longer see you, you have to warp to them. You cannot sync to people in a past time frame, they have to sync to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmods? Mods are easy to handle. Have stock servers and modded servers.

(It\u2019s got framerate issues and teleportation bugs and whatnot)\u00A0The games code could easily be optimised and tweaked to work well with multiplayer, but you can\u2019t tweak base code from a mod. All squad has to do is adopt the mod like they did for so many others, and all will be happy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine it though.. building a base with your bud on pol.. or maybe a rival space administration..
