How many times has it been officially stated that development of KSP would NOT stop after 1.0? Not to mention that Squad is one of the most forthcoming and community-friendly game developers out there. You think community input and feedback is taken into account by other developers to the same degree? All this uproar simply causes Squad to think twice about being forthcoming about future dev plans and announcements.

And then, when SQUAD and the community can have a discussion about the flaws present, how to proceed with the development/polishing and maybe how to improve the testing procedure in the future. \n\nI am perfectly happy to accept that SQUAD\u0027s hand was forced for some unspecified reason in regards to the time schedule, but I will be severely disappointed, if squad just moves own, pretending that there is hardly anything wrong/missing in this release, like parts of the community try to do.\n\nTo expand a bit on what I mean by \u0022wrong/missing\u0022 is, that I think that the game in general and the 1.0 features in particular lack polishing and balancing. Many parts like size 3 radial decouplers/probe-core/SAS etc are still missing. The KSC buildings are still somewhat ackwardly plopped onto/sticking out of the ground, missing proper transitions. This may seem like fluff, and I would agree, if we were still in early access and working up to implement all features, but for 1.0 where \u0022KSP is finally ready to be viewed by all as a complete game \u0022 some polish is needed. The Career/Science Tree, imo, seems to need a balancing/playtesting pass to avoid overt grinding and inter-level dependencies (especially at the 90 science level where the player is between orbit and moon landing and size 2 engines, structural parts and tanks are each in different parrallel nodes) \n\nTL;DR : I think many players are looking for an acknowledgment (no apology, finger pointing or anything, just acknowledgment) from SQUAD that 1.0 was rushed/not polished enough, so that a discussion can be had with the community about how to fix it and avoid these problems in the features"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T12:43:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think the launch was that bad... and I bet money it was not Harvester and the devs that wanted to launch this soon, I am guessing it was his management at Squad that wanted the game out so THEY rushed them to get the \u0022complete\u0022 game out to make more money.\n\nNope, please not more pseudo economical analysis. KSP was making money. In fact, I remember from one interview that the game was making money before it got to steam, and it blew really up when it got there. Otherwise, what is the point? It\u0027s not like releasing a bit earlier or later would actually create a big influence in the amount of sales. There isn\u0027t much coming out right now, aside from witcher 3, which, despite being presumably awesome, is probably not exactly the biggest competitor to KSP.\n\nThat\u0027s the thing you need too argue and proof before throwing out accusations about \u0027just wanting more money to the expensive of the game\u0027.

The mission was a great success. All those stuff that Rosetta did on the way to 67P, a freaking rendezvous with a comet, a lander on a comet, even most experiments on the comet were successful. But a few claim everything was a disaster because there was some trouble with the lander that was a really small part of the whole mission... more of a bonus.\n\nIt could also be seen like a situation where some guys made a rocket, launched it fine, got it to rendezvous with a comet and put a lander on it (eventually) and got some good science data.\n\nThen the whole world goes crazy about a shirt one guy wore that was made for him by his girlfriend...\n\nI\u0027m not convinced that SQUAD have done a bad job, I\u0027m enjoying playing 1.0.2 more than many update versions historically.\n\nI like a lot of the stuff that was introduced in 1.0, aero and heating are great mechanics and I\u0027m glad they are in the game.\n\nIt\u0027s even better with a bucketload of mods to prop up essential features I regard as missing from stock but those features seem to be personal preference so I\u0027ll leave that topic now.\n\nI think 1.0 should have come after features stopped being introduced and a release purely devoted to bugfixing and optimisation happened as the last beta release.\n\nIt didn\u0027t. Time to move on.\n\n**In negotiation it is always good to have in your mind your goal.** What is the result you actually desire from communicating with the other person? Just moaning has the result where the other person just dismisses you as a moaner. It\u0027s also good to step back a bit from the issue when looking at what you really want.\n\nThis is my goal :\n\nI\u0027d like CLAW\u0027s stock bugfix thread to be made obsolete. When there is a popular thread devoted to long term bugs that persist over multiple updates, that reflects badly on the people responsible for eliminating bugs. I\u0027d like the number of open bugs on the tracker to be a lower percentage of the overall reported bugs.\n\nCurrently the stats on the bugtracker stand at \n\nBugs 832 open / 1093 \n\nFeature: 120 open / 130 \n\nFeedback: 67 open / 72 \n\nThat (if I read the number/stats correctly) means that about 75% of reported bugs are still in the game and have not been fixed...\n\nTo me it seems a high ratio for a released game. Remember, these are reported bugs that SQUAD has not addressed and have nothing to do with QA or the testers, those guys do a sterling job and I\u0027m sure they have reported many many bugs of their own. \n\nI\u0027d like SQUAD to explicitly commit to reducing that percentage with a dedicated bugfix update. The update does not have to be soon, although some things like the catastrophic memory leak when showing the thermometers could do with being hotfixed. I\u0027d rather it was done right than done really quick.\n\nWhat I would prefer to have soon is some concrete feedback from the devs about bugs in general and their plans to deal with them.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThis seems like a storm in a teacup to me but some feedback from squad about their intentions re: bugs would be good and a dedicated bugfix update would also be good.\n\n**EDIT: I have NO desire for a mea culpa from squad and I think calls for one are counterproductive.

How about developing a bit self-awareness and asking why exactly the responses feel negative to you?
