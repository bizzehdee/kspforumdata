It would also bolster the confidence in the physics if actual units were listed. Lastly, certain parameters in the game seem to be ambiguously labelled and showing units would clear up confusions users will have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that users can just point their browsers to the wiki page and get the units from there. But I believe it would be great if this information was available in the game as well. Also, wiki seems to have a few mistakes regarding untis as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time of this post, I have been running the paid version of v0.21.0.272 from steam.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the list of a few ambiguously named parameters I mentioned earlier:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Parts\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMax Power: According to wiki this are labelled as \u0022Thrust\u0022 and measured in newtons (N).
