Kerbin is just the same wasteland planet as any other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest to make some cities, roads and other infrastructure. Part of this can be some collision system. For example, if your part (rocket or debris) hit a city, player will be alerted and later maybe penalised (if money system of KSP comes into force). This will make a whole game more interesting, player will be force to more carefully plan a mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Those infrastructures also should glow during night like in real (like on picture below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI offer myself as a volunteer.
