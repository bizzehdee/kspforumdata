I hope this gets fixed/added, because then it would look so much cooler! (Well, not literally, but you get the idea)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, before posting this I decided to make sure I was correct. I am not. The engine DOES glow, but it takes a lot to get hot enough to glow. It would be cool if at least the inside of the nozzle got really hot a glowy, because it just kind of looks dead without it glowing until after about a minute and a half of continuous thrust. It only ever glows a dim cherry red at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/133/graphics/fd8/srb3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022srb3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see from this image, the RS-25s on the shuttle get to be yellow-white hot, but only the inside of the nozzle; the outside of the nozzle does not glow visibly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the hottest it gets by running. Inside the nozzle, only a small bit near the top of the engine glows much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UVvJfbo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UVvJfbo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the hottest it can get without melting/exploding/poofing, using the HyperEdit heat editor to test it, and with hot part highlighting turned off. The whole part glows red at this point, like they all do when made hot enough, but the actual emmisive texture stays a fairly dim slightly-orange red.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/48izV71.png\u0022 alt=\u002248izV71.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T22:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T23:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, the way emissives work in 1.0.5 is completely independent on the part\u0027s heat, and is instead dependent on throttle, as the module controlling the animation was changed from ModuleAnimateHeat to FXModuleAnimateThrottle (which, funnily enough, is exactly what my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122673\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBetterEmissives\u003C/a\u003E mod did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want the glow to increase faster, find this in the config file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\tMODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = FXModuleAnimateThrottle\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tanimationName = SSME_Heat\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tresponseSpeed = 0.00025\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tdependOnEngineState = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tdependOnThrottle = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand increase responseSpeed to your liking.
