Well, because those are some of the most common science instruments on space probes. They\u0027d be able to work anywhere and, is it a shame to have more options for doing science?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T16:24:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes and all my yes!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sabastian","CreatedById":65726,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-18T17:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was just thinking about having a camera this morning! Pictures sent from spacecraft have been hugely important throughout the history of spaceflight. Consider this picture from Luna 9:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/luna9close_big.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022luna9close_big.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea for a pair of camera parts goes like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts: Basic Camera and Panoramic Camera\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic camera would be a small, radially attached part that would provide small, black and white pictures of whatever it was pointed at. It would be available fairly early in the tech tree (about the same time as the first probe cores)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe panoramic camera would be a larger, 1.25m part about half the height (but the same mass) of the science module and would take larger, color pictures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGameplay: \u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECameras would operate like crew reports. They would be reuseable and provide 100% transmit value. The panoramic camera would provide the same amount of science as a crew report, and the basic camera would provide half the science of a crew report. The only difference between a crew report and a picture from a science perspective would be data size; pictures would be roughly double the amount of data of a crew report and therefore require more power and time to transmit. For those concerned with cameras replacing kerbonauts, remember that cameras cannot provide EVA reports or take surface samples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe player would be shown the picture in the science dialogue box and be given the option to discard, transmit, or keep the photo. Photos would be saved to the screenshots folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this would be a really great gameplay addition.
