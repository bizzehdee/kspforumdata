So i can create a contract to public, or only my friends. So, if i need fuel, i can create a contract, specifying what i need, the money i\u0027ll pay, the deadline, the penalty, etc. Once the other player fulfilled the contract, he would get the money, and i would get the fuel, simple as that. This is only a example, but it could be implemented for rescue kerbals, add space station parts, pay for science, fuel, repairs, exploring other bodies, etc. If the player who get the contract, by any means could not fulfill the contract, the money penalty would revert to the player that created the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i ask:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-It has already been suggested?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Is there a mod with this suggestion?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Is it possible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T17:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great idea for if (when?) multiplayer gets added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of a nice way to hook things together. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T19:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is actually an amazing idea for when multiplayer arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind of how GTA V bounties work, except you would create a chain of different events that needed completing by someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"beelzerob","CreatedById":147002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T20:42:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven better than a contract with a fixed price....bid it out.
