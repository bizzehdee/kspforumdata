We need some way of assembling craft in orbit via placing struts and fuel lines, since docking ports, at present, are way too weak to hold large craft together under acceleration. That said, i think they should make docking ports much stronger. Nevertheless, a KAS-like system would make retrofitting existing crafts/rovers doable, and would be useful, especially if a part wasnt unlocked (in campaign mode) when the craft was launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also dont like the idea of tethers-- allowing kerbals to retrieve one another makes running out of RCS fuel mid-EVA relatively easy to recover from with the help of a buddy, but still dangerous...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T22:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the mean time could you use a Mk2 Cargo bay like a baseball catchers mitt?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust cover the bottom with stacks of ladders to grab on to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-07T22:11:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tex_NL\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are several EVA tether suggestions on the forum as it gets suggested about every other month.\u003Cp\u003EWith \u003Cstrong\u003EKAS\u003C/strong\u003E you can grab a Command Seat and have a second Kerbal sit in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the planet surface the second Kerbal will fall out as soon as you start walking.
