Please forgive me if this is old hat or if it is already slated to be included in the contracts system. I have been playing KSP since about 0.18, and have done nearly all of the basic exploration challenges in sandbox mode. Once career mode got started, I felt like one of the most interesting challenges I could give myself was to see how much science I could generate in the shortest possible span of game time, i.e. to try to win the \u0022race to space\u0022 against an imaginary opponent. Needless to say, this requires both careful planning wrt launch windows as well as launching and managing a large number of missions simultaneously. So my first suggestion is that the amount of money you can get for specific achievement should be in some way related to how quickly you can get it done in terms of game time. I think this would add an interesting level of strategy to career mode. Again, please forgive me if that\u0027s already what is planned. In that vein, the main headache in playing this way for me right now is the danger of missing your window for one of the many maneuvers you have to execute at the right moment for each mission. This headache has been significantly mitigated by having maneuver nodes become persistent in the last update, but it occurred to me that it would really be cured if somewhere in the game there was a \u0022maneuver node manager\u0022 window, that lets you view all the maneuvers you\u0027ve plotted in chronological order. Perhaps it could even pause and alert you if you\u0027re about to timewarp past one of your plotted nodes from another mission. At least for me, that would significantly reduce the number of \u0022$%@#! I sailed past Jool into interstellar space!\u0022 facepalm moments.
