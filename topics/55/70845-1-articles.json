This, over a LONG time (and the moon has had a few billion years of time to work with), will tend to make the orbiting body conform to a rotational rate that exactly matches its orbital period, so it keeps its longer dimension radially aligned toward the primary body all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason KSP stations don\u0027t do that isn\u0027t because they \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E rotate.
