It\u0027s about the natural interaction between men and women. the rest is the range of those things. And a very interesting thing to do with the concept of introducing a female character. It\u0027s also realistic potentially to the circumstances. It\u0027s the basic reality between men and women and what can happen. Your grossly oversimplifying it. Seductress does not mean overbearing sexual content. It\u0027s also the subtleties. All of them.....! And in fact that rarely properly means anything you would think of as sexual!
