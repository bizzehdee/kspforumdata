It works by 1 spacecraft transmitting a laser to another space craft, which absorbs the laser\u0027s energy via solar panels allowing for remote electricity transfer at long distances. Maybe someone can make a mod for this, or on a highly unlikely note, maybe can be in main game?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-18T23:14:07Z\u0022 title=\u002201/18/2014 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by coolitic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T01:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess it\u0027d be kind of useful, but there\u0027s a lot of potential for energy loss there, unless you use a very tightly focused beam, in which case you\u0027d better hope your aim is good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daddy Cecil","CreatedById":59121,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T02:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP Interstellar has something like this, the Microwave Power Transmitter.
