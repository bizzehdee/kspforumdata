My suggestion is to add a convenient way to manually reassign stages other than clicking through a long list of stages to see which ones highlight. The game determined staging could act as a default if one does not wish to manually select the preferred staging. Am not pointing out a miss step but rather suggesting a fine point of control which could offer something to the meticulous rocket scientist.
