Some of them are quite overpowered and can allow you to do things that normal rockets can\u0027t do, while others are just underpowered and as a result are rarely used. I\u0027m not here to say what should be the right ratio, but I\u0027d like to see some sort of consensus, so that the engines can be brought more or less in line with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my concept sketch for a ratio between the two ratios:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start with the LV-909 and the LV-T45 as my base, as they are close to the middle in value. Since they are close in Isp, I\u0027ll use the Rockomax 24-77 as a low Isp engine also for my values. I\u0027m simplifying TWR to 10m/s/s gravity for easier calculation purposes. We have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-77: 22.22 TWR and 250-300 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45: 13.33 TWR and 320-370 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-909: 10.00 TWR and 300-390 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like our launch engines are high TWR with moderate Isp that doesn\u0027t carry out well into vacuum. The landing engines have the best Isp in vacuum but lose the most from atmosphere. These engines have pretty decent TWR but nowhere near the best. A simple calculation that carries these values in a somewhat similar fashion to the three engines here is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edivide TWR by 10 and take the 4th root of the value (LV-909 is unchanged). New values: 24-77: 1.221 // LV-T45: 1.075. Now divide the min and max Isp of the LV-909 by these values:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-77: 245-319 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45: 279-363 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem with this system is that it doesn\u0027t take into account the increased Isp range of the LV-909 as a dedicated landing engine. Since it has the same median Isp as the LV-T45, lets use the LV-T45 Isp as the base instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24-77: 262-303 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45: 300-344 Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that looks about right!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use these calculations, we\u0027ll be raising the in-atmosphere Isp of the Rockomax 24-77 by a bit. We\u0027ll also be lowering the Isp of the LV-T45 and the LV-T30 significantly. I think that brings these engines more in line with each other and the others. Given how easy it is to make a SSTO with T30 engines, I think they could use a bit of an Isp decrease. But lets try these numbers on other engines!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst up, the big ones:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsail: 25.00 TWR and 280-330 Isp 1.2574 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Isp: 255-295\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESkipper: 16.25 TWR and 300-350 Isp 1.1291 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Isp: 285-330\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoodle: 8.80 TWR 270-390 Isp .9685 \u003Cstrong\u003ENew Isp: 310-400\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mainsail gets a huge reduction in Isp. The overpowered engine we all love is put in its place! I don\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. The Skipper actually has its Isp reduced. I didn\u0027t expect it but I\u0027m not too surprised. I don\u0027t use Skippers much when I can use Mainsails, but in the absence of Mainsails, one discovers that Skippers aren\u0027t a bad engine. The worst thing about them is their thrust-to-mount space ratio. I get more thrust with 4 LV-T45s. The Poodle\u0027s slightly sub-par thrust pays out with its new slightly higher than LV-909 Isp values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t like these Isp values? I know I don\u0027t find them completely satisfying. Lets adjust some other things and see where that takes us...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll leave the thrust of the Mainsail unchanged, but lets increase its mass to 7.5 tons. Now lets bring the Skipper up to 900 thrust and we\u0027ll leave it around 15 TWR, so 6 tons mass. And finally, lets just increase the Poodle\u0027s thrust to 250 so it\u0027s exactly like a big LV-909. I bet everyone will love it now. Actually, it might be a bit low on thrust to mount space ratio, so lets try making a bigger version of the same thing, too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMainsail: 20 TWR 1.1892 Isp: 270-310\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Thrust: 1500, Mass 7.5 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESkipper: 15 TWR 1.1067 Isp: 290-335\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Thrust: 900, Mass 6.0 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPoodle: 10 TWR 1.0000 Isp: 300-390\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Thrust: 250, Mass 2.5 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBig Poodle: 10 TWR 1.0000 Isp: 300-390\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Thrust: 300, Mass 3.0 tons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne possible problem with my calculation is that it will reduce the Isp of most engines by at least a little bit. Perhaps I should use the LV-T45 as the medium instead of the LV-909. Oh well. I\u0027m just estimating here. What are your guys\u0027 thoughts on this? Got any suggestions for better calculations? Different ideas on how a consensus should be reached? Think I\u0027m wrong and that the engines are all balanced? All input is encouraged, I want to know what you guys think!

If an aerospike has under 10% SSTO payload fraction, then I don\u0027t see why bell engines should be much over 5%. Aerospikes are more expensive, a higher tech, and less efficient in space. They should be significantly better for an SSTO on Kerbin I think. But also I could see upping the values on my calculation by increasing the Isp of everything by x1.075 to bring them all in line with the LV-T45 (except lander engines, they stay at the old value because they have min-max stretched outward by 20). The reason I chose the LV-T45 and not the LV-T30 is because the LV-T30 has no thrust vectoring, and thus has a greater TWR than the LV-T45. I think it\u0027s too good for its lack of thrust vectoring, an ability that\u0027s not really useful. As long as the LV-T30 maintains 215 thrust and the same Isp as the LV-T45, I think it should have 1.5 tons mass, or if it is to stay lower in mass, its Isp should be decreased a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never intended to suggest that there are not more unbalanced engines. The Rockomax 48-7S is quite overpowered as its TWR is ridiculous right off, but its Isp is actually pretty high, not extremely low like it should be. I think it should have its mass increased to 0.15 tons as opposed to getting a huge nerf to Isp. Making powerful engines heavier isn\u0027t as bad as you might think. It might decrease its SSTO payload fraction by a lot, but it doesn\u0027t substantially affect the rocket size it can lift. Screwing with its Isp allows it to propel tiny payload fractions really far, but makes it useless as a heavy lifter. It turns it into a stunt engine. The mainsail will be fine at 7.5 tons. It could do 9 tons but with its high thrust vs mount size, I think it should have significantly less Isp than the Skipper. Also, definitely should take out thrust vectoring. Can give it a bit more Isp back for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Skipper should be at least 900 thrust. With a mass of 6 tons it\u0027d be fine, if it actualy had 900 thrust. It\u0027ll lift bigger things farther than it did as a 650 thrust engine at 4 tons. It\u0027ll be a good mid stage engine, as opposed to (now) a crappy late-stage engine for people who don\u0027t want to wait on a Poodle for the higher Isp. Poodle should definitely be at least 250 thrust but I could see up to 400. It is 2x the width of a LV-909 and actually well more than 2x the height, making its volume considerably more than 8x a LV-909. 6-8x thrust leads to it being useful as a large-mount size lander engine, able to lift your 4 ton capsule with a 720/880 fuel tank easily. You won\u0027t have to make a long burn on descent to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, but can make a quick burn right before you hit the ground, just like with a little lander that uses an LV-909.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the worst balanced engine is the LV-1 and LV-1R. Their TWR is terrible and their Isp is worse. Leaving their mass and thrust the same, I\u0027d bring their Isp to 560 - came up with that a while back because it puts them as a proportional median between the LV-909 and the LV-N in terms of TWR vs Isp. But that\u0027s a bit high Isp for a cheap liquid fuel bell engine, so we could just decrease the mass by 50%-60%. Even after doing that, I would still increase the Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use the Rockomax 24-77s all the time. I love being able to mount a small yet powerful engine. I wish the Mk-55 engine had more thrust. I try to use Mk-55s in conjunction with Skippers to make a \u0022light mainsail\u0022 when a mainsail is overkill, but I end up with something that has way less thrust and significantly higher mass, and its Isp is about the same at launch and only gets worse. But with a 900 thrust Skipper and 4x 180 thrust Mk-55s with reasonably-balanced mass and Isp, we\u0027d get 1620 thrust for probably similar mass and Isp to a Mainsail. Of course I\u0027d probably be willing to use the Skipper by itself if it had 900 thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESay we leave the mass and Isp of the Mk-55 alone and change only its thrust to 180. Now it has a high TWR to compensate for its lousy Isp.

Liquid fuel engines are supposed to have limited Isp, while it is other technologies like the LV-N which have the high Isp. The reason the Poodle is underpowered is because you can get about the same thrust with less mass and height by using a large quad-coupler and putting on 4 LV-909s. The extra mass of the quad-coupler is still less than the Poodle, and the Poodle is still bigger. It should be more powerful, else it just gets in the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what you\u0027re saying, and to a big extent the ay to design an engine is by trial and error. I base my mass and thrust adjustments of engines around serving their purpose, or making them to serve a purpose at all, in some cases. The TWR/Isp balance is mostly just to prevent cheaty min-maxing with certain imbalanced engines, resulting in rockets that do things they shouldn\u0027t be able to do.

Increasing the mass of the 48-7S engine substantially reduces its delta-v, as the high delta-v is reliant on the tiny dry mass fraction, being barely higher than the fuel tank itself with a 360/440 tank, and still getting enough thrust when full to lift off the ground on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s pics of what a 48-7S SSTO can do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zwDV09O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zwDV09O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tWfLi3a.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tWfLi3a.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has 6003 delta-v and a TWR on Kerbin of 1.90.

Even that is pretty high, and is why I think this engine\u0027s Isp should be lowered even after increasing it\u0027s mass. It\u0027s a heavy lifter, not a SSTO engine.

For multistage craft, payload fractions seem to be ~1.5-2x the single stage values, but this depends on details, and would require several test flights to verify with the modified engines.

Upping the Isp by 1.9x to 560 s sounds like something to make it directly take on the LV-N and PB-ION(!), and breaks with your earlier comments about realistic engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I\u0027d want to see a focus on fixing the balance issues with the Mk 55 and 48-7S (in that order).
