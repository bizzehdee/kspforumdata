And then after that I have to ferry fuel up there with about 10 long and tedious flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first part of my suggestion is to have an auto-pilot like Mech-Jeb fly ships up to within 100m of the space-station and do the normal redezvous procedures. To make this balanced you would have to design the refuel ship to begin with so if it failed then it would be your fault. When transferring fuel the docking procedure would be done \u0022automatically\u0022 if it\u0027s not currently the active vessel and then return to orbit. It would stop it\u0027s automation if the current active vessel is within 2.5km because otherwise it would have to automatically perform a docking but it would then resume once the active vessel is beyond 2.5km. If the player chose to do so, by switching to the automated vessel they could control it without making any changes to the recorded flight. If the space-station is full of fuel the automation stops until it has empty space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I picture it is that you build the ship, put a part on it that allows for automation and then you must fly it to within 100m of the space-station and safely land it back on kerbin. You would then go to space center, select the second launch-pad and click the ship you would like to automate. It would need to have been successfully tested at least once. It would need to be retested if any parts are added or removed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flight the part records the position of the station at the time of starting the flight and records the flight so that it recreates exactly what the ship did during the test flight in it\u0027s automated flight. You would then have to dock with the space station and it records the amount of fuel that gets transferred, maximum fuel capacity of the station and final amount of fuel in the station upon undocking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would then be able to calculate when the space-station is fuel by adding the amount of fuel that gets transferred to the final fuel amount and if it is equal to the maximum capacity then it performs the recorded landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t consider it to be cheating (Maybe a little lazy) because it\u0027s using the players flight patterns to perform it\u0027s own flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part of this suggestion links into the first part. More than one launch pad. That way you can have automated ships going on one and you can still perform your own missions on the other(s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother suggestion that occurred to me is to be able to see ships in and around KSP in the Space Center Screen so if you had a ship on the lanchpad and returned to space center you could see it sitting on the launch pad. This could be implemented with my previous suggestion by animating the recorded rocket so it space center screen you can occasionally see the door on the VAB open and watch a rocket roll out onto the launch pad and then launch. It would be cool to have launch alarms and such happening at this time to make the space center screen a bit more...
