Or if asteroids were introduced in the game then the telescope could scan the skies checking for any possible impacts where, if they did occur you\u0027d have to do something about.

As long as we are dealing only with electrical connections and relatively weak structural connections, quite a lot can be done with limited tools. When we start talking about stronger connections, fuel lines, and explosives, more extensive facilities will be needed. We could for example remove the science equipment and antennas from a probe, and replace them with a command seat and light landing struts to make it a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clockwork13","CreatedById":100102,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T23:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022swakey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022swakey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m sure a lot has been said on the topic but being new to the game I\u0027m not really looking forward to shuffling through all the suggestions so sorry if I\u0027m bringing up old news.\u003Cp\u003EWhat if stations could have some kind of purpose in the game? I\u0027ve only found reason to have a refueling station so far and others are just for aesthetics i suppose. What if you had to build something like the hubble telescope for instance in order to be able to explore and visit planets beyond kerbin? They could be locked or out of view before you do so. Or if asteroids were introduced in the game then the telescope could scan the skies checking for any possible impacts where, if they did occur you\u0027d have to do something about. But if they hit kerbin you\u0027d loose money or science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr having satellites up in order for your communications devices to work better outside kerbins orbit? or for controlling probes for that matter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe building something like the ISS gives you bonus science for every science you collect? the hitchhikers storage container already exists time to put it in good use \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
