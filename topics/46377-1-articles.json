Started it, figured it out where to launch towards the star and let it fly to a 2.5 Mio. PE around the sun... after nearly reached the periapsis I wanted to burn to decline the Apoapsis to a Kerbol orbit, but found out that the deltaV for the last third of the orbit is getting enormous high...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid I do something wrong or is it normal to burn about 5000 m/s for reaching the orbit? How much do i need to get to a Syncronous orbit (AP/PE 1,5 Mio) And what is the last safe distancefor a orbit without letting my satelite get a sunburn?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeirdCulture\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T10:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo deep inside gravity well all orbits are very fast. Any change of velocity costs a lot consequently. I\u0027ve ran into this bump with my first Moho mission - near Moho\u0027s orbit my craft was moving so fast, that capture burn took all my dV meant for journey home. Theoretically you could use gravity assist from Moho or Eve to fiddle with your kerbolar orbit, but it requires a lot of skill and luck to properly line everything up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
