I\u0027ve got two different games running however, which reflects the dilemma I find myself in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my Sandbox game, I\u0027ve been building, testing and flying space planes, which is the main thing I love about this game (not that there aren\u0027t other attractions!). I\u0027ve been using those spaceplanes to set up an In Situ Resource Utilization base on Minimus, which will then allow my aircraft and probes to reach the rest of the solar system with ease. It\u0027s taken ten flights of my MK2 space plane to put all the pieces of this base, the orbital resource scanner and an ion thruster space tug up in mid Kerbin orbit, and i\u0027m just finishing off docking the pieces of the Minimus IRSU rover together, and the boondoggle is almost ready to set off. Assuming it all goes my way, I\u0027ll achieved exploration of the Kerbol system with reusable vehicles only and without having to bring interplanetary fuel up from ground level. Should be good for the budget, in the long term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with this game mode however, is that being sandbox I already have unlimited funds and when i actually reach these outer worlds, i can fly around a bit and see what they look like, but ultimately won\u0027t be able to do any science on them (will i?) and won\u0027t have anything to spend the points on anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason, I started a career mode game, but it\u0027s taking so long to tech up, furthermore, my beloved space planes are right at the far end of it. By the time i\u0027m able to do what i have been doing in Sandbox, i\u0027ll have had to have explored the entire system anyway, just to earn enough blue points. Career mode is all about rockets, but i don\u0027t find them as interesting and besides , i\u0027m horrible at both building and flying them. Most attempts, even with stock vehicles, end in a huge fireball and KIA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod or game mode where you are strictly limited for reputation and funds, already have the tech tree open, or some mod that adds near-future sci-fi items i can work towards once i cheat my way to supersonic/hypersonic aircraft tech?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T00:07:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard! You seem to be getting the hang of the game and the sometimes tricky art of aerodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you tried science mode? It gives you unlimited funds, but you still have to unlock the tech tree.

Turns out my solution was simple: career mode, in easy rather than normal. No need to do the contracts that don\u0027t interest me (visual survey of X locations etc), but still unlocking parts at a slow enough rate I actually use most of them rather than just skipping to the end of the tech tree, and still a structured progression (Mun, then Minmus, then Duna etc). The other perk of easy rather than normal is less need to grind missions. Now, for spaceplanes, you need more techs just to get going, so I\u0027d suggest easy career with giving yourself enough of a headstart to unlock the minimum viable spaceplane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sanic","CreatedById":149920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T20:27:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...
