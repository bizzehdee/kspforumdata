So first I designed some new sci packages and modded the rover to carry them around; that way they could be deployed from the rover instead of requiring them to be independent. Testing was largely successful; I\u0027ll have to remember to bring the rover to a halt before deploying the packages attached to the front, but that\u0027s not a big deal. Next step was to redesign the descent stage of the lander; that rover had been designed to use a discardable skycrane - okay if you\u0027re just transporting a rover on a one-way trip, bad idea if you\u0027ve got Kerbals riding down with it. Came up with a new challenge idea in the process of testing that design. Finally, I added all the hardware to the Apollo design elements I had already (CSM and LEM ascent stage) and redesigned the booster. Booster test showed it didn\u0027t have sufficient delta-V to achieve orbit on its own and my computer spontaneously shut down before I could try again. Tonight will likely see further booster redesign efforts.
