I imagine they are created by stock code when craft are loaded.  Appropriate code, as in a .dll, will be needed to control them and toggle them off for IR.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-19T07:18:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2016 07:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jacke**"},{"CreatedByName":"Neroziat","CreatedById":169246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T07:17:53Z","Content":"perhaps new landing gear or wheels should be made just for IR, that way we can autostrut to parent and be fine"},{"CreatedByName":"Jacke","CreatedById":103694,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T07:24:51Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think that\u0027ll work, as making new wheels still defines them as wheels in KSP and the rest of the code will handle them in the same way.

I designed a rover that folds up nice a compact and tested it on the launchpad, where all the robotics worked like a charm. I then put it on a rocket and sent it to my Mun base. I\u0027m ready to land it, but now the pivots don\u0027t work at all, and the extenders \u0022extend\u0022 backwards, into and past their bases. I hear the sounds of the motors, but nothing moves or it extends the wrong way.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think the difference was the loss of focus, since I went back to the Space Center after launching the rocket. To confirm this, I left another rover on the launchpad and when I returned to it, I observed the same errant behavior. Has anyone experienced this before? If so, is there a simple fix? I\u0027ve done this in my hardcore career mode game, so I don\u0027t like being stuck by it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m really hoping that I\u0027m just doing something incorrectly, because I\u0027m running about 10 other mods, making it difficult to debug Infernal Robotics by itself. \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for any advice.
