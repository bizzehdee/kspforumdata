I figured i would start with some satellites first. I wasent sure what they could and coudent do, but i figured might as well get something up there. So i made one and strapped it to the side of a rocket platform and put it in orbit. I went back and as far as i can tell, its no longer up there. Kinda, went away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a trick in launching something and making it stay up there? Might as well learn this now.

There is quite a difference. Reverting to the VAB or Launch will undo everything you did. Hitting the Space Center button however will leave the craft in persistence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can test this right on the launchpad, no need to actually go to space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother possibility is you left it in an unstable trajectory and it re-entered the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Progeekzy","CreatedById":137788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T21:28:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI returned to the center.
