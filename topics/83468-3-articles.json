I was imagining another winch type part with like a 50m(ish) small cable which would be grabbable or connect in some other way(not sure if he could hold the cable and still be able to grab other parts while holding it) so that the kerbal could safely EVA around the station and add parts or perform maintenance (or in my case also board the external command seat of the service tractor) without the risk of flying off into his own orbit if he were to overestimate his EVA propellant. I\u0027m sure the idea has been suggested before(doesn\u0027t seem that original) but I figured I would throw it out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KospY","CreatedById":33868,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T15:10:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022al.bebop\u0022 data-cite=\u0022al.bebop\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey all, Love, Love, LOVE KAS; it\u0027s been one of my \u0022must-have\u0022 mods pretty much since I started playing.\u003Cp\u003EI wonder if KospY, Majiir or any others here can assist with a simple plugin I\u0027m trying to write to extend the part storage capabilities of the KAS containers to an inline \u0022part bin\u0022 which I\u0027m making.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the .cfg setup to allow part storage, and I would like to combine this functionality with a pair of animated doors which I\u0027ve added to the model.
