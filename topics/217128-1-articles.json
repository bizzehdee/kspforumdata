Using winds and other similar function to get into or near orbit and then assisted to other location with a leo satellite(maybe with a collection tether or something.). Then make it travel to the moon or mars and land and explore a planets surface or start a construction project. Eventually possibly building a base or rover or return vehicle to return more then the payload that was sent?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf some of the stronger materials are much smaller in scale maybe it\u0027s a better direction for space flight. It could benefit from better structural strength and hence better vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe material could be made of nanites or carry a small load of nanites. If it\u0027s made of nanites it might get a lot more nanites to the target. The nanites could also carry other needed materials with it as part of the vehicles construction.(Also saving weight as the payload could be the structural weight.) Then when landed it could use localized materials to construct things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this could go far enough could they make a return vehicle, fill a payload, fill a rocket with fuel(methane/hydrogen), and return a payload or even themselves. This might allow base testing for pre human settlements or other constructs on other planetary surfaces. Even make exploration vehicles and whatnot if it\u0027s possible. I\u0027m assuming we don\u0027t have tech that advanced yet. But could a primitive version be sent and then even just do something very small for fairly cheap and then return a signal and some data?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr could something super small and light weight use the magnus effect to get to orbit or as close as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not to predate human exploration it could be used for places that would not be survivable by humans potentially. It could be a good way to probe location regardless. Even asteroids and other smaller objects. If it\u0027s feasible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe one day this could be used to send stuff to a moon of jupiter to build a fuel manufacturing or collection plant and send fuel to the rest of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf solar winds/radiation are a problem maybe a bunch of these are sent up, collected, then put into another container together with a protective layer and sent out of earths orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-10T18:55:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2023 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
