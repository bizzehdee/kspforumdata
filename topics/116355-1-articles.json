That is, with a single launch, land on at least 6 moons and planets and have a look from space on several others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do so they designed the \u0022Hermes XSMR-1\u0022 (eXplore, Science, Mining, Refining).

The Hermes XSMR-1 design was ready and the mission control was eager to send it into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a total mass of 88 tons, 32 meters high, the ship features a laboratory and all available scientific experiences, enough space for 5 kerbals, a total a 4 gigantor solar panels, a drill and an ISRU converter. It has also 3 docking ports, 1 of each size, in case a ship needs to spend some time with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere was the prototype in the hangars :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/001-Spaceship-Design.png\u0022 alt=\u0022001-Spaceship-Design.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the rockets that did put it into orbit :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/002-Spaceship-Launcher-Design.png\u0022 alt=\u0022002-Spaceship-Launcher-Design.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after design, the first step was to put it into orbit. Given the fact that such a ship was never tested before, it was launched without any kerbal aboard. KSC had already lost 3 kerbals when launching an untested aircraft, so now they were cautious ... The crew was planned to be sent in a separate ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the ship ascending into orbit.

So the first step before leaving the kerbin system was to refuel. Also, the ship had not be tested thoroughly and we were really curious to see if it was up to our expectancies. Finally, a few years before designing the ship, we had accepted a contract asking us to set up a land base on Minmus. The Hermes XSMR-1 had all the features allowing it to be considered as a land base, so we could fullfill the contract with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe insertion into minmus orbits allowed us to understand the pros and cons of that particular design. It is a big, clumsy ship, with low acceleration. So all the maneuvers have to be planned and executed with precision and patience. But on the other side, it as a lot of delta-V with low ISP, so it is possible to have very long burns to stabilize to descent on the target planets, making landings quite easier than expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the ship approaching Minmus :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/006-Approaching-Minmus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022006-Approaching-Minmus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated above, I could appreciate the fact that the ship had a LOT of fuel and was very fuel efficient. That really makes up for the low maneuverability, as we could light up the engines during several minutes for an optimal landing speed. Here the landing was made between 1m/s and 2m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe final landing phase (as you see, I have 28 minutes of burn available to finish putting down the ship on the ground, quite a luxury ...) :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/007-Minmus-Final-Landing-Phase.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022007-Minmus-Final-Landing-Phase.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately we could find a flat place to land with only 4.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of slopes.

As it comes, we had still not fullfilled a contract where we were suppposed to plant a flag on Duna and the customer was becoming impatient. So we decided to make that mission along with this ship and another one made specifically for the task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Duna lander made rendez-vous with the Hermes on a high orbit of kerbin close to Minmus orbit. The docking was difficult due to the small docking ports and the size of the ships, but it finally worked. However, the docking ports on the Hermes are sideways, so after docking the ship was completly unbalanced. We saw it when burning out of kerbin orbit : when the ship was at full throttle it was drifting out of course, even with RCS activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully the Duna lander had enough spare fuel to provide for a Duna insertion by itself. Given a good aerobraking, we calculated that it could land and take-off back to the Hermes alone. So for the burn to Duna, we splitted the ensemble and sent the ships separatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the 2 ships docked together :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/010-Duna-Lander-Docked.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022010-Duna-Lander-Docked.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHandling the 2 ships insertion into Duna orbit was quite a mess but we made it. The landing on Duna was made with the second pilot of the Hermes taking control of the Duna lander. It was a great success, planting the flag and gathering scientific data. It was then able to take off a get back to the Hermes. But in the end it was really a lot of trouble for just a flag, was a mess !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mess, but a successfull one. However, the ship was low on fuel and it was time for us to land on Ike. Due to the stress of the Duna mission, going back and forth between the Hermes and the lander, we were unable to take a lot of pictures ... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the landing on Ike was not as smooth as on Minmus. Our first landing spot had a 17.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 slope and we couldn\u0027t maintain stability, so we had to go for a few more minutes over the landscape to find a suitable landing place, with a better 8.2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 slope. Achieving at least stability was a true relief.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing spot was a good one with a soil rich of 6% ore. Refueling took only a day and we were then ready for new adventures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the ship landed on Ike :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/011-Ike-Landed.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022011-Ike-Landed.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a while, we took off to prepare for our next trip.

Quite impatient, KSC and the crew decided to go without further delay. But what looked a good idea became almost a nightmare when we arrived in the vicinity of Dres ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/013-Dres-Injection.png\u0022 alt=\u0022013-Dres-Injection.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, after almost 2 years of space travel the Hermes reaches Dres with a very bad surprise : the relative velocity between Dres and the Hermes was of about 2000 m/s ! Looking at the remaining fuel, about 2800 m/s of Delta-V, it looked like landing on Dres would be a tough one !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, we planned a maneuver very close to Dres, at 30 km high, to reduce the needed Delta-V for orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship on Dres approach before starting the orbiting maneuver :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/014-Dres-Approach.png\u0022 alt=\u0022014-Dres-Approach.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the maneuver proved successful but with not that much Delta-V remaining for killing orbital speed and landing (around 1000 m/s left).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship in orbit aroud Dres :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/015-Dres-Orbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022015-Dres-Orbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing maneuver was made in a bit of a panic, on the nightside of the planet, really not a good idea ... also due to the very limited fuel remaining, the plan was to start the engines at the ultimate moment, as well as using RCS all along to save every single drop of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe descent went well as we made two emergency burns to kill vertical velocity before doing the final approach, at 150 m above the ground. At that time the fuel was so low that we wondered how we had ended up in that situation ! But luck was with us as the slope angle on the landing site was only 8\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Because of the gravity of the planet and the profile of our ship, a higher slope could have been fatal to the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end the pilot was on the verge of making a cardiac arrest, but that was it, a successful landing, but a very, very close one !!! (had to reload twice ...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landed ship with the fuel indicators to see how desperate was the situation :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/016-Dres-Landed.png\u0022 alt=\u0022016-Dres-Landed.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe then deployed the Drill, activated the ISRU and prayed for god that everything would work. Two days later, the fuel tanks were fully replenished and we sent a message to KSC to tell them that the mission could continue ! At ease now after the fear of dying on that small rock far from everything, the pilot herself volunteered to plant the flag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, given that experience on Dres, everyone in KSC and the ship wondered if Eeloo was doable, so a lot of work was made to tune the trans-planetary maneuvers and landing protocols.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe flag and the ship on Dres :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/017-Dres-Flag1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022017-Dres-Flag1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/018-Dres-Flag2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022018-Dres-Flag2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, a contractor asked us to visit Jool and Bop, the next steps on our trip. That would provide some good money to prepare the design of the Hermes XSMR-2. Anyway there was no hurry for that and the crew was readying itself for the trip.

The crew was eager to keep on the exploration mission as fast as possible, but after getting so close to a disaster on Dres, KSC decided that it was necessary to wait as long as necessary for an optimal injection path to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, we checked all the un-necessary weight on the ship and came to observe that when the ore container was full, we were losing almost 200 m/s of delta-V ! So before leaving, we dumped the ore mined on Dres and the ship was ready to leave the planet surface with its full 4737 m/s of delta-V. If we had seen that before leaving Ike, the Dres landing would have been much more comfortable !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe burn into a 30 km orbit took us 540 m/s of delta-V. That again gave us concern about getting to Eeloo ... but well, there was plenty of time to think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever, the time we had to wait for an optimal Jool injection was sooooo long that KSC wondered about the sanity of the crew ... Almost 5 years of boring orbit around Dres before being able to launch to Jool in good conditions !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt mission time T\u002B9y,264d, we finally had a go from KSC : full sails to Jool !

After a short 1.5 years of waiting we had a great travel course for only 1000 m/s of delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the nightmare was not to wait for the window to open ... but the time of the travel itself : an 11 long years journey in deep space to reach Eeloo !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe path to Eeloo :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/982-Eeloo-Insertion-From-Jool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022982-Eeloo-Insertion-From-Jool.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11 years, about as much time for this last step as was spent for the whole journey since the departure from Kerbin ! The crew could have gone crazy, but they were either too stupid or too courageous for that ... During those long days between Jool and Eeloo, they kept asking to themselves if they really wanted to go back, or not. Some even suggested that may be they should all die on a course out of the kerbol the system, headed to the nearest star ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at mission time T\u002B26 years, the ship finally reached Eeloo. 26 years, for god sake ! Most of the crew members had spent close to half of their life in that spaceship ! The main pilot was even older, being a veteran from the first manned missions to Minmus and Ike ... at the venerable age of 65 years old, she was wondering if she could make it back to Kerbin ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, the arrival changed the minds of everybody and they started to think about what was to be done. The sight of Eeloo was also delightful, a very beautiful landscape that made them dream many nights ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Eeloo Orbit :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/983-Eeloo-Orbit.png\u0022 alt=\u0022983-Eeloo-Orbit.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a 150 km Polar orbit we could use the resource scanner. The planet had an average ore concentration, evenly spread. The choice of the landing site was then taken to be close to the equator and in a flat place. Deorbiting and landing was not a subject a concern, with more than 3100 m/s of delta-V remaining while in orbit. So it was made slowly, without stress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal landing maneuver on Eeloo :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/984-Eeloo-Landing.png\u0022 alt=\u0022984-Eeloo-Landing.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, at last, Eeloo !

The decision was quickly taken, the beauty of that last planet gave them the envy to share it with others and they all decided to go back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext step : Kerbin !!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 7 : Back to Kerbin.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return path was not an easy decision to take. Should we go straight to Kerbin or make one or two fuel stops ? Given the Eeloo orbit inclination and how fast the ship would arrive in the Kerbin system from Eeloo, the crew decided to make at least one pit stop on Pol in the Jool system before going for a direct insertion to Kerbin. Indeed, that path was to provide a better inclination for the burn to Kerbin and save fuel for the final orbiting maneuver around Kerbin, a maneuver that was expected to spend a lot of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, there was a direct Jool insert path : no need to wait before leaving Eeloo. Anyway, the travel time was still a bit scary, with a 4 years journey ! That meant at least 6 to 8 years more into space given the path back to kerbin would last about 2 years ... so far, so good, the point was to get back in one piece and it didn\u0027t really matter if the crew arrived in their late sixties ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe path to Jool :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/987-Jool-Insertion-From-Eeloo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022987-Jool-Insertion-From-Eeloo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the crew now expert in the usage of the ship, the whole pit stop was done in a fast and efficient way.

It was a direct, hard burned injection to Kerbin. First a 1400 m/s delta-V insertion maneuver, and a planned 1700 m/s orbitalization maneuver at 150 km above Kerbin. We wanted to avoid Kerbin atmosphere because the ship would probably not handle it and would most likely disintigrate. Anyway, with 4500 m/s of Delta-V available from Jool, these maneuvers would leave about 1200 m/s for a final trip to refuel on Minmus. At worst, if that final pit-stop was not possible, the ship would have been in orbit of Kerbin, allowing us to fulfill the main goal : recover the crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo after 2 more years of space travel, that was it, the ship was back to Kerbin !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.magmadev.com/temp/kerbal/990-Back-To-Kerbin.png\u0022 alt=\u0022990-Back-To-Kerbin.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbin orbiting maneuver was an 8 minutes burn.

However, before being retrieved, the crew wanted to park the ship into Minmus orbit after having refueled it.
