Some just punch up MechJEB and then go to the kitchen to make a sandwich or watch their favorite TV show, or just \u0022do something useful\u0022 while MechJEB \u0022...does the boring stuff...\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I have a different take on MechJEB, and this is probably the third time I will mention it here in the KSP forums. MechJEB has been my CFI (certified flight instructor). I started KSP with 0.18.3 demo, but back then I didn\u0027t really take it seriously, I always thought of KSP as a \u0022wannabe cartoon Orbiter\u0022 (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk\u003C/a\u003E). But when I got 0.19, and saw the new features, I really began to be engaged in it. I never used MechJEB until the point that I started to fiddle around with interplanetary trips, because back in Orbiter, we had MFDs (multifunction displays) for those kinds of voyages, and when I learned about MechJEB, it was the closest thing I could have to the Align MFD, the Transfer MFD or TransX. But, instead of letting MechJEB pilot my stack and me ignoring it, I \u003Cstrong\u003Eobserved everything\u003C/strong\u003E that MechJEB did while doing its thing. And pretty soon, it became predictive, and thus even without MechJEB, I started to realize I can do those manuevers myself, provided that my initial steps to get to that point were executed precisely and efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ll always see MechJEB as a flight instructor, more than just an automatic pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phenom Anon X","CreatedById":66562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion_herrera\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...

MechJeb is not only a tool ,it IS actually an instructor if you watch it go. Like the OP I started a few days before the release of .19 and I had no idea how to do stuff. Orbital mechanics were very dark to me. I Wanted to build a station but I had a lot of trouble getting to orbit. found out about MechJeb, installed it, watched it do the stuff and then one day I just found myself playing perfectly without it. I went from noob to accurate player by watching MechJeb go. I still use it regularly when I don\u0027t feel like piloting, but I don\u0027t go do something else in between, I watch. Excepted the times I launch something already tested and working perfectly, then it gets repetitive and I go downstairs make myself a coffee and come back to assist to the circularization, but nothing more. I\u0027ll be studying astronomy in a year and a half and I just love space, and what I love about this game is that I can just roam around and see stuff. Piloting is fun, but it\u0027s probably 5% of my fun source.
