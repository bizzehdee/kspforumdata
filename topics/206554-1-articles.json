Several issues though. First, if you want a harder set of planets, there are harder planets that are already in the game. An alternative to rescaling the Kerbol system \u00A0is to allow players to start in a more difficult environment. This does deprive you of a balanced kerbolar experience though. Second thing, the same argument that applies to adding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E applies here. The work is much less, but to get consistent experience the devs need to create a framework to make terrain work at larger scales, adding more terrain instead of having a lower definition larger surface. They could do this but chances are that it will be lower quality than expected and will deter modders from implementing their own solutions, which could be as good as the stock one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Watermel00n","CreatedById":217752,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T04:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhmm, i see ur point... lets see what the devs think abt it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224080957\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206554\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642910041\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn alternative to rescaling the Kerbol system \u00A0is to allow players to start in a more difficult environment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe opposite would work, putting the new player on a duna-like planet with roughly stock 3400 m/s to orbit, even in x2.5 scale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T05:11:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave the developers announced what the stock scales will be in KSP 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-23T05:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224080967\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206554\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221642914664\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156657\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HebaruSan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, HebaruSan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave the developers announced what the stock scales will be in KSP 2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
