It would be sorta like a master-arm switch and could be toggled like the SAS/RCS. Beside the SAS/RCS display on the navball, when your rocketed is armed, a red \u0022ARMED\u0022 text would appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many times where folks accidentally press space bar (it\u0027s right beside other buttons you use all the time), and accidentally stage their vessels. IMO, the staging button should get a safety switch. I suppose users could use a key combination to get the same effect though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing- how about physically representing the staging button inside the cockpit of a spacecraft with the archetypal \u0022big red button\u0022? It could have a transparent safety cover too that gets lifted on and off when the safety is enabled/disabled. When you press spacebar, the button gets depressed. It would add to immersion, and a single \u0022big red button\u0022 fits the cartoonish Kerbal ethos, IMO. Perhaps if the safety switch was not implemented, that would be even more fitting of the Kerbal ethos, and the devs could make fun of this fact by having an empty hole in the cockpit labelled \u0022Staging Safety Switch\u0022. But it\u0027s not usually a good idea to make fun of user\u0027s frustrations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, maybe the staging button should be green, and an abort launch button should be added that is red. That would also work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on a sort of related note, I would like to see more information added to cockpits (such as the ability to see how much delta-V you have left on a maneuver) so that it becomes more and more practical to control your spacecraft from the cockpit. It adds to the immersion of the game to fly your craft from inside of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-12T17:53:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2014 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cpast","CreatedById":112846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T17:53:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can already toggle a staging lock with Alt\u002BL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig red button would be nice, but should really be for \u0022abort\u0022.
