Like it served as a template. Granted, Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is different or \u0022scaled down\u0022 compared to Earth\u0027s but the \u0022feel\u0022 of the ascent is mimicked quite well. But I need a second opinion.\n\nAnyone else here have experience with these Orbiter craft? I wish to know your opinion if the new KSP aerodynamics let the aircraft/spaceplanes behave similarly to the Orbiter spaceplanes, specifically the XR series and the DeltaGlider Mark IV.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:27:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\\_herrera**"}]}
