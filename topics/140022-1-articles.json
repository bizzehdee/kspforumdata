Using the jetpack, I can reliably survive falls onto Kerbin at 40-50m/s, especially water. I just kind of feel this could use some tweaking. Also, saving mid-jump... please, my Jeb died from a normal jump. RIP. This was of course trying to circumvent the save lock when on EVA, but oh well. Maybe make it so you just can\u0027t save when jumping, either? Anyway, inconsistent damage from falling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panel","CreatedById":147540,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T14:23:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would be okay with this if they added EVA parachutes.
