However, what I really need is the ability to change the marker colors. There is a reddit thread and several other threads regarding the navball markers not being colorblind friendly. Imagine trying to navigate and you literally have to sick your face 1/2 from you monitor to just barely see the node marker. That is what I have to do because no matter what navball colors I use the blue node marker is invisible to me. The target (magenta) markers are also nearly impossible to see on the default navball texture. I have found a texture that helps with those but to be honest having the ability to set my own colors would be the best option. There are different kinds of color blindness so there is no one color fits all solution this is why allowing users to choose their own custome marker colors is the best solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:45:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ctbram\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ctbram\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlease consider adding the following features:\u003Cp\u003E1. add ability to change the hudnavball and ivanavball jpgs.
