I mostly use them for deploying antennas, solar panels, toggling engines and stuff where using the menu is too cumbersome or slow. To assign them, just go to the action groups tab (Top centre, a gear I think) and click on the part you want to assign, and the group you want to assign it to.

Just like staging, but unfortunately with no kick to get the detached part off. I should throw in some sepratrons I guess. When I\u0027m playing with Kethane, I keep a group for deploying drills, toggling the converter, and unleashing my massive, throbbing solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it\u0027s nice for toggling stuff like ladders when you have a bunch (tough to click the little bays) but lights and landing gear already come with hotkeys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love action groups to enable/disable fuel tanks themselves. Sometimes I want to carry a big fuel tank into orbit but only need a really small amount of fuel left in it for orbital adjustments/docking. So I let it drain into the lower stages to make my payload lighter. But since I have to disable Oxidizer and LiquidFuel with a mouse click each, I\u0027ll end up with some unusable fuel (which I also can\u0027t dump). I\u0027m sure I could also think of ways to quickly redirect fuel flow through external fuel lines using action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T03:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAction groups are handy for deploying solar panels IMO, though that might just be because I\u0027m too lazy to click on each panel separately. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Though I do find them very useful for launch escape systems, et cetera...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T13:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, y\u0027all; you\u0027ve definitely answered all my questions here.
