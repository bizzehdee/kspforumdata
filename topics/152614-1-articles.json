If no i need help about that.The thing is i\u0027m really horrible at making models.By this sort of models,I\u0027m really horrible at making like wing models,Those are really hard to me, for making those types of models.I\u0027m actually trying to make a World War 2 like warfare mod with fighter wings and bomber wings like that.Then when I\u00A0started making a simple\u00A0tiny wing it came out really horrible.So can someone give some tips and stuff for making wing models and like original ww2 fighter aircraft square oblong like fuselages\u00A0too\u00A0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, I\u0027m using Blender as a modeling sofware\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steedcrugeon","CreatedById":168050,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T16:30:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have thrown this up onto youtube as an example.

Basically, you make your model in Blender, make your textures in an image editing program, install the KSP PartTools in Unity, then use Unity to put it all together, and Unity will convert everything into a .mu file useable by KSP. There are also FREE versions of every program you need to get from start to finish.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat being said, there are already very many good tutorials and threads in the forums, that will give specifics for every step of the way...
