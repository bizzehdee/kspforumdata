When I bring the mouse cursor to the top of the screen (for example, to pop down the \u0022recover vessel\u0022 button), the OS X menu bar and window title bar slide down to cover the top portion of the screen (including the button I am going for). This is the behavior appropriate to an ordinary app that has been made full-screen with the green title bar button, but this is not appropriate behavior for a full-screen game, especially a game that is supposed to use the mouse-to-top-of-screen gesture itself, and which offers no relevant options in the menu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was informed by the Internet that adjusting the LSUIPresentationMode property in the game\u0027s plist file to 3 or 4 might be able to change this behavior, but that particular workaround does not appear to work for me. Has anyone been able to make this workaround, or another similar one, work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, Squad, please modify the game\u0027s interaction with OS X to prevent the menu bar and title bar from appearing when I push the mouse against the top of the screen in full-screen mode, or at least provide an alternate way to bring up the recover vessel button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T06:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other fix seeing they are redoing the UI anyway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet the recovery and space centre return buttons to out of the bottom of the Altitude display. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen your cursor has no need to go that high on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T11:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Interfect, you can force applications to stay on top with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/millenomi/afloat/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAfloat.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
