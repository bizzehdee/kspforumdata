Ofc also makes sense putting low t/w high efficiency engines at the later stages. Kinda what lead me to think that the pack kinda misses a 2.5m 500 to 600kn skipper-style engine. Two volcanos do at good enough job, but they seem more like low stage lifter engines.\n\nThanks for the tip with SRBs, somehow typical that I first think about various combinations of different engine types and than completely forget the most obvious solution.

Way back when in the HOME pack Bobcat had a radial Aerospike that was absolutely perfect for small landers.
