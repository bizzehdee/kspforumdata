I didn\u0027t try, but suspect you may even be able to get down to Mun\u0027s orbit from there as well. Of course, leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI at 760 means buggy patched conics and you\u0027re going to get recaptured as soon as you leave. So I suggest 765, which is easily enough to reach both Serran and Mun.\n\nI\u0027ve found it\u0027s easier to just eject at Serran (or Mun) An/Dn put your eject velocity at around 5m/s over minimum (765 for a 100km orbit), and then just adjust the time you burn so your Ap is at Serran (or your Pe is at Mun) and then go.

Bit of patience and this will happen at the AN/DN. Mostly just eyeball it for an early manoeuvre to get a glancing encounter, then perform a midway correction to get down to a tight polar orbit. Aside from those early missions where efficiency is life and equatorial orbits matter, it tends to work out quite well. Coming back is always easier, what with Kerbin being the big boy amongst Sonnah\u0027s moons.\n\nThe real magic... is how you go interplanetary in New Horizons given that TWP and MechJeb won\u0027t calculate exits from a moon. I won\u0027t spoil it because I suspect you\u0027d rather work it out (it\u0027s discussed further back in this thread anyway) but I\u0027ll say that you *can* get to Laythe for under 1km/s; but that my personal first attempts based on the obvious approach were more like 2.5-3.

So you\u0027ll either need big wings on a light airframe or you\u0027ll need to fly fast. But flying fast requires more power to overcome the drag, and big wings will themselves add drag.
