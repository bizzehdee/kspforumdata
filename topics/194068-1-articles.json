Sigma/Rescale is the simpler option, it just makes the stock planets bigger and has configs from 2.5x to 10.625x (apparently that makes Kerbin the same size as Earth) and tweaks things like gravity and atmosphere heights to match; it\u0027s fairly memory light both in terms of mod size and RAM use while the game is running. It can also rescale planets from other mods, although I haven\u0027t ever done that myself so can\u0027t tell you which will work and which won\u0027t.

If you want something a little different and have a powerful enough PC to cope, I highly recommend you try JNSQ as it\u0027s very well made and having a totally different Kerbin might make it a bit easier to adjust to the difference in scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DScamp","CreatedById":144316,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-22T21:36:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223789545\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194068\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590182222\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all- virtually all planet packs use Kopernicus, and Kopernicus is NOT 1.9.x (any version of 1.9)\u00A0compatible yet.
