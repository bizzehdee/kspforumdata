Some could only work with my timed-turns system though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An unmanned ship (including smart missiles) can be controlled only if there is a friendly crewed ship less than [distance to be decided] away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A ship with no more propulsion, weaponry nor means to be refitted back in combat shape is considered out of commission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A player automatically loses when he/she has no more controllable ships. One can also surrender or flee the system to avoid complete obliteration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Conditions of victory / defeat can be different for each player and more varied than just pure annihilation. For example one can have to protect a mining ship for a given time on the ground and then protect it as it escapes the system, while the other player will have to destroy it before it escapes the SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Civilian / support unarmed ships (designated as such before the battle) can only be attacked if there is no friendly ship in combat shape in a X meters radius around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce more, feedback is appreciated.
