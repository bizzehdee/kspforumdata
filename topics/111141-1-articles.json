Is there any way to build some kind of axis that turns in response to A and D?\n\nThanks,\n\nHarvey."},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:33:20Z","Content":"No, the wheels are made to steer like a tank.\n\nOn the bright side, you can turn around on the spot."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T00:04:59Z","Content":"Yeah, those ones are rigid. I don\u0027t use them all that often, but when I do, I usually add some hefty reaction wheels to the vehicle so that when I\u0027m turning, I can add SAS torque to the (tank-style) wheel steering to help with the turn."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T16:37:40Z","Content":"I\u0027m afraid the stock XL3 wheels are fixed in direction, making rovers with them [skid-steer craft](https://www.google.com/search?q=skid-steer).
