You can download it here for all platforms KSP runs on:\n\n[https://inkscape.org/download/](https://inkscape.org/download/)\n\nInkscape is not trivial software and requires some work to get familiar with\n\nit. Once you get good, you can do some really cool stuff. Some tutorials\n\nwill help you get you started:\n\n[https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/](https://inkscape.org/en/learn/tutorials/)\n\nOn Windows, SVG files are opened in Internet Explorer by default. You may\n\nneed to mess with your defaults, or right-click and choose Inkscape manually.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* MAN, INKSCAPE IS COMPLICATED! \\*\\*\\***\n\nIt really is ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nYou can ask questions in the forums, but I won\u0027t be providing any learning\n\nsupport for this (see the disclaimer). Sorry. There are probably other\n\nprograms you can use that might be easier. I don\u0027t know anything about those\n\nthough.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* WHAT\u0027S INCLUDED \\*\\*\\***\n\n1.) Examples.svg -- Some pre-made patches to give you ideas. I made these quickly, you can too!\n\n2.) Icons.svg -- This is full of all the planets, ship icons, patch outlines, and more. Copy and paste these into Flag Template.svg (where you assemble the patches).\n\n3.) Flag Template.svg -- This is where you assemble your patches. Make a copy before you save over it.\n\n4.) Aircraft Name \u0026 Number.svg -- This is a simple but handy template to put names on your planes/whatver. I think it looks best on the Mk3 cockpits, but it\u0027s nice anywhere.\n\n5.) Plaque Template -- A simple template that lets you make Pioneer Space Probe-esque plaques.\n\nSee the individual files for hints.\n\n**\\*\\*\\* DISCLAIMERS \\*\\*\\*** \n\nThis is provided AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.
