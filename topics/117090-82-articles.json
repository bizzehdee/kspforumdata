Thanfully, it looks like it will work out, if not well, then at least decently.  \n\nLots of work to do on it yet... nearly all of the geometry needs cleaned up, quite a bit needs more detail added (windows, hatches, hinges, cargo-bay interior and docking stuff).  Need to make and integrate the landing gear (one in the fuselage/nose, one in each wing), RCS (and the goemetry for the RCS on the OMS pods), and finalize all of the thrust transforms.  Still debating on if I should add additional in-flight gimbal/trim adjustment through another plugin... it is flyable without, but it could be helpful.  Also thinking on solutions to allow for an off-axis control transform... so you can have a \u0027control from here\u0027 that points in the direction of thrust rather than just the nose (will make MJ ascent a bit easier).  And of course I still need to handle all of the thermal stuff.\n\nI would love a way to add the split-rudder air-brakes, as well as allowing for the rear body flap as an air-brake.  Sadly, stock doesn\u0027t really support such complex setups (and I\u0027m not sure if they would even work in FAR); which is why the wings, tail, and elevons are already separate parts.\n\nHopefully by this time next-week that series of parts will be in a much more presentable state ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T01:27:01Z","Content":"Hello again\n\nI am sure you are awaire of this, but the SRB don\u0027t cost 0 regardless of their size.

Sometimes I put extra edge-loops in just to fix shading artifacts, so that might be what you are seeing... but there could also be some legitimate errors in the mesh (this stuff gets mangled so terribly during construction, splitting for AOs, duplicating non-unique faces, rejoining for export...

Integrating the docking port is an easy 1 part saved.\n\n2.) They are added through MODEL nodes, so feel free to patch them with whatever model you want.  This was intentional;  if you don\u0027t like the ports, you can write yourself a patch to fix it. (remove the model, offset the attach node downwards, and remove the docking-port module and possibly light/animation modules)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-20T18:08:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2016 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T10:54:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 hours ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just fixed this bug in dev-code (or the patch for LH2 rather).

Will likely be very similar to what you see on the current prototype parts, though perhaps moved inwards a bit (as the doors are becoming thicker).  The aim is that you shouldn\u0027t need special adapters on your station in order to dock the shuttle, but we\u0027ll see how that works out.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit:  The docking port itself is added through a MODEL node, so it could in theory be replaced through a patch with an animated one.\n\u003E \n\nSure, no problem, once I get back to KSP I\u0027ll take a look at making a patch to use a alternate docking port ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) (and back to RO too ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022) )  \n\n(btw, Buran is the first that comes to my mind, I simply find it so much handier to use it\u0027s extendable airlock ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022))"}]}
