She weighs 15.6 tons and can be crewed by 1 or unmanned. However, I\u0027ve never gotten a screenie of her being crewed, because of what follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus has a ridiculously low amount of gravity, I understand that. To compensate for this, I can understand that the wheels will not let me drive faster than 2.5m/s. However, I think Minmus has some friction (or rather, lack of) that makes it very difficult to use this rover. Specifically, it stops like a freight train, taking often more than 80 meters to slow to a standstill, and even when its speed is appreciably negligible, the game refuses to let me save because it\u0027s about to Crash: due to ice, or something, its velocity is never totally zero. I can switch to a nearby base module, but then if I save and try to do something else by going to the space center, say, using the space center to switch to another lander vehicle that\u0027s about a kilometer away, MOLLY disappears, as if she\u0027s crashed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my issue is, is there any way around the friction aspect? Or is there some other problem I\u0027m unaware of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be ridiculously hard at this point to try and make MOLLY heavier. And I have tried just letting the rover sit and settle out-- it doesn\u0027t work either. She just gently idly slides side to side, about the speed and distance of swinging one\u0027s arm back and forth in slow motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Answer]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess sticking landing legs on it will have to suffice until Minmus gets its friction levels improved.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-22T00:43:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/22/2013 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eother symptom\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T01:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy guess would be that you are using those gigantic wheels with almost no mass for them to lift.
