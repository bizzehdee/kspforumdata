The alternative is to start your rocket ascent from a lower speed/lower altitude, increasing your fuel requirement, which means increased complexity and increased weight. The simple fact is that the RAPIER is, basically, gutless and heavy, and to compensate for that you need more fuel, more intakes, more complexity.

If the RAPIER is going to win over a turbojet design, it\u0027s here because it\u0027s one of the rare cases where a RAPIER design is lighter. I flew to a 100k orbit (ish), and saw how much delta V I had left. I also took a snapshot as the plane crossed 10,000m. I then replaced the turbojets with RAPIERs and removed the aerospike. The plane was still well balanced and flew nicely. They took off with the same level of fuel (this plane does not take off fully fuelled, but has empty tank space to allow it to reach Jool after refuelling in orbit), were both flown in air breathing mode for as long as they were able to make progress to orbit, and then switched to rockets.
