Everything loaded perfectly except for the KSC. My install included the Switcher which used to be with the older RSS versions. For some reason, each of the KSCs are off of their position. For instance, the initial launch center at The Cape is on the ocean, and Baikonur is underground. Is this a problem with the height maps? I\u0027ve never had this problem with a RSS install, so any help with be appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ANWRocketMan","CreatedById":65251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T10:53:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the KSC Switcher configs are not properly updated for the new Kopernicus-based RSS version. So they would probably have to be redone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
