Means it loses the extreme versatility of Hubble (which can image pretty much any wavelength you ask it to... or could, before its instruments started breaking). But it is *extremely good* at near infrared. And it\u0027s the frequency that\u0027s best for peering deep into the early universe, which is its main purpose.\n\nHubble will be retired when its orbit decays to the point of becoming dangerously close to uncontrolled reentry (Hubble is in LEO, in contrast to JWST, which will go to a lagrange point). It will then spend the last puff of fuel that it has to make a controlled reentry over the ocean.

Webb will primarily look at the Universe in the infrared, while Hubble studies it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths (though it has some infrared capability). Webb also has a much bigger mirror than Hubble. This larger light collecting area means that Webb can peer farther back into time than Hubble is capable of doing. Hubble is in a very close orbit around the earth, while Webb will be 1.5 million kilometers (km) away at the second Lagrange (L2) point.\n\n[http://jwst.nasa.gov/comparison_about.html](http://jwst.nasa.gov/comparison_about.html)\nThis telescope will require 47\u0027K heat removal for is near infrared detctor and a 2 stage colling system for the mid-range infrared detector, 7\u0027K. Both can operate above optimal but doing this results in two corrections. The noise to signal will increase. Sampling times will inrease but not indefinitely, so that at some point data will have to be stacked by the computers and statistially analyzed and filtered later. This means you would have to have a large computer with lots more memory and heat producion, or crop the sampled dat to smaller regions. Grab, crop and toss.\n\nIf this equipment needs service Nasa better have a manned space program capable of reaching L2.
