Brown is always \u0022down\u0022 and blue \u0022up,\u0022 ie towards nearest planet or away. This means that when you\u0027re in an inertial orbit (one in which you do not rotate) navball moves and it appears pitch is changing. Pitch is in fact changing with regards to ground but not with regards to 3D space. And in fact craft is not rotating, only thing that changes is its aspect with regards to planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL (at least in Apollo) the navball was fixed to an arbitrary zero point (more on that in a bit) and didn\u0027t move unless craft actually rotated. However, there was disagreement between astronauts and engineers. The engineers favored the model I just described, but the astronauts who were all pilots wanted an artificial-horizon type device at least when in orbit. So they got both. When in orbit they activated a device called ORDEAL (Orbital Rate Display Earth and Lunar.) This basically rotated the navball such that is worked just like it does in KSP. Autopilot kept it steady with the result that craft always maintianed same orienttion to earth during orbit, and thus always pointed prograde and made 1 complete 360 degree pitch maneuver in each orbit. (as an aside, they were \u0022heads down\u0022 in that earth was above them in reference to the seated position. This was because 3/5 windows faced mostly up, and sextant/telescope was on opposite side and naturally had to face stars.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce they left orbit they turned off ORDEAL and went back to the mode in which zero point of navball did not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course in space the zero point was arbitrary and they actually changed it several times during mission. Zero point had the jaw-breaking name of REFSMMAT (reference to stable member matrix.) They changed it for 2 main reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. it was convenient during a burn to have the desired attitude be zero in all 3 axes so that if astronauts had to control manually they could just hold the navball centered. (In KSP this would be like having a maneuver prograde be zero point.) So once they calculated the attitude for a burn they would usually change the zero point as described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. There were some attitudes in which they could experience \u0022gimbal lock,\u0022 a situation in which at least 1 gyro was no longer free to move (or actually not move as craft moved around it) such that it would get torqued out of position. This was due to having only 3 gimbals and could easily be solved with a 4th gimbal but for some reason they left that out. The attitude was marked on navball as a redzone and they had to make sure redzone was not on reference point. If a maneuver could result in an attitude that would cause gimbal lock they would simply change the zero point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in KSP I think there should be 2 modes of navball: orbital and inertial. Orbital works just like it does now. Intertial would mean that indicated attitude doesn\u0027t change unless craft actually rotates. In this mode you might want to have different (or no) colors to remind one that it\u0027s no longer in reference to the ground but to 3D space. In this mode there could be buttons and/or hotkeys to change the zero point, one shortcut would be to change zero point to current prograde, another to maneuver prograde, perhaps also to retrograde and target prograde. Maybe a manual option to change zero point in any axis to a desired value, although I\u0027m not sure why one would would do that. Of course it\u0027s not critical to be able to change zero point with all the nice markers and such but it would be easy to implement I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt we\u0027ll ever simulate gimbal lock, but if they did as part of an Apollo pack then you would have to be able to change zero point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like this could be a simple change, perhaps a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-20T20:02:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2014 08:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DrD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T20:04:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you considered looking into \u003Ca href=\u0022http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOrbiter?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-20T20:32:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not against the idea of inertial navball, I just think it would be of only marginal use.
