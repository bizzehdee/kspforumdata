To that end, I propose a throttle lock. Similar to Gear/Lights/RCS/SAS, it is persistent, and perhaps indicated by a red indicator at the bottom of the throttle. May be a red \u0027lock\u0027 tab that slides out over the throttle slider. Or a light. A light works too. But basically, some assurance that accidentally nudging the shift key or - and I do this all the time - switch vessels without checking the position of your joystick\u0027s throttle, turning what was supposed to be a simple Munar free-return flyby into an exercise in ballistic trajectories and impact mechanics. Or docking \u003Cem\u003Ethrough\u003C/em\u003E, rather than to, a station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T01:23:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way is to just \u0022minimize\u0022 the navball.
