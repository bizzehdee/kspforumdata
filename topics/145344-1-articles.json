When my eyes saw the wonder that was the ISRU units and the mining drills a couple hours into the game, I knew immediately that what I wanted to build was a rocketship that could travel to and land anywhere it wants, refuel, and return, carrying a bold Kerbal crew and all science experiments as well. In practical terms, this meant a rocket which could take off from Kerbin, travel to Minmus without refuelling beforehand, land on Minmus, refuel and then travel elsewhere with good delta-V to spare.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KRS Persistence N-S II is the pinnacle\u00A0of all my spacecraft, and it represents the culmination of countless engineering mindset breakthroughs as well as a well honed piloting ability. Its maximum delta-V, travelling on the nuclear engines alone, is 6533m/s if my calculations are correct.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cTNMNDa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cTNMNDa.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts takeoff flight plan is moderately complex. At launch, turn on the chemical engines only with the chemical rockets action group, then start performing a gravity turn at roughly 50m/s. I typically nudge it a small amount at 50m/s, then set autopilot at prograde after 2500m altitude.\u00A0At approximately 5000m altitude, turn on the nuclear engines with the nuclear engines action group, and continue performing the gravity turn. Keep both nuclear and chemical engines on until the chemical rockets run out of fuel. Stay with the standard gravity turn until there is one minute left until apoapsis, then set it back to stability assist and hold until circularization of orbit happens. At this moment, you should have enough remaining fuel to travel to Minmus and land if you aim\u00A0at Minmus accurately. This might take some practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAction groups:\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Toggle Radiators.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

It doesn\u0027t have the necessary acceleration, and its more efficient engines are crushed by Eve\u0027s atmosphere. However, Tylo should theoretically be possible - it just needs to be careful with its ratio of oxidizer to liquid fuel upon refueling at Pol or Bop. I haven\u0027t done a Jool-5 with this particular SSTA yet, but with its similar delta-v (6558m/s)\u00A0much larger cousin, the KRS Endurance N-S III, I\u0027ve gotten within 500m and 100m/s of landing on Tylo. It turns out that I have refueled too much oxidizer,\u00A0so I\u0027m trying to figure out some good way to burn off a chunk of it and refuel again before attempting Tylo again. I\u0027m using the KRS Endurance N-S III first because it has a large scanner, and I\u0027m planning to scan the entire solar system before then sending out the Persistence and deploying the fuel stations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D7RtMek.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022D7RtMek.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KRS Endurance N-S III at Bop. The Endurance line was the first line of SSTAs built along similar shapes, and it was breakthroughs discovered while engineering the Endurance line of SSTAs allowed the Persistence line to become SSTAs.

Refueled entirely on liquid fuel, found the closest launch window and went straight at it. I recall that I had approx. 1 000 liquid fuel remaining upon landing at Eeloo, so I had a decent delta-V margin left. Unfortunately, no pics from that save - I did that before I thought of taking pictures, and I deleted the save because I fail at quicksaving and every so often I loose my Kerbals in an unrecoverable fashion (offscreen death, for example). In my current save, the KRS Persistence N-S II is chilling at Minmus for now while the Endurance III scans everything it can.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Got7at6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Got7at6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Persistence chilling and refueling at Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
