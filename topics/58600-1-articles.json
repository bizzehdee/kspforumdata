If you are under the planet then you will orbit anti-clockwise and the reverse if over the planet - assuming an anticlockwise launch from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T12:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the OP is asking how do you tell BEFORE you get there - when you plan your transfer maneuver - which way is the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick to answer that is to see which way the encounter causes your trajectory to bend. Look at the new post-encounter trajectory that is being predicted. (the purple orbit on the map view) Does it fling you radial-in or radial-out from the Sun. You can tell because radial-in will rotate the orbit backward (The orbit ahead of you dips closer to the sun and the orbit behind you rises higher from the sun), while radial-out will rotate the orbit the other way (the orbit ahead of you rises higher from the sun and the orbit behind you dips closer to the sun). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your predicted orbit bends in the radial-out direction, you\u0027re passing inside the target planet and thus on route to a clockwise (retrograde) capture maneuver. If your predicted orbit bends in the radial-in direction, you\u0027re passing outside the target planet an thus on route to a counterclockwise (prograde) capture maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in any case, it doesn\u0027t take much delta-V to correct for this if you stop time warp the moment you enter your target\u0027s SOI. While still far from the target planet you can burn perpendicular to your path and bend it to pass on whichever side of the planet you like and it\u0027s not that big of a deflection.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awaras","CreatedById":15671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-02T12:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can switch the patched conic draw mode to \u00270\u0027 by editing the settings.cfg file in the KSP folder. This draws the projected encounter trajectory around the planet itself, allowing you to center on the target planet and fine-tune the approach.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
