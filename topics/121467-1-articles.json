It doesn\u0027t knows this because it knows nothing. By not subtracting where it is from where it isn\u0027t, or where it isn\u0027t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains nothing, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to not generate corrective commands to not drive the missile from a position where it isn\u0027t to a position where it isn\u0027t, and not arriving at a position where it wasn\u0027t, it now isn\u0027t. Consequently, the position where it isn\u0027t, is now the position that it wasn\u0027t, and it follows that the position that it wasn\u0027t, is now the position that it isn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the event that the position that it isn\u0027t in is not the position that it wasn\u0027t, the system hasn\u0027t acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile isn\u0027t, and where it wasn\u0027t.
