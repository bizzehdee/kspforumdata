I made ONE with the Fraps free trial. It worked fine for me. Very minimal framerate loss, and (i think) reasonable file size. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried the Dxtory free trial, but it basically halved my framerate and gave me files more then three times as big as fraps files. Unless i am doing something REALLY wrong, i am not going to be using it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try bandicam, but i haven\u0027t heard many good things about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso tried this other thing called Camstudio (later found out it was a trojan) with HORRIBLE framerate, but the filesizes were already so small i didnt need to compress them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically im wondering which screen recorder software is the best (particularly for KSP) and what other good ones i have not tried yet. I just want to make sure i make the right choice when i get around to buying one of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, what is the average file size of a video after compression?

Fraps has a free version with limited features. In my experience, free and easy or free and functional do not usually go together. There are other free products out there, but they are either hard to set up and use or they cause severe frame rate drops. Setting up a camcorder to record your monitor is probably the best \u0022free\u0022 alternative, unless your video card has RCA outputs that can go to a dvd recorder or VCR. There are products out there that can capture video and audio from a HDMI cable, but they are far from free.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hotmailcompany52","CreatedById":21696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T06:38:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your on mac I find quicktime player to be the best.
