You would drain one fuel tank at a time and then drop the empty arm off. Rest of the arms would then rotate to form a triangle to balance your ship. So kinda like asparagus staging, but involving moving parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess it could be done with Infernal Robotics, but would be easier if there was a structural fuselage with rotating parts in it (hence the choice of sub-forum).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T19:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile they\u0027re rotating, the thrust would be unbalanced.

With an unbalanced thrust OR drag, your ship would have lots of problems no matter where it was, and while you can control unbalanced thrust by shutting off engines, you can\u0027t do the same with unbalanced drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill. I think it\u0027s a really cool idea to have mechanically position-able engines attached to the body!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
