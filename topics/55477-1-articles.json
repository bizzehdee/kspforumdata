During this past work week, I\u0027d been getting some more ambitious ideas in my head about building a modular type of ship in orbit. Today I put the central-most unit in orbit, then painstakingly docked one of the outer units with it. This is my first time building a craft in orbit and it is also my first time docking items with multiple connection points. I\u0027m still shaking and sweating a little. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Jebediah is piloting the main craft and Bill is shuttling up the modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.whiteravenserver.net/screens/piecemeal1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022piecemeal1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.whiteravenserver.net/screens/piecemeal2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022piecemeal2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBill departs, headed back to Kerbin.

It is in a nearly circular orbit 202-204km above Kerbin. All the attached tanks still have about 75%-90% fuel left in them, but I\u0027m still probably going to send up a refuelling vessel to top off the orange tanks and replenish the monoprop. Once that\u0027s done I\u0027ll have to design some modules to go on top of those tanks (lander, probe, a small seperate explorational craft, etc...).

It was originally planned to be more of an exercise in modular/reuseable ship construction. And I can always manually deactivate a few engines to help preserve fuel. The other good thing about this design is it\u0027s very refuelable (as I just proved about 15 minutes ago by topping off the liquid tanks and the monoprop in orbit). If this ship is in orbit around a distant celestial body with questionable reserves of fuel for the return voyage, I could always build a second one (or something like it) and use it as a disposable refueling vessel to rendezvous with the first one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and as always, use very carefully planned orbital manuevers and transfer orbits and make good use of \u0022window of opportunity\u0022 situations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m already designing an upgraded version of this in my head that involves 10 tanks and 5 engines (basically a double-length version of the one I have now) giving me a little better range.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T17:23:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by WhiteRaven22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
