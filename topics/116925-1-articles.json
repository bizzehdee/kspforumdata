This resulted in uneven thrust between the two engines, they would increase at the same rate, and then the one on the right would cap at around 220 thrust while the other continued to increase. This results in loss of control. I am not sure if it is an issue with my design or a bug in the game. Note: i always have plenty of oxygen and liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/ioQJsMl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ioQJsMl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T19:04:36Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T16:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPictures always help in this case, but the most obvious thing first is the order of placement that you are using.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDual jet engines have some quirky behavior, a lot of which is due to the intake air distribution. KSP handles air by spreading it out through the whole ship. However, the order of placement matters because of how the underlying code works. So if you place all of the intakes then both engines, the second engine placed will only get the leftovers that the first engine didn\u0027t use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally, if possible, it works better if you can split the intake placement in between engine attachment.
