I\u0027m thinking that maybe what was causing your problem though, is the fact you are using both fairing bases and decoupler\u0027s at the same time to stage your rocket. If you dumped the fairing bases you would be better off in my opinion. In regards to how your rocket flies, I\u0027ve just been telling mechjeb to put me into either a 70km or 80km orbit, and your rocket couldn\u0027t achieve either of those orbits before the second stage burnt out. Also the main engine on your first stage burns out before the SRB\u0027s do, and that causes a fairly large drop in velocity before your second stage lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note, is there noway to add an attachment to a post?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skendzie","CreatedById":58299,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T02:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea, I was going to address the delta V issue after I fixed the docking.
