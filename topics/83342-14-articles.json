I do want to add specific support for those systems, but it hasn\u0027t been a high priority yet because I haven\u0027t had too many requests for it. Regarding RSS support, I hadn\u0027t given it much thought since Regex\u0027s campaign system was supposed to use a mass based timer for each pad, so KCT wasn\u0027t going to end up being paired with RSS in 99% of installs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do wonder how KCT should handle multiple launch sites. Should each one have their own build lists and storages? Or should they share all of those and have reconditioning and rollout times for each site instead. The latter is what I would likely do at the moment, at least for KK. RSS\u0027 dedication to realism would incline me to have individual build lists and storages per KSC (ones without VABs/SPHs wouldn\u0027t have VAB or SPH lines, obviously).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I did see \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84689-0-25-Realism-Overhaul-v6-1-2c-1-Nov-2014?p=1504334\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post1504334\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis message\u003C/a\u003E in the RO thread and would like to comment on it. While KCT relies on part cost for determining construction time (well, technically \u0022Build Point\u0022 values) all of that information is available in any game mode, not just career. As a result, KCT works perfectly fine in a Sandbox game. The upgrade system relies on the Tech Tree (for now), but in Sandbox mode you\u0027re just given a bunch of upgrades (45 to be precise, which is less than what you\u0027d get from a full tech tree \u002B the starting 15) which you can spend however you want. That number can be changed at any time so that users can give themselves more points for completing tasks they feel are worth upgrades (like landing on the Mun, or Duna, or sending a probe to Venus). To me, Sandbox isn\u0027t necessarily \u0022Have everything all the time!\u0022 but is instead \u0022Play however you want\u0022, so KCT is designed to still be played with in Sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-07T00:43:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2014 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
