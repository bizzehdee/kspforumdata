They tend to require more bulk than I expected, due to a strange effect: losing thrust at certain altitudes and/or speeds.\n\nThis happens with aerospikes, LV-T30s, even Skippers. I get to around 15-20k, thrust at max all the way, and without having to touch the keyboard the thrust meter suddenly dives, fluctuates, sometimes cuts out entirely. This tends to make ascent from Laythe partly an endurance run, so I need much more fuel than I should.\n\nI\u0027ve seen this lifting off from Kerbin with a few vehicles as well, but much more rarely.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen? Is this a known issue not mentioned on the wiki? What could be going on here?"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T18:56:16Z","Content":"Screenshot? Mods?

I found ~3400 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv (atmospheric) to be an acceptable (minimum) number for reaching orbit from the ground. Realistically you probably want a bit more. In this regard, the Wiki is incorrect, the 2800m/s number it lists will absolutely strand you.\n\nI did find that the atmosphere\u0027s density seemed to decrease slower than I would have expected as I ascended, but I didn\u0027t find any strange dead spots or places where my thrust suddenly cut out.\n\nAre you sure you\u0027re not losing fuel flow to an engine or something?
