They tend to require more bulk than I expected, due to a strange effect: losing thrust at certain altitudes and/or speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis happens with aerospikes, LV-T30s, even Skippers. I get to around 15-20k, thrust at max all the way, and without having to touch the keyboard the thrust meter suddenly dives, fluctuates, sometimes cuts out entirely. This tends to make ascent from Laythe partly an endurance run, so I need much more fuel than I should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen this lifting off from Kerbin with a few vehicles as well, but much more rarely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else had this happen?
