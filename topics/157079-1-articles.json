(Me: Docker A and Docker B. Took forever. At first I though \u0022Oh, cool!\u0022 But my real \u0022I can dock!\u0022 moment was the first additional module of Space Station Epic. I swear, it took me two hours to dock it! I felt so awesome afterward!

(Yeah, this is true! After Duna, you can basically go anywhere!) (Me: I forget the name, but it was a two part ascent module and lander. I felt so cool climbing Jeb dramatically down the ladder!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 First ascent from Eve: Woah. I have truly mastered this game! (WOOOHOOO! If you need more info, I think it\u0027s in part 29(?) of Project Intrepid. It was a huge, five man ship that was brought to Eve by a 100 meter long mothership.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Do a minor impossible thing: Oh, cool! I got\u00A0a dozen likes on one post! (I\u0027ve done three. One being a working ion plane in 1.1, two, I built a steampunk Mun base using only solid rocket boosters (Yes, you heard me!) and three, sending 916 Kerbals to Minmus in one launch!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Do a major impossible thing: Why did my like counter suddenly jump 200 points? (I have never done one of these. But to list a few: the first stock helicopter. The Rubik\u0027s cube. That first guy to do a Jool ascent. The EVA grand tour. The guy who went to Eve and back twice with no refueling and the same ship. If you achieve one of these, you basically have become one of the few overlords of KSP. Cherish it!
