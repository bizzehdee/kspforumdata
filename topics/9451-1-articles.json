The GPV is designed to be able to do a Munar orbit/landing, orbital rendezvous, and even got tested on a \u0027straight up\u0027 burn and got into a low orbit around the kerbol at 5mill m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging is a bit complicated, but it\\\u0027ll get to Mun with the whole center cylinder, if you aim right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/51788563/GPVPack.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/51788563/GPVPack.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zzIy7.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022zzIy7.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage is the most \u0027complex.\u0027 Wait until the 12 outermost boosters run completely out of fuel. Should be somewhere near 13km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, wait until you have 6 empty fuel cans and then jettison that stage. Usually the other 6 stacks are enough to get me into a Munar orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas 8 landing struts, rather heavily overengineered. It IS designed for a powered landing on both Mun and Kerbin, landing on Mun should require next to no fuel from the lander, depending on how you land, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse parachutes for braking on re-entry, ship has plenty of fuel, so use the main engines on a full burn to help brake, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: The IX version (highest numbered) is the \u0027most stable.\u0027 Earlier versions may or may not wobble, fall apart, etc. I\\\u0027m pretty sure I tossed in one that explodes from some internal strut failing partway through launch, but watching it looked like it just spontaneously and completely exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
