Usually, the eyepieces can be removed and changed for different magnification. Each eyepiece should have a number: 8mm, 3mm, and the like. The larger the number, the \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E magnification. I know it\u0027s weird, but just go with it, okay? When you\u0027re looking through another person\u0027s telescope, it is considered improper to actually rest your face on the eyepiece, instead, look from a fraction of an inch above if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFilters:\u003C/strong\u003E Little bits of colored glass that only make light of a single color pass through. These can be used to enhance contrast for distant planets and even nebulas. If everything looks a little off-color, you can ask the guys whether they\u0027re using a filter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFinder Scope:\u003C/strong\u003E A little scope tacked onto the side of the bigger one. You don\u0027t really need to look through that guy unless you yourself are trying to find an object. Hopefully the pros will do all of that for you. If you do have to find an object, gently guide the telescope and look through the finder scope until the crosshairs are directly centered at the object you want. Then look through the \u0027real\u0027 scope and see whether the object is there! If it\u0027s not, look back to the finder scope and make some adjustments, or gently, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E slowly move the main scope around while looking through the eyepiece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFocus Knob:\u003C/strong\u003E The bit that makes stuff not be quite so blurry. It generally works by adjusting the distance between the mirror and your eyepiece. Even if you think the telescope is not focused, it\u0027s improper to actually twiddle the thing yourself. Instead, have the owner of the telescope do it. This is a common mistake for beginning telescope users to make, and it will irritate the telescope\u0027s owner. If you are given permission to mess with the focus knob, turn it so that objects are quite unfocused and then gradually bring them back into focus. Note that under high magnifications and on a warm night (with plenty of \u0027waves\u0027 of heat coming off the ground), it may be impossible to properly focus your \u0027scope. Don\u0027t worry about it though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETelescope Mount:\u003C/strong\u003E The bit that the telescope is sitting on.

But the main thing is to stand at the correct east-west position - it\u0027s very hard to change from east hemisphere to the west hemisphere, you need to basically re-aim the telescope from scratch (what happens when the object passes from east side to the west side, as they rise and set). To more precisely aim at the object, as long as the object is behind the telescope\u0027s body viewed from the ocular end, it\u0027s most likely within the field of view of the finder (or even, the main telescope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3rd : There\u0027s this small scope attached to the main telescope - the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finderscope\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efinder\u003C/a\u003E.

I learned the sky with the help of good old fashioned books and a red flashlight, back in the mid 90s. It was relatively easy, even for a 10 year old. The patterns the stars make in the sky are quite distinctive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that said, I learned the sky under moderate light pollution; I could see stars down to like magnitude 5.5. If you\u0027re under heavier light pollution, things could become more difficult by making some distinctive patterns disappear. I\u0027ve heard from city observers that the actual opposite can be true also- that learning under city skies can be easier because there are fewer stars- though it\u0027s hard to imagine \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E this is true, it makes very little sense to me. Sometimes, I\u0027ll see some bright star in the city and struggle to figure out what it is because of the utter lack of \u0022context\u0022, and only identify it by figuring in time of year and time of night. City dwellers supposedly get \u0022lost\u0022 the first time they make it out to a low light pollution area because they get \u0022overwhelmed\u0022 by the number of stars. Personally, I had no issues at all transitioning to light-pollution-free skies, but I was only transitioning from moderate light pollution to no light pollution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, I still \u003Cstrong\u003Evastly\u003C/strong\u003E prefer books over electronic means. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) I have NEVER encountered a planetarium program or app that is dim enough to not interfere with your night vision- \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eevery single one\u003C/span\u003E I\u0027ve ever seen is WAY too bright. The problem is, you need \u003Cstrong\u003Ea lot\u003C/strong\u003E of light to activate your high resolution night vision. So the entire screen is bright, and it never turns off. At a dark sky site, anyone using a laptop is not very popular at all. However, when you use a dim red flashlight, you only illuminate the part on the page that you want to read. When you\u0027re not looking at it, it doesn\u0027t emit light to mess up your night vision and/or the night vision of others. Books and charts also do not require batteries- the only batteries you need are for your flashlight, which, if it\u0027s a good flashlight, is powered by a 9V battery, emits pure red light from red LEDs, and doesn\u0027t need a battery change until like 50 or 100 hours of continuous use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Laptops/Ipads/whatever are expensive. They break easily. Where I observe, by the end of the night, there is water everywhere- sometimes forming in puddles around the telescope. My star charts are frequently covered in mud, and they are always covered in water by the end of an observing session. It\u0027s called \u003Cem\u003Edew\u003C/em\u003E. If I used a laptop, it would die, and die \u003Cstrong\u003Efast\u003C/strong\u003E. It would either dew up and short out, or a water would drip onto it and it would short out, I\u0027d accidentally knock it over and it would die, I\u0027d spill a drink on it and it would die, whatever. Laptops and IPads and the like are delicate and do not belong outside, at least, not with \u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Laptops are hard to bring to the eyepiece- I\u0027ll frequently need to bring a paper chart right up to the eyepiece with me, and alternate between looking at it and looking through the eyepiece. Not only are Laptops big and heavy, but they also constantly emit too much light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Laptops/IPads/w/e use up too much power. I need my amp hours for powering dew heaters NOT pumping out huge amounts of light into the night when no one is looking at the stupid screen, or running some 2.5 GHz turbo-charged quad core heating element that\u0027s trying to download some stupid Windows updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn contrast to all of this, books, charts, and flashlights are cheap, they are durable, the flashlights have very long battery lives, they do not emit too much light, and individually, they are smaller and easier to use. No one is going to steal your charts if you leave them unattended at some public event. They still work even if you get them muddy and wet. Hell, I\u0027ve even stacked up a couple volumes of \u003Cem\u003EUranometria 2000.0\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Estood on them\u003C/em\u003E so I could put the eyepiece at a more comfortable height. Try doing that with a laptop! Oh and finally, charts can be repaired with duct tape. To repair your laptop, you\u0027ll have to spend 3 hours on the phone with some guy from Techsupportistan that barely speaks English.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as books go, I learned with the Peterson Field Guide, but honestly, most any book that has charts of the naked eye stars will do. The way to learn the sky is to match the map to what you\u0027re seeing in the sky. That\u0027s all there is to it. To actually find things with a telescope, you\u0027ll want a chart that plots stars down to much fainter than naked eye visibility- so like magnitude 7.5 or fainter. I used Sky Atlas 2000.0 and it\u0027s a reasonably good chart for intermediate observers. More advanced observers will want to get Uranometria 2000.0. (I actually have a several three-ring binders full of my own finder charts I made using online sources (Simbad Astronomical Database) and a laser printer... but that\u0027s not applicable to your case.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, dark skies make a \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHUGE\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E difference in spotting deep sky objects, and in the beauty of the sky and the objects seen through the telescope. Do you own a car? If so, you\u0027re in luck. Many people live in areas where dark skies are impractically far away, however, it looks like somewhat dark skies are within a 100 km drive of you, and if you go 200 km you can get even darker.

There are folks who observe for years and years and never take their telescopes outside the suburbs; to me, they\u0027re missing out but as long as they are having fun, that\u0027s all that actually counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re serious about deep sky observing, then considering that Portugal has reasonably decent skies, a Dobsonian reflector- 8\u0022 or 10\u0022- would probably be ideal. You\u0027ll want enough money for a small set of eyepieces (at least three- for low, medium and high power), and a narrowband nebula filter. TWO finder scopes is best; my personal favorite is a non-magnifying \u0022window\u0022 site like a Telrad combined with a right angle, correct image finderscope of at least 50 mm. The Telrad puts you on a naked eye star and the finder scope allows you to star-hop from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T14:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T18:51:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re able to get to the observation site before the party, familiarize yourself with the site.
