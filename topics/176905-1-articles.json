For me, the fiddly maneuvering to match the specified orbit is the fun part of these, and the margin of error on the completion conditions is large enough that my target disappears and the contract ends before I get to the fine corrections. I\u0027ve skimmed through the settings and physics config files, and I didn\u0027t see any way of decreasing this margin of error and making the requirements stricter. Does anybody know of a way to do this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-21T20:45:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the
