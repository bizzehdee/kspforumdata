Rather, it seemed as if he was asking whether or not that should devote the time they could spend introducing NEW features (i.e. new systems, parts, multiplayer, etc.) on additional bug squashing.

Truthfully, I\u0027ve never been a big fan of sandbox games because I\u0027ve found that without some guidance or direction it can be difficult to think of new things to do. KSP (even with career mode) is an amazing sandbox game because it lines up for you so many accomplishments without really trying. For example, you start by getting into orbit, then the Mun, then Minmus, then other planets like Duna, Eve, etc. Then trying to land on those planets and return safely.

So, that said, in the interest of keeping the game going, bugs MUST be nearly gone before an official release and there definitely can not be any big ones.

We\u0027ve all been putting up with them because we\u0027ve all been aware that the game is in development. Once you call it 1.0 you\u0027re saying, \u0022This game isn\u0027t in development anymore.\u0022 Look at how many releases from major game developers have been savaged in the press because they were buggy on release.

Again, we\u0027ve all been putting up with that because the game is in development. Reviewers and buyers aren\u0027t going to put up with that from a game that isn\u0027t in development anymore. Dress up your textures and make them consistent. IVAs for everything. Fix the water. Add some clouds. Maybe even add some weather. I might even point out that nobody is going to believe that Kerbals developed spaceflight without ever building a single structure on their planet except for their space center. I can\u0027t really speak to the sound quality, since I\u0027m mostly deaf, but I\u0027m sure the comments others have made are spot on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the aerodynamics (including reentry effects). Right now, they\u0027re just embarrassing. You\u0027re fixing them, and that\u0027s good. However, you somehow imagine that you\u0027re going to get them 100% right, final release quality, zero bugs, on the first try, with no beta testing. It\u0027s a bit cheeky, don\u0027t you think?

To summarise my view on the matter, I would say:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures I think need to be in 1.0:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) bug fixes and polish. There are plenty of bugs in 0.90 that need sorting out, and things like tutorials and IVAs still missing. I would include balancing existing parts and the tech tree in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) aerodynamics. This change will make a big difference to gameplay, and will likely make craft that work today not work in future. It is important to make sure that craft that work in 1.0 continue to work in 1.x.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) re-entry. A core function of spaceflight, and something that if introduced later risks breaking people\u0027s save games, not something we want to see after 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeatures discussed for 1.0 that can safely be pushed back:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) in situ resource mining. The core game is building and flying space missions. Resource mining is a great idea, but isn\u0027t essential to the core game, and would work well as a new feature for a future update. I imagine the mechanics associated with this feature risk bringing in lots of bugs and will need a fair degree of QA and testing. Perhaps better to leave it for a future update\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) delta V and engineering reports. Sure, it would be nice to have this information, and to have a \u0022checklist\u0022 when you build your spacecraft, but to be honest the game as it works now is \u0022good enough\u0022, and I would have no great upset if we had to wait for this polish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe radical suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to remove scope from 1.0, I suggest you entirely pull the Mk3 spaceplane parts from the game. Perhaps have a \u0022custom\u0022 option to \u0022use experimental parts\u0022 or something so that you can use them as they are in 0.90. Here\u0027s why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk3 parts as they are need a lot of attention. The fuel tanks are not balanced. The cockpit and crew tanks need IVAs. The current wing sections and undercarriage are undersized and very difficult to use with these parts. The current jet engines are really too small, and you need 6 or 8 engines to get them to work. This is really kludgy. To make Mk3 parts useful in the way that Mk2 parts are, we need bigger wing sections, bigger undercarriage, better engine and air intake options, perhaps re-worked fuel flow mechanics, ideally wet-wings or other more radical parts (like thick wing sections that can incorporate engines and intakes in the leading and trailing edge segments to mimic engines burried in the wing root). Realistically to get Mk3 sized spaceplanes to work with the degree of intuitive construction and ease of flight. I think the whole Mk3 space plane building experience is at a level below that of other aspects of the game. Having a dedicated 1.x release of \u0022new bigger planes\u0022, with these parts done well, with the full range of functionality would probably lead to a better 1.0 experience than having the current somewhat incomplete state of affairs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T18:35:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rcp27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul Kingtiger","CreatedById":57455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T18:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPolish is more important than wide scope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlayers and reviewers are going to jump over bugs, so a smaller feature set which is well polished will make a better impression than incomplete features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese can be left for 1.1\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
