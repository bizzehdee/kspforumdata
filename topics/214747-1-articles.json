The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E says my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is \u0026gt;1 (~1.4). However, my rocket fails to lift off of the ground, even when I suspend it in the air with launch clamps to make sure it isn\u0027t clipping into the ground or anything. The engines are attached directly onto the bottom of the XL fuel tank. Fuel does drain from the main tank into the engines, and their exhaust is visible. However, if I replace the 4x Reliant engines with 1x mammoth engine (ASL thrust ~4200 kN if I recall), the rocket lifts off. My rocket weighs about 430 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is it a known issue? Have I missed something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
