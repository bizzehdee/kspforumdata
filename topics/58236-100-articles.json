NFP tanks are balanced against stock, so some significant changes to volumes and dry masses are needed. I thought about using the BalloonCryo tank type for the Hydrogen tanks and the ElectricPropulsion tank type for Argon/Xenon tanks, that should at least ensure mass ratios that are in line with procedural parts. If the mass ratios are fine, getting the volume exactly right would not be absolutely crucial, so a very simple method would be attempting to balance against PP tanks of similar dimensions.\u003Cp\u003ENear future construction (RF has configs for those, but they are very outdated) is problematic: It\u0027s tanks use interstellar fuel switch to change their appearance and content, and while that would be fine for tanks that do not necessarily need to be able to hold different fuels, some (eg. servicemodule, \u0022liquid fuel\u0022) should really get a ModuleFuelTanks - which IFS does not support currently. Options I see here are: Ditching tanks that need to hold varied fuels and keep using IFS with the rest or ditching IFS and creating separate part.cfgs - giving all the customization but cluttering the part catalog. Oh, and I have no idea how to go on about doing #2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions, feedback and ideas greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace had the same issue (it was Firespitter\u0027s part switcher, but same logic).
