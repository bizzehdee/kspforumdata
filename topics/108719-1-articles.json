It isn\u0027t science in my mind. It is more a game of whack-a-mole where you wait for the right conditions to press a button. They could have called ti anything and the game mechanic would have been the same. I personally wanted something more involved, something that would require you to actually collect research and analyze it in some way. RealScience is what was born from those desires. This has been in development for a bit now, in private and in conjunction with the RO guys in IRC, but i\u0027m now posting it here publicly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is by no means done, but it is usable. There is still a lot of work to be done but it is mostly in the area of improving the UI, and expanding to provide designers more conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off please be aware that RealScience is just an Add-On that does absolutely nothing by itself. It requires designers to create experiments to use with it. These will be showing up initially in RP-0 soon(ish) but anyone else is also more than welcome to build experiments. What I am trying to say though is here what you will find in this thread for download is just the plugin, no experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOVERVIEW\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can see the original design as documented at the start of development on the Wiki here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/jwvanderbeck/RealScience/wiki/Original-Design\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/jwvanderbeck/RealScience/wiki/Original-Design\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a nutshell RealScience seeks to do two things, only the first of which is being tackled at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Remove the whack-a-mole style stock science and replace it with a system that requires the player to collect research under proper conditions, and then analyze that research to complete \u0022the science\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Overhaul the stock tech nodes system with something that uses science disciplines or schools, and unlocks parts with some semblance of meaning to the research done. IOW don\u0027t unlock engines because someone duck up rocks, and don\u0027t unlock rover wheels because someone researched how air flows at high altitudes. By removing a generic science pool and replacing it with various disciplines like say Geology, Meteorology, Astronomy, Physics, etc we can make part unlocks be at least somewhat logical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this time I am focusing on part 1, and part 2 will come in the future. Part 2 will however always be optional for those who want better experiments, but want to keep the stock tech nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ECREATING EXPERIMENTS\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreating experiments is simply a matter of making standard KSP config files to define the experiment and add it to the desired parts.

I\u0027ve been thinking of working on something similar but my design was slightly different: Remove the perfect knowledge of the solar system that the Kerbals have right now and introduce the concept of discoverable information. I think at one point Squad had a similar idea, or still does, because if you look at the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003ECelestialBody\u003C/span\u003E API, they have \u003Ca href=\u0022http://anatid.github.io/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/class_discovery_info.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027;\u0022\u003EDiscoveryInfo\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E. which seems to be a lot like what I\u0027m talking about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I envisaged it working was by starting you off with either no knowledge or only basic knowledge of the celestial bodies except Kerbin, the Sun, and maybe Mun and Minmus. So if you want to know about Duna, you first have to discover it by performing an astronomical survey and detecting it. Then, once you know something is there you have to perform continued observations of it to derive information such as its orbital characteristics, size, mass, etc. Want to know if it has an atmosphere or what the atmosphere is composed of? Perform a spectroscopy experiment. All of this data would also be subjected to errors, based on the quality of your equipment or the number of observations you perform. Perform more observations, use better equipment, or get smarter scientists to lower your error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is this useful? My thought was to turn the map view into just a representation of the data we have, not a perfect representation of the system as it is. So if you add a maneuver node, the orbital path it calculates would be determined by your best current estimate of a CelestialBody\u0027s position, mass, velocity, etc; which may not correspond with reality. So the more science you perform, the better your data gets, and the more useful the map view becomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also thought of pairing it with a \u0022simulator\u0022 type system, like in SRL, KCT, or HoloDeck so that you could simulate your flight without spending funds, \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E the simulation would be based on the data you have. So, for instance, if your current data underestimates the mass of Duna, you may be able to successfully escape Duna in the simulation, but may not actually have enough delta-v in reality. Or, for example, Duna may be represented by a perfectly flat sphere in simulation until such time as you launch a SCANSat scanner to map its terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy making the action of performing \u003Cem\u003Escience\u003C/em\u003E yield relevant \u003Cem\u003Eknowledge\u003C/em\u003E, I think you make it much more engaging, realistic, and educational to boot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also thought about the concept of \u0022RawData\u0022 and \u0022ProcessedData\u0022. Basically, sensors would produce RawData which could then be converted by instruments into ProcessedData, which could then be used by Kerbal scientists to produce \u0022Facts\u0022 (i.e. knowledge). The difference between the two being that RawData is reusable: it can be reanalyzed to produce either new Facts or Facts with a lower amount of error once you have better equipment or smarter scientists. ProcessedData can only yield specific Facts with specific amounts of error. Once you\u0027ve determined that Duna has X mass from ProcessedData, that\u0027s all the useful information you can glean. However, RawData is extremely large: so it takes up a lot of storage space and would take forever to send back to Kerbin. So your choices are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Spend a lot of time and energy transmitting the RawData.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Convert the RawData to ProcessedData and just transmit that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Return the RawData on a ship back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Send a scientist Kerbal to the RawData to analyze it in situ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing that\u0027s kept me from doing this are the huge amount of disparate areas it would have to touch and whether or not it\u0027s even feasible to do some of the stuff I want to do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on doing something similar?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Fully reading your design doc, I notice you mention something similar to the Raw/ProcessedData concept under \u0022Unorganized Thoughts\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T21:18:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 09:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by zengei\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T22:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds great!
