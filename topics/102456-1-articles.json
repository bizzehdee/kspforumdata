When you run it directly, it will use the ones installed by your distribution.

If your binary have trouble finding libraries, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the way. If you really really need to push things via preload, you really ought to specify what libraries are you pushing. Pthread is core system library and I would be very careful around it, and libGL came from various sources (nowadays mesa or nvidia proprietary blob are most likely) and most people don\u0026#39;t need to touch it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027eggymatrix\u0027]export __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow this is interresting.
