To clarify for the non-technical:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(On Windows) a document with the extension \u0027.exe\u0027, \u0027.com\u0027 or \u0027.dll\u0027 is a \u003Cem\u003Eprogramme\u003C/em\u003E and those \u0027random letters\u0027 you\u0027re seeing are your text-editor\u0027s attempt to translate the computer instructions into something it can display. It\u0027s hopeless because the computer instructions just don\u0027t make sense to us, only the computer. In order to make, or edit, a program you need to write the \u0027source\u0027 instructions, which are in text files that we can understand (eg; PlanetShifter.cs that Kipeo mentions) then use another programme to \u0027compile\u0027 those instructions into the exe/com/dll form the computer understands. This is what programming a computer means.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost programmes store their data - such as planet information - in their own formats too so they can\u0027t usually be read or changed without the specific application (=programme). The way KSP stores a lot of information in a human-readable format (persistent.sfs, *.craft, etc.) so it can be displayed/saved in a text editor is fairly uncommon.
