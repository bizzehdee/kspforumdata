This is the current course of action, and has the advantage that we already \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E the stuff works, concave meshes in particular are very stable as tests with the floating point version in Unreal have proven.

Then we can start connecting the HQ scene and the game scene up as it should be, and start making the editor, which still needs a few details worked out so far.

Full immersion would mean simulating the construction of ships piece by piece, in real time, which is not only boring but a nightmare to actually create. On the other end of the spectrum is something more like KSP, where you\u0027re just presented with total freedom, a big list of parts and engines and materials and all that, then you save your craft and go, and it\u0027s ready to fly.
