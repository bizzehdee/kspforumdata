One wheel is damaged, but I can\u0027t repair it because I didn\u0027t bring any repair kits with me (I know, I\u0027m an idiot. Let\u0027s move on). After I landed it I was able to drive it around just fine. I parked it and folded the wheels away, then unfolded them again (that\u0027s a story for another time). When it finally settled down, one wheel was damaged, and there\u0027s still plenty of electricity available. But for some reason it just won\u0027t move. The wheels spin,\u00A0 but it just won\u0027t go, other than a little bit of motion side to side (steering seems to work).
