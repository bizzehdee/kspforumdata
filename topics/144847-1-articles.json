I recently read an indie developer blog detailing a new game mechanic/feature the dev was working on implementing in the upcoming alpha of his game. It pointed out something that stood out to me in regards to KSP (and now that I think about it, the recent v1.0 release of Starbound): The \u0022gameplay\u0022 mechanics used don\u0027t feedback into one another well (if at all) and feel tacked on. (Starbound has some other quibbles I have for it, but this isn\u0027t the place for it.) The developer went over his thoughts on the mechanic, how to make it interesting,\u00A0useful; basically how its would be a value-add to the game and it\u0027s integration with the other systems and mechanics in his game. (Well, I thought it was a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fractalsoftworks.com/2016/07/17/exploration-salvage/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egood read\u003C/a\u003E...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking back on what I know of the KSP development history, KSP\u0027s focus in development was on the simulation part\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Efar\u003C/strong\u003E more than anything else. (And I\u00A0mean that literally: look at the UI issues, general lack of truly interesting long-term content, etc.) KSP had\u00A0quite the development history, mainly because it was being developed by a crew that had no game development history or experience to begin with. Said crew tried VERY ambitious project as their first task, no less. Honestly, you can (still) see the problems that brought about: stability issues, relative lack of content, disparate behavior in the game, lack of cohesiveness/unity (pun mildly intended) in design, etc. I know I\u0027m gonna sound spoiled saying this, and I hate it, but it\u0027s says a bit about a\u00A0release when a year later\u00A0with plenty of updates, there were minimal content additions and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E more stability/performance changes. And I don\u0027t mean small ones here and there. I mean BIG changes. You have the recent 1.1 and the upcoming 1.2 updates. It\u0027s great that the devs are doing what they can to continually fix/improve the \u0022game\u0022, but sometimes I think the game went to 1.0 sooner than it should\u0027ve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say that because I find it very peculiar for something to have practically a complete ground up rewrite within a year or two after release when it was already a long time in development. Granted, the KSP team has far more manpower now. Not only that, it\u0027s manpower that seems to have a better grasp on the situation now compare to the beta era. I certainly don\u0027t envy them. Code refactoring is a *bleep*.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP\u0027s underlying foundation is being worked on so they can build on top of it better. I say don\u0027t worry about the \u0022game\u0022 aspects until they have a stable foundation and platform to actually build a game on. They\u0027ve torn down the house to rebuild the foundation (the code refactoring), so let\u0027s just wait to see the new house they build for themselves after before trying to \u0022fix\u0022 things. What\u0027s the point in fixing something when it might be reworked soon, anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best advice I can say about not being satisfied with an aspect of the current KSP is to find (or make, perhaps request)\u00A0a mod that helps alleviate that problem for\u00A0the time being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-30T08:45:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2016 08:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by StahnAileron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChanged some formatting because the forum autodefining acronyms irks me sometimes...

It\u0027s also dull in real life and yet people get excited when something new is discovered by Curiosity (or some other rover that\u0027s still active). It\u0027s because the real life rovers perform science and dig into rocks. The problem is with how the contracts and mission objectives are handled. You get about 5 surface points to visit if you accept the contract and once they are all visited the rover becomes useless.

Then, once the game recognizes there\u0027s a rover landed (with wheels) it gives a few points of interest (\u0022Visit point ABC-123 near your landing site\u0022). You go there, visit the place and *CHING!* A\u00A0new one pops out nearby (500m away, or so, just to not make the journey tedious)!\u00A0The points of interest keep generating around the rover as long as the player is interested in roving.
