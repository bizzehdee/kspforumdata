In theory it shouldn\u0027t happen for reaction wheels and if your RCS is perfectly balanced but KSP isn\u0027t perfect. It\u0027s probably mostly due to computational inaccuracies because of finite precision of trajectory calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that SAS causes it is because it keeps bumping around the marker it\u0027s trying to hit and so is constantly applying torque and causing shake. If you have a heavier craft or less reaction wheels it will decrease the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the effect is amplified if your AP and PE are at very similar altitudes, as small changes can switch them around.
