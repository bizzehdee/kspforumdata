This is just appealing to the audience that is claiming that games are sexist because they don\u0027t include females. I personally believe that people should get off their high horse, and realize that there are more important matters than a gender. Such as aerodyamics, re-entry, EVA in IVA, and releasing the game.

This comes first-hand from a variety of people whom I\u0027ve had play the game for a little social experiment. Furthermore, female Kerbals wouldn\u0027t take as long at all to implement from a coding standpoint, and the ART team would be the group workin on the Kerbals, something which you don\u0027t really seem to care much for. Finally, It\u0027s not just feminists who want female Kerbals, it\u0027s also not-particularly-feminist women and men alike.
