If you\u0027re determined, I suggest you build an array of about 40 ion engines using gantries and radial attachment points. Make sure it attaches at its dead centre, has a megatonne of battery power and absolutely bury it in solar arrays or you\u0027ll have to stop thrusting every 20 m/s to recharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, spamming a planetary system (even Jool) with little probes isn\u0027t really worth it.

The unit of xenon fuel used in KSP is 1 unit = 0.1 kg. Considering that xenon is a heavy gas and liquid xenon is about three times denser than rocket fuel, you can realistically store a HUGE amount of xenon gas in a tank the size of the Jumbo 64. Since the Jumbo 64 is, if I remember correctly, 32 tons full and 4 tons empty, and remembering that liquid xenon is 3X denser than rocket fuel, then you should be able to get almost 100 tons of liquid xenon in a Jumbo 64. 100 tons is 1000000 (one million) units of liquid xenon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can potentially get something like 100 km/s delta V with a spacecraft utilizing such tanks, if the payload is rather low, you use solar panels, and you are willing to go through DAYS of acceleration under 4X time compression.
