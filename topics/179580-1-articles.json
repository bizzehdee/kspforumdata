I cant see any real way to duplicate this as frankly I dont know what if anything I am directly doing aside from starting the game and loading my save...\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I just reloaded the game and saw a RED error message go blitzing past. Took multiple reloads to grab a screen cap via print screen. In RED: MissingMethodException: Method not found: \u0022Unityengine.Texture2d.LoadImage\u0022. and in an Orangeish color right below it: [KSPSteamController]: Failed to initialize Steam API!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am playing a Steam copy of the game with a shortcut on my desktop and I run as Admin.

I dont think this is a game breaking error as I can jump from craft to craft with no real issues being seen, just that those two errors are randomly popping up. And before anyone asks my most recent output log is from about 2 years ago from what I can tell, well that is to say, the output log I see is dated October of 2016....

I will of course be updating this with edits as I learn more information on what I am seeing.

My theory on the errors I am seeing that it may be a conflict on mods updated only as far as KSP 1.4.X and KSP being 1.5.1 with DLC \u0026lt;not sure if the DLC affects this or not\u0026gt; seems to be holding up. I just pulled every mod from KSP including my 2 saves that have those parts active in them and only spotted 1 error during the initial loading screen. that error was the game crabbing about the steam api \u0026lt;running from the short cut icon on my desktop\u0026gt; and when launched from steam directly even that error went away. I hit alt-f12 and its still crabbing about a missing: MissionScore.cfg or something along that line. I think its just a compatibility issue at this point but thus far does not seem to be game breaking as it seems to play just fine.

Space Y and Space Y Expanded being for 1.4.X seem to have some odd little conflict with 1.5.1 and when Necrobones updates \u0026lt;hopefully soon\u0026gt; the issue should be corrected. I will go ahead and assume that since I did not see these errors with the mods removed and only see them when the mods are there \u0026lt;the ones NOT updated for 1.5.1 that is\u0026gt; that this is mod related.
