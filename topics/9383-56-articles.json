But even so, if you\u0027re seeing that sort of usage for a browser alone (4gb?!) you\u0027ve got something seriously wrong with your system or are just being utterly lax about system hygiene because you can brute force through it with hardware; As I\u0027m typing this, my Firefox with Ad-block and a few other plugins, is only using 380,000k Ram, or 1/3rd a GB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem a lot of us are seeing though, especially with KSP which is still an unwieldy memory hog even with the latest patch, is that there\u0027s very little space left on top for Mods that haven\u0027t got a reasonable footprint once it\u0027s unreasonably eaten up your system. The last version of Mapsat seemed to be nice and snugly sized, so I was happily using it.

If WinXP needed 4gb of Memory no one would ever have been able to use it at all back at it\u0027s launch, when 2gb of RAM was considered almighty luxury; \u003Ca href=\u0022http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314865\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe minimal system requirements are only 64mbs of RAM\u003C/a\u003E Of course, drivers, anti virus etc add to the overhead, but even with all services packs, firefox and skype and pidgin and MS Security Essentials and an open Windows Explorer window, I can currently see only 1GB in total use right now (and there\u0027s 1GB of dedicated graphics ram waiting to ease pressure during gaming on top of system RAM). \u003Cp\u003EWin 7 is actually a fair bit more efficient with how it handles actual memory usage than WinXP, although it needs more of it due to the slow bloating of modern software; it does require roughly 2GB for basic operation. But even so, if you\u0027re seeing that sort of usage for a browser alone (4gb?!) you\u0027ve got something seriously wrong with your system or are just being utterly lax about system hygiene because you can brute force through it with hardware; As I\u0027m typing this, my Firefox with Ad-block and a few other plugins, is only using 380,000k Ram, or 1/3rd a GB. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem a lot of us are seeing though, especially with KSP which is still an unwieldy memory hog even with the latest patch, is that there\u0027s very little space left on top for Mods that haven\u0027t got a reasonable footprint once it\u0027s unreasonably eaten up your system. The last version of Mapsat seemed to be nice and snugly sized, so I was happily using it. And with 8gb you should be able to run 2 triple-A titles at once, so you won\u0027t notice the difference between old or new map sat; but the latest blows up for game for me now I\u0027m afraid, which can hopefully be found and fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, my browser isn\u0027t eating up 4GB, that\u0027s just my total memory usage with a few programs open, such as my browser, Steam, AV, etc. Also I didn\u0027t mean that Windows itself needed that entire 4GB for itself, only that it has to share that with KSP and any other programs running. 32-bit Windows can\u0027t even make use of that whole 4GB either. IIRC, it can only use around 3.3GB. That right there means you\u0027re already limited to a little over 2GB for the game itself to use, which puts it at a significant disadvantage to someone like me who has plenty of RAM. I also read that supposedly, even video card memory eats into that usable limit (I\u0027m guessing maybe memory addressing doesn\u0027t specify between video and system memory?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, KSP itself has a memory leak even with little or no mods. Take note of its memory usage, then let it run overnight and check it again and you\u0027ll see it is using a good deal more memory, even if you let a ship orbit a planet the whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kriegswolf","CreatedById":45754,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T15:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep... tried that, too (turning on the scan).
