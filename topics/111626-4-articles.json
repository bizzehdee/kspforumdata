I think that I would like more people to submit entries, rather than impose restrictions to avoid making it easier. But these mods can do some things that I think are a bit too powerful:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- PParts and Fuel Switch allow filling tanks with only LF. I\u0027ll use as an example a ship with one nuke, an orange tank, and a 5 tons of extra mass (crew quarters, reaction wheels, payload, etc). With the tank filled entirely with LF (replacing the space for the oxidizer), the ship is 12 tons dry and has 10196 dV. With stock fuel tanks, giving it the same amount of LF (That is, a second orange tank), the ship is 16 tons dry and has only 7939 dV, not to mention being bigger = harder to get into orbit, slower turning. That\u0027s a lot of difference. I used the rocket equation here, so KER or MechJeb might report slightly different numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KIS could allow a lander to be basically built and unbuilt without requiring creative solutions for docking ports, staging, or multiple landers. For example, a lander can land on Laythe and then the parachutes can be taken off to save weight for later landings. Or lander legs could be added to a Tylo ascent stage after it returns from the surface, that then goes and lands on the small moons. I would like to imagine that when you attach a part in the VAB, engineers run wires and fuel pipes to the other systems to allow it to work, so slapping on a new radial engine, leg, solar panel, or chute on EVA seems a little cheaty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Alcor used to be prohibited and I hadn\u0027t looked at it recently, but I think they actually increased the weight to a more realistic level since then.
