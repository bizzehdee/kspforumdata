It does, but it doesn\u0027t, but it does. It does (KSP2 shows more than one), but it doesn\u0027t (KSP1 only stars 1 star; kerbol), but it does (the kerbal universe has multiple stars, but they were approximated away in the first game). I bet you\u0027ll find many other examples of things in the KSP universe that game 1 approximated away, and is this yet another thing that is there, but just not visible for gameplay reasons. Surely KSP2 will not contain the entire kerbal universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow some people might argue that there is actually no such thing as a kerbal universe, and that instead we have a multiverse of kerbal universes, one for each game, some of which have phenomena that others do not. That this is the real answer to the paradox of differnece in observation we can see between the games.
