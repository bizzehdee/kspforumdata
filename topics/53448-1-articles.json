It\u0027s fast with four horizontal engines and two vertical engines. All that power can push it to 255 m/s at 2500 meters. Missles can be added with no stability loss,and really anything can be added up to about 15 tons. However 15 tons isn\u0027t much compaired to my Air-6 and other VTOLs.

She should handle pretty good(a little sluggish with all that weight) however for VTOL mode I couldn\u0027t balance the engines so SAS is recommended.
