I\u0027m particularly proud of a launch script my friend and I wrote with another mod, kOS. The cool thing about RP-0 and all the other realism mods I have is you start out launching V2s. You strap on the simple science things you have and send them up, then unlock more science stuff, and send it up again. \u00A0You end up modifying the original V2 to meet your scientific research needs. Also, I had a Chuck Yeager moment with Jeb (minus the fire in the helmet). I put him in a rocket plane and flew him up past the Karman line.

Of course, it had evolved over time. (I no longer play with a Life Support mod, though I used to roll TAC-LS when I did.)

It would just sorta lock up on me when trying to launch a vessel, revert, or switch vessels. I thought it was just a time-related stability thing at first (as it would take some time). Then maybe RAM issues. Neither of those were consistent, though. I troubleshot the issue on and off for a couple months. Mods were updating all this time, so I eventually decided to clean up my install of mods and parts I didn\u0027t use just to tidy it up. I don\u0027t recall exactly how I figured it, but found out my problem was somehow tied to RasterPropMonitor/IVAs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t play IVA at all, so I realized there was little to no need for custom IVAs from the part mods I used. I went around deleting the IVAs assets. Didn\u0027t seem to affect anything in a test run, though I think I was still getting the random lock-ups. Remembered RPM and deleted it since it\u0027s a pure IVA plug-in. Cleared every up and that copy of KSP runs stably enough for the most part for hours at a time. (I\u0027d have to do something dumb for KSP to crash/freeze\u00A0on me now.) Performance is still subpar, but I think I got some performance boosts since the game was trying to deal with the IVA views in the pilot portraits. (AH! I think that was what tipped me off! Well, sorta. If I hid the portraits, the game\u00A0would\u00A0run a tad better.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m eagerly awaiting 1.2 so I can be up-to-date again (and the performance boost).

No AA is perfect texts, but the jaggies and shimmers are horribly distracting.
