The Experimentals Team, Squad\u0027s QA and Devs. I don\u0027t think they are allowed to release any footage or images just yet, so we\u0027ll have to hang tight to see it in action.

The attach nodes are the same as 0.625m parts, the center of the toroid is exactly the size of 0.625m parts, and it was added with all the small diameter probe parts in 0.18. IMO it was meant as a tank for 0.625m probes (though of course people found many other creative ways to use it)."},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T14:37:35Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Depends how you define it.
