All you have to do is send a craft equip with a science instrument to a planet/biome, click the \u0022Log ... Data\u0022 button, (repeat steps 1-2 for any other biomes/planets visited) and transmit or return the results to Kerbin to get your science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I not the only one that thinks this implementation is completely boring and unfun? All it ends up being is giant click-fest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh Look! I got a little closer to the planet/moon! Now its time to click on all my instruments to get the \u0022in space near\u0022 science reports! SOOO EXCITING!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike science in reality, it just feels extremely shallow and dull. There is no excitement or setup for your experiments. All you do is click a button, and you\u0027re done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I suggest is to completely rework the science gathering system in KSP to add more depth to science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some ideas on how to do that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, change the Gravioli Detector and the Thermometer from \u00221 click 1 result\u0022 instruments to scanning/mapping instruments (much like the SCANsat mod, but less complicated) with the Gravity detector mapping density of the surface, and the Thermometer mapping temperature. With this change, you are rewarded in science by how much of a planet/moon\u0027s surface you map with these instruments. This change also gives players an incentive to build unmanned probes, satellites and orbiters, which currently don\u0027t have much use in the base game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, change the Seismic Accelerometer from a \u00221 click 1 result\u0022 instrument to an instrument that requires a \u0022setup\u0022 (similar to the Interstellar mod\u0027s Seismometer) where you position a lander on the surface of a planet/moon to listen for impacts and smash a spacecraft into the planet/moon to generate seismic waves. In addition, you could land a seismic probe on the surface of a planet/moon and wait for natural tectonic activity (only on tectonic active worlds like Eve or Laythe) or small asteroid impacts. With this change, the player is rewarded for setting up experiments and long-term seismic surveys rather than clicking a button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, change the Presmat Barometer and Sensor Array Computing Nose Cone to measure the atmosphere as they descend/ascend through it. Players would be awarded science based on how deep they descend into the atmosphere. This is a relatively small change but, I think it adds more depth to atmospheric analysis than clicking a button at arbitrary altitudes of \u0022Flying high\u0022 and \u0022Flying low\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, change the Mysterious Goo canister and Sc-9001 Science jr from \u00221 click 1 result\u0022 experiments to experiments that need to be exposed to an environment for a period of time to get results. Maybe the experiment will react in a couple of minutes or hours or maybe even days or weeks. The only way to know is to set up the experiment in an environment (like in a station or surface base) to find out how and when it reacts. Much like a real science experiment, you have to keep the experiment in the same environment; once started, moving it from environment to environment (like orbit to surface) would invalidate your results. In addition, both types of experiments would benefit from having a Kerbal monitor, and record the data. Also, there could be all sorts of in situ experiments the Kerbals can perform (for example, mixing a water sample of Laythe\u0027s oceans into an experiment). Of course, you could do it with an unmanned craft but you\u0027d get less science. This change would encourage players to set up long term, manned surface bases and stations to run these experiments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe addition of even more instruments such magnetometers, cameras, etc. would greatly enrich this system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with all these instruments, we need things for them to discover!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I suggest the addition of \u0022anomalies\u0022 to all the planets and moons. Discovering and studying such anomalies would be where you get most of your science. For example, the impact crater on bop could show up as a \u0022hot spot\u0022 on a temperature scan and reward you a significantly higher amount of science than scans of the more uninteresting areas on Bop. Think of the possibilities! There could be subsurface oceans on Minmus that you could search for with a gravity scan or volcanoes on Laythe you could study with an accelerometer. You could scan a planet, find something interesting and then send follow up missions to study the anomaly in more detail. You could take this idea one step further and introduce random events that you could study, like storms on Laythe, earthquakes on Eve, geysers on Vall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we take into consideration the fact that Kerbals have never been to space before, the discovery of water on Duna or Oxygen in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere could be a big discovery that would net you lots of science (much like we didn\u0027t know there was water on Mars until we sent missions to it). You could send a probe to the mysterious world \u0022Eeloo\u0022 and gain tons of science studying a world that the Kerbals know little to nothing about. You could feel like you are actually exploring the Kerbol System, unveiling its secrets and expanding Kerbalkind\u0027s knowledge of the universe. You could actually feel that you are making significant discoveries. In my opinion, this sounds like more fun than clicking a bunch of buttons to get boring and easy-quick science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s all for my suggestion. I hope the devs (or at least a modder) consider this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, tell me what you think!

I want Kerbals to become more involved in gathering science. For example, lets say you send a base to Laythe and then you send a bunch of Kerbal scientists to man it. You could then set up the goo containers and science jrs to run some experiments and the scientists would monitor the experiments and record the data. It gives the Kerbals a reason to be there on the base. However now that you mention it, I think a better way to implement this is to have the experiments slowly give you science over time, similar to how the Science Labs from the Interstellar Mod work. Maybe to add a bit of skill to it, lets say you\u0027d get more science depending on the location of the base.

The information you gain from doing the science rewards you directly. For instance, when landing and taking off of Eve, you can save A TON of dV if you land on a high mountain, to avoid the lower atmosphere, and extra travel distance. So using a satellite to map its height pays off directly (or you can cheat and look it up, but you can cheat in a lot of ways). Similarly with the Kethane mod, scanning a planet tells you where to land for kethane, which has obvious benefits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously there still needs to be point systems, for unlocking the tech tree, but more directly applicable results from doing science would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major problem with building long term settlements in KSP that produce science over time is that you can fast forward, which basically breaks it. But if you force them not to fast forward for it, it\u0027s often grindy. If people want to have bases in KSP, then the bases would need to produce something that you wanted, and had to consume. For instance, a base could produce a type of super efficient fuel that your engines can\u0027t start with, for interplanetary travel or something. Then, you would have to occasionally dock with it, or maybe simply beam it to Kerbin.
