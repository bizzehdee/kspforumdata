This represents the addition of multi layered insulation to the outside of the part. (generally cryogenic fuel tanks). In real life applications, this would be an important part of thermal management. This feature will require balancing against the loss rates of Real Fuels tanks which assume that insulation was builtin but don\u0027t take into consideration ZBO applications.\n\nThe radiator will drain heat from whatever it is connected to. It drains a flat rate of 50kw  \u002B a amount equal to whatever heat is leaking through the insulation. (this because the goal is zero boiloff)\n\n***KNOWN ISSUES***\n\nTime warp faster than 100x (technically this starts at 1000x which is one step up from 100 in stock) will cause problems because KSP\u0027s thermodynamics switches into analytical mode which doesn\u0027t simulate heat transfer in a time based manner. If you must warp faster I recommend doing it from the space center until a solution can be found.\n\n[Download Latest](https://github.com/Starwaster/HeatPump/releases/latest)\n\n[Github (source)](https://github.com/Starwaster/HeatPump)\n\nIf you find this mod helpful and want to throw some money away, feel free to click the donate button below!\n\n[![btn_donate_LG.gif](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](http://paypal.me/Starwaster)\n\nLicense for the plugin is CC-SA-BY as it was in Real Fuels.

I only use RF in RO so those configs are important to me.\n\u003E \n\nHere\u0027s a config with comments as to what each thing does. Note that heatTransfer is technically optional and is only 0.1 by default. Heat Pump works by intercepting conducted heat and providing just enough cooling to neutralize the heat that is in danger of penetrating the tank wall into the tank contents. A non-zero heatTransfer is basically actual refrigeration beyond insulation cooling. This really should not be set very high unless the application is some sort of ISRU making cryogenic fuels. Default is 0.1\n\nSo basically the way HP works is that it just intercepts incoming heat and provides just enough cooling to prevent that. For ZBO purposes a cryo tank really should have a lot of MLI installed but no existing tank parts are actually configured this way. Even the RF Cryogenic and BalloonCry tank types don\u0027t provide the type of insulation required for long term Earth-Mars voyages. That\u0027s what skinInternalConductionMult is for. Basically that needs to be set low enough to reduce heat penetration to watts instead of kilowatts if the objective is actual ZBO. (so in other words passive AND active heat management). In the example below it\u0027s set to 0.00005 which should be enough to reduce heating from solar/planetary flux to a few tens of watts down from several kilowatts\n\n    \tMODULE{\tname = ModuleHeatPump// Active tank refrigeration.

I have been looking for some details about how much weight this would add (preferable as comparable to the insulation levels on the Cyro tanks in Real Fuels but I can try and get the calculations based on Default and Balloon as a base if I need to) but have not found anything that I can understand enough to work with.  If you could provide some guidance here I should be able to create the MLI variants of the thank types and would not need to override the conduction multipliers. This would be preferable as the free insulation does not belong in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, IMHO.\n\u003E \n\nFrom  \u003Cu\u003ENuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): A Proven Growth Technology for Human NEO / Mars Exploration Missions\u003C/u\u003E\n\n[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120003776.pdf](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120003776.pdf)\n\npage 9\n\n- Material: Aluminum-Lithium (Al/Li)\n- Tank ID/OD: ~9.8 m/10.0 m\n- Tank L: ~19.7 m (propulsion stage) \u2013 22.7 m (\u201Cin-line\u201D drop tank)\n- Geometry: cylindrical with root 2/2 ellipsoidal domes\n- Insulation: 1\u201D SOFI (~0.78 kg/m2 ) \u002B 60 layers of MLI (~0.90 kg/m2 )\n\nIn LEO that resulted in ~78 W of heat flux penetrating the tank.
