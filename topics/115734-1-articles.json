Note that heatTransfer is technically optional and is only 0.1 by default. Heat Pump works by intercepting conducted heat and providing just enough cooling to neutralize the heat that is in danger of penetrating the tank wall into the tank contents. A non-zero heatTransfer is basically actual refrigeration beyond insulation cooling. This really should not be set very high unless the application is some sort of ISRU making cryogenic fuels. Default is 0.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically the way HP works is that it just intercepts incoming heat and provides just enough cooling to prevent that. For ZBO purposes a cryo tank really should have a lot of MLI installed but no existing tank parts are actually configured this way. Even the RF Cryogenic and BalloonCry tank types don\u0027t provide the type of insulation required for long term Earth-Mars voyages. That\u0027s what skinInternalConductionMult is for. Basically that needs to be set low enough to reduce heat penetration to watts instead of kilowatts if the objective is actual ZBO. (so in other words passive AND active heat management). In the example below it\u0027s set to 0.00005 which should be enough to reduce heating from solar/planetary flux to a few tens of watts down from several kilowatts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E\tMODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = ModuleHeatPump\n\n\t\t// Active tank refrigeration.
