I\u0027m testing its stability on Kerbin but it just won\u0027t fly straight and I don\u0027t wanna bring it to the mun knowing I can\u0027t keep a handle under it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jl3JpTQ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Jl3JpTQ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LV-45s are just stand-ins for nukes cause they don\u0027t have enough thrust on Kerbin to lif that. The CoM is centered right at where the girder and tank connect, and is equal on all sides. The CoT is -slightly- off with the CoM but it\u0027s so negligible I didn\u0027t think that it\u0027d matter, you can\u0027t even tell the fuel tanks and engines are without really closely inspecting it.

My ability to control it however, is much better at low thrust, up to about 60% throttle where I no longer have control over it. I don\u0027t know how that\u0027s going to translate over to non-atmospheric flight with the nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sumyunguy","CreatedById":76225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T04:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter looking, I think a small change to it would be to shift the rockets to the corners of the craft instead on the x/y axis of the fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that doesn\u0027t work, try adding either more reaction wheels or RCS with a high thrust output to the craft. This might help controlling the craft with more control authority(?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it THAT doesn\u0027t work, try flipping the kethane tank vertically and attach the framework/rockets to the center.

The Mun\u0027s gravity is only about 1/6th that of Kerbin, so if you can take off from Kerbin\u0027s surface with that setup, you can almost certainly land it on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bone White","CreatedById":34752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T05:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also try adding more reaction wheels to apply more torque.
