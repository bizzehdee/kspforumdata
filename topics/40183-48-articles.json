Travelling to Jool, and experienced one of those spontaneous dis assemblies. Any way to revert to last quick-save without getting broke, or losing months of progress? I tend to do other things while waiting, rather than warping. \u003Cp\u003EI mean would be fine if game and mods were bug-free and stuff, but... Then I\u0027m also wondering what happens with constructed in orbit ships...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your doing it all in one sitting and not leaving the vessel then you should be able to use MCE revert at any time.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut how the MCE backup save works is like this. Its only ever saved when you enter the Space Center scene. So if you manage to never enter that scene and want to revert, you can in theory exit out of ksp and rename the .backup to .sp and have your budget set to just before you launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut like I said if at any time after launch you enter that space center scene the backup will be replaced with new one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for constructed ships in orbit. My last Duna mission did this. I used custom contracts to pay for the construction of the vessel piece by piece (custom contracts is MCE mission editor). Sometime you get the bad luck of the draw and a company won\u0027t fund the whole thing... But that more realistic then people realize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy duna mission is one of the reasons for the last 2 updates.. Because I noticed an issue with Saved Goals causing conflicts with these types of missions. (IE launch it, then do something else while you wait for it to arrive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway its still better to use custom contracts for these missions.
