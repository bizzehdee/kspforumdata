Something to scribble down notes about burns, the possibility to plot a course to a destination, incorporating the action groups \u0026amp; stages maybe?. Basically a little more foreplay before you press the ignition button. not something which you\u0027d have to do but more of a side option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egrtzz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T18:11:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a pretty good discussion about something like this recently. Kind of. It was about a chalkboard or whiteboard or something like that, kind of like the one they used to plan out Apollo oh so long ago.

They could even implement text bits in a written-lookin\u0027 font like comic sans or something for working out rough calculations(perhaps an in-built give-or-take addendum to your numbers) for figuring out the rough requirements for burns and things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-04T19:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea, even if you get to put a \u0022dummy\u0022 body in an imaginary orbit, so you can plan your manoeuvres and work out how much delta-v you\u0027ll need without having to actually put a physical rocket up there first, sort of like the orbital map screen, only instead of having to launch a body, you just stick in initial orbital parameters, and work from there. It would be especially cool if instead of the 3d render, it was rendered like a whiteboard, with the trajectories and planets drawn in pen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
