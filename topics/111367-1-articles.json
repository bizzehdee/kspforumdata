Photos with obvious buildings, grass, or whatever, will not qualify.\n\nEach unique, passable Mun scene you make (of a flag planing, rover trip, kerbal on a ladder etc,) will be worth 50 points.\n\nDouble that if you\u0027re using a mod that adds reflections to helmet visors.\n\nIf you include a nice little story with your Mun pictures, your score may double again.\n\nPlus, I\u0027ll give an X-factor bonus of up to 25% for extra complex efforts, or excellent scenery..\n\nPlease also include an image or two that shows how you did it. I need to make sure you didn\u0027t cheat by actually going to the Mun. But hide these in spoiler tags, so they won\u0027t ruin the effect of your fake pictures. Also, try to take your fake mun pictures on Kerbin.  \n\nDo it in space if you must, but there will be a 40% penalty to plan around. No photoshopping allowed. Try not to directly  copy previous attempts, this may get a 10% penalty. \n\n[![sI2xO3J.png](http://i.imgur.com/sI2xO3J.png)](http://imgur.com/sI2xO3J)\n\nUse the remains of a demolished space center, use any cheat, mod, use asteroids, use anything, just don\u0027t land anywhere but kerbin!\n\nGo \u0022land on the Mun\u0022!
