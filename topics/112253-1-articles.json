I don\u0027t care about Fahrenheit. I just said in case some of you use it - just for fairness. I\u0027m from Europe and normally use Celsius. I know what units space agencies use, you really don\u0027t need to tell me that.\n\nI just would like to have a button next to the info popup of the HOT2 Thermometer. These kinds of buttons are used everywhere in the game for many parts (including the Thermometer). Currently, the thermometer shows only a number without a unit. I guess this is just a bug. The other thing was the suggestion to toggle the unit to show the another calculated value. E. g., 277K [\u003E Click \u003E] 14.85\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C [\u003E Click \u003E] 277K.

If they are leaving school without having encountered it, that is a dreadful situation. If anything, that makes me want to keep KSP strictly in Kelvin, to fill in the gap in their education.\n\nAside from that, I don\u0027t see how your argument really demonstrates a need or benefit for having other scales in KSP, or a problem with the status quo. It\u0027s impossible to burn yourself, the temperatures don\u0027t matter for anything other than overheat. Overheat is just fine in Kelvin, and would have no tangible improvement if it could be changed to Celsius; it\u0027s still one number having to stay below another number, the units are entirely irrelevant as long as both numbers are actually on the same scale. If anything, adding the choice would add confusion, with people getting mixed up between cfg file values, in-game values, wiki values, values in forum posts, etc. A single scale used for all eliminates that likely confusion.\n\nIf someone really has never heard of Kelvin (within the subset of people who are able to comprehend KSP\u0027s simplified orbital mechanics), it\u0027s literally 30 seconds on Google, and you know all that you need to know to understand the Kelvin scale (assuming you\u0027re already familiar with Celsius), at least as far as interpreting the numbers for basic hot vs. cold. Here\u0027s the one line that is all anyone needs in KSP terms (although I\u0027m not sure you even really need it, to be honest): 273K is 0C; 0K is -273C; delta-1K == delta-1C.\n\nWhere in the stock game would it make a real useful difference to have temperatures in Celsius?"}]}
