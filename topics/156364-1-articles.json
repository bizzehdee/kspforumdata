A rocket on Earth will naturally end up much higher up in an ideal gravity turn, because if it turned over as hard as rockets in KSP can, it would fall out of the sky long before obtaining enough sideways velocity. The only reason you can even target the end of your gravity turn at 28km in KSP and survive is because Kerbin is so tiny and lets you get away with a much smaller amount of sideways velocity. And the only reason you\u0027re on fire at that point is because the atmosphere is not quite as tiny as the planet itself. If it was, flying planes wouldn\u0027t be much fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested in verifying this, you can actually do so relatively easily. Just download Sigma Dimensions, and try some of the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Enter a 0.2x multiplier for atmosphere scaling. That\u0027ll make the atmosphere around 14 kilometers thick, which is comparable to Earth\u0027s atmosphere downsized to Kerbin\u0027s level. You should now no longer be on fire during ascent, even if the smaller atmosphere lets you target your gravity turn even lower.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Enter a 2.0x multiplier for atmosphere scaling, and a 11x multiplier for size scaling. This will make Kerbin as large as Earth, and extend the atmosphere to 140km. These are, IIRC, roughly the values that Realism Overhaul is using (though they also edit a whole lot more than just that!). If you launch a rocket here (remember, \u0026gt; 9km/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required to orbit), you\u0027ll find that even with engines putting out 4 to 5 g of acceleration at stage burnout, you must target your gravity turn so high up that you don\u0027t get a flame sheath on ascent either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Enter a 1.0x multiplier for atmosphere scaling, and a 2.0x multiplier for size scaling. That\u0027ll create a situation where Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is at 70km as normal, but your required sideways velocity is 50% higher than before. Wonder what happens here?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn case 3, you\u0027re probably still going to get some flames. The atmosphere is still oversized in respect to Kerbin, meaning you will spend a larger portion of the ascent inside it than you would on Earth. And because you\u0027re accelerating towards 3300 m/s instead of 2200 m/s, there\u0027s plenty of plasma sheath potential. This is where we get into the area where KSP fudges its physics in favor of gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned before, at the low velocities in stock KSP, you\u0027d barely ever see a plasma sheath at all (only on aggressive interplanetary aerobraking at Jool, perhaps). So KSP has multipliers in place that pretend that, for the purposes of drawing the plasma sheath, the velocity you are going at is quite a bit higher than it actually is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn your KSP root directory, find physics.cfg and open it. Near the top, you\u0027ll see the physics constants used for aeroFX (which is both condensation/mach effects and plasma/reentry effects). Find \u0027AeroFXVelocityExponent\u0027. This number, defaulting to 3.5 in stock KSP, is the physics fudging factor that makes plasma effects show up at much lower speeds than natural. For example, if you set this value to 3.0 instead, you will find that a standard \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E reentry on stock Kerbin (100km AP, 0km PE) does not produce \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E flames at all (though the craft still heats up as normal). In my setting up my latest play instance, I found that putting it at about 3.33 was suitable for a 2x sized Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile you\u0027re at it, you can also play with \u0027AeroFXDensityFadeStart\u0027, which controls how close to the edge of the atmosphere you can get plasma effects. In stock KSP on a normal reentry they start at about 51km, which I found to be a little low. So I tweaked it to be around 56km instead. It\u0027s really up to individual taste, and has a lot to do with how you set the velocity exponent. And then there is \u0027AeroFXStartThermalFX\u0027 and \u0027AeroFXFullThermalFX\u0027, which are the mach numbers at which condensation effects start/finish transforming into plasma effects. If you increase these mach numbers, you will see more white effects during ascent, and less red ones. Of course, you\u0027ll also see the plasma sheath fade sooner during reentry as well... I went with 3.0 and 4.5 here, to account for the higher speeds on my upscaled Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that provides some insight \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-13T11:58:29Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2017 11:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-13T10:53:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the options menu I have atmosphere effects slider at the minimum.
