After discovering landing on Mun and coming back was, well, difficult without any of the larger rocket parts I was thinking of a new way to earn some decent science points. I just got my Science Bay and some fixed solar panels so I decided to build an unmanned probe, originally with the intent of doing some work in orbit around Mun. The probe was nothing fancy, it only had a 200 L tank and it was not designed for any long range exploration. However, after setting up my initial Munar trajectory I found out I\u0027d pass within about 12 Km of the surface and then be ejected from the Kerbin system. My first stage was still attached and had plenty of fuel so I thought I might use my good fortune to get some more science points in deep space. With that in mind I didn\u0027t do any further orbital adjustments and after transmitting my observations I just let the whole thing sail off into an independent orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell after all that, I transmitted some data (only getting a 20% return) and then wondered what else to do. I didn\u0027t have enough Delta-V to really go anywhere but I thought I could get closer to Kerbol and just sort of leave the probe to its own devices thereafter. So I burnt off all the fuel in my first stage and, by chance, I screwed things up and ended up increasing my apoapsis to the point where it was relatively close to Duna\u0027s orbit. Furthermore, by chance I found that by doing another burn some 160 days later I would pass very close to Duna itself, periapsis being less than 15 Km. And I could do it for less than 100 m/s of Delta-V. So I dumped the empty tanks and waited for the probe to get into position, after the burn I was well on my way to another planet with nearly all of my Probe\u0027s fuel supply intact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I lacked fuel to slow down to go into orbit so aerobraking was my only option. for just a few m/s cost I was able to lower my periapsis to about 10 Km, which was good because I was coming in with an orbital speed in excess of 1,800 m/s. To be honest I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get captured but evidently it was enough since I settled into an orbit with an apoapsis of about 27,500 Km away from Duna. I did one more pass through the atmosphere at about 14.5 Km which was enough to mostly circularize my equatorial orbit. I settled in at about 60 Km above Duna\u0027s surface and that\u0027s where the probe is at the moment. With enough fuel to go to Ike but I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m going to do that yet. It was really quite interesting and hinged as much on just luck as anything else, which I guess made it more exciting. The only thing that irritated me was the massive loss of science per transmission; well I guess there aren\u0027t any free lunches even in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aeronaut","CreatedById":83922,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T17:46:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMission to Eeloo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RIJvrql.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RIJvrql.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/jqUNR#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELink to the rest of the album.\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adge","CreatedById":85309,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T19:41:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECompleted my first landing and return on Minmus in career mode.
