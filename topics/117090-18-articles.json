The layouts are based on a 1m scale. Whatever positions defined in the layout will be scaled by the engineClusters mountSpacing value. Rotation values are applied to the models KSP-space Y axis (standard lengthwise axis for engines/most parts). When per-engine mounts are used, the same spacing and rotation is applied to them. You could even define the layout in the same file as your part (for custom layouts), or though MM patch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m mostly settled on the one-part-per cluster setup, so I\u0027ve skipped past the need for the investigatory testing, but I do appreciate the offer (I know firsthand how busy modding can keep you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).

I\u0027m thinking that I\u0027ll likely be making two sets of geometry for it; the full ring style, and something more resembling the stock radial decouplers. Should I include some geometry for the jettison motors? I can, but I\u0027m unsure how well it would scale, or how good it might look for certain uses.

The thrust transforms will move with the attach rings, so you can essentially set the locations for the separation motors (the rings/mounts are mostly just there for visual cues of where the separation motors will be located).

If I could just use those in a smaller/grayscale texture (srsly, I don\u0027t need 1024x for AO bakes, 256x or 512x would be fine for most larger parts), it could seriously cut down on texture use -and- increase how fast I could get parts created (being able to share textures would be...
