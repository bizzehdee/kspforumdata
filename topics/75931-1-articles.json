The idea is to point prograde (in your direction of travel or where the navball has the yellow marker with horizontal lines in the middle of the view), and burn as or just before M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn comes over the horizon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you watch on the map view as you burn (and don\u0027t forget to have your navball visible in the map view), you\u0027ll be able to get a reasonably efficient transfer point as your orbit\u0027s apoapsis (the AP marker) rises towards M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s orbit. The easiest thing to do there is to just keep the nose prograde and use a very low thrust level, watching the intercept\u0027s lowest point or periapsis (the PE marker on the predicted orbit). A 50KM periapsis is good enough to be able to time warp to (I think) 50x once you get into an orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for getting into an orbit, point retrograde once you\u0027re close to periapsis. That\u0027s the opposite direction of prograde, pointing your engines toward the direction of travel. Depending on how powerful your engines are determines on where you burn here. There are mods with flight computers here that will give you estimated fuel remaining in seconds, delta V remaining, and even carry out a circularisation burn for you, however in stock, the best game I think for a newbie to play is \u0022chase the periapsis\u0022. As you burn, you\u0027ll see the blue PE marker hopefully start to move away from you. The idea is to get as close as you dare to the periapsis, but not cross over it. The nearer you are to periapsis, the harder it becomes to push the PE marker away from your ship, but the more circular your end orbit will be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, be skillful with throttle control and watching the navball markers, use map view, and stop thrusting when the periapsis and apoapsis are close enough or when the PE runs right away and ends up either halfway around the orbit from you or on the other side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should be enough to get you to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit given enough delta V to get there. Escaping from M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn back to Kerbin from M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit is a case of burning prograde shortly before your ship reaches the point \u0022in front\u0022 of M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn relative to its direction of travel. Basically look on map view and zoom out far enough to see M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn\u0027s orbit. It should rotate anticlockwise around Kerbin if viewed from above the North pole. If it\u0027s at the 3 o\u0027clock position relative to Kerbin, you should start your burn to return somewhere around 12:00. Just get a fairly low predicted orbit around Kerbin, let yourself escape from M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and lower your orbit around Kerbin once you\u0027re there by burning retrograde at Apoapsis. If you can get the periapsis down to around 25KM, that\u0027s about the right height to re-enter without skipping back out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, take care when crossing Sphere-of-influence or SOI boundaries. The game doesn\u0027t like it when you cross from Kerbin to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit (or vice versa, or to any other orbit) at really high time warp values, and it can throw your final orbit right out. Use F5 to quicksave and F9 to reload quicksaves, Alt\u002BF5 and Alt\u002BF9 let you create named quicksaves, and also try the other things people have suggested in this thread. It\u0027s all good advice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails, there\u0027s always the flight computer mods. Flight Engineer and Mechjeb 2 are popular ones. They both allow you to calculate the amount of delta V your rocket will give you, its thrust to weight and how long the fuel will last at full throttle. Mechjeb\u0027s autopilot features are both loved and hated it seems in equal measure here. Basically if you can engineer a rocket well, you can click a button and watch your rocket get itself into orbit, or land itself on M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and maybe learn while you watch how Mechjeb does it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T23:35:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biff","CreatedById":113084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T01:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know this is a late, as a beginner, I always stuck to LV-45\u0027s and Jebidiah\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship Co. rocket parts, so if you are using the larger Rockomax parts, then try going smaller.
