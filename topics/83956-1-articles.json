It takes a lot of ladders to reach the ground. Due to the way the vessel is built, there is no straight path, either. I now find that I spent pretty much an entire afternoon trying to get the ladders working. Even for a complicated case like mine, that seems a tad much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou have to make ends meet, precisely. If the ends of telescopic ladders go past each other there\u0027s a good chance that the kerbal won\u0027t switch ladders.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDocking ports, batteries (and possibly more) have handles, but they don\u0027t work. So every docking connection needs to be bridged with ladders. A simple three-rung ladder attached radially would work nicely, but alas, no radial attachment of anything to a docking port.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Emaking ends meet can be quite a hassle. Rotating a piece about several axes becomes non-intuitive real quick. Not to mention that 5-degree increments are much wider than the long ladder\u0027s width -- so you\u0027ll be off either way.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe only way to find out is testing \u003Cem\u003Ethoroughly\u003C/em\u003E. Things that look fine may fail to work, and the other way round. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E especially funny: a ladder may work in one direction, but not in the other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETogether with ladders not being extendable after reverting to VAB, Kerbals not staying in the pod they\u0027ve been assigned, and movement on ladders being rather slow, testing was rather time-consuming as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy job would have been a lot easier if it was possible to attach ladders end-to-end. Also, variable length (or a wider choice of legths) would have helped. Or placing ladders like struts: start point, end point, here we go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese proposals are just the first ideas that crossed my mind; I don\u0027t claim that they\u0027re especially well thought out. But I\u0027d say that ladders could do with a little more attention than they\u0027re getting. As it is, laddering up a vessel can easily become more complicated than designing the vessel in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woopert","CreatedById":84274,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-06T18:29:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry Padishar\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EPart Angle Display\u003C/em\u003E mod, it helps with aligning parts with precise angles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390-0-24-2-Part-Angle-Display-including-seamless-highly-accurate-rotation-v0-2-4-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390-0-24-2-Part-Angle-Display-including-seamless-highly-accurate-rotation-v0-2-4-5\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree with all the rest that you said, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T14:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E6.
