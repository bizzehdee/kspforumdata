The main difference between the 4 installers is on the author end, not the end user side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- CurseForge / CurseClient - Has a 24hr team that checks files and tries their best to catch problem files before they get to users, requires mod author cooperation/permission for hosting, requires mod author permission for packs, rewards authors for their work based on download count, has the FTB Official packs as well as a large number of moderated community made packs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- FTB - does not host mods, only installs packs. Has a team that creates packs as well as community made packs. Community made packs are checked for mod author permission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ATLauncher - does not host mods, does not host packs in the traditional way, some packs may require you visit multiple URLs and download the mods yourself, pack creators can use any download link source not just the official download\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Technic - does not host mods, has a team that creates packs. Has un-moderated community packs available, some of which are using mods without permission, some are using modified versions of mods, no one checks the community packs so they are a bit of a mixed bunch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to safety, none of the 4 listed launchers will intentionally load anything that\u0027s not safe, all of them have community teams that want people to be able to have fun while being safe. All 4 have varying risks of something slipping through, depending on how stringent their checking and moderation of files is, CurseForge has the most checking and safeguards of the major sites for Minecraft mods and packs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe remaining websites that distribute mods, aside from Minecraft forums are mostly un-moderated and frequently host stolen or modified files. If the mod author doesn\u0027t link to the download on their website/forum post, especially on an un-moderated site be careful. In the end, this is the internet and people are constantly trying to get around guidelines, rules and safeguards just to prove they can, or to be mean to other people. The safest thing you can do is to try and make sure any files you are downloading are coming from the author, or were distributed with the authors consent and knowledge whether alone or in a pack. Then at least you know the file is exactly what the author intended and no one has meddled with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd make sure you know what he is downloading/installing.
