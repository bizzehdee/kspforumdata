I wish that I had a teacher like you when I was their age. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have at length thought about such scenarios as the one that you\u0027ve described in my daydreams. Below are a few suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Don\u0027t mess with a good thing. If the kids are doing well on their own, then don\u0027t \u0027taint\u0027 their little world with your adultness. I don\u0027t mean to sound mean, but this game is \u003Cem\u003Etheirs\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Don\u0027t let the fire die. If you see that a group dynamic is limiting the kids, then step in and fix it as quickly and cleanly as you can; if they need resources, then provide them, e.g., have orbital mechanics textbooks; and keep adding fuel, e.g., leave a book full of old rocket designs idly lying on a table--or better yet, a single sheet of paper with a fundamental concept or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Think ahead. Your goal is to get these kids to have fun with rocket science in the most natural way that you can. If doing so means sparingly helping them over an otherwise insurmountable hurdle, then do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Match their level of sincerity and enthusiasm--which can become surprisingly intense and specific to certain aspects of the game: give the pilots adventure, the organizers power, and the engineers problems that seem just out of reach. Some kids will even find meaning in their work--stoke that, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Stoke their interest. Put a grand, ultimate challenge before the class--a mothership capable of orbiting and deploying a manned lander upon every single body in the Kerbol system--and leave them to their own devices unless such a case as described in suggestion 2 comes up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Duxwing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"esinohio","CreatedById":57681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T04:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found this link \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45770-KSP-Tutorials-auf-Deutsch\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45770-KSP-Tutorials-auf-Deutsch\u003C/a\u003E in the international section.
