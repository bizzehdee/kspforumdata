Anyway, some know I despise the \u0022hype-mobiles\u0022 that are popping up now, because of Gregox\u0027s use of it in the last update. Now it just seems as if everyone is hopping onto the bandwagon because they want to have some-sort of fame. As much as I know it\u0027s for \u0022fun\u0022. It isn\u0027t necessary. If I where to post a thread on non-hype days. People would hate it. It\u0027s just because Gregox is making too-big of a deal about it. Sure, it\u0027s for a discussion. But when the discussion thread is just \u0022#LOLOLOLKSPHYPETRAIN420TICKETSLELELELEL\u0022, that isn\u0027t discussing new features. It\u0027s just a chat thread. Other games don\u0027t do this, because it would be something people would complain about. You don\u0027t see the Minecrafters on the forums doing this. You don\u0027t see Prison Architect fans doing this. You don\u0027t see Buzz Aldrins Space Program doing this. It\u0027s just a person with the spotlight on them, and others wanting to join in.
