Canards would surely help, but I\u0027m trying to avoid those.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T04:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a CoL/CoM arrangement issue in both cases.

I ended up settling on more blended body designs. Unfortunately, most of the \u0027ready-made\u0027 ones (such as Bobcats Kliper, etc.) don\u0027t really react to FAR that well. Personally, for a while there I was using a \u0027Dyan-Soarer\u0027 design for crew transfer to and from my main station (back in .20), but haven\u0027t done too much in the lines of lifting bodies since then. However, another mod that can help you out is pWings. Otherwise known as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/29862-0-21-Procedural-Dynamics-Procedural-Wing-0-5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural Wings\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E, this mod allows you to create your own wing shapes, tailor made to your craft. One of the functions of the mod (one I\u0027d like to figure out how to circumvent somehow) is that expanding the wing root length-wise, also increases the wing\u0027s thickness. From your standpoint using this function correctly, you can make some pretty good lifting body shapes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the uncharacteristic lack of example pics, but I just found \u0027X3-Albion Prelude\u0027 and have been playing that in most of my free time over the last few days...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T07:38:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t believe lifting bodies work in KSP. However, launching a winged plane on top of a rocket requires some extra control. Ideally, you want the centre of lift behind the centre of mass (yes, even if it\u0027s launched vertically), otherwise it will be inherently unstable in flight. Possible solutions would be to put quite a few canards/winglets on the very, very bottom of your rocket, make sure your engines gimbal and can compensate for such instability, or simply slap a buttload of RCS/SAS units on the rocket to keep it locked in place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"espm400","CreatedById":71109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-31T17:12:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t believe lifting bodies work in KSP. \u003Cp\u003E~snip~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I can\u0027t speak for pure lifting bodies (you\u0027d have to make an actual model for those), blended wing bodies work just fine with FAR installed.
