It won\u0027t let me speed up time either, every time I try it says I can\u0027t do that while moving over the surface, even though I\u0027m 300k\u002B km away from said surface. I\u0027ve restarted several times and I am not using any addons at all. Can anyone help me? Is there something I can do in the console to change my status from landed to something else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance for any help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T19:15:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like a bug to me.
