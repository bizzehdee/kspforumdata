You start with 100 reputation, enough for the first parts. Sub-orbital flights earn you 10 reputation each. Orbital flights earn you 20 reputation. Going to Mun or Minmus earns you 200 reputation. Going to Dres or Moho earns you 800 reputation. Going to Duna or Eve earns you 500 reputation. Going to Gilly earns you 400 reputation. Going to Ike earns you 450 reputation. Going to Eeloo earns you 2500 reputation. Going to Jool earns you 1500 reputation. Going to Laythe earns you 2000 reputation. Going to any of Jool\u0027s other moons earn you 1000 science. You don\u0027t spend reputation, but you can lose it by killing kerbals. Killing the main crew makes you lose 200 reputation. Losing other crew members make you lose 100 reputation. You can get negative reputation, which means you can only use the basic capsule and the solid fuel booster that you start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECOST:\u003C/strong\u003E You can get money by going on missions, must like reputation. But with cost, it\u0027s about getting \u0022artifacts\u0022 or surface samples, which is just one way to get money. Another way is by transferring science to money. 1 science = $10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESCIENCE:\u003C/strong\u003E You can only do reports from Kerbin a few times. You can do reports from space as much as you want and still earning science, but the science will only give you 10%. This is to prevent people from getting stuck to the point where they have no science at all and no way to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E Ok, reputation should only be worth half as much, but you get twice the amount of reputation if you make it back.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-31T00:47:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2014 12:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Clockwork13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T16:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy are the reputation values so random?

It\u0027s probably easier than Duna. Bigger SOI less delta-v needed to intercept and a much thicker atmosphere for aerobraking. Jool is harder by comparison due to the greater delta-V requirement. The fact is that there is nowhere in the game that is very difficult to get to. Getting back is the challenge.
