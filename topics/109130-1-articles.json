I\u0027ve recently installed a few mods that I wouldn\u0027t expect to cause any problems and I\u0027m unsure if this is the issue. However, the problem that I\u0027ve encountered is that my launch vehicle tends to automatically enable some sort of rotation system that disables any manual inputs or overrides that I attempt to command the craft to follow. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will - on its own - completely disable the main engine at exactly 3km of altitude and begin an automatic rotation to point retrograde at the launch facility. Thereafter once drag and gravity have slowed the rocket to a freefall point, the strange control system will correct the rocket\u0027s direction to point retrograde to its new trajectory and face the sky. Once it passes 3km again and descends below that point, the engines will fire again at the throttle before the flight systems took control. The thing is, it does it \u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E once the rocket ascends beyond 3km for a second time. I\u0027m unsure of whats going on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have noticed that when the main engine disables itself and the rocket begins its automatic rotation, if I flail on the keyboard and spam the space bar, LIN/ROT will enable and disable itself. I assume this is part of the docking computer system, but I\u0027m on the staging computer so I haven\u0027t a clue what the heck is going on with that. Is my space bar a hotkey for LIN/ROT, and does this cause this odd rotation pattern? I attempted to access the settings to find the controls, but each time I do so, the game bugs out and loads for tens of minutes until the game crashes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of the rocket:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gyazo.com/ca7ff3c91d9219ec0aee6f719f7ea7ba\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://gyazo.com/ca7ff3c91d9219ec0aee6f719f7ea7ba\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only modded parts I have on the rocket are two cameras that I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E do not respond to physics from the Hullcam VDS mod.
