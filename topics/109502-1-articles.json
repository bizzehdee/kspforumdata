Fun trivia, the body flap was damaged during STS-1\u0027s launch due to insufficient sound suppression, but it wasn\u0027t discovered until after Columbia had landed. John Young reportedly said that if they had know of the damage during launch, he\u0027d have ejected because the orbiter should have been uncontrollable during reentry!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"matthias123","CreatedById":141722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks you, and yes it\u0027s a flap too on my version, i need to work on the separation booster ( 3/10 failure ) and work on the RCS for more stability. then i\u0027ll post the files and information like maximum orbital altitude etc..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"inigma","CreatedById":69310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:27:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wings, cockpit, and fuselage bottoms are naturally heat shielded.
