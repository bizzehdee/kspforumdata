Everything was normal for the beginning of the launch, I was headed to Minmus to do an altimetry scan. Once pretty far out there, it started acting strangely. I can\u0027t activate \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, for starters - when I press T, it flashes on for the briefest moment before being shut off again. I can\u0027t use the reaction wheels to change the direction of the probe at all. It seems like it\u0027s fixed on one point and won\u0027t give me control. I\u0027ve managed to get it to move by right clicking on the probe core and the reaction wheel and messing around with the reaction wheel setting - changing it from \u0022Normal\u0022 to \u0022Pilot Only\u0022 and one to \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E Only\u0022 seems to allow me to change where it\u0027s pointing, but within a few seconds of me moving it, it starts trying to take back control and move it back to where it wants it pointed. I managed to keep it mostly under control by turning the reaction wheel power way down, but then when I activated my engine for my burn, it used the engine\u0027s gimbal to try to move it to where it wanted it to be pointed as well, ignoring my input and the fact I was trying to point at a maneuver node. It\u0027s like I\u0027m fighting against another pilot in the ship. And even though I can wrest some control away, when I change the settings of the wheel back to \u0022Normal\u0022 it immediately snaps back to where it wants to be pointed and I can\u0027t move it at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-07T22:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223668095\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188037\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567809544\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022135803\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mr_trousers\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n23 hours ago, mr_trousers said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you use mechjeb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-08T18:25:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLogs.

Since you didn\u0027t, and since your stage light is purple, I think your problem is that either RemoteTech\u0027s FC or Mechjeb have control of your probe. Here\u0027s what I think is happening:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA. With RemoteTech, you can set the Flight Computer to lock into a particular heading / orientation after completing a command. The FC will then try to hold the orientation. Now, it\u0027s been a while (since 1.2 days at least) since I\u0027ve used RT, so I may be out of date; but if I am not, you can try disabling RemoteTech and see if you can move. If you can, possible culprit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB. Likewise, with Mechjeb, you can have the Smart A.S.S. turned on and pointed to a particular orientation. In this case, checking is as simple as opening up the Smart A.S.S. window and switching it to \u0022Off\u0022 (if it\u0027s not already).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact you are pointed towards Anti-Normal also would indicate that either of these could be your culprit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coyotesfrontier","CreatedById":181596,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-24T17:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had a similer issue with probes (and only probes), where they won\u0027t respond to the \u0022A\u0022 key on my keyboard.
