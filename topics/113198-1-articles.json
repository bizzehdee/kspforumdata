I have one engine marked as \u0022experimental\u0022 because i had a contract for testing it. Somehow, due to mods installation, the contrracts got reseted, but the engine keeps appearing as experimental in the VAB ans SAS. Do you know how to remove the label ? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T12:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESilly question for your silly question: have you unlocked the part in your tech tree?

Can you upload your logs and what mods you use? Also, can you create a simple craft (no modded parts) with an \u0022experimental\u0022 part in it and upload it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
