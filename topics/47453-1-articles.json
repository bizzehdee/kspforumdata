I wish we could group all the ships from a certain category (e.g. All the modules of X station, All the mun ships, etc.) and have the categories be listed first, then let the player navigate through the different groups. This would make finding a specific ship to improve much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: I want a ship loading GUI that works more like a normal file manager.
