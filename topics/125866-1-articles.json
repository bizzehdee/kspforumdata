I first noticed it on returning from my first orbit in a new career. I always try to return pretty gently (~75k ap and ~50k per). Everything seemed pretty normal until i reached around 20k. I\u0026#39;m blazing towards the ground and it seems like I\u0026#39;m coming in way too hot. Maybe I\u0026#39;ll start slowing down? Nope. Ended up pulling my chutes at 1000m going 350m/s. Of course they ripped off and I slammed into the ground, killing Jeb.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI played around with it some more and did some reading here on the forum. Slashy recommended decoupling the heat shield after you\u0026#39;re through with it. When I do that, I slow down just fine. Using KER I see that my rate of deceleration goes from ~2.4 G\u0026#39;s to ~4 G\u0026#39;s as soon as the shield is decoupled. Why is the heat shield so much more aerodynamic than the bottom of the pod?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this an intended behavior, or is this a bug?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, I seem to remember a mod that had heat shields with built in decouplers.

The thing that confuses people is that if there\u0026#39;s a heatshield attached to the pod, the whole thing behaves like it has very little drag.

If you use the highest possible periapsis that still works - i.e. the shallowest possible reentry angle - your vertical speed will be low only in the upper reaches of the atmosphere that do not slow you down measurably, but high and increasing when you finally encounter the lower reaches, causing high g-loads and high heating - and potentially failing to slow down in time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat you really want is a shallow angle and low vertical speed [I]during transition from middle into lower atmosphere[/I], not elsewhere. That generally involves choosing a steeper reentry angle with a lower periapsis and possibly an elevated apoapsis, so your vertical speed is high while passing through the upper reaches but slows down as your craft levels off when approaching its periapsis inside the atmosphere.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T08:00:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 08:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T08:31:45Z","Content":"\nNope, you get exactly (perhaps even 1% larger, since there\u0026#39;s a bit of extra side area) the same drag force with the shield or without the shield.

added to crewed parts? If I need extra shielding for a particular mission, I could just add ablator to the pod or cabin as needed, instead of adding more parts. Also, I wouldn\u0026#39;t have to rely on luck to keep my Kerbals alive.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T16:39:10Z","Content":"\nWell if it were only for crewed parts we couldn\u0026#39;t use them to protect probes or other equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would think a combination of adding decouplers and moving drogues up in the tech tree should get us there.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T16:45:00Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 04:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T16:49:57Z","Content":"\nAll,\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe official word on this is it\u0026#39;s on the known bugs list, but we shouldn\u0026#39;t expect a fix any time soon.
