Now, then, when--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hand went up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey gave a patient sigh, \u0022lad, if you keep asking questions, Ah\u0027ll never get to the Ussari part.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo hundred pairs of eyes gave the incorrigible inquirer a nasty look, and the hand went down.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where was I? Ah yes, now the old Roamin\u0027 Empire had been the paragon of civilization for well over a thousand years, and accordin\u0027 to some histories, at its height it covered nearly the entire landmass of Kerbin. Except for what we today call Cerima, of course. But around fifteen hundred years or so before the present, it entered a time of steep decline. Province rose against province, and regent against regent, smashing to rubble, as they did, many of the great Roamin\u0027 innovations like indoor plumbing and arches. Libraries were burned, hospitals were razed, even the very roads were pulled up and hurled at the opposing side. The whole \u003Cem\u003Eworld\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0burned, and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hand again, \u0022did the emperor really play a fiddle while it burned?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No lad, that\u0027s just silly. It was a tuba.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So the world burned for years, and when the the last flames finally went out, an age of darkness descended upon it. Literally and figuratively, Ah suppose. Very little is known of this time, as most folks were too busy trying to avoid horrible deaths to bother writing anything down. Or they had simply forgotten how.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But eventually the world began to heal, as it always does, and the first post-Roamin\u0027 societies emerged from the ashes. Tribes of barbarians competed for scarce resources, sometimes cooperating, but usually just beating each other over the head with whatever was handy, and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Was one of them named Conan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEyes rolled, \u0022no, lad, it was \u003Cem\u003ECohen\u003C/em\u003E, the \u003Cem\u003En\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is silent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now on the vast plains of the eastern landmass, along the banks of the Never River, one tribe in particular began to distinguish themselves as being particularly good at not dying, and they called themselves the \u016As\u0027, which, ironically, simply means \u0027us.\u0027 As opposed to \u0027them.\u0027 In fact, they were \u003Cem\u003Eso\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0good at staying alive, that the clans of the \u016As\u0027 spread out into the unoccupied lands around them, and inevitably, into the occupied ones too. Whether the current occupiers wanted it or not. This led to infighting among the clans, and the tribes fighting the clans as well, and just when it looked like the first society in a few hundred years that was civilized enough to brush its own hair was about to crumble into ruin again and take with them anyone within swinging distance, a true leader appeared.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey glanced at the incessant hand-raiser, and seeing that he \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0actually ceased for the moment, continued, \u0022as Ah said, records from this time are highly fragmented, but they all agree on one thing: within a generation, most of the clans of the \u016As\u0027 had been united by a Kerb who was given the name Vlad the Great. Also variously called Vlad \u003Cem\u003ESt\u0103p\u00E2nul Diminea\u021Ba\u003C/em\u003E, Lord of the Morning, or Vlad \u003Cem\u003EDraculya\u003C/em\u003E, son of the devil. Or, more commonly...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly the meager light shifted, illuminating his features from below and giving Chadvey\u0027s face a terrifying cast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...Vlad the Expaler!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd gave a collective gasp before Chadvey could raise a hand to his eyes, \u0022and get that bloody light out of mah face!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003ESorry, tripped\u003C/span\u003E,\u0022 mumbled the A/V guy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hand went up again, \u0022don\u0027t you mean Vlad the \u003Cem\u003EIm\u003C/em\u003Epaler?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, lad, quite the opposite, \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Vlad had a penchant for putting \u003Cem\u003Epeople\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0through \u003Cem\u003Etrees\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother collective gasp, and the hand slowly withered, its owner growing quite, well, pale.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA different, rather hesitant hand went up, belonging to a young Kerbelle in cadet blue, \u0022but... why would people follow such a brutal person?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, you see it\u0027s all a matter of perspective. If I told you \u003Cem\u003Ehalf\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the things I\u0027ve heard about this Vlad the Expaler, you\u0027d probably wet yourself,\u0022 the cadet scowled at this, but he continued with a wink, \u0022and none of it is likely true. You mustn\u0027t put too much stock in legends and fairy tales. Old Vlad was certainly violent, but one Kerb\u0027s thug is another\u0027s hero, it largely depends upon which side of the tree you\u0027re on, as it were. He brought stability and the rule of law to people who had never known it, which allowed them to live in relative peace, so long as they stayed on his good side. Supposedly respect for his law, or fear of punishment, was so strong that in what became the city of Kernobyl there was a golden goblet set on a public fountain for thirsty citizens to drink from. According to the legend, it was never stolen and always returned to exactly where it had been left. Interestingly, the very name \u0027Vlad\u0027 can mean either \u0027he who has peace,\u0027 or \u0027the ruler of the world.\u0027\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ooooooooooooh,\u0022 breathed the astonished crowd.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyways, what Vlad the Great began, his son Vladimir finished, finally uniting all the various clans of the \u016As\u0027 under his own banner. To this day, the name \u0027Vladimir\u0027 remains very popular in Ussari-speaking lands, roughly meaning \u0027the offspring or close kin of Vlad.\u0027 As the tribe\u0027s lands and power grew, they slowly gave up their nomadic ways and settled down, building villages and towns and cities, and Vladimirimir, son of Vladimir, declared himself their first king. At some point, they adopted the language of one of their appropriated rivals, and began calling themselves \u0027Ussari,\u0027 or \u0027children of the \u016As\u0027.\u0027 Around the time of Vladimirimirimirimirimir, the king gave up \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bit of linguistic nonsense as he was spending a large portion of his day simply signing his name, and took to calling himself Vlad VI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now when Vlad XIII came to power, the Kingdom of Ussari was \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0powerful in the region, but was becoming outshined by its neighbors, strong principalities and powers in their own right. So Vlad XIII commissioned a massive statue in his likeness, which he was sure was just the thing to strike fear and awe into his rivals. On the day of its unveiling before a gathered crowd, he proudly read the words carved upon the plinth in the old tongue, \u0027\u003Cem\u003EVrei s\u0103 pleci, dar nu m\u0103, nu m\u0103 iei,\u00A0nu m\u0103, nu m\u0103 iei,\u00A0nu m\u0103, nu m\u0103,\u00A0nu m\u0103 iei\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 meaning \u0027I am the King of Kings, look upon my work, ye mighty, and despair.\u0027 And was promptly stabbed in the back by his twin brother Ivan--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey was interrupted by Jerdous bursting into a furious coughing fit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry, \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;cough\u0026gt; \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0sorry, don\u0027t mind me,\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;gasp\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u0022 he croaked, setting down his glass, \u0022swallowed wrong \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0026lt;gag\u0026gt;\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Careful, lad, you\u0027ll need to learn to control your breathing better than that if you\u0027re to be a spacekerb,\u0022 Chadvey grinned, \u0022now what was Ah saying? Ah yes, so of course Ivan--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hand once more, \u0022don\u0027t you mean EYE-vin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, lad, the proper Ussari pronunciation is Ee-VAHN. Now Ee-VAHN took the throne, of course. Quite literally, in fact, he took it right from the palace in Kernobyl and moved it to a huge fortress he had built just far enough from the Never River to keep it from wandering in and pinching snacks in the night. For all his fratricidal tendencies, he was a very lern\u00E9d Kerb for his time, and absolutely fascinated by the former glory of the old Roamin\u0027 Empire. Read everything he could find about them, and wanting to emulate them as much as possible, declared himself \u003Cem\u003EEmperor\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Ivan I. When neighboring kingdoms took issue with this, bit risky having an empire next door, after all, Ivan tore down his brother\u0027s old statue, and used an enormous siege engine he\u0027d reproduced from Roamin\u0027 documents to fling bits of it at them until they buggered off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022From these humble beginnings, the young Ussari Empire grew and grew until at its height it stretched from the west coast of modern Cerima all the way to the Yaltik sea.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hand in front went up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So the Ussaris just went out and conquered everyone else?\u0022 The cadet said indignantly, then scowled and crossed her arms, \u0022well no wonder it all went to crap!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, not as much as you would think,\u0022 Chadvey smiled, \u0022the Ussari Emperors and Empresses tended to be fairly pragmatic folks. War is expensive and risky, after all. Most territorial expansion came bloodlessly at the point of a \u003Cem\u003Epen\u003C/em\u003E, not a sword.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused, and scratched his chin thoughtfully, \u0022well except of course for Katarine IV, who stabbed the King of Ibetia to death with his \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0pen when he wouldn\u0027t agree to her terms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But once again, lass, it all depends largely upon which side of the tree you\u0027re on. The sins of the Empire were indeed many. The greed of Ivan XXI, who came to be called, rather unimaginatively,\u00A0\u0027Ivan the Greedy,\u0027 decimated the province of Erakonia. The famous open plains of Nusad were once covered in towering forests, until Feodor III had them all cut down to build an armada of tall ships. And the Empire was certainly not averse to taking territory by force and rationalizing it later.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022However, those same battle-hardened troops allowed the Ussaris to repel the Bronze Horde when they swept down from the mountains of Yama. Its time under the control of the Empire is also the only period in recorded history when Cerima was at peace, and when \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0finally fell apart, the armada of tall ships allowed the evacuation of thousands of refugees to safety in Ibetia. As well, the Empire was always especially tolerant towards a nomadic people called the Kermanni, older than even the Roamin\u0027s, who were granted free passage anywhere in the land.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand went up, \u0022wait, why was it called the \u003Cem\u003EBronze\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Horde?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well because Gold and Silver were already taken. And besides, they honestly weren\u0027t very good at the whole \u0027marauding horde\u0027 thing, Kerbals really have no business on horseback.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow a new hand went up, \u0022I heard they all believe in spirits who do housework in exchange for borscht!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At one time, perhaps, but that\u0027s just another fairy tale. A book of Ussari myths and legends would be even thicker than a book\u00A0of Ussari history! It\u0027s often said that the Emperors and Empresses of old were able to amass and maintain such a vast territory because they were mystical beings who could wield objects of unimaginable power. Even more mysteries surround the Kermanni who wandered the land in their brightly-colored wagons, calling them keepers of ancient secrets.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Pfft,\u0022 snorted someone in the back, \u0022so you\u0027re telling us they were \u003Cem\u003Emagical?\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0What a load of--\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd gasped. Wait, when did D.N. get here?

They always have a perfectly rational explanation. For instance, there\u0027s a very pervasive Ussari legend about the huge lake in modern Athiland. Supposedly, it was once a nation that so displeased the Emperor that he called down fire and water from heaven, to gouge it from the face of the planet. And as if that weren\u0027t enough, he used also used his power to wipe the very \u003Cem\u003Ememory\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the place from the people\u0027s minds, so that no one would ever again speak its name.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gathered Kerbals \u003Cem\u003Eooooooh\u003C/em\u003Eed once more.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But if you look to history, a similar tale is also told of the crater off the coast of Dachland, which always had close ties with the Ussaris even though it was never officially a part of the Empire. Today we know it\u0027s an impact crater, and probably millions of years old.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And of course, the most famous Ussari legend is that of Kerblutin, the Mad Monk. He was a friend and confidant to the Royal Family in the waning days of the Empire. According to the legend, he survived numerous assassination attempts until he was finally shot, stabbed, beaten, electrocuted, starved, defenestrated, run over by a carriage, hit by a locomotive, crushed by a falling tree, drowned in molasses, shot some more, hit by an errant foozeball, bitten by a rabid monkey, set on fire, crushed by a stack of newspapers, poisoned, shot some \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E, hung, beheaded, disembowelled, and drawn and quartered.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EOuch\u003C/span\u003E,\u0022\u00A0someone said.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And just before his head died, he was said to have spoken a prophesy: \u0027ye shadow of the first, ye whisper of the second, as empires rise and fall, so shall the revelation of the third bring the end of this age... and bring the hell that waits beyond.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother voice, quietly, \u0022w-what\u0027s that mean?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah haven\u0027t the foggiest.

Yes, ok, like any other empire, even the Great Ussari Empire began to wane. After the Ceriman Crisis, it entered its own period of slow decline, with first this region then that one declaring independence, and hoping, usually correctly, that the Throne couldn\u0027t be bothered to do anything drastic. But with the calamity in Erakonia, it was greatly accelerated. This was a time in global history when nearly everyone, everywhere had grown tired of the very concept of monarchy, and various rebellions and revolutions the world over began to experiment with silly ideas like elected rulers and government by consent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo hundred faces stared blankly at Chadvey. He didn\u0027t seem to notice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyway, by the reign of Emperor Nicholas II, not even the Empire had been spared from such nonsense. Now Nicholas \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0try to make reforms, and he wasn\u0027t really a \u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0ruler, the trouble was he also wasn\u0027t a very \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one. Memories of the misdeeds of Emperors long past melded with the, ahem, enlightened fervor of the day, and it was only a matter of time. One Kerb quickly rose to the forefront, no one knows his real name, but he took the moniker Vladimir Kermin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet another hand, \u0022I thought it was \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKer\u003C/abbr\u003E-\u003Cem\u003Eman\u003C/em\u003E?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good catch, lad. Vladimir was a shrewd old fellow, and by taking the most popular name in the Ussari-speaking world, he became everyone... and also, no-one. And by changing his \u003Cem\u003Elast\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0name, something only Emperors had the power to do, he thus became both \u0027the close kin of Vlad I,\u0027 and also his defier. And when he spoke, \u003Cem\u003Emillions\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0listened. His words ignited a powder keg, culminating in the famous Octember Revolution. Which, by an odd clerical error, actually happened in Septober.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Emperor Nicholas was reluctant to deploy his army against the partisans, and many of his own captains went over to their side. The revolutionaries laid siege to Kermangrad and stormed the Summer Palace, arresting the Emperor and his family after a short skirmish. They were led in chains to the Fortress, and imprisoned in the East Tower there. Which now put the nearly-victorious revolutionaries in a bit of a political pickle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You see, if they simply executed the Emperor, as usually happens in such situations, then he would become a martyr, and possibly inflame loyalist sentiment across the country. But if they just lock away him in prison, then he likewise becomes a rallying cry and a hero to be rescued. And if they banish him instead, well, there was no telling what allies and support he might raise from other nations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And so it was, as Nicholas sat there in his cell, illuminated only by the light of the burning city beyond, knowing that his country sat on the brink of what was sure to be a bloody civil war such as the world had not seen since the Ceriman Crisis hundreds of years ago, that he did the one truly worthwhile act of his entire reign. He rent his own shirt, and using a piece of coal, wrote out a declaration of abdication upon it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Woooooooowwwww....\u0022 the crowd murmured in hushed awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Vladimir Kermin now had his victory, but the question remained of what to do with the former Emperor. In another cunning maneuver, he swiftly crafted a document that came to be called the Agreement, and one way or another secured the assent of all the major factions of the revolution. In the end, Emperor Nicholas would \u003Cem\u003Ekeep\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0his throne, and his head, and his family would be protected from all harm, present or future, lest the document be invalidated. And for his part, he ceded all power of the Throne to a provisional revolutionary imperium, and thus became nothing more than a f--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here, for an instant, just for an instant, Chadvey Kerman stumbled. Only Valentina was seated at \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the right spot, to see his eyes loose focus in that moment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003Efigurehead\u003C/span\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe quickly shook himself, and continued as if nothing had happened, \u0022in the weeks that followed, a nascent government coalesced from the influential, and the imperium became \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethe\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0Imperium\u003C/em\u003E, a ruling body of eight Kerbals who would share authority equally and govern by consensus. Emperor Nicholas, with Vladimir Kermin at his side, would give speeches to crowds of thousands, all across the former Empire, his voice carried by the new electrical amplification technology, urging them to stop using their plough shares as swords, and instead work together for the communal glory of greater Ussari and her national siblings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And interestingly enough, it actually worked, and the vast country calmed. For the first, oh, decade or so, this new arrangement stood as a shining beacon to the world. The Imperium instituted sweeping reforms, addressed centuries-old grievances where they could, and allowed the various constituent provinces to move towards autonomy, turning the old Empire into a loose union of independent states. The economy greatly improved, and there was a chicken in every stall and a mule in every pot.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe paused, and put a hand to his chin, \u0022or was that the other way around?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyways, things \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0going quite well until one fateful fall day. The Imperium, Emperor Nicholas, and most of the Royal Family were enjoying lunch at an open-air cafe in Kerbelsk, celebrating the record-quick completion of the famous Trans-Kerberian Rail Road,\u00A0surrounded by foreign diplomats and press. With entertainment provided by the soon-to-be-famous Trans-Kerberian Orchestra. Sort of a \u0027look on our glorious Union and how well it\u0027s doing\u0027 kind of thing. Some say an argument broke out between Vladimir and Nicholas, but suddenly there was a titanic explosion. Dozens were killed, including most of the Imperium, all of the Royal Family present, many many foreigners, and both Vladimir, and the Emperor. In yet another interesting legend, supposedly there were witnesses who swore to their dying day that it was the Emperor \u003Cem\u003Ehimself\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that had exploded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyways, the young Union was immediately thrown into chaos, and nearly dragged the rest of the world with it. Among the foreign casualties were three Kleptogarti senators and their Secretary of the Interior, the Grand Admiral of the Yaltik Navy, two Yaltik Members of Parliament, the Crown Prince of Omork, and the Archduke of Kerbia. The Ussaris, of course, blamed counterrevolutionary partisans for the blast, but the outside powers blamed the Union, for lax security or even deliberately staging the attack in order to destabilize its perceived rivals. One thing led to another, and for several tense weeks, the whole world teetered on the brink of a war to end all wars. But in the end, cooler heads prevailed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quite literally, in fact, as the weather was turning cold and \u003Cem\u003Eno one\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was stupid enough to engage the Ussaris in winter!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When the outsiders came knocking again the following spring, they found that the entire country had been shrouded in a steel curtain.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand again, \u0022but... wasn\u0027t it an \u003Cem\u003Eiron\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0curtain?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, lad, iron becomes brittle in the cold, and as Ah said, it gets \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0cold in Ussari.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Imperium had reconstituted its self, and found a new Empress as well. By an odd stroke of luck, Nicholas\u0027s eldest daughter had not been in Kerbelsk that day, and along with her own daughter were the only members of the Royal Family to have survived. Well, unless you believe the ridiculously pervasive story that his youngest daughter had also survived, and that in the chaos she was spirited out of the country by agents unknown. But there\u0027s never been any real evidence to support that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe waited for the thoughtful murmurs of the crowd to die down, then continued, \u0022anyways, the eldest daughter was crowned Her Imperial Majesty Alexandra I, and with its power consolidated and its legitimacy secured, the Imperium shut the entire country off from the outside world and struck back hard against anyone within who had \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0challenged them. Thousands and more were arrested and sent off to reeducation camps in deepest Kerberia, or the salt mines in eastern Nihacima, or worse, even a great multitude who had actually supported the revolution. In places, entire towns were depopulated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This dark time came to be known as the Troubles, with only a handful of long-time allies like Gytep and Dachland having any contact with the country at all. So of course the outside world, having no real idea what was going on, decided the Ussaris must be up to no good and further distanced its self from the Union.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The reinvigorated Imperium squeezed the country with a steel fist, dashing any hopes of autonomy and forging all the constituent lands into a new and far more centralized confederacy now calling its self the Imperious Union of Ussari States, with the ideal of uniting all Ussari-speaking peoples under a single flag. The ravaged province of Erakonia had finally had enough, and what had been only quickly suppressed unrest in other lands devolved into a full-blown rebellion. The Erakonians retreated to the rugged and inhospitable lands at the southern tip of the peninsula, and fought back with the ferocity that can only come from a cornered and desperate soul. They used whatever they had, farm tools, sharpened sticks, rocks... they made the Ussaris pay so dearly for every meter of land that the Unionists finally gave up and just left them there. The Imperium considers the area a breakaway province to this day, so when the foreign powers across the Yaltik Sea instantly recognized the weak local government that formed, it did little to help international relations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And of course,\u0022 Chadvey sighed heavily, \u0022there was the matter of the Kermanni. The Union has always closely guarded any information about what really happened, but the most reliable sources say that somehow the Kermanni, \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of the Kermanni, were wiped off the face of the planet, not unlike that unnamed kingdom in Athiland centuries ago. And not even the stringent Imperium suppression could quell the rumor that the Kermanni were betrayed by one of their own, and what a heartless, dark soul that must be.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe let the relation sink in for a few moments, until the murmurs once more died away, before continuing softly, \u0022but, like it always does, time heals all wounds. The Union weathered the Troubles, and its steel curtain emerged from that fire well-tempered and harder than ever before. For a long while, the world outside simply forgot about that enormous blank spot on the map, while the Imperium and the vast resources it now completely controlled fueled the building of an industrial powerhouse to rival anywhere else in the world. Alexandra I had a turbulent and fairly short reign, there in her gilded cage in the West Tower of the Winter Palace, and died rather suddenly when it caught fire one night. She was succeeded by her young daughter, crowned Alexandra II.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The Imperium still holds unquestioned authority over the country, it\u0027s only been very recently that relations with the rest of the world seem to have thawed a bit. Though personally, Ah think it\u0027s better when people talk to each other. Hiding behind walls rarely fosters dialogue, no matter which side you\u0027re on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And what would \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0have to say to all this, \u003Cem\u003EMajor?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 he suddenly turned to Valentina, snapping her out of the daze she had been in. It took a moment for her to recover, as Chadvey looked at her with an softly contemplative gaze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... might have put some things, bit differently, but,\u0022 she slowly shrugged, \u0022I cannot say that you are wrong.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore he could respond, another new hand went up, belonging to one who had the bewildered, cross-eyed look of someone whose brain had nearly reached capacity, \u0022how... how do you know all this stuff?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, well Ah suppose that\u0027s the advantage to being thirteenth in line for a throne,\u0022 Chadvey grinned, \u0022Ah\u0027ve a plethora of resources but few expectations, so Ah like to keep busy.

No one seemed to notice.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey looked out over the crowd, many of whom looked ready to follow the other Kerbal\u0027s example, \u0022now, are there any other questions?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is... there gonna be a test on this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aye, multiple choice and short answer, but you won\u0027t have to know dates.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA collective wave of groans washed over the gathered, and another hand went up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um... do they really have three-foot-long mosquitoes there?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Meters, lad, only barbarians measure with body parts.

I think the early Proto-Kerbals would have spread quite quickly across the planet, and the brighter minds would have realized pretty early on that the world is round (whether or not they would have been burned at the stake for such heresy remains to be seen.

And was \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0raining. First it had rained \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0way, then it was sunny, then it had rained \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0way. Rain was supposed to go \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E, not sideways! She had tried to go outside, and it had rained in her \u003Cem\u003Eear\u003C/em\u003E. So no more of that. Her ears still hear little \u003Cem\u003Esquish-squish\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0noises if she shook her head.\u00A0She even thought that, at one point, it had actually been raining \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd rain was also supposed to be, well, \u003Cem\u003Erain\u003C/em\u003E. It had rained \u003Cem\u003Efish\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Thousands of flopping, gaping, bewildered fish. Then yesterday it had been golf balls. The novelty of watching them ricochet between buildings had quickly worn off, as the constant \u003Cem\u003Eping-ping-ping\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0made sleeping impossible. And now today, it was raining \u003Cem\u003Efrogs\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0The frogs, at least, didn\u0027t seem to mind much, using their webbed feet to sort of glide or at least aim their descent at whoever was unfortunate enough to be stuck outside in this nonsense. Even now, through the window of her room, Valentina could see great masses of them hopping randomly about down below. She was sure she had seen one singing and dancing with a little top hat and cane, but chalked it up to lack of sleep and water in the ears.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, probably.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaining frogs \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seem to carry a certain ill boding with it, though.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed, and stared out the window some more. Burdous\u0027s rocket had been hurriedly returned to the VAB just before the storm. She had the impression that this sort of thing was not unexpected around here. Apparently, weather like this was not all that unusual, not even the non-rain rain. Huge storms like this would regularly sweep in from the sea to the east, get stuck up against the mountains to the west, then sit and drop their rain for days or even weeks on end. It seemed like a very poor location for a space center, equator or not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least the drainage system had been well engineered. There were very few puddles on the concrete aprons, and the rivers of runoff were mostly confined to the streets and walkways. Nearby, street lamps cast pallid, yellowish silhouettes of light in the torrent of droplets and small amphibians. It was midday, but outside looked black as night. This darkness had lingered for nearly three days, now, too, permeated only by the occasional flash of lightning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll boding. Ill boding, indeed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...in the old histories, I found things that were... troubling...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDibella\u0027s words came back to Valentina as she stared out into the gloom. Chadvey\u0027s words, too, had been... troubling. Valentina was no scholar. The whole of her \u0022official\u0022 education had been during her time in the State homes. It was hard to study when much of your time was spent avoiding beatings, or administering them. Even then, she had known well what propaganda was. Her \u003Cem\u003Ededa\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had always been less than forthcoming about \u003Cem\u003Ethe past...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...never, ever make noise...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...see it for what it is.... see, and know...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...do what you must to survive...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee it, then ignore it. Never question, never challenge. Valentina had known well enough that the instructors painted a stilted picture of history, the brave and selfless revolutionaries... the corrupt Emperors... the drive for justice after the former\u0027s betrayal...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EWas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Chadvey telling the truth? He certainly had no reason to lie. She wondered if the instructors here painted a similar picture. Maybe, people were just people, and sometimes did horrible things. But... the stories... the Kermanni... were they really--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe jumped back at a sudden \u003Cem\u003Ethud\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0against the windowpane.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aaaaaaaaaaah!\u0022 Screamed Valentina.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ribbit,\u0022 said the frog.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe frowned, and tapped at it through the glass where it clung by its suction-cup feet. It waggled its gullet at her.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo she sat back, and rested her chin on a hand, \u0022what say you, frog?

Perhaps of a prince, who at True Love\u0027s first kiss, turns into a handsome young toad?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ribbit,\u0022 said the frog.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My \u003Cem\u003Ededa\u003C/em\u003E, he knew many fairy tales. He would tell them to me, on long, terrible nights when it was too cold to go outside, even for him. I thought they were just stories, until a voice began to whisper in my head. I still hear it sometimes, in my nightmares. I try to pretend it is not there. Now, I am not sure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ribbit,\u0022 said the frog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe sighed, and switched hands, \u0022I miss my friends. I miss my home, such as it is. I worry about them. Something is not right there. Something is not right \u003Cem\u003Ehere\u003C/em\u003E. But... somehow... they are different. I fear, if they find each other, something horrible will happen. Perhaps, I am here to find something too?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA shiver rolled down her spine. That odd little ball of vague emotion flared in the back of her mind for a moment, then was still. She pushed the feeling away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A chill. It is said, in the taiga, that when you feel a chill, someone has walked over your future grave,\u0022 she shrugged, \u0022it is cold there, chills come often.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeaning back and stretching, she stared up at the ceiling. The window-frog continued to regard her unblinkingly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I think all these things, then try not to think them. It is best this way. That is what is always said. I wonder, what sort of fairy tales are told in this land? Before I left, someone told me the streets here are paved with gold.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe leaned forward and looked out the window, \u0022they seem paved with water and your friends, at the moment. Streets paved with gold, what an odd thing to think.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hand went to her chin, \u0022or was it paved with cheese?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer belly loudly announced its preference for the latter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ribbit,\u0022 added the frog.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe frowned at it, \u0022you know, your social skills could really use some improvement.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe frog looked at her, croaked loudly, then jumped from the window. Distantly, she heard the muffled, rather distinctive scream of one who had just unexpectedly taken a cold, wet frog to the face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina huffed, and blew the errant lock of hair from her own face. And... there was still the matter of J.R.\u0027s offer. The Kerb could give that frog lessons on sliminess, but... would a consultancy really be so bad? Layland Heavy Industry\u0027s rockets \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seem to deliver on their promises, after all. They had proven absolutely reliable back home, even built under license. And they kept improving. Perhaps she shouldn\u0027t judge the company based on only one of its workers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer stomach grumbled again. When had she last eaten, anyway? Time was strange when it was always dark. She should really go down to the cafeteria for a snack.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, she would have to take the offer through the proper channels, of course. If anything, this J.R. was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0a fool, he would have thought of that. And already have an answer. Would it really be so bad, just offering her input for the betterment of the space program? Dibella. Tercella. ...Sergei.

Her belly grumbled in agreement. She really \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quite hungry. Must be throwing her perceptions off. After all, she\u0027d seen also just seen a singing--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe shuddered, and turned to her plate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA stubby finger poked at the foil.

She gingerly peeled back the layers one by one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBread, stale. Covered in some kind of seeds. Not that unusual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKetchup and mustard. Fair enough, they put ketchup and mustard on \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0here. She was starting to gain a taste for the stuff.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquishy, uneven tomato slice. Far past its prime, but not that bad. You could get tomatoes back home even, if you knew the right people.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLettuce, limp. Not unexpected on a sandwich.

Well, it certainly wasn\u0027t borscht, or even onna stick, but it couldn\u0027t really be \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bad, could it? Deciding the risk was preferable to further hunger-driven visions, she closed her eyes, took a bite...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd instantly, visions exploded across her mind!
