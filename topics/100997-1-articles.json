Primarily the upper craft components designed by General Atomics for NASA use, that should work on the USAF Engines (nearly identical to the \u0022for NASA\u0022 engine designs). I\u0027m basing my parts on compatibility with Nyrath\u0027s Orion drive mod, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28428-Orion-aka-Ol-Boom-boom](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28428-Orion-aka-Ol-Boom-boom)\n\nThey should (mostly) work as normal spacecraft parts as well, although some parts are probably a teeny bit heavier than is normal. It\u0027s that use of inch thick plate steel and almost foot thick plates of depleted uranium shielding and so on that really does it. But apart from an intention to later add internal bomb storage to Nyrath\u0027s engine, I\u0027m not messing with the Orion engine itself.
