I had an instance where an IVA I made wouldn\u0027t show up even though I had done everything that tutorials had said, and it wouldn\u0027t complain about it in the log. It turned out that I had forgotten to change the name parameter to a unique name causing the model to not display.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that I would suggest double checking the path to your model, though I would think that it would complain in the log if it couldn\u0027t find the model.
