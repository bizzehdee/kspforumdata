I had an instance where an IVA I made wouldn\u0027t show up even though I had done everything that tutorials had said, and it wouldn\u0027t complain about it in the log. It turned out that I had forgotten to change the name parameter to a unique name causing the model to not display.\n\nOther than that I would suggest double checking the path to your model, though I would think that it would complain in the log if it couldn\u0027t find the model. That\u0027s all I can think of at the moment. Hope it helps."},{"CreatedByName":"E.Nygma","CreatedById":104703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:27:24Z","Content":"Hi squiggsy,\n\njust to make sure: every mesh with a collider is a single unity game object?

A thing to note:\n\nAny mesh collider which is not marked \u0022convex\u0022 will fall through the ground instead of colliding with it. A obvious problem with this is that you can\u0027t pass through a part which is supposed to be open in the middle unless it\u0027s collider is not \u0022convex\u0022. There is a simple way around this. Split the model in blender into convex hulls, then each part in unity gets its own convex Mesh collider. \n\nWelcome to the modding addiction!"}]}
