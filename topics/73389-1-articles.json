I landed on Minmus and then I took a break and turned off the game. Today when I went back to that mission it\u0027s like there is an old control node target stuck on my ball and I can\u0027t set any new nodes. There are no markers where I can open and remove the old node. I\u0027m trying to redock with my lab but with out the ability to set a control node and predict an intercept I don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to get back.
