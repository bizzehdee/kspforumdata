They just do not do so. Perhaps this is a result of a lot of people not interested in anything and the governments not wanting to fund stuff which no one is interested in. In fact, many countries do not even fund their own infrastructure properly, because some people fear taxes more than anything else and do not want to see where this kind of behavior leads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
