They would have likely flown painted white, maybe with the orange and gray striping, but the Advanced Booster Competition was called off in 2015.  It is clear that NASA is still planning to use Advanced Boosters for the Block 2 SLS and their images show what looks like a monolithic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I can\u0027t find anything where they have accepted new proposals for Advanced Boosters so I don\u0027t know if those images represent a proposal, or just to show that the advanced booster (whatever they ultimately are) will be different from the Shuttle-derived 5-segment SRBs.\n\nSo, the short version (sorry for being long-winded) is that the Advanced Boosters in the mod are not (to my knowledge) going to be the boosters that will ultimately fly on the Block 2 SLS, and I like the black SRBs, I think they make the SLS look cool.  Also, having another large, white \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E in the parts list could confuse things more.
