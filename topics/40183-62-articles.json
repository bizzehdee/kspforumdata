The plan is still to integrate MCE with the new KSP economy system. This will most likely mean a complete rewrite of Mission Controller actual Budget system to work with the in game system. And from what I have read about the plans for KSP contracts, might mean a complete redo of missions and contracts for MCE. I would like MCE to move on to the future KSP by bringing a little more complex Budget system to KSP then might be delivered with KSP. This also will most likely mean that the old .sp system will be no more and MCE in whatever form its in will use KSP persistent file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorse case: The developers of Kerbal Space Program make such a awesome Budget and contract system MCE is no longer needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost Likely Case: The developers make a similar system that is simple in design just like science system.
