As soon as the velocity relative to the target gets close to 0 the target and anti-target vectors get deactivated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any reason for this?

If it says \u0022Orbit\u0022, of course you will not be able to point to a target. You need to set your navball to \u0022Target\u0022 and then the Target/Anti-target buttons should appear again.

I\u0027m quite capable of playing ksp. Here are two screenshots to clarify my point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the bad lighting, but that is the only craft currently in orbit that is capable of showing what i mean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, in the first picture, the pod has a relative velocity of 0.2 m/s. The Prograde and Retrograde markers are inactive. That is correct since at low relative velocities the vector is not clear (As already mentioned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second picture, however, is taken moments after. It shows the same craft just slowed down the remaining 0.2 m/s of relative velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs can be seen the target and anti-target markers are also inactive. Hence making it impossible to tell SAS to point at the target although the target as well as anti-target vectors are clearly and uniquely defined and present in the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/o2Zau\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
