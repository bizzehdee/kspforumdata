If the game is good enough in graphics for me to play it and it\u0027s the bets game around I\u0027m fine with it. I don\u0027t want a movie I want a game. In my opinion their is more character development in the campaign of Star War Battlefront II than their is in Ep VIII. All we see is a loser\u00A0Luke. Luke is the hero not some couch potato! I mean he has become a farmer. Not study the force be just farms milk and awaits his death. That\u0027s what he hated uncle Owens farm. He is worse than Vader in his depression and PTSD and Vader killed children and his wife who he killed the children for! And why because some student with \u0022raw power\u0022 aka Disney needs a successor to being the most powerful dark side user knocking him unconscious and kills his academy? What could like have\u00A0done he was injured! Luke knows this! So instead of helping fox the galaxy from the evil of the first order he retires. The first order is the Empire! He gave his life, his hand, his strength, his freind Biggs and much more to defeat and he goes and retires. If their is one this ep 4-5-6 shows us is that Luke will seek revenge he isn\u0027t like the Jedi of Old. Even if he didn\u0027t think like that then and went to Ach to he learned it then so he would be comfortable using the dark side to destroy the first order. Again Rey just gets lucky and has \u0022Raw Power\u0022 again Disney just needs a lead charchter who is powerful. They don\u0027t develop Rey\u0027s character nor snokes, nor leias, Finn, Poe, or really anyone else accept destroy the one character left. Disney is so eager to dispense of the older characters because they actors are getting old and are scared one might die like Carrie fisher. And I understand that but they don\u0027t give anyone a heros death. From 4-6 Han went from their and scoundrel to compassion and hero and then now in 7 he is bad to his old ways because his ship got stolen... really. Chewbacca gets no freinds or backstory, Luke also follows Hans path and becomes some loser of a Island. Leia becomes some\u00A0Commander of a force that will never beat the First Order without more help. We don\u0027t see any charachter development. No reason for Rey\u0027s power but luck.

Some people have more force than others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s fine, but if you do that, follow through with story. Some being are then objectively better than others. Substantially better. In the Lucas universe, there are wizards. They can be improved via going to Hogwarts, but they are none the less wizards, and vs muggles, muggles lose, every time. That\u0027s the Lucas universe, and both sides are therefore bad, IMO. Instead of good vs evil, it should shade things more, since the Rebellion is only one bad wizard away from being the Empire by a different name---a civilization run by the tiny minority who are wizards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first movie mentioned the Force as somethng more democratic. Something everywhere. It gave the impression that everyone has it, or at least implied that. Han ddin\u0027t have it because he\u0027s a skeptic, not because he literally didn\u0027t have it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but mitoclorians need training! Again I don\u0027t care if she is that powerful by episode IX but see is that powerful at VII. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s not possible in Star Wars but I mean it\u0027s 1 in a thousands of trillions Chance. I mean Anakin needed training right? He had a prophecy and the highest amount of mitoclorians ever. He wasn\u0027t just lucky he was the chosen one. So why is Rey this powerful for no reason she isn\u0027t the chosen one so why would the force let her be that powerful. If she can split a cliff down the middle why just not split kylo in half? My point is the force wouldn\u0027t let her be that powerful. Why doesn\u0027t she just kill Anakin in the force and take the place as the chosen one? BECAUSE SHE ISNT!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes the force is a lottery but not the power ball. You can win up to so many mitoclorians. You can\u0027t win a billion just maby a couple hundred or thousand. Their like the convenience store sratch\u00A0tickets only award up to some much. It isn\u0027t some powerball where you can hit a jackpot. The only time you get the jackpot is if you have a prophecy like Anakin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean mace winds had less mitoclorians but could beat Anakin in Ep III why because he had training and could beat him because he MASTERED Vapad. Anakin was untrained in it so he would have lost. So why does Rey who is just a nobody get that lucky in such a crucial time in the galaxy she wasn\u0027t born during stability but unrest. I mean it\u0027s like she couldn\u0027t have been born during a more crucial time to the galaxy with that much power. It\u0027s 1 in a thousand times trillion chance of her power let alone the time she was born. No body is that lucky.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-29T21:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWookipedia has nothing about training being required.
