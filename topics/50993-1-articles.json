However it can lead to the weight sometimes being more then it actually is; there are a few parts (the strut connector and fuel line to start, but a few surprising ones like the octagonal strut) that have no weight despite one being listed in the tooltip. In fact they not only have no weight they have no drag either as for performance reasons they have been marked as insignificant in the physics engine. However they are already light to begin with, and are usually used in such a way that their total weight is a very small fraction of the crafts total weight. I usually check my final weight on the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T02:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother trick you can use in conjunction with those already listed: You can multiply the total mass of your ship by 10 (actually 9.8, but 10 is a nice, round number that\u0027s easy to remember) to get an estimate of the amount of weight (remember, \u0022mass\u0022 and \u0022weight\u0022 are different things) you\u0027ll need to overcome when placing your engines. The \u0022Max Power\u0022 value for each engine that\u0027s listed in the VAB will tell you how much force each one generates in thrust, and you can then add your thrust up and compare it against the weight to see if your engines will actually lift the rocket off the launchpad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, if you divide your engine\u0027s total thrust by your craft\u0027s weight on Kerbin (that\u0027s where the 9.8 comes into play -- 9.8 m/s^2 is acceleration due to gravity at Kerbin\u0027s surface), you\u0027ll get what is called a Thrust-to-Weight Ratio, which is a simple way to tell whether your rocket will lift off, and how quickly it will do so. If it\u0027s under 1, you won\u0027t lift off at all, at least until you\u0027ve burned off some of your fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T10:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb has helpfull lists saying exactly how much your rocket weights for each stage, and how much ThursttoWeightRatio it has\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lojik","CreatedById":83883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-29T11:47:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother great tool is kerbal engineer redux.
