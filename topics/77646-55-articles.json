By clever thermal design \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACdescribed below, and using tricks like rotating your craft to distribute heat more evenly and using insulation, you can cut this to a range of -100 C to 100 C. This is still outside the range most off-the-shelf electronics can handle. If you minimize your radiative properties (choosing white or reflecting casings)\u003Cp\u003Eto reduce both heating due to the sun and re-radiating that heat in the dark, and you assume there is some on-board heating of your components due to being in use, you can achieve a temperature range of -30 to 90 degrees as typical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAssuming a 10cm x 10cm Cubesat profile, that means it gets about 14 Watts of direct heating on its surface [in the sunlight] \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it sounds like we are going to need MUCH more thermal control than the \u0022typical\u0022 cubesat, since we probably need to keep the moss between -- at the most -- 0 and 25 C, and probably between something like 10-25.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T14:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022henryrasia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022henryrasia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUntil then, however, we\u0027re starting with a LEO cubesat with an \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E scientific experiment so we can make the most out of it AND maybe hitch a free ride from NASA, cutting ~$60k from the costs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell then, you have a problem. Or two problems, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst one being that the experiment you propose was already done in space, including by far more in-depth and interesting analysis than anything you proposed here. It was \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/515797main_UN-HSTI_research_accomplishments_overview_compressed.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edone more than once\u003C/a\u003E, on far more interesting topics than just \u0022growth\u0022. One interesting fact here: ill-fated Columbia (yes, the one) took moss in Petri dishes analyzing it\u0027s growth in space: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/01/030115065325.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/01/030115065325.htm\u003C/a\u003E (if you really want to know - \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.spacetoday.org/SpcShtls/ColumbiaExplosion2003/ColumbiaExplosion.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emoss didn\u0027t survive\u003C/a\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I very much doubt that sending moss in space and snapping some photos of it would in any way increase your chances of having a free flight. You don\u0027t even have any idea of which aspect of moss you\u0027d like to study, not to mention anyone with education background in biology to at least make you some ground work on a topic. What you are doing is not an \u003Cem\u003Eactual\u003C/em\u003E scientific experiment, it\u0027s just an excuse to send a cubesat into space. An excuse that might not really work well, as your project in it\u0027s current form will most likely be perceived as nothing more than a private mexican company wanting to pull off PR stunt for US taxpayer dollars (yea, sounds harsh, but people judging your project won\u0027t do you any favors either)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd secondly - that excuse is very fault-prone. You rely on many very crucial components working in extreme environment with no experience working with any of them. I\u0027m not really into the whole cubesat hobby thing, but I heard about simpler and more reliable cubesat-based experiments failing (read about PW-Sat and it\u0027s failed solar tail experiment). You should really read stuff about KISS rule. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
