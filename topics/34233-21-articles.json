Worries have begun to arise that unless serious measures are taken, Kerbin\u0027s orbit may achieve Kessler Syndrome and permanently ground the entire Kerbal race. Given this, KerbComm has been working on a prototype automated salvage vehicle designed to retrieve hazardous debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KC-122 Automated Salvage Vehicle Prototype, affectionately dubbed Janitor, is a second generation salvage vehicle prototype, designed to rendezvous with debris and dock a probe core with it allowing remote control of wreckage. The current design features 8 autonomous probes, 4 of each of the 0.5 and 1m universal docking ports, as well a single 2m docking port on the janitor itself. Both the main vehicle and each of the 8 service probes mount sustainable power reserves and an internal supply of monopropellant for autonomous operation along with a processor capable of controlling any functional systems on docked wreckage. Salvage probes, while not primarily designed for it, can also be used to control intact vessels if the situation is deemed too hazardous for a pilot. The second generation prototype also mounts a hitch-hiker storage container after the shocking number of hulks found with barely living crew inside over the course of the MKI\u0027s testing. Unfortunately, the Janitor is currently only capable of linking to debris with at least one active docking port, but the MKIII is already in production and is hoped to be a major breakthrough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Janitor is currently under lease by the spiritwolf corporation to aid in salvage and recovery around Laythe, saving KerbComm the costs of field testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vrVgghZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vrVgghZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IjXp5PK.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IjXp5PK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull launch documentation: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/r79sw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/r79sw\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/767ggvbfcmdmpax/Janitor.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/767ggvbfcmdmpax/Janitor.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devland99","CreatedById":73224,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T21:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion, how do I import an image from steam \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mygnol","CreatedById":74949,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T22:37:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.21\u0027s finally out, so Macey can get his ships now \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHe bad news is, my Sentinel (and in fact all my ships) now suffer from such a bad case of jittering due to the new ASAS that if I don\u0027t do anything during burns it rips itself apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itisdearflinch","CreatedById":32704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T23:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have just completed a Laythe capable heavy fighter, but there is no justification for my company to have built or deployed a fighter.
