New to KSP, started with 1.0. Have landed on Mun and Minmus several times, opened most of the tech tree, put multi-part stations in orbit round all bodies in the Kerbin system and sent unmanned probes to Duna and Ike. Now it\u0027s time for a manned mission. That\u0027s where I need your help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve built the below rocket based on an Apollo-like mission profile - orbital rendezvous around Duna with separate landing and return stages. Basically there are \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStages 1 and 2:\u003C/strong\u003E asparagus staging in two pairs, 4x Mammoth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 3:\u003C/strong\u003E central orbit stage, 1x Rhino. Combined Dv in Stages 1-3 = 4599m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 4:\u003C/strong\u003E transit stage, 1x Rhino. Transit Stage Dv = 2591m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStage 4 contains the following components:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EA science pod\u003C/strong\u003E containing the science bits too heavy to bring home easily, ie the Science Jr. and Mystery Goo. Equipped with 2x parachutes. Does not need to return to orbit. Dv = 999m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EA lander\u003C/strong\u003E, crewed by two Kerbals and equipped with a pile of science components for surface exploration and 4x parachutes. Needs to make planetfall and return to orbit. Dv = 2274m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EThe command \u0026amp; return module\u003C/strong\u003E. Should be able to make LDO without expending any Dv (that\u0027s the job of the transit stage), so just needs to return to LKO, where it will dock with my orbital station.

Carrying too much mono-propellant has an important impact on your delta-v budget.

I really like the science pod and service bay idea. Pretty new, though maybe not as impressive as packing in years of science in one service bay (credit to a redditor: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I4ry59F.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/I4ry59F.jpg\u003C/a\u003E ), but it\u0027s pretty good. Though I do suggest to edit your config a bit because the 1.0.2 aero is a bit.. soupy. In other words, entire stations will survive reentry (except for hitting the ground), and shuttles touch down at 25 m/s. Of course, the 1.0 atmo (what I\u0027m using now) is, IMO, a bit too light since you can lift around 60-100 tons into orbit with 3 of the tall kerbodyne tanks and one of the 3.75 m 4 engine cluster kerbodyne engines. But hey, I also started halfway through .90, and I\u0027ve only been on the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Dres, and Gilly (I returned a kerbal from all of them except gilly), so take this with a grain of salt. Also, I like how you used a Soyuz-style rocket for an Apollo-style payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
