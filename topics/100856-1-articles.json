It had done stuff in the kerbal system, but wanted to go further. Since interplanetary missions are not ready (wrong alignments) and kerbal space-plane technology was underdeveloped, Project Pogo was made. It\u0027s mission was simple, get a kerbal in orbit around Kerbin with a space-plane. The craft: a single seat thing. It was a delta wing biplane. An interesting choice. It was powered by a single RAPIER engine with 1000 units of fuel. (Including oxidizer) Between the wings were structral wings type D, connecting them. The pilot sits in a Mk 1 command pod. Bill also snuck a pillow aboard, as he claimed later he found the seat very uncomfortable.![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n Everything went well, until it didn\u0027t. The ascent was without hitch, besides for the confusion over RAPIER controls. He was in orbit, triumphantly saluted a salute no-one saw, because he was very high up, and began to de-orbit. He had aimed to come down near the KSC. His plans kind of failed. A reaction wheel mishap delayed de-orbiting and so he realised he would overshoot, into the sea! Bugger... So, he came up with a stupid plan which would probably fail, he took some snacks out of his pillow\u0027s secret compartment, ate them, and then burned retrograde. (We put a camera in it, but we forgot to turn it on before) He ran out of fuel.\n\n He made another plan, equally stupid, but still had bad odds. He attempted to maneuver and glide down to the KSC. at 40,000 meters, this was a bad idea. He gave it a go though, and put the airplane into a crazy spin, which he only managed to stop at 2km above the sea. Now, he hoped to stall the airplane at a low speed like 30 m/s, true it would make most stuff blow up, but the command module would survive with some other things. His plan was working, until the plane began to nose up uncontrollably, stall and spin. He knew he could not right it in time and made the famous statement, so common for Kerbonaughts: \u0027This might blow up.\u0027 He was the first. Bill Kerman bailed out with his pillow, and hoped the explosion would cushion his fall. He prayed a silent prayer as he thought he would blow up too. (A prediction that, in that predicament, you would make too. Unless you are Jebediah) He watched his silly looking plane tumble into oblivion beside him, hit the water and fall apart. All but the 4 radial intakes blew up. Bill prayed, and God answered him. He survived! He watched as drunken Mr Physics made the intakes bounce on the water. They showed no sign of stopping. He quickly gave out a distress call. \n\n The first mission was led by Jebadiah, who flipped the boat, which then proceeded to jump until Jeb flipped it again. Everyone agreed he was too silly. Bilvey and Merson, (who were veterans, Bilvey had been to the Mun and Minmus. Merson had been to the mun twice and piloted a plane to the north pole) tried next. They succeeded, but panicked when an intake nearly hit their boat. Getting Bill, they headed back so quick that Bill fell over and got his face stuck in the esky and Bilvey fell on his back, bounced and fell on his front!\n\n Epilogue:\n\n Bill Kerman was among the great Kerbals of Jeb, Bilvey and Merson. He was a hero. Legend says that those intakes are still there, jumping around. No-one is brave enough to go however. So it will probably never be known.\n\n![USmUfSH.png](http://i.imgur.com/USmUfSH.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T22:45:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 10:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CrazyJebGuy**"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:19:55Z","Content":"I was thinking about pogo stick at the beginning, lol!
