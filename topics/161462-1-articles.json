I searched the available mods list for the 1.3 KSP release but found none, maybe I missed it, maybe it exist but is not updated for 1.3 yet or maybe it doesnt exist anyway. I also searched the forums and internet but found nothing similar. Can you help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first one is a mod that allow me to have group of buttons in the screen that I can associate with the functions, Like a antena button that raises all antenas, or a fairing button that will eject itonce I click it and soo on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second is a mod that would let me calculate trajectories while I am in space to land in certain parts of Kerbin. Also a mod that allow me to calculate projections while in launch pad to reach low orbit objects (for example rescue missions) or to calculate a sub-orbital parabole to land on a specific area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T15:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst one: ActionGroupsExtended is the closest thing I can think of. It gives you up to 250 action groups to work with. You have the option of displaying the action groups with customized names. Clicking on them will trigger the group (because groups 11 and up do not have hotkeys assigned by default; you can assign them however.) You can even edit groups in-flight rather than just in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrajectories would be the one to look at for landing on atmospheric bodies as it takes into account drag, though it assumes a few things (mainly \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E; there are settings to adjust that and get a better prediction.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if either have been updates to 1.3 yet. (I wait after a major update to let modders get up to speed before I even think of updating myself.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last\u00A0set is harder. I don\u0027t know any mods that calculate trajectories like that from the launch pad. GravityTurn and MechJeb can get you into space easily enough, but direct interception/rendezvous launches I have yet to see a mod for. Mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E give you the info you need to figure this out yourself to some degree. (Mainly the phase angle.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSub-orbital hop trajectory planning\u00A0I haven\u0027t seen anyone attempt a mod for. (Has far as I can tell, most people just use a plane instead after a certain point on Kerbin and wing it on non-atmospheric bodies.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"felcas","CreatedById":178312,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T19:17:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223077607\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022161462\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221496418073\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022139783\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StahnAileron\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, StahnAileron said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst one: ActionGroupsExtended is the closest thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrajectories would be the one to look at...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply I will check the ActionGroupsExtended as soon as it release for KSP 1.3\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried Trajectories but it is not exactly what I am looking for, anyway it caused crashing to desktop problems with \u00A0KSP 1.2, I can try again when it release for 1.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"felcas","CreatedById":178312,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-02T19:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone else want to contribute, I am gratefull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-03T17:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing you are looking for is far more complicated than you think it is, because there are no universal answers to questions of trajectory.
