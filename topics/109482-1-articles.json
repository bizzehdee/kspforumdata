So heres my problem. I want to take a rover to the Mun, so Ive built a \u0022lander\u0022 with my rover attatched to the bottom (this lander is only for test purposes on the launchpad). Im using a 0.01 force decoupler to break the rover away which works fine.....the rover lands on the floor and sits there. However, I cant seem to take control of the rover? I have an OKTO 2 pod on it as shown in the pictures yet, even taking Jeb and sitting him on it I cant control the rover. Is it me doing something wrong or.....?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/2i26b2f.png\u0022 alt=\u00222i26b2f.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/9hi5w0.png\u0022 alt=\u00229hi5w0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T08:30:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn case you haven\u0027t done it: Try the bracket keys [ and ] to change active vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I\u0027m a bit slow.
