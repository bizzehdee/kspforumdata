If the throttle is at 0% it will stop increasing the overheat but won\u0027t come down, and if the throttle is slightly above 0% it\u0027ll still increase the overheating bar.\n\nHow to reproduce: Having the same OS can help (that doesn\u0027t seem to happen in Windows). Also it doesn\u0027t matter if I use the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of KSP.\n\nBuild a rocket, in my case I build one with the following parts:\n\n- 1x Stayputnik Mk1\n- 1 Advanced Reaction Wheel Module, Large (for stability)\n- 4x Rockomax Jumbo-64 Fuel Tank (to give time to the engine to overheat)\n- 4x AV-R8 Winglets (for control)\n- 1x RE-M3 \u0022Mainsail\u0022 Liquid Engine (to overheat it)\n\nAny ideas, workarounds known for this issue?\n\nResources:\n\n[KSP.log, Screenshot and Craftfile](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7e3hugtvt46ks29/AADdkXtvWV5PI1DDO6vzPi5ia?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T09:38:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nakara**\n  \nQuestion solved"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T08:22:09Z","Content":"Hi Nakara, please try replacing your physics.cfg with the one [**here**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread!#linuxthread03), and if you use links to start the game try starting KSP using the KSP.x86 or KSP.x86\\_64 instead."},{"CreatedByName":"Nakara","CreatedById":89316,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T09:38:07Z","Content":"Hi there sal\\_vager,\n\nThank you very much for your response!
