You have a rover and you send it to a different biome. You collect a shed ton of data. For obvious reasons, you don\u0027t want to hike all the way back to the mothership. Therefore you have to transmit it to KSC. Boom. Half your precious science lost. Alternatively, you could be presented with an option to beam back to the mothership (or any other craft within a preset 3D radius) with no loss in worth. You could also have other bands, say 500km-1000km you lose 10%. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T14:38:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExploitable.
