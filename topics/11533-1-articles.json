The best approach is to put a set of 4 controllable fins at the bottom and another 4 at the top, that was the ASAS gets the maximum force possible in all directions."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T07:47:40Z","Content":"ASAS and \\*perhaps\\* one set of fins will be sufficient, so long as you put an extra standard SAS module or two every stage. More will only be beneficial, so even 3 can be used per stage. Just remember that they do weigh a fair bit, so don\\\u0027t go overboard or you aren\\\u0027t going anywhere. With this, you\\\u0027ll only really need RCS for turning the rocket manually, and to stop it turning after a manual turn. That way, you can minimise the amount of RCS fuel tanks you have to slap on the rocket."},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T08:44:51Z","Content":"SAS is really only useful for large spacecrafts that need attitude control while thrusters are off. They\\\u0027re quite heavy and impose a noticable performance penalty on your boosters. You\\\u0027re much better off using that gimballed LV-T45 engine for attitude control on 2nd stage. Strategy I used to use is:\n\n(Assuming stage 1 means \u003C20000m, where air is dense enough for fins to work)\n\nStage 1 attitude control - fins attached to stage 1\n\nStage 2 attitude control - LV-T45 gimballed engines\n\nSpacecraft attitude control - Command pod reaction wheel \u002B SAS (if large ship) \u002B RCS (if huge ship and I have RCS fuel to spare for the mission).\n\nNowadays I fire my stage 1 and 2 together in parallel with fuel crossfeed from stage 1 to stage 2, as a result I don\\\u0027t even need fins anymore on stage 1 since stage 2\\\u0027s gimballed engine will provide enough attitude control for the whole stack before stage 1 separation.\n\nYou wouldn\\\u0027t want to use purely LV-T45 for first stage though because it has poor thrust to weight ratio, LV-T30 or Aerospike with fins is fine but a mixture of LV-T45 with non-gimballed engines with no fins or SAS at take off results in the most efficient rockets."},{"CreatedByName":"Millst0ne MK II","CreatedById":13384,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T10:10:56Z","Content":"How about a picture of your rocket.

Hold book out and move the book left or right. You can keep spinning around by bringing the book to the centre of gravity after you can\\\u0027t reach any further and then extending to the side you started from. By using weights you could turn the ship too."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T12:12:29Z","Content":"Aye, as what-the says, it employs a device using an electrical motor (as described briefly by Temstar) to alter the craft\\\u0027s rotational momentum by an application of the conservation of angular momentum. It\\\u0027s used to keep satellites and telescopes in particular orientations as well as slowly turning them. \n\nAnd while \u0027magical\u0027 is an apt description, it\\\u0027s just basic physics that can be demonstrated as what-the outlined. In the absence of a swivelling chair, you\\\u0027ll see similar effects on anything that spins -- for example, ice-skaters can control the speed of a spin by bringing their arms in close or flinging them out wide as they spin. And no, air resistance will not account for all that, before you ask."},{"CreatedByName":"xclusiv8","CreatedById":20567,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T14:00:53Z","Content":"Super cool :-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T14:04:22Z","Content":"There are two elements required:\n\n- a control computer (ASAS) and \n\n- some sort of physical system to control the rocket\\\u0027s attitude: either RCS, SAS, or winglets.\n\nASAS on its own is just a computer. If you don\\\u0027t attach an RCS, SAS, or winglets, it won\\\u0027t do anything. In the absence of an ASAS, the RCS, SAS, and winglets also react to manual controls.\n\nSAS works like a gyroscope. This is how you can control a spacecraft without RCS, even large ones. The ISS uses multiple gyros to maintain its orientation, not RCS thrusters. SAS does not control anything by itself. They really should have called it a gyro, so as to reduce confusion, because that is how it works."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-28T15:14:03Z","Content":"Yah, what they all said above.
