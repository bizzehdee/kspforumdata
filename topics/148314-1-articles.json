What you need is an adapter part that surface attaches on one end and has a node on the other. Very common choices are Cubic Octagonal Struts, in Precision Engineering, or the Radial Attachment Point, in Specialized Construction. Both are tier 6 tech nodes. Either part will do the job. You surface attach two of them to the bottom of the tank, creating two nodes where none were before (well technically you have three now, together with the tank\u0027s own node). Then you attach a pair of Skippers to those new nodes. Finally, use the offset tool to tweak the exact position of the engines to get the look that you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Once the rocket part revamp comes along, in some version after 1.2.0, you\u0027ll no longer need intermediary parts; you\u0027ll be able to switch the Skipper to a \u0027slim\u0027 model without its large base but with surface attachment capabilities, and then just stick a pair of them directly onto the tank.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-22T07:55:31Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2016 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
