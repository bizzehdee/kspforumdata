More a hobby/completionist thing than a real need.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSearching about it, i found that the bare minimum is the radius of the planet/moon. I\u0027m trying to use two sets of 3, the first set at 45\u00BA, and the other at -45\u00BA. Or both 45\u00BA\u00A0with LAN 0\u00BA and 180\u00BA. Forming a \u0022X\u0022,\u00A0each satellite apart 120\u00BA, with one RA-2.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsing Kerbin as an example, it would be 600 km. I tested it and it didn\u0027t felt right. The lines between the satellites goes too close to the planet, and vessels on the surface need angles too step into the horizon to have communication. Any increase in occlusion and it stop working.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tested 720 km ( x 1,20 the radius), it became better, but with 6 satellites there are blackspots. They can be in the poles, or in the tropics, depending how I release the 2 sets. Making some tests, I found that 5x the radius is what looks better and somewhat more realistic, the angles in the horizon\u00A0are far\u00A0better for the vessels in the surface. For Kerbin this is 3000 km. It felt much more right, and I\u0027ll probably keep it for Kerbin and all the bodies. With a simple Communotron 16 I can get 100% signal anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo you guys think this altitude is simple a waste of resources, or it is really more realistic?

For example, on a perfectly even sphere, a trio of satellites passing directly overhead ensures that you can always see at least one of them - regardless of altitude. Meanwhile, if you have some steep mountains and valleys, even six satellites in the same orbit passing directly overhead may not be enough unless the altitude is really high (for example, geostationary). That\u0027s why designing for 100% coverage is a fairly tedious and resource-intensive task; try limiting yourself to 99.9%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe really interesting points are those furthest away from the orbital plane of your satellites. For a low orbit constellation consisting of sets of polar satellites, they will be along the equator in between where the satellites pass, and these spots may shift over time if the satellites\u0027 orbits are not perfectly in resonance with the planet\u0027s\u00A0rotation (see: sun-synchronous orbit). For equatorial satellites, they will be on the poles. Conveniently Kerbin\u0027s poles are flat as a billard ball, and so a trio of equatorial satellites will not have any dead zones on Kerbin\u0027s poles above a certain altitude. On other celestial bodies, like the Mun, this is an entirely different story; no amount of equatorial satellites will manage to cover the Mun\u0027s poles adequately, regardless of altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T13:18:48Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 01:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-08T13:55:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBearing in mind I use RemoteTech so might be slightly different to standard...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Kerbin I use a 4 satellite network at about 780km, as this\u00A0rather conveniently gives me a 1.5 hour orbital period which is nice and easy to remember when setting them up.\u00A0 This gives a decent clearance above the horizon to allow for a reasonable amount of drift, and 17 years in to the game I\u0027m now thinking about needing to move them a bit, but Iv\u0027e still got full coverage around thee equator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has some useful info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Satellite_Coverage\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:Satellite_Coverage\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-08T15:20:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223289384\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170611\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221518095914\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why designing for 100% coverage is a fairly tedious and resource-intensive task; try limiting yourself to \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhen needed\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs perfectly viable to start with a basic network \u0027full of gaps\u0027 if you can get signal often enough and long enough to do the necessary manoeuvrers/transmissions for your mission.
