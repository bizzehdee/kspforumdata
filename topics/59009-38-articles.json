The Universal Storage versions of many parts seem to be strewn about the CTT tech tree almost at random. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn\u0027t even find several of them - until I started hunting in the config files, and even then I ended up having to look in the KSP log to locate the module manager patch that was actually responsible for placing the US parts where they are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are science wedges for rockets doing in aircraft parts nodes like subsonic \u0026amp; high altitude flight, specialized flight systems, and heavy \u0026amp; experimental aerodynamics, when the parts they supposedly contain are in totally different (and far more sensible) science-related nodes? Why is the RPWS wedge in Actuators while the normal RPWS is in Space Exploration, along with the barometer? And why is the Accel/Grav wedge in Advanced Unmanned Tech, which you can also get without picking up either of the stock devices it combines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s almost as if they were moved out of the sensible nodes listed in the default patches on each part \u003Cem\u003Epurely for the sake of placing them in different nodes\u003C/em\u003E in the CTT version of the tree... Not that some of the normal tech tree locations for the US wedge versions make significantly more sense. Normal GORESat in Advanced Electrics, with the US version in Precision Engineering with the SALLI instead? Why not put the US version of each part in the same node as the normal version, in both versions of the tech tree? I can\u0027t see any benefit to splitting them up. It seems to me that it\u0027s just a recipe for unnecessary headaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t get me wrong, I absolutely love this pack. This was one of the first mods I looked for when I got back into KSP shortly after hearing it had finally hit the \u00221.0\u0022 release and playing stock for a while to get used to the various career mode additions I\u0027d missed in recent versions. You\u0027ve done so much exceptional work on all of these great parts, and all the standard versions of the parts seem well placed in the tech tree. And I love the models and animations for extending the GORESat and telescope from the US wedges! It just seems like the tech nodes for US versions of the parts could be more sensibly chosen, for consistency\u0027s sake. If nothing else, it would\u0027ve avoided the frustration and confusion I just went through trying to figure out \u0022what was wrong with my install\u0022. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T07:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022smjjames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022smjjames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThey\u0027re still in the science section, I can see them with Universial Storage.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo they exist without the universal storage parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squeaky","CreatedById":132315,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T08:47:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENoob question, are the universal storage experiments supposed to show even if you don\u0027t have universal storage? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS scares and confuses me and my laptop is already having a brain haemorrhage with the amount of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks DMagic, great mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:36:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WeirdCulture\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WeirdCulture\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edo they exist without the universal storage parts?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Squeaky\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Squeaky\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENoob question, are the universal storage experiments supposed to show even if you don\u0027t have universal storage?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. Universal Storage science parts require Universal Storage to work at all.
