I can\u0027t believe this. How could they screw up something so easy?\n\nDid you guys see the limit on how long each fairing segement is? It\u0027s ridiculous! Even if they couldn\u0027t fuse the segments together, at least let them be longer than **one meter!** :mad\n\nAlmost as disappointing was the Flea booster, which is *another* 1.25m SRB instead of a much more useful 0.625m one. They also decided to nerf the already useless RT-10.
