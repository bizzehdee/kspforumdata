You might be able to make a mod (dll type mod) to give you the same effect but I haven\u0027t seen the idea mentioned much less implemented - may be some difficulties involved as there seems to be a constant interest in the idea of Lagrange points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-23T00:45:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/23/2016 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by wasml\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
