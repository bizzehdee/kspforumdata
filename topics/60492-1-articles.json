Considering most of the experiments have return values (that you can stuff in a command pod), there is already value to returning your Kerbals and their pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT I do like this idea as a random goal somewhere in the system.

It\u0027d be too easy to miss. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that it shouldn\u0027t be too easy to find. Maybe limit it to planets with atmosphere or enough gravity to pose a challenge in returning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reward should determine the difficulty.
