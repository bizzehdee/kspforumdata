A few suggestions if I might:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, everything I\u0027ve read suggests the lean/rich dichotomy is the opposite of that: vacuum engines (with high expansion ratios) run leaner than sea-level engines. (Only counterexample I\u0027ve found: Titan.) Also, even sea-level engines tend to run a little lean, especially staged combustion ones, and hydrolox engines *always* run lean since you gain more in density than you lose in efficiency (the range of mixtures for hydrolox is about 5.7 to 6.3 IIRC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027d recommend swapping NTO/AZ50 for HTP/Kero for aerospikes, since the latter is often proposed (though IMO wrongly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E) for SSTOs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, if you want additional flexibility it\u0027s pretty trivial to add support for fourth or fifth or...etc. configs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Fourth: what did you think about only using UDMH, not MMH or AZ50?
