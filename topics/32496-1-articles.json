I have to say that I love the community this game offers, but it really is my dream game. I get to sit around and make rockets and aircraft and then see if they\u0027ll fly? Superb! I\u0027m really excited to see this game develop as the developers slowly add more and more to it, I heard rumor of a better aerodynamic model and can\u0027t wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods I\u0027ve tried so far are mind-blowing; MechJeb, Lazor, Sunbeam (my personal favorite method of handling debris), those robot arms, Bussard RamJet thingy, omg! The one mod I\u0027m looking for and haven\u0027t found yet is some sort of robot building pack. Just a collection of telescoping arms, motors, cogs, pivots, etc. would be perfect. I have a copy of Blender but not much idea of how to use it, tried Wings3D (much easier) years ago but apparently it doesn\u0027t support the right file type. In short, I\u0027m not a great 3D modeler without AutoCAD, but if anyone wants to tackle this I would be willing to help out with planning, testing, and maybe even texturing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-12T07:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
