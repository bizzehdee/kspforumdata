The documentation he\u0027d gathered for Edgas was incredible in both scope and breadth. \u0027A few thumb drives\u0027 turned out to be several boxes full of them, each one meticulously labeled, categorized, and ordered. It would have been reams and reams of paper if people still used actual paper. What a silly thing, printing documents on paper. Bureaucracy could be so much more expansive and overbearing when it wasn\u0027t limited by physical resources. Bureaucrats, \u003Cem\u003Epfft\u003C/em\u003E. But if not for the bureaucracy, Edgas wouldn\u0027t have this trove of information before him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet, the more he read, the more confused he became. The magnitude of it all was simply staggering. The Company was woven into it all like a thick rug, and it lied like one too. But... Layland-Wutani had violated the import/export, banking, tax, health and safety, manufacturing, and traffic laws of no less than half a dozen countries just to build this ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine and technology parts had been built in Ussari, along with most of the launch vehicles. The electronics in Gytep (all the best cheap electronics came out of Gytep these days), the structure in Itsuania, the hydrogen tanks in Cocomor, various minor bits in other nations, then all of it shipped though the Straits of Kerfrica right under their noses. Everything traveled halfway around the world, through the Andacanian Canal then somehow into eastern Cerima,\u00A0to an equatorial launch complex not far from the coast that none of the locals on either side of the border seemed to notice. That much, at least, wasn\u0027t a stretch. The hodgepodge of duchies, provinces, theocracies, and plantain republics collectively known as \u0027Cerima\u0027 changed governments and allegiances more often than they changed their underwear, and generally for the same reasons. It was easy enough to get away with shenanigans there, the locals had more pressing matters to worry about than huge rockets launching every few days. But the Andacanians tended to be rather testy about such things. They must have been very well paid to ignore rockets overflying their sovereign territory and dropping toxic spent stages on their sacred fishing grounds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was the bit of weirdness vexing Edgas at the moment. Why would the Ussaris go through the trouble of securing a launch facility near the equator in the first place? They already had a formidable space center. It was at such a high latitude it could only launch into high-inclination orbits, but with a ship with such a ridiculous amount of delta-v available, why would that matter? He rubbed his temples.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then, of course, there was the larger befuddlement. The one that made his brain hurt, and his eyes water. The one he was no closer to understanding despite hours pouring over extensive documentation. The Company was dirty, no doubt about it, but... it wasn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E dirty. Misappropriation of funds, mild embezzlement, good old-fashioned fraud, and gratuitous employment of hired goons. Typical greedy multinational conglomerate type stuff. But there was no grand plot, no vast conspiracy, no evil scheme. At least not that Edgas could \u003Cem\u003Esee\u003C/em\u003E. It was maddening. And then the icing on this dirt cake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was all so \u003Cem\u003Esloppy\u003C/em\u003E. The boxes of virtual documents demonstrated that. Everything was hidden, but it wasn\u0027t hidden \u003Cem\u003Ewell\u003C/em\u003E. Even a casual audit should have uncovered something, and something should have led to something else, then the whole mess should have come crashing down... Only it never did. Any time a whisp of attention was directed its way, it just... dissipated. Like the proverbial fart in the wind. Edgas shook his head. People would be transferred, or reassigned, or simply disappear altogether. It was all just so damned... convenient. Why no, Mr. Inspector, there\u0027s no need to investigate the radiation coming from that freighter there, paperwork\u0027s all in order you see, just rubber dookie bound for Bylia, here, have some money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was always lurking, just beneath the surface. Hidden, but only just enough. Always \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E. A veneer of legitimacy, a veil of plausible deniability. A house of cards that should collapse at the slightest breeze. It was like... like...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like a scapegoat on a leash,\u0022 Edgas said quietly. He was sure that someone, somewhere, was having a grand old laugh over all this. Edgas wasn\u0027t laughing though. Buried in all the documents, all the forms, all the requisitions, all the applications, all the CF-7501\u0027s and THX-1138\u0027s, was a single news article. It stuck out like a bloodied thumb, and it twisted his innards to read it. \u0027Young female found murdered,\u0027 was the simple headline, probably buried in the back between sports scores and launch manifests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Female identified as A. Kerman found dead in alley,\u0022 the article said. It went on to use words like \u0027slashed\u0027 and \u0027stabbed\u0027 followed by a nauseating number. Edgas had tried to read the details, but couldn\u0027t bring himself to. Not with that picture staring back at him. It was Anastasia, Billy\u0027s sister.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E...I will \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Estab\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E you with this...!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas shook his head. He closed his bulging, red-rimmed eyes, and rubbed the wide, flat spot between them. Somewhere distant, reality creaked. It couldn\u0027t be, just a virtual news clipping and a comment taken out of context. Burdous certainly didn\u0027t like \u003Cem\u003Ehim\u003C/em\u003E, but that didn\u0027t make him... make him--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThe Hand of the Kraken\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas blinked.

Burdous. There were reams on him, too. On... well, \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E, too. He was brilliant, no doubt there. His career as a Kerbonaut was accomplished, if not remarkable, but his prowess was engineering. He\u0027d written several papers on the practical applications of fission fragment and induced fusion engines, all praised but mostly ignored. Six months after the ill-fated M\u00FCnbase mission, at \u003Cem\u003EEdmund\u0027s\u003C/em\u003E behest, no less, Burdous and Jerdous had been assigned to Ussari as part of the Kerbonaut Exchange program, as liaisons for the Administration and goodwill ambassadors. There, Burdous had found fertile ground for his ideas on advanced nuclear propulsion, and the Company had been happy to fund them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA potentially ground-breaking interplanetary propulsion system paid for by someone else? The Ussari leadership were only \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E happy to give their assistance, and keep it a secret until the right time. Keeping secrets was easy in that part of the world. In Ussari, atom splits \u003Cem\u003Eyou!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous was indeed a well-traveled anthropologist. Seeing his evidence in writing, all with meticulous notes, footnotes, cross-references, and concordances, was all the remaining convincing Edgas had needed about their, well, quest. It seems Jerdous had had an epiphany of sorts out there in the desert. Several years before Chadvey\u0027s M\u00FCn landing, Jerdous had uncovered the tablet, visited the temple, and begun piecing the story together. He\u0027d spent years traveling the globe between Corps assignments, ostensibly for \u0027life science and archeological\u0027 research. Chadvey\u0027s discovery of the seal had been the linchpin, the final piece. Since then they, along with Burdous, had been working in the shadows, trying to discern the Kraken\u0027s true nature, and ultimately to hatch this grand plan to secure the other seals. And whatever else they were going to do out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey\u0027s story, well, it pretty much checked out. He\u0027d played the part of the intrepid Kerbonaut hero, shaking hands, making useful friends, and opening doors. Then finally, as a deputy flight director, had put the resources of the entire space program at their disposal, if surreptitiously. He\u0027d been quietly pulling strings all along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOf course it checks out\u003C/em\u003E, a voice inside said, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003EChadvey\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E had Jerdous gather the documents. You\u0027re being fed.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas pushed the thought away. Ugh, but this was exhausting. And always the final variable: the unknown adversary. His (her?) prints were all over the paperwork too. Back and forth, cat and mouse, move and countermove. Whatever the three tried to do, this force worked against them. Sometimes they won, sometimes not. For the moment, they did seem to be ahead. But there was still something wrong, Edgas knew he was missing something. No matter how hard he tried, there was some connection his brain just kept missing. Every time he thought he was getting close, it slipped away like a shadow at the edge of vision. It was infuriating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sighed, and set his tablet down. That was enough for now, anyway. He\u0027d agreed to go meet with Burdous for a briefing on how to monitor the engine, so he could take his turn standing watch. This would be \u003Cem\u003Eoh\u003C/em\u003E so much fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA thought lingered as he opened his door. They weren\u0027t ahead, they were being driven.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a trap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas shuddered.

A leftover, from an ancient asteroid impact. They built a huge tunneling machine to mine it, but it broke down after it hit an old water pipe. But asteroids are rich in it. That\u0027s why the Company bothered to privately fund a grand tour. To locate and catalog more sources. At least that\u0027s their reason on paper. If they land a Kerbal somewhere, they can claim ownership. They\u0027ll claim the entire solar system. And if anyone protests?

It had been days of nothing but more of the same, pouring over documents, eating space food, watching the engine do nothing, and putting up with Burdous. Jerdous at least was cordial. And Chadvey was, well, Chadvey. It all confirmed something Edgas had expected for a long time: interplanetary spaceflight was incredibly boring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe turned and looked out the window. The stars never changed either. The ship held its course like a mountain. There was no sensation of speed, no stars streaming past the window. He knew there shouldn\u0027t be, of course, but some part of him still seemed to expect it. For days now, they had been constantly accelerating, going faster and faster. In about another day, the massive ship would slowly turn and begin decelerating. Within minutes of the engine first firing, the ship had taken the title of the fastest thing ever made by Kerbal hands. They were now traveling at \u003Cem\u003Eseveral thousand kilometers\u003C/em\u003E every second. Nearly ten times \u003Cem\u003Egalactic\u003C/em\u003E escape velocity. He knew it was just a number, but it still boggled his mind in that sciencey way he found he still loved. And terrified him too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous had already briefed him on the lander in the pressurized cargo bay. It was a fairly small thing, designed for landing on tiny worlds like Bop and Pol, they\u0027d had to modify it to fit four. Four EVA suits were also stored in the bay, fully fueled for their low gravity excursion. Edgas had never been to Minmus, of course, but he knew the gravity on Bop would be similar. He had listened intently to the others describe the difficulty of moving about on the surface. They would probably... need..... to..... use..........\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy was that light red?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-30T05:34:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/30/2017 05:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 30, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T11:20:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo worries - that\u0027ll just be the escaped Red Matter floating loose behind the control board.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAdversary238","CreatedById":138827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T16:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how many of these folks have kids.

Beyond the orbit of Dres now? He wasn\u0027t sure. He turned, and searched for Kerbin. It took him some time to find it, just an unremarkable pale blue dot. So far away.

It wasn\u0027t much, but it had lights, a video camera, and rudimentary instrumentation on a heads-up display.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Be careful,\u0022 Jerdous this time, \u0022there\u0027s nothing really to tether to until you reach the tension cable, but there\u0027s plenty of hand holds.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got it,\u0022 Edgas switched on his helmet lights, and carefully pulled himself out of the hatch. He could see the stanchion for the tension cable just across the hull of the engine room. It was a long way to pull himself untethered. Strapped to his back where he could just barely reach it was a meter-long section of insulated pipe and a valve assembly. Strapped to his chest was a repair kit with tools. Moving was extremely awkward, on top of the difficulty of the pressure suit. Edgas set off, cautiously moving from one rail to the next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous had talked him through the repair procedure, reality wavering all the time, while Chadvey had put a quick bandage on Jerdous\u0027s head. It sounded simple enough, just unbolt the damaged pipe and bolt in the new one, then repeat with the valve. Getting there was going to be the hard part. Half a kilometer hand over hand. Edgas paused for a moment to get his breathing under control. Only a few meters and he was already winded. He looked out at the stars again. Far off, he could easily see the milky white smudge of another galaxy, barely visible on a clear night back on Kerbin. Supposedly that galaxy was due to collide with their own in a few billion years. He absently wondered if the ship was\u00A0heading that direction and might get there first if he failed. He pushed the thought away, and set back to crawling across the hull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edgas? How are you doing? Your heart-rate\u0027s up,\u0022 Chadvey sounded worried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m ok,\u0022 he panted, \u0022almost there.\u0022 He reached the bottom of the stanchion. It was little more than a braced girder jutting ten meters out from the side of the ship. Three of them were arranged around the junction between the superstructure and first hydrogen tank. The cables stretched to the other end near the engine, creating tension and stiffening the structure. Supposedly. Edgas took a breath, and started pulling himself up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly the stars evaporated and the sky went pure black. Edgas instinctively raised a hand against the sun peeking over the radiation shield at the back of the ship, but even that seemed dim and insignificant. He closed his sun shade, and climbed on, away from the small comfort of the hull. Finally he reached the top, but his grip slipped and he kept going, momentum carrying him past the end of the strut, pirouetting him around. He struggled to keep a hand hold, his grip slipped again, then at the last possible second he stretched out his other arm and clipped the tether to the cable just as his other hand slipped off. He let out a sharp cry as he drifted off the structure before the tether snapped taught.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What just happened? Video feed went all wonkie.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m ok,\u0022 Edgas grunted, gritting his teeth, \u0022I\u0027m tethered, moving down cable now,\u0022 he then set to the arduous task of pulling himself down the thin cable. He very quickly realized it was futile. The thin suit tended to balloon and made any movement difficult. Trying to pull himself half a kilometer like this would exhaust him, if he even made it. He paused, panting, and watched a droplet of sweat floating inside his helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edgas? What\u0027s your status? Your vitals are all over the place.\u0022 Jerdous again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This isn\u0027t gonna work. Stand by I\u0027m gonna try something.\u0022 Edgas swallowed hard. The thought of voluntarily letting go horrified him, but if this didn\u0027t work... He switched on his tiny attitude thrusters, took a firm grip of the cable, and \u003Cem\u003Epulled\u003C/em\u003E. The force launched him down the cable, his tether sliding along it, keeping him from floating away. He gingerly adjusted his attitude with the suit thrusters, trying to stay in control but use as little fuel as he could.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022W--what\u0027s going on? I can\u0027t see, everything\u0027s jumbled.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas ignored the comm for the moment. It took all of his concentration to stay on course... but it was working. He glided along above the cable, nearly motionless, occasionally giving it a tug to recover speed lost as the tether clip dragged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, I\u0027m approaching the other end.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Already? How did you..?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Standby,\u0022 Edgas said. He wasn\u0027t about to have a repeat of the first stanchion. He switched off his suit thrusters, and slowed himself carefully as he reached the end of the cable.\u003Cem\u003E Almost there\u003C/em\u003E, he thought to himself. A check of his fuel supply showed it\u00A0only down 10%. Then he carefully unclipped the tether, and made his way down the stanchion to the maze of pipes and conduits at the base of the enormous circular radiation shield that now towered over him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, I\u0027m on site.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All right lad, well done,\u0022 said Chadvey on the radio, \u0022now, it\u0027s a bit of a mess up there but Ah think Ah can point ya to it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas looked around, \u0022you won\u0027t have to, I can see the leak from here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? That circuit should be voided!\u0022 Burdous could just be heard in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Go ahead then,\u0022 Chadvey said, but be careful.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy,\u0022 Edgas began making his way toward the thin plume of vapor emanating from the mass of pipes. As he approached, it trickled off to nothing. He could see the extent of the damage even from some distance. Several square meters of insulation had been blown off, \u0022you guys seeing this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jool\u0027s jewels, that\u0027s what I was afraid of!\u0022 swore Burdous, \u0022we\u0027re gonna loose a ton of efficiency. Can you see the failure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas began crawling over the exposed pipes, \u0022think I found it, do you see?\u0022 Burdous let go with an impressively awful curse this time. A meter-long section of pipe just past a valve had split down nearly its entire length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Burdous is, er, indisposed at the moment,\u0022 said Chadvey. Burdous could be heard yelling in the background. Something sounded like it shattered. \u0022Best take it one step at a time lad, let\u0027s get that pipe replaced.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy,\u0022 said Edgas. He snapped his tether to a nearby handle, followed by the tool kit, then set to work unbolting the damaged pipe. It was exhausting, hand-cramping work. Getting torque to the bolts without proper foot restraints proved difficult, and he could only reach the bolts in the back by feel. He also had to avoid the obviously sharp edge of gleaming, jutting metal where the pipe had ruptured. After what seemed like forever, he had managed to free the damaged pipe, collecting the nuts and bolts in a tethered bag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Got it, it\u0027s loose,\u0022 he gasped, \u0022what do you want me to do with it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t have any tools for a proper analysis,\u0022 Burdous crackled in his ear, \u0022hold it very still in front of you for a moment... ok turn it... now try and get the inside, right there, that looks good. I\u0027ll look over the footage later. No sense bringing it back, just give it a good throw away from the ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Understood,\u0022 Edgas turned, braced his feet against the hull, grabbed his tether and pulled it tight for support, and gave the old pipe a mighty shove. He stopped, for a moment, realizing the gravity of what he\u0027d just done. He, Edgas Kerman, had just launched the what was effectively the first intergalactic space probe, \u003Cem\u003Eby hand.\u003C/em\u003E He watched the pipe as it sailed away. He looked again at the white smudge of a galaxy in the distance, and the hint of a smile cracked his lips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it was back to work. The replacement pipe went in somewhat easier, then the valve remained.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We copy that it\u0027s done, Edgas,\u0022 said Chadvey, \u0022stand back, Burdous will test the connection.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas moved away from the joint, re-securing\u00A0\u00A0his tether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ok, I\u0027m clear.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing appeared to happen. He knew that was actually a good sign, then noticed vapor around the valve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you see that?\u0022 Chadvey said. Burdous was letting loose another string of curses in the background.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I see it, I\u0027ll try to see where it\u0027s coming from.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA pause, and then, \u0022ok, the line\u0027s voided.\u0022 Edgas carefully approached where he\u0027d seen the leak. The foot of the valve was buried in the shadow of the plumbing, and he couldn\u0027t get light on it. He was at the very end of his tether.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ack, I can\u0027t get a good look from this angle. Let me switch places, I have to untether.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Be careful, the lines should be clear but you already saw residual off-gassing before.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Copy,\u0022 Edgas unclipped his tether, and cautiously moved toward the valve. His breathing thundered in his ears. Almost... there. He could see it once he was over the top of the valve and could get some light on it, a hairline crack where the housing met the footing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We see it too,\u0022 Jerdous this time, \u0022that line is clear. Burdous is going to cycle the valve open, then you should be good to remove it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately, he\u0027d brought that spare, the bolts didn\u0027t look too hard to get to and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe felt like he\u0027d been gut-punched. The whole world went white.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Edgas! Edgas, you\u0027re off structure!

Suit fuel still at 70%. He reached back, fumbled, pulled the auxiliary battery, tossed it roughly backwards, did the same with the emergency O2 bottle, the tools, threw out the superfluous. He gingerly corrected his aim, and fired his suit jets. 60%...40...20...10... There, the ship was getting bigger again. He drifted, slowly spinning, ignoring his attitude, just tiny corrections to his course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We see you, you\u0027re coming in fast, you need to loose speed.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENot enough fuel for that\u003C/em\u003E, Edgas thought.

The impact wrenched his arm, but somehow he held on. He flailed, struggling against the cable as it oscillated up and down its length, finally grabbed hold with his left hand. He pulled himself close, wrapping a leg around it for good measure, then finally clicked his tether back on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were happy cheers and questions on the radio, but for the moment he didn\u0027t hear.

There must be more than one bad valve out there.\u0022 There was a slowly spreading wet spot on his bandage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous studied the floor as he spoke, \u0022as long at the pipe holds, I can just bypass that entire section. We\u0027ll loose more efficiency, and power. Have to turn around now and start decelerating, extend the approach by a couple of days, and make a very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E close pass of Jool. I can reconfigure the containment fields into a radiation shield, that\u0027s part\u0027s easy. But we\u0027ll only be making a couple of hundred gigacraps, two-fifty at the most.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas crinkled his brow, \u0022what \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E a gigacrap, anyway?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous looked at the ceiling, \u0022it\u0027s a measure of induced secondary fusion in a hydrogen-boosted fission system. Named by Dr. Fermi Kerman after he discovered the phenomenon, accidentally.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChadvey clapped Edgas on the back, \u0022Ah\u0027ve heard spaceflight described as hours of utter boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror, or was that aerial combat? Anyways, thanks to you, lad, that\u0027s all this was. A moment of terror, not a real setback. We\u0027ll be back underway in no time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas grinned awkwardly, \u0022uh, could you guys give a minute? Bit damp in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJerdous winced and put a hand to his bandaged temple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on, lad,\u0022 said Chadvey, taking him by the elbow, \u0022let\u0027s get you patched up proper, now.\u0022 They floated up the ladder toward the medical bay, leaving Burdous alone with Edgas. He just stared for a time, giving Edgas that intense considering look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nicely done,\u0022 he said flatly, then floated up the ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas sat and thought, still covered in a sheen of sweat. His heart had finally stopped pounding. Exhausted as he was, he didn\u0027t notice the small canister of Goo peeking out of the other suit. It was glowing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-07T22:47:39Z\u0022 title=\u002202/07/2018 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T12:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edont think I didn\u0027t notice the bible reference In there \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreat chapter going close to jool eh?
