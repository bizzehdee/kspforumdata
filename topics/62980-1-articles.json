I find it really useful to run the rocket engines alongside the turbojets at part throttle, especially when the twr\u0027s not so high. I couldn\u0027t do that with the Rapier engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you can achieve roughly the same result with more versatility from a turbojet and one of the little rockomax engines, which works out lighter too.
