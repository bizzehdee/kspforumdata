Although it makes perfect sense to put Manned Pods much latter in the tech tree, some mods might actually require that you have early access to manned space craft or make it a whole lot easier. At least SETI has the advantage that is a total conversion, meaning it can actively anticipate these problems and give implement alternative solutions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI m planning to make all the old SETI-BalanceMod tech tree changes in the new SETI-CommunityTechTree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus repositioning the parts of many other mods. The CTT itself is, like with the old BalanceMod, just the fallback for mods which are not directly supported.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: I tried to circumvent this by default as much as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example the CTT adds the \u0022simpleCommandModules\u0022 node for capsules between the Mk1 and the Mk1-2. Since I wanted to introduce the Mk1 where this simpleCommandModules node is in the CTT, there would not have been a differentiation by default.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I moved the simpleCommandModules node up to the 90 science tier and retitled it (no renaming) and introduced a new earlyCommandModules node where it was before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich provides the desired progression even if the inbetween pod only supports CTT and not SETIctt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to something I forgot to mention:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I changed the probe progression and the location of many science parts, imho it would make sense to rebalance the science rewards with the SETIctt, instead of the whole SETI-BalanceMod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that science gain and science spending is handled by the same mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also miss the telemetry and surface sample from LordAurelius (which would fit perfectly in the now empty unmannedTech node, so that no required node would be empty when using stock only, except for the first nuclear one).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T21:41:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yemo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T22:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EWARNING\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E edit: resolved\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the SETIctt, please stay with the CTT 2.0 for the moment (old version can be downloaded from kerbalstuff from \u0022changelog\u0022, if you already installed the new one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem at the moment is, that CTT 2.1 reintroduces enhancedSurvivability, which was already reintroduced by SETIctt 0.8.0 as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will correct this compatibility issue with the next SETIctt version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T01:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yemo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T00:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Yemo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t really tested my science tweaks in 1.0 yet, but the one time I loaded them up they appeared to work.
