The problems arise while still in atmosphere, at 7000-1000m altitude (the point where i try to do the gravity turn). The problem is that the rocket either \u003Cstrong\u003Ekeeps\u003C/strong\u003E turning to the right, and/or the rocket\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ebends\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0at a point just below the lower most service bay, and gets uncontrollable from that point on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCargo weight: 1.6t\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoal: geostationary orbit (2863km orbit) (for continuous LKO scansat coverage/satellite linkage)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve used this rocket before for smaller payloads without a problem. I tried everything, other types of wings, change thrust limit and fuel amount of the SRB\u0027s, strutting everything, etc., but unfortunately \u00A0to no avail. The previous payloads where in the range of 0.5-1 tons, this payload is only slightly larger, so i don\u0027t think it\u0027s because of the weight of the payload?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy restrictions: i play science mode and have not unlocked everything yet (see picture of what i have unlocked). Also, i try to build rockets with efficiency and economy in mind. Also, i try to not load launch parts of the payload with multiple rockets, because of \u0027economy and efficiency\u0027 (i do this because i play career mode also and wouldn\u0027t want to develop \u0027bad habits\u0027). I tried with SAS both on and off, but no success. The biggest problem is the rocket bending at the previously mentioned point. Also, i tried deploying the fairing while in flight and i saw the payload bending too, just at the point where it is attached to the main rocket. I tried strutting the payload to the inner side of the fairings, but it didn\u0027t make my rocket and flight stable. I basically tried everything in my current possibilities (even the bigger sized fuel containers and bigger sized liqued fuel engines (see the tech tree for an overview of what i have available), but still no success :(.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mods: KER, KIS, KAS, SCANsat, TACLS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not know what to do anymore and it has halted my game progress and enjoyment.

Basically, you should initiate the gravity turn right off the launchpad. A couple of degrees, and then let gravity (and your aerodynamics) do the rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt takes a bit of practice but with a normal, nose-heavy rocket with the fins you have on that rocket there, you would be able to start the gravity turn, keep SAS off and do nothing other than press the space bar a couple of times, turn SAS on at about 30km, and find yourself in orbit. Obviously, having the HEX core helps since it can follow prograde and lets you get away with a less aerodynamically stable ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the fairings complicate that, not because they produce drag but because they produce lift. Therefore, if you start turning at 7000m you have a massive lift force pushing the nose of the rocket perpendicular to the airflow. Impossible to survive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with fairings you really do have to keep exactly on prograde to avoid this problem. You want prograde to drop gently down, and once you are going fast in the atmosphere you have zero options for altering course: you must get the turn right before you\u0027re going more than about 180 m/s. And you certainly want the HEX or better probe core because you really need to let SAS follow prograde and do nothing but that until you\u0027re over about 35km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne good rule of thumb is to turn about 5\u00B0 at about 100 m/s, but the actual angle will completely depend on your TWR and aerodynamics. More TWR and less draggy ship = much slower drop to the horizon, so you have to turn much more aggressively off the launchpad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T04:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a few things:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots of verbiage below, but first and foremost:\u00A0 How is it possible that that ship is only 80.4 tons?\u00A0 It\u0027s got four Kickbacks that ought to be 24 tons each.\u00A0 Are you running the Kickbacks without a full load of fuel?\u00A0 Is that on purpose?\u00A0 Is it possible you accidentally reduced the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efuel content\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E when you were trying to set the thrust limiter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, on to the advice:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, that payload is the poster child for Thing That Wants to Bend In Half.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSmallest stack radius?\u00A0 Check.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLots of short flat things stacked in a row, so there are lots of bendy floppy joints?\u00A0 Check.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMassive draggy thing on the top, to make it all sway around like a bobblehead?\u00A0 Check.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIcing on the cake:\u00A0 The whole shebang mounted atop a 0.625m docking port, i.e. the single bendiest joint in KSP?\u00A0 Check.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThose are far, far more batteries than you need, anyway.\u00A0 The radially-attached 400EC batteries are plenty.\u00A0 Just get rid of all those stack-mounted 200EC batteries, you don\u0027t need them.\u00A0 Also, flip the science payload around so the engines \u0026amp;

it means you\u0027re lugging around 1.5 tons of empty fuel tank and another more-than-a-ton of engine for a long part of your ascent.\u00A0 A better ratio is something more along the lines of 2-to-1 or 3-to-1.\u00A0 So, for example, consider making that 1-ton tank into a 4-tonner, then get rid of one of the 4-ton tanks in the stack below it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote:\u00A0 For aero stability, vertical stacks of tanks are your worst enemy, since they drain from the top tank down.\u00A0 That moves your CoM rapidly downward, and your rocket can become unstable.\u00A0 So it\u0027s best to avoid vertical stacks when you can.\u00A0 If you must have one, there\u0027s one trick you can do to help it a little:\u00A0 disable the top tank in the VAB, which forces the bottom tank to drain first.\u00A0 It means one more piece of micromanagement during the launch sequence, since you have to remember to enable the tank when the one below it is nearly empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the SRBs.\u00A0 That rocket seems far over-supplied with SRBs.\u00A0 They\u0027re great off the pad, but they have crappy Isp and you shouldn\u0027t rely on them to take you to orbit.\u00A0 Those Kickbacks are \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efar\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E too much SRB for that rocket; they\u0027re making up the large majority of your rocket mass.\u00A0 Suggestion:\u00A0 Replace the Kickbacks with Thumpers.\u00A0 That would bring the launchpad weight down to around 46 tons (if I\u0027m correctly visually estimating), which means that a quartet of Thumpers set to around 70% thrust or a smidgeon lower would give you a reasonable launchpad TWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice that you\u0027re using a combination of your liquid-fueled engine \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eand\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E your SRBs off the pad.\u00A0 Don\u0027t do that.\u00A0 To get the most dV, you always want to burn your lowest-Isp fuel first.\u00A0 Since the SRBs have a much lower Isp than your liquid fuel engine, you should lift off using SRB power \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eonly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and don\u0027t activate your liquid-fuel engine until the SRBs burn out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T04:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to add to Snark\u0027s excellent advise above, the fairings have a pretty horrendous bug where they apply their lift/drag forces waaaaay out in front of the rocket.

using SRBs alone, and I have no problems with control.\u00A0 A very modest amount of torque authority from reaction wheels is plenty-- e.g. a single 2.5m wheel for a 2.5m stack, or a single 1.25m wheel for a 1.25m stack (or none at all, if it\u0027s a small vehicle and has a command pod on it).\u00A0 If the rocket is very big and unwieldy (i.e. using Kickbacks on a ship that\u0027s over 100 tons on the pad), I may put a couple of AV-R8 winglets on the bottom of the longest-burning SRBs, on the north and south sides of the rocket, can help with pitch control.\u00A0 But for anything up to mid-size rockets, a few Basic Fins for stability are all that\u0027s necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe key is to start the first bit of the gravity turn very early, like practically right off the pad; I generally give the first eastward nudge when it\u0027s going no more than 20 m/s.\u00A0 It takes a bit of practice to gauge the right amount of nudge, because at that early stage just a small difference in the early nudge can make a huge difference in the later part of the gravity curve.\u00A0 One thing that helps is that I keep a religiously constant launchpad TWR of 1.5, which means that all my rockets, big and small, follow a fairly consistent launch profile, making it easier to judge the gravity turn with practice.\u00A0 The key point, though, is that the first nudge is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E small that a very modest amount of reaction torque is plenty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to put some perspective on what I mean by \u0022modest amount\u0022:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy typical rescue-a-kerbal-from-LKO single-passenger rocket is a three-stager consisting of:\u00A0 #1 Mk1 pod, 2-ton tank, Terrier; #2, 4-ton tank, Swivel, four Basic Fins in an \u0022X\u0022; #3, two radial Hammers.\u00A0 It lifts off on the Hammers alone and doesn\u0027t touch the Swivel until the Hammers burn out.\u00A0 No reaction wheels at all, and no control surfaces; the torque on the command pod is plenty to start \u0026amp; tweak the gravity curve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example:\u00A0 a typical heavy-lift vehicle has a bottom booster stage that\u0027s a Big Orange Tank with Mainsail, surrounded by eight Kickbacks in two symmetry groups of 4.\u00A0 One of those 4-groups of Kickbacks has AV-R8 winglets.\u00A0 No reaction wheels on the booster stage.\u00A0 Lifts off on the Kickbacks alone, all it needs is the four AV-R8s plus the small amount of torque from the upper stage to steer it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe moral of the story:\u00A0 do a very tiny (and just-right) amount of steering right at the start, and the gravity curve takes care of itself and needs practically no steering at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(That said, I suppose it\u0027s fine to start the LF engine together with the SRBs, if the throttle mostly stays at 0% and it\u0027s only used in brief blips to help make minor steering corrections.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

Especially if the payload does not exhibit almost equal length and width, because fairing has to occupy a whole cross section area of a circle, it may increase the area by a lot. An example: if payload is 2.5m-sized with additional 2.5m-sized parts placed 2x symmetry, cross section area is 3*pi*1.25^2=14.7m^2. However if a fairing is used, then it has to be at least 3.75m in radius to cover the thing. That makes it pi*3.75^2=44.2m^2. This means unless fairing can bring down the (average) drag coefficient by 70% or more, you\u0027ll see increased drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if cross section area doesn\u0027t change too much, then I do see a decrease in drag, especially with 1.25m-sized rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-06T02:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222443900\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457225374\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022142946\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FancyMouse\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, FancyMouse said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the advantage of firing both LFO and SRB at launch is\u00A0controlling the TWR at the end of the stage.
