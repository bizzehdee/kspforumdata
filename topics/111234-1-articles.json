I am been playing Kerbal Space Program for a very long time, and see myself almost as a veteran, with landings and returns from most bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut even still, I just encountered a problem. It might be something that I have overlooked, but nonetheless I have a hard time figuring it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I attach kerbals to specific parts, it is usually not a problem. But the problem here is, that I have 3 of the same landing capsules, and I need tourists in 2 of them, and 1 empty. I am making this a multipurpose rocket, for sending tourists into space, while also recovering a vessel \u002B kerbal. But I can\u0027t seem to figure out, which one is which, as it doesn\u0027t highlight them as I hover over the slot. One could assume that the lowest slot, is also the lowest capsule in the rocket, but with more complicated rockets/capsules, I just don\u0027t think that would be sufficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could of course do some testing to figure out, which capsule they are in, but I really can\u0027t bother to go through that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture to help clarify my issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1369.photobucket.com/albums/ag229/The-MathMog/screenshot27_zpsljzkqs7w.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot27_zpsljzkqs7w.png~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I wan\u0027t them in the lower two capsules, is because I wan\u0027t to send them straight back to Kerbin as I reach orbit, while being able to proceed with be rescuing mission!

That is a good idea. I will try that. Would be nice if they added a simple glow around the part, when you hove above the slot. Would make it a lot easier, visually to determine where to put them \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
