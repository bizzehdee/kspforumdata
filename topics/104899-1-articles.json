Two opposite brakes will be open, and the other two will be closed. When you enter the atmosphere and find yourself going too fast, you can open up two more brakes and further slow yourself down. But if you\u0027re going too slow and heading too far down, you can close the two open brakes and lessen the drag. Assigning the action groups might be tricky, but it could be very useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if it\u0027s feasible or not, but I\u0027m definitely going to try when 1.0 is released!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T01:59:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense. Although a simpler way would be to put all your brakes on one action group, then open and close them as needed during the maneuver. Your way would work too, and probably look more interesting too. Normally I do this with wings, by changing pitch to control drag, a-la the space shuttle. But a small capsule could use air brakes to get a similar effect.

Generally depends on how Squad is going to implement airbreaks, FAR e.g. nerfed them quite heavily at one point, mostly for realisms sake, since they could brake a plane better than wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-25T02:15:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2015 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T04:41:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am a glider pilot. When landing the standard practice is to run 50% spoilers during approach and landing.

It would make it so that you\u0027d rapidly speed up or slow down to a certain equilibrium speed whenever you change the throttle settings, so when your brakes are on your throttle would act like a speed controller rather than just acting strictly as an accelerator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T06:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo bad we don\u0027t have notchable setting for this sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you we could tap B to increase brakes and mod(alt/option) B to decrease then we could have just one key give a range of control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHolding the B down would quickly set brakes to 100% very quickly anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T07:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your just looking at breaking but remaining on an orbital trajectory (aka aerocapture or lowering your AP) you can also just use wings and vessle pitch to controll things. if you have wings and nose down while near your PE they will be generating \u0022Lift\u0022 that will be pushing your craft back to the planet.
