My favorite space movie was 2001/2010 up until now. A space movie that\u0027s about the exploration and discovery. Most movies add in some horror alien factor and I hate that. Not to mention are completely unrealistic. I didn\u0027t think anything could top 2001, but my god this movie did. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow its not out in theatres yet. I have Comcast so it was a $10 \u0022watch before it hits theatres\u0022 deal on demand. Worth.. every ...penny. The movie is simply about a mission to Europa. They get there they drill through the ice and ....o boy lol. I loved every second. The visuals are practically.. real. I felt as if i was truly along for the ride. There is a fear factor, but they do it very very well. That feeling of isolation. That \u0022We are actually here\u0022 feeling. I highly recommend this movie KSP fans will feel right at home. And ..well let\u0027s just say I have a greater appreciation for the lives of my kerbals after watching this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo watch it. Right now. By any means possible.

All that moving ice causes a lot of earthquakes. Which I imagine is very accurate. That ice moves fast. Future explorers may find that to be an issue.

If more people see an accurate and unsensationalized movie about space (assuming what the OP says about it is correct) because of an action-packed trailer, then that\u0027s a good thing I think. Although most would probably leave thinking they were mislead and not appreciate it.

Its not a horror film as in Prometheus. I was fooled by the trailer too, but NO its not what it looks like at all. The actions scenes you see are more or less just.. accidents. For instance the part where the guy in the space suit is screaming... they were EVA when he ripped a hole in his suit and depressurized. That scene was of him regaining consciousness. As for the guy that saved him well... hes the one that\u0027s floating away. That scene was great I truly felt really sorry for the dude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheres only two things I don\u0027t agree on in the movie. One is the landing zone. they land about 100meters off course and somehow this chick threaded a needle to get this thing down into a valley of ice. The next thing is when the probe finally breaks through the ice... they show sunlight peeking through even though they show the probe being at like 800 meters before it breaks through. But other then that its a truly remarkable movie. And all it did was make me want to play KSP even more lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T00:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI hate movies that don\u0027t explain how they got into orbit around a solar body, or throw some stupid explanation like \u0022Warp\u0022 or \u0022Teleportation\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always feel that when they do orbital capture/escape burns they do them wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYOU DO NOT THRUST TOWARDS AN OBJECT TO GET TO IT!!!!!!11111One!!!!1Eleven.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AustralianFries","CreatedById":57660,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-01T05:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople that don\u0027t understand space travel won\u0027t really enjoy this movie.

I do agree, but even 2001 had a disaster. That\u0027s why I liked 2010. Most of them actually made it back. It\u0027s nice that the disasters in this movie are practical though. More or less... for instance \u0022The ice is thinner then we thought\u0022 And there always will be a unpredictable variable. Future explorers may indeed find the surface far more hostile then we thought. Like the earthquakes ( Europaquakes? ) from the shifting ice. That would be detrimental to a mission. A fissure could open up at anytime and sink the craft. I think sending people down to the surface of these moons in the future may not actually happen. Europa and especially Io might be far too active to send humans to the surface. I remember reading something like the topography of Io changes as fast as our weather does. So you never know there will always be that one variable.
