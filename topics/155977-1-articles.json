Problem is, KSP now runs nowhere near as smooth as it used to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s the 2016 MBA (Skylake I5 @1.8GHz, 2.4GHz turbo boost, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD).

Smaller mods such as real plume and reentry particle effect works fine for me. After all you\u0027re gaming with a potato and there is really nothing much you can do apart from reducing its workload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy Macbook Air is only 1.4 GHz btw, so good for you to have a better hardware!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nZooming out a bit during launch also helps increase frame rates\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Riven","CreatedById":171451,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T17:43:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of how thin MBA\u0027s are, and because they only have 1 small fan, thermal management is quite poor. In my experience with a friend\u0027s 2012 MBA, a game/program that utilizes even 50% CPU load and all of the GPU will send the die temperature to above 100\u00B0C very quickly. After that the CPU will throttle back to attempt to keep the temps under control, and even then the temperature may still continue to climb. I did a simple test with Minecraft running max FPS on that computer and after 10 minutes the CPU die temp was 105\u00B0C, so I stopped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs MaxZhao said, you\u0027re probably gonna need to take your graphic settings all the way down. You could probably invest in one of those laptop coolers that you put under a laptop like this one for example \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA6SY2Z13018\u0026amp;cm_re=usb_laptop_cooler-_-9SIA6SY2Z13018-_-Product\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA6SY2Z13018\u0026amp;cm_re=usb_laptop_cooler-_-9SIA6SY2Z13018-_-Product\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
