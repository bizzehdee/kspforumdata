For air, I\u0027ll say the heat transfer coefficient is 25 and the temperature difference is 21 degrees (assuming dealing with surface body temperature of 25 degrees). In that case the heat transfer rate is 525 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. For Titan, I\u0027ll assume the heat transfer coefficient is 1.5 times that for air (not really sure of the exact value) and the temperature difference is 205 degrees. In this case the heat transfer rate is 7687.5 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, almost 15 times more. For water, with a temperature difference of 21 degrees and a heat transfer coefficient of 5000, the heat transfer rate is 105000 W/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. So water seems to be quite a bit better at wicking heat than Titan\u0027s air, but let\u0027s see how much of a threat it is anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater (which you contain a lot of) has a specific heat capacity of 4.186 J/g*degree C. So if you have 1 mL of water in your mouth spread over an area of, say 10 cm\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0or 0.001 m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, at a temperature of 310 K, the temperature would need to be lowered by 37 degrees to reach the freezing point and begin to form ice, corresponding to an energy of 154.88 Joules. At the heat transfer rate we calculated earlier for Titan\u0027s air, and taking into account the smaller area, if you drew in a breath at 2 m/s or so, the water in your mouth would reach 0 degrees Celsius at t=20.15 seconds. Ok, so that\u0027s not complete instant solidification, at least in your mouth. For comparison with my example from before, liquid nitrogen apparently has a heat transfer coefficient of 300 to 800, around the same as air. That means that indeed, imagining dunking stuff in liquid nitrogen\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ea decent analogy to what would happen to it on Titan. And while we\u0027ve found out that swishing liquid nitrogen in your mouth *might* not *instantly* freeze\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of your spit, I think we can be absolutely sure that for no amount of time would it be pleasant. Furthermore, your eyes are more exposed and likely a bit cooler than the inside of your mouth, so we can be sure that should your face be exposed to the atmosphere you would have significantly less than 20 seconds before your eyelids start to freeze. You might be blinded around the same moment you realize there\u0027s no oxygen in what you\u0027re breathing - a frightening scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, it seems that Titan is definitely very dangerous to expose your face in, but if you should accidentally expose some skin out of your jacket, say, with your glove loose around your wrist, you might have up to 20 seconds to get your glove back on before you start getting serious frostbite - and beyond that, there is no mercy.
