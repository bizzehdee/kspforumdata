While modification of stock is not an issue, it\u0027s that when it comes to other\u0027s craft, they either barely modified it, or submit it as it is.

In cases where it\u0027s an exact duplicate it\u0027s simple and the reposted craft will get deleted. In cases where some modifications have been made it is somewhat harder (and I appreciate you detailing the changes in your report, that helps save me some time).\u00A0 I set the rules on KX to allow posting modified versions of craft because I wanted to enable people to post craft and request other users help them improve it and to enable posting craft components that are intended to be used by others in their designs. But that does make for a tricky to draw line sometimes; is it a change that is meaningful, or is it just a change to say it\u0027s changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut short answer, is yes, moderation is done and I take protecting people\u0027s work seriously. In this case I have contacted the re-posted and I\u0027m awaiting a response before I take further action.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jestersage","CreatedById":165777,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-25T19:33:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.
