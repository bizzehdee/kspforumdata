I\u0027ve turned down the terrain detail, pixel # etc but I still get big frame rate drops.\n\nI also have gotten that flickering shadow issue again on my craft: like the shadows casted are flickering in and out of existence all the time.\n\nAnyone know of a solution to one or both problems?"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T16:53:49Z","Content":"I\u0027m also interested in what might be causing the shadow flickering.

This uses up too much space on the video card (there is only a certain amount of video memory used for computing the shadows) causing some objects to not cast shadows.\n\nI also see flickering shadows with craft on the launch pad. Try loading this craft and zoom in to the top of the ship (looking down about 45 degrees). I get a shadow that looks like a rotating cog under the pod and the battery.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab3c18o2lk6e3z9/FuelCellLag.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab3c18o2lk6e3z9/FuelCellLag.craft?dl=0)"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T19:59:51Z","Content":"So, I\u0027m getting the flickering all the time now.
