But since they limit (somewhat self-imposed) the amount of science that can be gained, I need to start sending manned missions out. Mun and Minmus have already been tapped out, and at this point anything less than a major mission just isn\u0027t bringing in enough science. So I decided to launch a manned mission outside Kerbin SOI. Duna seems a bit easier than Eve so I settled on it. I built a ship to do this task, but unfortunately I couldn\u0027t get it to work out the way I wanted so I decided to refuel it in orbit and attempt the mission anyways, a bit reckless but Jebidiah wanted to go. I apologize I don\u0027t have more screenshots, I don\u0027t usually intend to share a story afterwards but this time it just felt so good I really want to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trip to Duna was flawless, I actually had something very interesting and unexpected happen,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/703981943138373193/76184E7073B2CF1117724B82C8ED72DF437EE354/\u0022 alt=\u002276184E7073B2CF1117724B82C8ED72DF437EE354\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow I managed to hit both SOI which made the aerobraking nice and easy.

But now I get to the part I was expecting, less than a quarter of the fuel I used to get here left to get back. Should I send a refueling rig out, or to just try and make it back? It could be years, and that\u0027s a long time to leave someone waiting. I could leave the lander, and I\u0027m sure the remaining fuel will last longer without it, but I\u0027d lose out on a massive amount of science I\u0027d gathered. Sure, transmission is a possibility, but I was really hoping for a better payday. So instead I decided to shut down two engines and consolidate the remaining fuel. I use Ike to escape the SOI and found that for a mere 31 second burn I could get within 1.6 million km of Kerbin. I know I have SOME fuel, but I don\u0027t know exactly how much. The lander does have some left in it that I can either transfer to the big engines, or save for just in case. I decide on the latter and it turns out the answer is ... I have twenty three seconds of fuel. Now, there is a minor problem I found in the design after takeoff. The parachutes are attached to the drop tanks, and if you haven\u0027t figured out the problem with that I need to study you. So even though I wanted to bring the lander in, it might be impossible without any fuel. However, I realize if I just split the emergency lander and leave it on the Duna lander I can make use of its parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/703981943138187719/EB86BC47293030D16DD4F873974BC8A82FCD6492/\u0022 alt=\u0022EB86BC47293030D16DD4F873974BC8A82FCD6492\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd wouldn\u0027t you know? It worked! Back to probes for a bit I think, I prefer missions where I\u0027m not too concerned if things go awry. Only had one casualty so far in Career, and I think I\u0027m going to try to keep it that way for a while longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/703981943138801682/8282DA7BB854C50E4AB71E7F87AA35B0B01661F8/\u0022 alt=\u00228282DA7BB854C50E4AB71E7F87AA35B0B01661F8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
