Particularly the EPE and P-14 probes had really high, elliptical orbits. Now I don\u0027t think you\u0027re being stupid at all. In fact I myself also had a lot of trouble getting these missions done with an accurate Thor-Delta. I even mentioned it a couple times at the performance testing department over at BDB - but other than a change in the IMP probe parts, no changes were made, since Jso is apparently able to fly them to their specs. I guess I\u0027m just not that good either\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother thing I feel is a big part of this, is that these probes in reality weigh very little - 30-50 kg at most. Which means that in KSP, you\u0027ll have to come up with a design that\u0027s half of that at the very most. This is of course very challenging given the very limited amount of tiny parts we get, even with BDB. Tweakscale becomes quite a necessity if you don\u0027t want to change the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLauncher tests (and pretty much any contract actually) is kept at least mostly part independent, to allow for creativity as well as much needed changes if a player wants to try this on a different scale or with another parts set. Parts requirements only apply to those supported mods when installed, and then only to the main probe core or crew capsule parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately there\u0027s actually very little in the way of probes in mods, and for US rocketry BDB and Probes\u002B are definitely the main ones. NF exploration is very useful to keep on hand as well though - its parts may not be based on the equipment used within this pack\u0027s timeline, but it can be helpful to custom build your own variants. And if you don\u0027t mind doing some massive config balancing, Raidernick has a whole suite of probes in his mods too. If someone does get around to balancing those out for stock-alike career, do please share with the world!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, you\u0027re not the first to suggest an alt-history expansion - this was suggested a while ago in the BDB thread as well in fact. I\u0027m open to the idea, but I\u0027d need someone to write out the mission details for me, since I\u0027m really not familiar enough with the subject matter. Then we\u0027d need to figure out how to make it different to existing historical missions, otherwise you\u0027d just have \u0022land on the moon but with a different part required\u0022 kind of missions, which is not worth the trouble imo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SilverFox1701","CreatedById":207987,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-05T23:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been working my way through the US tree in the standard pack - I figured there was so much in it between the US and USSR it was better to focus on one line instead of split my focus between all of them - and have reached a bit of a confuzzlement.

The first was standard operating procedure; I tend to accept and run these contracts in batches. Not exactly historically correct, but easiest for me. Right now, my habit is to pick up six or seven contracts and run them at the same time, complete as many as I can at once in a launch. I launched under the auspices of an Explorer contract - I believe it was Explorer 30 - and completed four other contracts at the same time. I then went suborbital with the probe and crashed it into the ocean. I remember I crashed it into the ocean because the solar panels survived re-entry down to about 1 km above the surface before they ripped off.
