Easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, I did not manage to burn back into a retrograde orbit around Mun without expending heaps of deltaV for normal/antinormal burns. Is there a specific trick on how to achieve this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have to launch another ship and will try to do this starting again from LKO. I read somewhere that the Apollo missions did a \u00228\u0022 pattern and entered retrograde orbit.
