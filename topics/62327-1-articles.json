The effect is not strong enough for us to have to care about it, but in some 10^100 years there won\u0027t be anything but black holes and photons. At least unless some other, yet unknown forces change something on that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nebula","CreatedById":49153,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T01:19:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022crazyewok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022crazyewok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWrong about not being able to see it. A black hole is surrounded by a huge accrestion disc which is material being accelerated so fast round the event horizon its pulled apart and turned to plasma.

A planet mass black hole will hardly have anything surrounding it, especially if it\u0027s a wondering interstellar black hole. It would only be as massive as a planet, if anything it may have some asteroids in orbit around it. Kasuha is definitely right here. To even see the gravitational lensing you would have to be extremely close, and by that time you\u0027d be dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only possible way a black hole would be introduced into KSP is if KSP goes interstellar. Such a black hole (probably being a few times the mass of Sol and being surrounded by a nebula) would be to slingshot probes or spacecraft to distant stars at high velocities\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T05:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have contradicted yourself there Kasuha.

But given the Milky Way is an N body problem counting a few hundred billion bodies, this isn\u0027t quite right. As every system, the galaxy is not a perfect one. There are energy losses from different sources. This is indeed causing most objects to slowly decay on their orbits towards the center. But needless to say that this is not a universal case. It is true to say the exapnsion of the universe is puyshing galaxies away from each other, but false to say this applies to every galaxy. The simpless example: the Milky Way is bound to collide and merge with the Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt present mankind is unaware of the mechanism that keeps the galaxy spinning as it does. the motion of the matter towards the edge of our galaxy is in violation of our current known \u0027laws\u0027 of physics. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaaaaaaaaartially false. We know what\u0027s going on. But not really at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simple answer: dark matter. All you need to know is that it\u0027s massive, present in the galaxy, and keeping things flowing together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe long answer: It does not react with conventional matter in any way (which implies it\u0027s invisible), and makes up about 70% of the mass of the universe. It\u0027s present in galactic cores, and it\u0027s repartition makes such that the arms of the galaxy floaw along with each other. Search it up a little, we\u0027ve even have 3D maps of the repartition of dark matter in the universe. We have no idea what it\u0027s actually made of, how to identify it, how to know more about it. We just know it\u0027s there and we can observe it\u0027s effects on our surroundings. And even then to be fair, it could be a flaw in general relativity. To be fair, general relativity is flawed. For the simple reason it cannot explain everything. Dark matter is a \u0022sensible patch\u0022. It works. At least for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
