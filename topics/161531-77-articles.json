The big advantage is that you would need a lot less power to initiate the inertial fusion process. In the game, we could implement this by allowing different kinds of fuel for the Vista Engine. This also reminds me about (Deep Space Exploration Vessel (DSEV) Fusionpellets which also uses pulsed inertial fusion. They are both kind of like micro fusion bombs. The difference is that DSEV uses a Deuterium \u002B Helium4 mix while this design uses a pellets with Uranium \u002B Deuterium \u002B Tritium mix. This allows inertial fusion to be achieved much easier, and not requiring the high amounts of power when you just blast it with lasers. The Disadvantage is that it would require a lot more mass and therefore reduce effective Maximum Isp.

It can be switched even while active. It allows you to reuse anticides for 80% at the cost of 50% less power output.. This allows you to run on on a standby reactor for many decades. I though this was only possible with Uranium, but thorium as well?
