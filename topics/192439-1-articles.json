But my problem is that I have a satellite in a valid orbit of Kerbin, but when I click on both of the UIs (right click and toolbox button) is just loops the animation of the camera opening instead of actually opening the camera (here is a dropbox with the log and an image with pretty red highlights of my issue\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/transfer/AAAAAPkJKjIiQ7vxLNZ-vOkCbGGimNpcvoYluvDpAZ7xQ7SzTa8oAoM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/transfer/AAAAAPkJKjIiQ7vxLNZ-vOkCbGGimNpcvoYluvDpAZ7xQ7SzTa8oAoM\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0) To reproduce all I did was install TST with researchbodies, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and Blizzy\u0027s toolbar (along with others but as far as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E is saying nothing interacts with it) and I created a small probe with both telescopes on it, cheated it into a 400,000m orbit, and tried to open the cameras with the same result of the image in the dropbox.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-22T11:52:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also had this issue, and it turns out the most recent version of TST (v7.10) is only compatible with KSP 1.9/.1 and NOT with any other version.
