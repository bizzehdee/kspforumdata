Generally if the wheels aren\u0027t on straight up and down they won\u0027t behave like you should. Case in point, last night I was working with a rover that wouldn\u0027t move for the life of it; problem turned out to be the fact that I had them all tilted ninety degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poynting","CreatedById":103397,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T14:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYea Capi3101 is right, the physics engine makes the assumption that the point of contact is the bottom of the wheel (when it is straight). Therefore unfortunately tilting the wheels currently produces bugs due to this simplification. I think they will eventually fix it in up coming updates but we are stuck with it for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to keep the contact patch of the wheels out in fron of the main body of your rover I suggest angling the struts you are using forward instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T15:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, thanks.
