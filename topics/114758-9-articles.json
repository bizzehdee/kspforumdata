That would be useful to remove parts to reduce part count. I was thinking of small rovers, that could go out for Science^TM^ with only the basic supplies or collect visitors. Larger rovers would end up being a similar same size as the base and therefore would weather any storm just as happily as the base.\n\nA garage would need to be just something a bit larger. Unfortunatly without tweakscale you can\u0027t design smaller than the size of your largest part. If KIS was enabled for craft files or Nils277 was able to integrate the Hanger Mod, for a workable rover for collecting said Science^TM^ then a larger garage would still be needed.\n\nPeace."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T20:17:51Z","Content":"I use kis so I\u0027d be inclined to assemble a rover in situ ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:06:06Z","Content":"I think its time for another update ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nChangelog:\n\nv0.1.4\n\nNew Parts:\n\n- [\\*=1]Added the Planetary ISRU  \n[\\*=1]Added the \u0022Bigfoot\u0022 Landing Legs  \n[\\*=1]Added Base to MK2 adapter  \n[\\*=1]Added Base to Size1 adapter  \n[\\*=1]Added Xenon Container  \n[\\*=1]Added Stack-Separator for the Base-Profile  \n[\\*=1]Added Bi-Cupler for two Bases to Size2  \n[\\*=1]Added Heat-Shield with the Base Profile\n\nEnhancements:\n\n- [\\*=1]Scaled down the chairs in the IVA of Habitat MK2 so one can see the Kerbals face  \n[\\*=1]Changed crew capaity of Habitat MK1 from 2 to 3  \n[\\*=1]The Base parts can now also be found in a new profile category and in two new Manufaturer categories  \n[\\*=1]Added new main filter for this mod with functions as subcategory\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [\\*=1]Habitat MK1 is now in the right science category  \n[\\*=1]Several Typos and errors in the descriptions removed.
