The perceived\u00A0\u0022force\u0022 of gravity is nothing but objects following straight line paths in warped 4-D spacetime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Alcubierre Drive is a reverse solution of Einstien\u0027s field equations, where normally a configuration of matter/energy is taken and it\u0027s spacetime field is calculated, instead a field was taken and the equations were solved to find what kind of configuration of matter/energy is needed to make that field. The same thing could be done to \u0022create\u0022 artificial gravity in a room in a spaceship, you define the warped spacetime field that would provide the associated gravity effect and solve for the configurations of mass/energy needed to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I am not equipped to solve the field equations for such a configuration I can speculate as to what it would be.\u00A0Essentially you would have to have an energy concentration in the \u0022floor\u0022 of your ship that would create enough of a warpage in spacetime as to mimic something of a planetary mass which in relativity is analogous to saying you would need a near planetary mass spaceship. Even if the field was generated by a large energy density and not by a large conventional mass (which would help you reach the densities you need for a reasonably sized space ship) this energy would still add to the momentum of the ship giving your ship the effective momentum of a planetary body, making it very hard to accelerate with any kind of conventional drive, of course if you are capable of creating and maintaining such a large amount of energy I\u0027m sure you also have all sorts of exotic drive choices at your disposal. The real big issue, assuming you could generate such a field and moving a ship of that\u00A0mass around wasn\u0027t a problem, would be the massive tidal forces at the edges of the field. Because you are trying to create a very localized warping of space time, the edges between the \u0022flat\u0022 spacetime outside and your field would be massively distorted which would cause all sorts of spaghettification issues for objects near or on this boundary. The Alcubierre Drive also suffers from these same limitations, but they generally aren\u0027t issues given the use of the drive, for one the warp bubble is meant to fully encapsulate the ship, so tidal forces are only an issue for anything that tries to cross the edge of the bubble which isn\u0027t an intended thing, also the momentum/mass issues are less of a problem because during the actual superluminal functioning of the drive no actual accelerating force is needed as the spacetime within the bubble is \u0022moved forward\u0022 by the contraction and expansion of the spacetime for and aft of the bubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically yes the same mechanism that would allow an Alcubierre Drive to function could also be applied to generating an artificial gravity field, however even assuming such a thing were possible it would still suffer some extreme practicality issues, specifically the death and destruction of any being/object that happens to transverse the boundary of the field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T20:35:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223003327\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158428\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490905008\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022117470\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Akira_R\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 minutes ago, Akira_R said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Essentially you would have to have an energy concentration in the \u0022floor\u0022 of your ship that would create enough of a warpage in spacetime as to mimic something of a planetary mass which in relativity is analogous to saying you would need a near planetary mass spaceship...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only does the energy density need to be very large (how large depends on how many of the modified metrics and geometries you want to accept) but it also needs to be negative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-30T21:13:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223003353\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022158428\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221490906121\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002249317\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, Steel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only does the energy density need to be very large (how large depends on how many of the modified metrics and geometries you want to accept) but it also needs to be negative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting, how difficult would it be to explain why the energy needs to be negative?

Space-time creates the illusion of gravity. Quantum gravity is supposed to be the most fundemental force in the universe, and it is very difficult to parse out of its dominion.\u00A0 Thus creating negative gravity would have to have some aspect of space-time as a negative value. The curvature of space-time is caused by energy and its mass equivalents, therefore you would have to have negative mass or negative energy at one end of the drive. Energy is driven from entropy and entropy and time are woven together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interesting thing about our observed universe is that while time can go backwards, on the space-time scale it does not. Some have speculated that from the origin we went this way in time and maybe half the universe went the other way in time. Thus if such a negative energy/negative mass circumstance is possible, but not on our temporal side of the universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn statistics we run into the circumstance all the time where one observed limit of something is always zero, if the expected value is 1 you have a skewed distribution, if the mean probability is a million you have a near normal distribution. The skewing in the observations gives a pretty good indication that you have found the limit. When you get to the very low end of measurement and you start seeing the skewed distribution of sampled values, then you pretty much know your never going to go below that limit. In Quantum physics such a finite limit is laughable, but we have never observed what happens at the transition between quantum and relativistic observations .. .vis a vis we have different interpretations, (Copenhagen, multiple worlds, . . . . ). You can postulate all you want on the possibility of negative time, energy or mass but until we can observe then transiting into space-time, speculation is what they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-02T14:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose to get a \u0022gravity\u0022 you need some changing potentials so... well, the easiest way would be to gather a lot of mass-energy\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-12T08:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn what sense would this\u00A0be \u0022artificial\u0022 gravity?
