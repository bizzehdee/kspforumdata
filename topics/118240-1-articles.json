I\u0027ve seen a few that I can easily accomplish and would like to do so, I\u0027m just lost on the acceptance/reward aspect of them. Any help would be appreciated.

You can always just link the badge image. But everyone who cares and tries to find your entry would know, and would probably follow you around the forums and mock you relentlessly, so faking it isn\u0027t worth it.\n\neg:![cavemanbadge_zpsjkijz0wr.jpg](http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/cavemanbadge_zpsjkijz0wr.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:57:54Z","Content":"For displaying them go to settings (top right) and on the left side you can edit your signature.
