It *could* be a scratch-build, which can run a little cheaper than a kit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe motor looked like a G-motor (model rocket motors are letter rated, with each succeeding letter equivalent to roughly twice the power of the previous letter), so would cost about $10 for a single-use, or, if you already have the reloadable hardware (which can run about $40 as a one-time cost), about $6-$7 per reload. Based on the size of the model when the guy was handling the nose cone at the end, as well as the altitude mentioned, I definitely would say it was a G motor. Maybe a G40... the launch was too slow and easy for a G80.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe altimter that was probably used for the altitude determination probably runs about $20-$40, depending on the features.

Anything below one pound LOW and 4 ounces of propellant, no notification is required. Notification means just that: you notify the FAA 24 hours prior that you will be launching X number of rockets at Y location (GPS coords are fine), and that\u0027s it. High power has been around long enough that the various rocketry groups and organizations have an excellent relationship with the FAA people and local airport towers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything above that requires high-power certification from either the National Association of Rocketry or the Tripoli Rocketry Association. Level 1 cert covers motors in the H-I range, Level 2 is J-L, and Level 3 is M and above. After P-motors, you\u0027re getting into amateur rocketry, which is a whole \u0027nother kettle of fish. Also, anything falling into certification territory requires FAA Waivers, which is a much more complicated process than simple notification, but again, the working relationship between rocket folks and the FAA is really good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real problems we ever had were with the BATFE, but the NAR and TRA sued them and won, after almost ten years of court battles. Unfortunately, I\u0027m not sure what the fallout was for that, as it happened after I stopped building and flying. The NAR website ( \u003Ca href=\u0022www.NAR.org\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewww.NAR.org\u003C/a\u003E ) used to have a section detailing the court process and things they were doing, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s still there. There\u0027s a hilarious story regarding how the BATFE determined that APCP (Ammonium Perchlorate Composite Propellant) was an explosive (it isn\u0027t, which was the point of the entire legal battle), and was shown how they completely failed in their \u0022proof\u0022. It\u0027s too long to go into here, but if the records of the legal battle is still up at the NAR website, a little searching will find it easily enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket flown in this video probably only needed notification at worst.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-07T18:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello everyone!

The only H I ever flew was an H260 Smoky Sam on a scratch-built 3x upscaled Mars Lander for my Lvl 1 cert flight sometime around 1995. Got to *maybe* 500 feet (didn\u0027t have an altimeter at the time, so it was Mk1 eyeball guesstimated, and you know how draggy those MLs are and the TOW was 10lbs). Three 36\u0022 chutes and \u0022spring-loaded\u0022 landing legs meant a safe recovery. Second flight on an AT I161 resulted in a burned-through shock cord on one of the chutes, and a landing on the slope of a ditch, breaking one of the legs. It was repairable, but I never bothered. Got my LVL 2 cert on a scratch-built scale Sandhawk (4\u0022 x around 8\u0027 5lb TOW), using a J280.

All you need extra are batteries (for the controller), paint (if you want - it\u0027s not necessary) for the rocket, and some form of glue, depending on the materials - white glue for balsa and paper, plastic cement for plastic parts, of course, and maybe epoxy for stronger joints or quick repairs.
