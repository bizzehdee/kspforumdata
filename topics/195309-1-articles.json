However it is great for mods with many dependencies (installing visual packs is easy cause you don\u0027t have to install 30 mods manually.) I recommend using both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and manual. Use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E for what it does have and manual for what it doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-04T08:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you playing in sandbox mode? It probably won\u0027t work in that mode as science is irrelevant. For science/career modes, make sure you have all the dependencies and are on the right versions- try uninstalling and reinstalling it. If that doesn\u0027t help check the in-game settings for the mod, maybe you need to change some of those.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u0027t have everything, some by choice and some by necessity, but it has the majority of mods on it and has version and dependency controls so you don\u0027t have to find the right versions and all the dependencies yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
