Now with stock parts you set the dry mass and the fuel amount and the game calculates the weight of the tank.

It\u0027s a great \u0022getaway\u0022 movie for pure science \u003Cem\u003Efiction \u003C/em\u003Evalue. I agree that there are some HUGE holes in that movie, but I liked it nonetheless.\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I\u0027m still looking forward with some hope as to what might be done with the sequel. Now that the whole xenomorph thing has been dealt with and kicked off for the rest of the Alien franchise, I\u0027m interested to see if the smart decision is made to follow Elizabeth\u0027s journey to find the rest of the Engineers. There were some interesting angles I\u0027d like to see expanded upon, in a completely different direction that isn\u0027t a 2 hour monolith to Alien fanservice and call-outs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack on-track: I\u0027d really like to see what comes of your latest effort!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELook, being an Alien fan, ANY new movie is good..\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am looking forward to where they take it, the only two characters besides good old Mr Weyland was Liz and David. It sure is a different movie to the original tho, I still think 3 is my favourite, not sure why.. just was more authentic, believable.. I loved #2 but #3 when they went back to 1 alien, and then the theory of it taking shjape dependant on what animal the host was was a cool thing, and something they strangely had not touched on in 2 previous movies. The reason they are humanoid is because of us basically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to getting home from work and working on this puppy, it\u0027s good when I actually have inspiration to make something, things tend to look alot better then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
