I hope this is still the right category. First post...) I recently bought a joystick (Speedlink Phantom Hawk) and it works great with the game except for one part. The stick has a built in throttle.. thingy (Let\u0027s call it a lever) which is steplessly variable and the input is recognized by my PC as intended, when checked in the system settings. But when I bind the throttle axis to this lever in the game it acts all weirdly. When I push it up to 100% the ingame throttle is around 70%, when I move it to 50% on the joystick, it\u0027s at full throttle ingame and so on. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I\u0027ve tried playing around with the dead zone and sensitivity but nothing really worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
