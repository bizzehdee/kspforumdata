I\u0027ve now completed my first prototype N-1. It works better than their one. The giant first stage does explode dramatically in realistic fashion, but only after it\u0027s been used up and detached from the rest of the rocket. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real thing had 30 on the first stage, 8 on the second, 4 on the third and then a single rocket for the trans-lunar burn. My version has 30 on the first stage two stages of 8 and then 4 for the trans-munar burn. I had to do this just to keep the TWR acceptable, as the payload is too big for a single nerva. Weighing 1630t means it\u0027s a lot more than just a mun rocket. It\u0027s got enough power to land on quite a few different places. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to make everything as close to realistic as possible. LK lander, LOK spacecraft, functioning LEM and fairing protecting everything. The lander and orbiter have a lot of random parts attached to them and quite a bit of part clipping going on. The docking port on the lander seemed to kinda bug things out, and the capsule wasn\u0027t supposed to break apart when the parachutes opened, but apart from that everything went pretty well. It does unfortunately leave a ton of spacejunk, both in obit around kerbin and the target destination...... but hey.... this was a rush-job space-race rocket...... I\u0027m sure they weren\u0027t that bothered by a bit of spacejunk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a few N-1 recreations, but until now....... none that use the large diameter engines. This 1630t test-craft was to let me figure out the engine configuration, and see if i\u0027d actually hold together in Kerbal physics better than they did in real life. Next is to build a \u0022full sized\u0022 version that weighs around 2700t. This version uses skipper engines....... so the final build will require mainsails. I might have to download a mod for a larger VAB, as I ran out of room when building this one, and had to angle the lower fuel tanks more than they needed. Still..... at least I\u0027ve figured out how to angle fuel tanks now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/e1RXv\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
