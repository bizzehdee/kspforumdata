It has quite a few bugs before mods even come into play, and it hurt my performance quite a bit- which normally wouldn\u0027t be such a big deal if I weren\u0027t already on a very low-end three-year-old Toshiba Satellite A660 laptop.

The Bandwagon Exchange: The Spacecraft Exchange used to be full of Asparagus-staged monsters, limited only by hardware performance and rated by launch weight. People tried to outdo each other in increasingly larger launch vehicles. Then it was full of SSTO\u0027s, decried as \u0022the pinnacle of Kerbal engineering\u0022 by many. Now it\u0027s all \u0022VTOL Amphibious SSTO\u0022 and other cliche\u0027d planes. I\u0027m not saying that sharing vehicles is bad, it\u0027s just that when all of them are the same thing and can only be judged by whichever gimmick is coolest they all lose value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) \u0022It\u0027s my way or the highway!\u0022: When you\u0027re in the suggestions forum and the developer says, \u0022We\u0027ve built a FTL drive and plan to implement procedurally generated systems\u0022 the absolute stupidest thing you can say is, \u0022That doesn\u0027t fit in with how I think KSP should be, don\u0027t implement it\u0022. Far too often have players, old and new, said things along those lines- just open up a FTL discussion thread and read through it. As participants in an open alpha, we\u0027re privileged to have a first person view towards what the developers are doing to the game, but we should NOT take that to mean we have veto power, control over what does and doesn\u0027t go into the game. It\u0027s up to the developers. They will fix bugs, address issues, and even take player suggestions about changes or additions. But they will NOT remove planned features because a few people want the game to be played their way. Avoid being entitled and closed-minded and you\u0027ll have a much more fun experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sorry if my being candid offends you. These are really the only KSP specific complaints I have, besides a bunch of other ones that are common to every internet community and not so much relevant to the evolution of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:29:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake ASAS for example. Its algorithm seems to be a very straightforward logic: if I\u0027ve drifted off-center in the \u002Bx direction, then try to push in the -x direction until I\u0027m no longer off-center. The problem is that it\u0027ll be pushing at full speed the whole way back to the origin, which means I\u0027ll cross the zero point with a large -x velocity, taking me far from the origin in the other direction, which\u0027ll again require a large correction back. Effectively, it\u0027s attempting to match position but not velocity. It\u0027s especially bad if you\u0027re using RCS, since it\u0027ll be trying to use full RCS thrust to correct for tiny variations in orientation. A similar problem applies to engine gimbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if the internal math were fixed, to where the system tried to zero out deviations in both position AND velocity simultaneously? What if ASAS was designed to reduce rotations as it corrected, to where it hit the origin with zero rotational velocity, and therefore no need to see-saw back and forth? (That is, far from the locked angle it puts as much rotation in as possible, but as you get closer it attempts to reduce the velocity by thrusting the OPPOSITE direction so that rotational velocity approaches zero as you reach the right orientation.) A variable-thrust RCS jet would help with this, but it\u0027s not really necessary as long as the ASAS is smarter about knowing when/if to turn off the jets. Small perturbations can be corrected through flywheels, no need to fire the RCS, but right now turning RCS on means the ship will always use them at full strength whenever it needs to make any change in orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, these things can be improved without waiting for Unity to get its act together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know precisely how the algorithm works right now but I can definitely see what you\u0027re getting at. Overcorrection has consistently been a performance issue when I try to rely on asas for much. In many cases I have had cleanly successful launches that were previously ripped to pieces by asas overcorrection. It would seem that all of the relevant data on a craft is in the game during a flight. things like mass, velocity, and momentum all have to be known by the engine for it to run the simulation right? if that information is there I can\u0027t honestly see why a more nuanced approach to asas isn\u0027t possible, more complicated to code surely, but not impossible. Maybe I don\u0027t know enough but I\u0027ve been trying to think up a reason and i\u0027m coming up empty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:33:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWaitwaitwait.

I\u0027d like to think I made it pretty clear that while DF is amazing and something I enjoy, I recognize that there are problems with it that became canonized because they were more entertaining or awesome (one of the primary faults being that Tarn won\u0027t work on the interface until the end... when it\u0027s pretty dang clear that he\u0027ll be dead before he\u0027ll consider it done).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t call DF a half-assed game for straying from the original vision, and I have three words for you: Vampires and boogeymen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETarn Adams is constantly updating his vision for the game, if you read his updates; it\u0027s not a static idea, but a series of things he wants to put in, even if it requires completely rewriting the codebase in order to get closer to his new vision. I miss dungeonmasters and taming megabeasts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise, when Notch realized he\u0027d hit gold, he changed direction and did something new that got people excited, even though it was initially feature-poor and continues to be updated by \u0022Hey, this\u0027d be cool!\u0022 than any grand plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with your original post is that you staked out an unreasonable claim based entirely on your opinion, which opened up a whole can of worms that should have been left untouched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s hard for me to resist tweaking noses when people call out others for using strawman arguments via strawman arguments... which is why I responded, in part, with a strawman.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou opened with a clumsy analogy based on your opinion, and got smacked around a bit for it since you left the topic wide open. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you\u0027re really complaining about is \u003Cstrong\u003Epresumption\u003C/strong\u003E by the playerbase that the designers are infallible, and that the fanbase will invariably rally around the developers even when there are serious problems. That\u0027s certainly something that happens because people will defend what they love/enjoy, and this does carry a risk of shielding the devs from legitimate criticism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I don\u0027t see it as a big danger here, since people are very quick to offer technical criticism and KSP\u0027s community has such a wide range of skill levels and analytical thinking that there\u0027s a healthy mix of people trying stuff out because they don\u0027t know what shouldn\u0027t work, or because they do know what shouldn\u0027t work and try it anyway. Even disregarding the alpha status of the game, if you can enjoy the game, it\u0027s because you enjoy failing and learning. Hopefully, that should temper the dogpiling and white-knighting I\u0027ve seen in other game communities.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itisdearflinch","CreatedById":32704,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T00:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022M5000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022M5000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, you don\u0027t see it flexing even when a shuttle flies within two feet of it.

Perhaps you\u0027re right. I just think that they have a good head on their shoulders and are much better than most other development teams I have encountered (not much I must admit). A reason I might not offer much criticism of them is because I am actually not that technically savvy. So even if I did spot a problem, I would have no idea how to even suggest fixing it (or even be able to discern if it is a bug or me just derping it up).

That is kinda why I might get a little involved with defending the devs. Much of the criticism levied toward them is overly harsh and based on perceived wrongdoing or some such. An example of something I would consider good criticism is all those people who have been talking about performance reduction with the new machine. I haven\u0027t noticed much ire over it just some disappointment. Same thing with the reduced textures of planets. It was something the devs attempted, and I think it is something that they didn\u0027t really implement correctly or shouldn\u0027t have done at all.
