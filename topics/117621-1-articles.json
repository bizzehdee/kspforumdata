I have been playing KSP for quite a while, having dabbled with it since 0.23, and playing quite a bit since 1.0. I visit the forums at least once a day, having learned a lot from the tutorial section, as well as gaining a lot of inspiration from the craft section. Here is my first submission to the forums, a proof of concept crew shuttle. I hope I can contribute a bit to this great project. \n\n![SwWfPu3.jpg](http://imgur.com/SwWfPu3.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T16:42:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 04:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T16:42:18Z","Content":"Ah wow.
