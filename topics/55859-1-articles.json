As far as side mounted towing, I would disable the engine on the thing being towed (Especally if it is more powerful than the one doing the towing) and be sure you have lots of reaction wheels to counter the uneven thrust. If a tank is drained of fuel then the CoM would naturally shift towards the engine. Unless they already have juel in them you are better off towing them. (Save file editing for that purpose, imho is cheating) If done right a tug would be able to leave behind an RCS fuel tank, you would just have to put Sr. docking ports on both ends (One to connect to the tank, the other to connect to your tug) however, be mindful that this is going to shift your COM, so it would be best to plan this ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T01:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESr docking ports as decouplers are a non-starter.

The only real exception to this is if you\u0027re in the habit of sending spaceplanes to other planets because these usually need to be refueled as soon as they get in orbit. If you\u0027re not doing that, then the easiest way to deal with spent boosters is to just deorbit them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of options for that. The easiest is to put a probe core (and probably RCS) on the booster. Once in orbit, separate it from the payload, switch to controlling the booster, use the RCS to point it retrograde, and burn off the remaining fuel to deorbit. Usually, the probe core has just enough electricity for this without needing a battery or RTG on the booster, especially if running the booster engine makes electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T18:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepending on your target altitude and mass of the stage, you could use Sepratron motors to try to deorbit stages on separation.

I don\u0027t even need to strut them to anything in most cases as long as I make sure they don\u0027t get too much load. Below you can see my lifter lifting one fuel module. Notice struts which are taking load off the docking port\u0027s connection. The bottom docking port is not strutted. The top one is, because the connection between the port and the SAS module is exceptionally weak. These struts go from the fuel tank right to the port. There are usually no problems with these connections in space where you don\u0027t need as much thrust as during liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow it is my interplanetary ship made of such modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ulpxH99.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ulpxH99.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oB3MKoV.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oB3MKoV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-12T19:09:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/12/2013 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kasuha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T19:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a Cantanker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v0.22/Screenshots/screenshot283.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot283.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a Clampotron Sr Docking Port, a Probe brain, a 2m battery, a Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank, a 2m reaction wheel and a Sr Docking Port from end to end.
