Could it work the other way around - making a persistent variable (that controls the animation) be non-persistent? Before I added the RasterPropMonitorComputer module module to fix the problems mentioned by me on github (and thus realized it was the *RasterPropMonitorComputer* that made a persistent var persistent) it was OK, as the animation resetted to the same state as the zoom. Is this somehow possible?\n\nWhat would work though is making several meshes that function as projecting surfaces for different RPM monitors -\u003E each with a different camera config. These meshes then could flip 90\u00B0 into a surrounding non-transparent mesh, depending on the same persistent variable as the switch rotation. IE on switch pos 0 plane a is visible, on switch pos 1 plane a gets rotated out of view and plane b is visible etc. But having at least 3 cams render to a surface that then is not really used seems wasteful."}]}
