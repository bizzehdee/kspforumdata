Have you ever wondered why all Kerbals have the surname \u0022Kerman\u0022, or why Kerbin is so sparsely populated? In my \u003Cem\u003EFlight for Survival\u003C/em\u003E series, I attempt to explore the answers to this series whilst also exploring the question \u0022how do you lose this game, anyway?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI freely confess that the above exposition is merely an excuse to play around with FAR, Deadly Reentry, and the like. I figured that since contracts and reputation have been implemented, however, that it was the perfect opportunity to go all in. Currently, there are but two rules in this playthrough:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI must never hit orange reputation or my space program is done for. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI must never quicksave or revert to the VAB during recording. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like hitting Orange in stock almost has to be done deliberately, so I\u0027ve added a few mods to make this scenario more likely. No longer may I aggressively reenter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, nor may I forget to pack lunches for my Kerbals on those long interplanetary flights. Here are the mods I am currently using:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFerram Aerospace Research \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeadly Reentry \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETAC Life Support \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFinal Frontier \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFirespitter \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EProcedural Farings \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you want to make my life harder, feel free to suggest any additional rules, mods or gameplay tweaks to look at.
