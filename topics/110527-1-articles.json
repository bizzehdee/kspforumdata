Right-clicks will open the building upgrade/repair window. Hovering the mouse over the button will cause the corresponding building to be highlighted.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts using the top number row are indicated for each button and can be used to open it.\n\nEach building\u0027s icon is mostly self-explanatory and most of them use the R\u0026D center icons.\n\n----------------\n\nFor those interested more in the Unity 4.6 UI this also serves as a simple example of how to create a few UI objects using the new system.\n\nMost of the code comes from [this link](http://chikkooos.blogspot.jp/2015/03/new-ui-implementation-using-c-scripts.html), the only real scripting example I have found. The system doesn\u0027t seem so friendly to UI\u0027s made entirely through scripting and Unity\u0027s documentation is very sparse.\n\nI can\u0027t get the buttons to appear on top of the bottom bar in case anyone is wondering. That would be the logical place for them to go, but that bar seems to be rendered on top of everything else (though I can get it working fine with OnGUI...).\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T02:17:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic**\n  \nLink to collection thread"},{"CreatedByName":"tkw","CreatedById":142638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T19:43:03Z","Content":"seems cool mod i love it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
