However, there isnt a stock part that is good at conducting and radiating heat. Docking ports work well as buffers, but only for so long. \u003Cp\u003ESo, may want to look into the thermal properties of that engine or make some sort of radiator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the stock solar panels (except for static radial one) will radiate heat out of the craft...they say as much in the description now.
