Just getting to Kerbin orbit requires a lot of thrust; achieving escape velocity also requires a lot of thrust. Both of which aren\u0027t able to be done with decouplers.

OP, where\u0027s your entry?\n\nI think there\u0027s a rule that says you have to do the challenge first and upload pictures/videos of it for a challenge to be valid.\n\nAlso, I think that doing such maneuver with only decouplers isn\u0027t possible.\n\nEDIT: Yes, there is a rule for that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Many challenges we see are nearly or literally impossible to achieve, and usually very little thought has gone into them, these challenges just annoy people, waste forum space and show that the submitter hasn\u0027t really tried.\n\u003E So test your challenge yourself first to make sure it is possible, you don\u0027t have to be successful but you\u0027ll soon know if the challenge has a hope of being completed."}]}
