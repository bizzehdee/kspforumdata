I think the prospect of parts becoming damaged due to misuse is a fun game mechanic. We have to protect those parts, and when things go wrong we have to send out an Engineer to fix them. I\u0027m not talking about \u0022random part failures\u0022, as some mods have set out to do. I don\u0027t particularly like the idea of uncontrollable failures that require tedious repairs. But I do like the idea of paying for my own mistakes. And I like the idea of adding a small margin of error where a mistake doesn\u0027t result in total failure, but rather something which can be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t fully understand how part destruction works, but I know that the part files come with various impact tolerances and the like. Hit below the limit and you\u0027re okay. Hit above the limit and you\u0027re toast. So here\u0027s what I would propose:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Introduce new \u0022damage tolerance\u0022 values to every part. You can use Module Manager to add these, based on some percentage of the tolerances related to destruction. (Say 80%?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Just adding the extra possibility of damage would make things hard. So to balance this let\u0027s also use Module Manager to \u003Cem\u003Eincrease \u003C/em\u003Edestruction-causing impact tolerances by some percentage. (Say 10%) This gives a nice window of room between 100% functional and 100% destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. When a part falls into this \u0022damage window\u0022 it becomes Damaged. The part (and everything attached to it) is still attached to your ship. You receive a warning at the top of the screen: \u0022Part X has been damaged!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Damaged parts no longer function properly. Some examples of what this implies: Engines are locked in a deactivated state. Tanks containing resources cannot be accessed. Reaction Wheels lose all torque. Decouplers cannot decouple. Antennas cannot deploy. Science Labs cannot perform research. Crossfeed is disabled on any part. You get the idea!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. To be fully realized, such a mod would change the model and texture to appear damaged, but that\u0027s incredibly ambitious. More realistic perhaps is a simple adjustment to the texture to indicate that it has been damaged. And in lieu of anything else it would be nice to just have an overlay that highlights any damaged parts. Of course there would also be a \u0022Damaged!\u0022 line on the right-click context menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Damaged parts can be fixed. There are a few ways to approach this. Perhaps the setting is configurable, or perhaps you\u0027d just need to pick one and run with it. My opinion is that an Engineer is required to fix the Damaged part. Just hop out on EVA, right click the part, and choose \u0022Repair\u0022. It may also be desirable to include some kind of \u0022Repair Parts\u0022 resource. (whatever the random failure mods are using, I figure) In this case, the ship with the Damaged part would have to have this resource available, and the repair would use up some amount of these. Another possibility is to include \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E integration, and require a particular tool in order to repair Damaged parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould anybody else find this as awesome as I do? Does something like this exist and I just don\u0027t know about it?
