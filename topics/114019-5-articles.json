The short and skinny is, \u0022It depends.\u0022 Every craft will be a little different. They will all produce more thrust with higher intake pressure (lower altitude/higher speed) but they will all experience less drag at higher altitudes. Since top speed is where drag equals thrust, it\u0027s hard to say with precision where that altitude will be without test flights. What I\u0027ve been noticing in performing prograde speed dives for your single engine speed challenge is that there does seem to be a point somewhere around 18000-20000m while descending where the speed actually starts decreasing (I use it as a signal to pull up. Waiting to see the temperature gauge rise is often too late)\n\nFor circumnavigation, it gets even more complicated since you have to be mindful of fuel economy. The lower you fly, the more you\u0027re going to have to burn, and flying low enough to maximize your speed versus drag heating, you might find that you end up going slower on account of having more weight and more drag from added fuel capacity. On my expedition flight, I had to climb by about 3000 m to make it around the last lap. That made me lose about 3-5% of my speed but improve the fuel consumption rate by about 8-10%. I\u0027d have gone dry otherwise. Most of my velocity flights have ended up at about 20000-21000m but this is more to avoid excessive heating than anything else. But I have also been limiting my intakes to just enough for continued operation. More intakes means drastically more drag, and a higher altitude and very likely lower surface speed to run with very high fuel efficiency.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T00:59:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 12:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck**"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T01:00:22Z","Content":"To add to ExaltedDucks explanation, fuel consumption is not proportional velocity, nor lift/drag, but acceleration. Lift/drag are not scaled linearly with altitude [inverse square law], however, intake air is. This means you have a linearly scaling thrust output and exponential scaling lift/drag effects. This is the perfect equation for better efficiency at higher altitudes."},{"CreatedByName":"Triop","CreatedById":145841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T01:11:05Z","Content":"Thanks for all the info guys, saves me some testflights.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-29T01:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2015 01:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Triop**"},{"CreatedByName":"t3hJimmer","CreatedById":145943,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:44:58Z","Content":"I dont think I\u0027m going to break the 40 minute mark.
