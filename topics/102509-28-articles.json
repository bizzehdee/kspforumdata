This one I called Amphib3c. I added some electric generation, now have 6 RTGs instead of 2, and I added a Fuel Cell Array. I put a lot of the little bits inside the cargo bay, and lowered the mount for the drill (not enough apparently). Biggest change was the configuration of the \u0027pontoons\u0027 and wheels. I lowered the pontoons significantly to get a performance increase. That also required widening the pontoons significantly to prevent tipping over. I also ditched the rover wheels for aircraft wheels. I miss the rover wheels, but the aircraft wheels have two advantages. First, they are a lot less draggy, so there is an efficiency bonus. Second, they don\u0027t break as easily as the rover wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, the other big change is the addition rocket engines.
