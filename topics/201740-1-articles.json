Good realistic alternatives exist. Don\u0027t want your bones to turn to mush? Separate vessel with a kilometer long tether and rotate 1 RPM with thrusters for 1g gravity.

Something that the enemy wants to take intact, such\u00A0that slamming relativistic projectiles into it would do enough damage to make the whole exercise rather pointless. That, right there, gives you some useful constraints. It keeps combat vessel speeds within reason (just because they can zip around at lightspeed, it doesn\u0027t mean they have to, especially if accidentally annihilating your prized mission objective is a serious risk). More to the point, neither side can make use of their OTT maximum velocities to\u00A0simply avoid combat - the attackers want to secure their objective and the defenders need to stop them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr consider a planet. Sure the attacking force can zip in at lightspeed and maybe avoid any defenses whilst doing so but, if they want to put boots on the ground and take that planet away from the enemy, then they have to establish some sort of presence there , whether that be sufficient orbital weaponry to cow the populace into surrender*, or sending in the drop troopers to secure a beachhead.
