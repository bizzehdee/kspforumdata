Anyway, mods wont work for me at all. The parts show up in the game but seems the plugin .dll dont work or do anything. Anybody else have this problem? Plus I dont know where the saved files are saved with this OS. I look in the KSP save folder but see no saved files but they are saved somewhere due to that they are there when I run the game. Can anybody help me with this problem cuss I want to use Mods...Thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
