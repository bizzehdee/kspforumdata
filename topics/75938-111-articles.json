I\u0027ll see if any updates need to be done to the MM patch version of it. Great news on the DustFX scene too. I have successfully split the module into two versions: Wheel/Track and Repulsor. The repulsors don\u0027t seem to make any use of tweakScaleCorrector, so I stripped out most of what I was doing with that and replaced it with a modification based on the ride height of the part. The one thing that worries me about that, however, is that I\u0027m only grabbing the value when the part is initialized... but I\u0027ve got a few ideas on how to update that. I may need to move the setter for that variable into the method that defines the dust color, which is updated quite often and should be active enough to catch changes in Ride height during the flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all of this lacks any proper testing due to my OCD when it comes to building rovers. if I\u0027m not completely happy with it, it doesn\u0027t get launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only other thing I would like to implement that was part of CollisionFX is something specific to the screw and skids. Those parts, when moving over especially-hard materials, have the potential to throw up sparks due to the fact that they\u0027re not exactly rolling over the terrain, but rather scraping along. I\u0027m gonna have to do some digging to see if pizza-whatever-his-name-is ever got the sparks to only fire off when colliding with non-planetary-collider surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also been experimenting (well, I experimented with the config, haven\u0027t actually tried it yet) of adding the FSbuoyancy module to the screw so that they actually float in addition to your propeller module. I hate to do anything that would add a dependency to that part though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Oh, hey, a thought about the overheating problem. As a short term fix/hack you could simply double the maximum heat tolerance of the parts. In a more long term fix/hack... I wonder if an animation state could be added to the rest of the parts, taking the ERS wheels as an example, which would put the part in a \u0022packed state\u0022 where the suspension would be put in a fully-contracted position and, as a nice side-effect, the part would then spoof the game into thinking they are fully shielded (something we\u0027ll have to do some coding work to achieve) as if they were under a fairing. This goes along with my long-standing idea that the repulsors (specifically the non-surface ones) need to have a fully-retracted state that causes the repulsion-pod (I\u0027m making this up as I go along) pull up and rotate to face outwards to show that it is \u0022turned off\u0022 which would also make it take up less horizontal space.

On the plus side, the only change I\u0027ve made to any of the files is adding a part info override, which can be overridden in the config file if necessary, and that\u0027s pretty much it.

I still want to make some additions to the whole system, and there are likely some tweaks and optimizations I can make to the whole thing now that I\u0027m tying them directly to the KF wheels. Also, in the far future, I would like to see if there are other effect types that could replace what the dust is currently emitted from which might provide a more natural effect.

Sorta like the physics-less parts in the old days. It\u0027s not an ideal fix, but it would do the trick.

It\u0027s gonna be awesome though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUPDATE: Alright, I did a merge to github. The bad news is that, in order to be sure that DustFX (more accurately called KFDustFX and KFRepulsorDustFX) and the old CollisionFX modules don\u0027t conflict, I had to implement the module using Module Manager. Considering nearly everyone who uses mods at all will already have it, I don\u0027t even consider this \u0022bad news\u0022 necessarily. Eventually I would like to find a way to detect the presence of CollisionFX on the parts, those of which have the KFDustFX module as well, and disable the offending module when the part is initialized. This would eliminate the dependency on MM. Ideally, in the far future, being able to break free from the extra module and turn DustFX into a called method from the standard KF modules, which would allow me to eliminate the current collision detection techniques and simply re-use what the KF modules use themselves (water-spray when repulsing over the water, that would be awesome)... well, a guy can dream.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in conclusion, everything \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E would as it is (totally untested, but it\u0027s not really any major change from the original DustFX implementation, so everything should work like before) but I\u0027m nowhere near being done tweaking it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other news, I\u0027ve updated a number of mistyped module names in the wheel configs, and removed some previously-commented redundant/unnecessary modules.

I have no clue where to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of thoughts on the dust: It looks wicked. Really pleased with it. but I noticed it seems to grab hold of one of the colliders on tracks and repulsors and display the effect from there. I wonder if there\u0027s a way to find all the collision points - rather than just the closest one - and average between them. Also, you can access a lot of the variables from KFModuleWheel, and I can make certain other things available. Wheel collider slip springs to mind, as this could be used to add more dust when slipping. Just ideas, but it seems like something worth enhancing.

I have absolutely no clue how to do that though. Keep in mind, everything I\u0027ve overhauled is still, at its core, straight from CollisionFX. Whenever I break something completely, that old mod is still my go-to to figure out what I\u0027ve done and get it working again. The whole collider detection stuff is some of the most confusing parts of the whole thing too, so I\u0027d welcome your own mucking about with the code. My baby is really just the addition of an external config file to define colors/biomes/planets and all that. Previously it was hard-coded, which is simply not acceptable, and even then the code is really from xEvilreaperx. All I did was pester him for help and combine it with the original PQS detection stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy only worry with emitting from multiple colliders in a sing part is that, when using many different wheel-type parts, you\u0027ll overload your performance with all the dust you\u0027ll be emitting. I would actually love it if you could somehow detect the collision that is furthest towards the rear of the part (pretty much dead center for a wheel, but would be pretty far back for a track) and emit from there. However, since tracks can throw up dust when turning in place, the effect would lose its cool factor in that instance. I\u0027m actually not sure even the current system would detect movement during in-place turning with a track.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, it\u0027s all quite the work in progress. I\u0027d also like to see the particle stream itself done differently so that, upon changing biomes or surfaces that produce different colored particles, we don\u0027t get the entire particle effect changing all at once but only the new particles being produced by the collision. This would probably mean we\u0027d need to start using a real particle emitter, instead of a simple smoke effect. I\u0027m unsure if we could get the same results from a particle system though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll cast an eye over it.
