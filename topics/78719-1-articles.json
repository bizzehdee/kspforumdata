I know that (at least at present) there is no concept of losing in the game, so these are things would probably end up being self-enforced (that is, by deleting the save when I have violated one of the losing conditions). I was wondering if anybody else has given this any thought, and if so, I was hoping that we might compare notes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the two mechanisms that I can see for losing are reputation and funds. I am not sure if it is possible to go into debt (or if the worst that can happen is to hit $0), although I do know that the devs have always had an out in mind. I do know, however, that is it possible to drive your reputation into the ground, and I think this would be a good starting place for such a rule set. Here are my thoughts so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe game could end if my reputation gets low enough. The justification here is that recurring failure causes the Kerbals to lose faith in their space-fairing prowess, and they might question whether or not they are even meant to be in space at all. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe game could also end if I can find a way to say that the space program has become insolvent; if so, the space program dies a political death since there it has become clear that the management cannot fund it. My testing indicates that it is not possible to go bankrupt; no matter what I do, I can\u0027t seem to get my funds under $12. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the former, I\u0027m thinking the game terminating condition might be when I hit red ( \u0026lt;= -1000 reputation), although that almost seems like it\u0027d be too easy; it seems like you have to kill a lot of kerbals to do this. Alternately, I could make orange the cutoff point here, as that seems to be much easier to get to. The funding problem seems like a harder one to tackle though: are there any suggestions for a reasonable cutoff point here, or should I just not worry about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-20T23:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI applaud your aims but think career is the wrong target. \u0027Career\u0027 is meant to provide a fun way for people to always win,as far as I can tell.

It seems to be working out pretty well for him, but somehow it just doesn\u0027t feel right doing it this way. The greatest appeal of using Career mode is that I am substantially limited in what I can do, and that means that it\u0027s not a question about what seems appropriate, but rather whether or not what I\u0027m doing what is feasible. For what it\u0027s worth, if the game can enforce those restrictions on me, all the better, since it limits bias caused by forgetfulness on my part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently looking into mods that might help the fun factor (as in Dwarf Fortress \u0022fun\u0022) in this way. I definitely think it\u0027s time to start looking into things like Ferram Aerospace, Deadly Reentry, and TAC Life support. I guess what I\u0027m looking for are self-imposed rules that will keep things interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pecan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pecan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only way to introduce \u0027logic\u0027 into it is to stick with sandbox; flight before space, unmanned before manned and parts to enable science, not the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one wrinkle I\u0027ve never really liked about the tech tree. I, too, would prefer to see the tech tree arranged in this manner (although I can understand why Squad implemented it in the way that they did).

I\u0027m afraid I have no useful advice for the former. For mods RT2, KAS and Kethane make communications (non-Fox), bases and mining necessary or at least useful. My own favourite is SCANSat for mapping satellites - although note the current version uses ModStatistics so you may want to avoid it. I don\u0027t know how familiar you are with the aesthetic mods - EVE, Distant Objects and others but for video they would probably be very convenient. FAR and DRE I wouldn\u0027t worry about so much, depending on how much you want to mess around in atmospheres as opposed to in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
