I\u0027ve reduced the node tolerance down to 0.7m/s which is better, but still permits the vehicles to turn in pursuit of the maneuver node before shutting off. In order to prevent any wild chasing of the maneuver nodes, I have to reduce the tolerance down to 2-3 m/s. While both settings are better than the alternative of MJ simply burning endlessly until it\u0027s either out of fuel or crashed, this doesn\u0027t explain any sort of why this is happening. Something has changed in the last couple of days and I\u0027ve been unable to determine what it is and how to fix it correctly. I know for a fact that something has changed because vehicles which used to perform just fine with a tolerance of 0.1 must now have their tolerances reduced to the previously mentioned 0.7 or even higher. In response to what Sarbian said about larger ships needing a less restrictive tolerance, I have the following two pictures:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/TFRZfZg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022TFRZfZg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6JO0KaD.png\u0022 alt=\u00226JO0KaD.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, neither of these is what I could consider a large ship, clocking in at under 10t, and yet both need relatively low tolerances for dV (the latter has been to the mun 4 times with a tolerance of 0.1m/s and yet now it wasn\u0027t even working correctly with the 0.5m/s of tolerance seen in that picture) despite their small sizes.

Again, I know for a fact that this is something that has changed recently, though as far as I can remember, the only recent variable changes to the mix were some edits to MJ\u0027s attitude adjustment page. That said, if I can\u0027t find the culprit, I\u0027m going to have to start again from fresh installation of the game and start working back to where I am now. I feel like it\u0027s going to be a headache, but considering all of the different mods I like to run, I\u0027m probably going to have to start obsessively keeping a changelog for my installs so that when something like this crops up, I can identify quickly all of the recent changes that could have caused it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that note, I\u0027m really hoping someone can help me out here as I\u0027d really hate to lose weeks of game progress because I can\u0027t track down the source of this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Before someone tells me to just accept the lower tolerances, I don\u0027t actually think that is an option. I rely heavily on MechJeb because the bulk of the fun in KSP for me is in designing the vehicles rather than hand flying them everywhere. At these reduced tolerances I can only imagine the difficulties in trying to match orbits with an asteroid or other celestial body, especially when I\u0027ve got a limited number of engine ignitions thanks to the Engine Ignitor mod. As I see it, I must find a way to correct for this issue or I\u0027ll be forced to start over from scratch in the hopes that I\u0027ll be able to track the variables well enough to revert it back to working the next time it occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPPS: @Sarbian, I know you\u0027re pretty busy with getting MJ ready for v1.0, but as a request for some future release, I\u0027m wondering if you might include some sort of break on the number of times MJ ignites / kills the engine. While using engine ignitor, you have a limited number of ignitions, but MJ doesn\u0027t make any accounting for this, sometimes rapid firing the engine 10-15 times in a row while on a descent trajectory and leaving you without an engine at a point in the flight where that will guarantee you\u0027re going to become a crater. Again, this is just a thought for some future release, but I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not the only person who uses MJ who might want something like this to exist.

I use Kerbal Construction Time, which includes a simulation mode so you can test your vehicles without having to wait on them to be built. This mode contains something similar to hyperedit (or hyperedit itself) to allow you to jump straight to another planet to test your vehicle there, which is what I was doing to test my Munar lander. Apparently, MJ doesn\u0027t like this sort of jumping around, and as a result jumping to the Mun to test resulted in the autopilot acting a little kooky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter giving up temporarily on solving the issue and wanting to get back to the game, I decided to just fly the mission to see how it turned out and everything went just fine, autopilot included.

As I\u0027m guessing many people don\u0027t do much maneuvering after using hyperedit (putting stations in orbit is the most common use that I know of), this control issue probably hasn\u0027t surfaced many times in the past.
