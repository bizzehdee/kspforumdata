the big hub bub is about the multiplayer being bad.\u00A0 Sure there are some technical hurdles to deal with.\u00A0 The thing that gets me is why are people so up in arms about it.\u00A0 Squad has expressed interest in bringing multiplayer to KSP for over a year now.\u00A0 Near as I can tell, Squad is not talking about a typical multiplayer scenario with a dozen or more people trying to pile onto a public server with grief on their mind either.\u00A0 At most we are talking about being able to get together with a few friends and jointly experience the game in a more hands-on way, unlike just showing friends pictures or video or watching streams.\u00A0 Personally, I have a number of friends that have expressed interest in actually buying the game and learning it for the first time if we could all play and have fun together.\u00A0 The issues I see are like this....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Timewarp...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the case of timewarp, give the players multiple options.\u00A0 We should have the ability to either lockstep the warp OR run it in A-sync mode.\u00A0 However, before you go jumping on me about A-sync warping, remember that in the cases we have seen already in multiplayer mods, you cannot interact with another player unless you are in sync AND you can only catch up to another player in the future.\u00A0 You cannot reverse timewarp.\u00A0 I personally prefer the lockstep method (why that is will become clearer later) but options either way are key to overall satisfaction from the community.\u00A0 In any case its doable.\u00A0 We know its doable because if a ragtag team of modders can make it work within the bounds of modding, then imagine what the devs can do with having access to the source code.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Simultaneous Player Actions...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, this has been another big topic of discussion throughout this thread and elsewhere.\u00A0 How to deal with multiple people physically playing in the same world at the same time.\u00A0 There are two basic schools of thought in my mind concerning this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2a) Give the players a single space center to share.\u00A0 In this case certain mechanics from single player will hold over in many ways in multiplayer.\u00A0 For example, you cannot use the Launchpad or Runway for launching vehicles if someone is already using them.\u00A0 In single player, if you have something on either of these when you select the launch option, it gets removed.\u00A0 A similar system can be used in multiplayer.\u00A0 You simply disallow other players to use the particular facility until for example T\u002BX time after player A initiates their first stage.\u00A0 Plus these T\u002B times could be configurable by the players in the game.\u00A0 Now this would only apply to the Launchpad and Runway because the VAB and SPH scenes can obviously be instanced on each players client.\u00A0 That though, is how I would basically look at doing a multiplayer with a shared KSC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2b) The other main option is to give players multiple space centers to choose from around Kerbin.\u00A0 Each can be identical but in different places all across the planet.\u00A0 You might even be able to give modders the ability to set these centers on other planets so the really adventurous can start in completely different places in the Kerbol system.\u00A0 The key point here though is that, with multiple start locations to choose from for each player, you no longer need the added complication of a launch failsafe.\u00A0 Its also not necessarily that much extra work with this option because Squad already has a perfectly viable KSC to work with.\u00A0 Its simply a matter a sprinkling additional clones of it in locations around Kerbin with suitable terrain.\u00A0 A little height map tweak here, a spawn location there, and voila, done.\u00A0 Plus, the less experienced players can elect to pick from the more equatorial locations while the old pros can try their hand at the more complex launches from higher or lower latitudes. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Player/Craft Interactions...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is always gonna be a tough one.\u00A0 You can code the world\u0027s best ever server but there isn\u0027t anything on this Earth the devs can do if someone simply has a slow or bad connection.\u00A0 Its a sad fact that not everyone is gonna be able to play KSP in multiplayer.\u00A0 Some folks may have computers that are just a bit too antiquated.\u00A0 Others will have internet that is slower than paint drying in a rainstorm.\u00A0 However, The obvious option that would at least help some of these poor souls and offer the best experience overall, are dedicated servers.\u00A0 In most multiplayer/Co-op games you typically have two server options, Listen and Dedicated.\u00A0 For those that do not know, it breaks down like this.\u00A0 Listen servers are where everyone playing with you are running off the machine of the player that is hosting the game.\u00A0 Dedicated servers are typically either paid-for servers from a 3rd party like say, PingPerfect, or are run on a spare machine by one of the players.\u00A0 The biggest difference is the load of the game on the network or host computer.\u00A0 Dedicated servers are in the vast majority of cases, superior in nearly every way as far as game performance.\u00A0 When Squad does introduce multiplayer (and I do believe its \u0022when\u0022 not \u0022if\u0022) I truly hope they build a dedicated server program for it.\u00A0 If we don\u0027t get a server client then I am afraid it would all be for naught.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn closing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know a lot of you will never be interested in multiplayer Kerbal Space Program.\u00A0 That is your prerogative and I am not gonna call you names, or spit hate in your direction.\u00A0 I love this game.\u00A0 You love this game.\u00A0 We can agree to disagree.\u00A0 The biggest reason I wrote this post was the number of folks I saw in this thread that had actively called for Squad to not even bother trying to get a stock multiplayer available.\u00A0 That to me is just, well, rude.\u00A0 How would you feel if I were to demand that Squad made multiplayer the ONLY option and too bad for you single player folks.\u00A0 Not so good I\u0027d wager.\u00A0 Its not a waste of Squad\u0027s time just because YOU don\u0027t want it.\u00A0 I want it.\u00A0 Lots of people want it.\u00A0 Here in this post is just a tiny little inkling of the fun that could be had by a lot of us in the community that does not have to interfere with the way you want to play.\u00A0 At the end of the day, Squad has said that they at least want to give it a shot and if they don\u0027t succeed then, well, I will be sad.\u00A0 I\u0027ll still play KSP though.\u00A0 I\u0027ll still crash things.\u00A0 I\u0027ll still shout for joy to the dismay of my family and pets when I pull out a miracle landing.\u00A0 Most of all though, I\u0027ll still gladly continue to watch your Twitch streams, your YouTube adventures, and read about your thoughts and opinions on these fine forums.\u00A0 Give it a chance.\u00A0 You never know, if they pull it off you might even want to give a shot.\u00A0 You\u0027ll be welcome on my server anytime if you do. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdited for
