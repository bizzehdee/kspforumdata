Then you set your course to 40 degrees up pitch when you cross the muns orbit, turn SAS on, and wait until your nose touches the horizon: THEN burn to return to kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone know which is more fuel efficient?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hypocee","CreatedById":8609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-02-01T21:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I\\\u0027m any guide you\\\u0027re going to get some bogus answers regarding free-return trajectories assuming an eastward Kerbin launch, which are the lowest-energy \u003Cem\u003Eoverall\u003C/em\u003E.

Which should give you very little velocity relative to Kerbin. Which should result in a highly elliptical orbit that requires very little to get into the atmosphere. And I figured eastwards was better since the Mun is rotating eastwards, giving you some help. But as Hypocee said, it\\\u0027s pretty much meaningless. I arrived at 40\u00C2\u00B0 below the horizon and 800 m/s @ 5km through trial and error. There\\\u0027s no more math or theory behind it than that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
