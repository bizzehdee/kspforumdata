I have a couple of designs in mind: \u0022windmill\u0022 rover for Eve\u0027s surface and extra power supply for the Kerbal Foundries AG repulsors (that are indeed power hungry). Maybe a small Duna ion glider without tons of solar panels too.\n\nThe \u0022windmill\u0022 rover should work on some of the Outer Planets moons too, like Tekto. \n\nI know that a common RTG could solve all my issues, but just for roleplay sake, a RTG would decay while a RAT operated vehicle could last longer (theoretically, of course).\n\nEDIT: And this may lead to \u0022electric/hydraulic operated cooling\u0022 too.\n\nThink about an electric actuated radiator that could be smaller but better performing than what we have now.\n\nThe RAT then could be an interesting extra power supply to use just when you need it, during the re entry.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T03:50:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Signo**"}]}
