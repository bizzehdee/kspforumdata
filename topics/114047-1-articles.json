The problem is that with the basic engine, you don\u0027t get more than 300 m/s speed, and can\u0027t climb more than 10km or so. That barely lowers your delta-V requirements (and probably won\u0027t even offset the mass of the jet engine)."},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:09:20Z","Content":"You\u0027d probably have to figure out what energy/work is larger: Dragging the jet engine, wings and intake to orbit and beyond. Or climbing to 10k/300m/s. Probably isn\u0027t worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:13:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I guess it is obvious for most of you but I need to be 100% sure\n\u003E thanks\n\nI tried building a rocket only ssto the other night.

That leaves you with a dV requirement of 1987 m/s minus losses. \n\nCompare to a hohmann transfer from surface: 0 m/s at 0 m gives you 174 of the 2492 m/s needed for a hohmann transfer orbit to 70 km. That leaves you with a dV requirement of 2318 m/s minus losses.\n\nFinally for reference, 1 km/s at 20 km is 1174 m/s of the required 2432 m/s; a 1258 m/s deficit.\n\nBasically, for a hybrid SSTO, you need to craft a scenario where (wings,) aerobic engines, and jet fuel costs less than the extra rocket fuel (plus tanks and engines) needed to reach the edge of the aerobic flight envelope. For basic jets, that\u0027s about 400-500 dV. Not a lot of margin to work with. Other jets work because that margin is about 1100-1400 dV. That\u0027s a solid third of orbital dV requirements!\n\nAltitude saves you tens of dV, horizontal velocity is direct payment of dV costs."},{"CreatedByName":"KarateF22","CreatedById":143090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T04:15:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, but it usually isn\u0027t worth the trouble.\n\u003E OTOH, a rocket-boosted Weasley makes a good early-game suborbital tourist ship.\n\nIf you only need to get suborbital a single Kickback with thrust limited should do the job, and be cheaper."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:07:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If you only need to get suborbital a single Kickback with thrust limited should do the job, and be cheaper.\n\nThe Kickback isn\u0027t exactly \u0022early-game\u0022, though. By the time you have enough science to unlock that, you\u0027re not doing suborbital tourist missions anymore. Besides, the plane will recover for 100% minus fuel costs, while the kickback is either lost or, if recovered via chutes, will recover for less than 100% (as is the capsule(s))."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T14:53:30Z","Content":"Probably possible but not easy. Back in 0.90 FAR I did a Basic Jet spaceplane. FAR then gave the Basic Jet a similar top speed, but I was able to climb to a rather better 16 km on it before lighting the rockets. Whether it\u0027s \\*useful\\* is another matter mind you, it could easily have an inferior payload fraction and cost-per-kilo-to-LKO when compared to a good regular launcher."}]}
