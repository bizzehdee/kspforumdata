The problem is that with the basic engine, you don\u0027t get more than 300 m/s speed, and can\u0027t climb more than 10km or so. That barely lowers your delta-V requirements (and probably won\u0027t even offset the mass of the jet engine).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rofltehcat","CreatedById":145224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T23:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027d probably have to figure out what energy/work is larger: Dragging the jet engine, wings and intake to orbit and beyond.

For basic jets, that\u0027s about 400-500 dV. Not a lot of margin to work with. Other jets work because that margin is about 1100-1400 dV. That\u0027s a solid third of orbital dV requirements!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude saves you tens of dV, horizontal velocity is direct payment of dV costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KarateF22","CreatedById":143090,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T04:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wanderfound\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, but it usually isn\u0027t worth the trouble.\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, a rocket-boosted Weasley makes a good early-game suborbital tourist ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you only need to get suborbital a single Kickback with thrust limited should do the job, and be cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KarateF22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KarateF22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you only need to get suborbital a single Kickback with thrust limited should do the job, and be cheaper.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kickback isn\u0027t exactly \u0022early-game\u0022, though.
