Thus, we can use a skinny service bay to store what ends up being a stocky lander. As a plus, in the radial assemblies are tanks, they can be staged off manually once empty.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine a series of FL-400 tanks with RCS, probe core(tiny), a landing leg and a Jr docking port could dock to a central assembly for a wide base lander. KIS/KAS could allow for parts to be added later to save space and fuel tranfer so the thing can ditch the externals upon take-off and return to the bay.Either a transfer stage built in or a nose based docking port on the mothership could be used for transport.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T12:03:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, what might be fun is to fit two 3KdV landers in a MK2 bay...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vMHPOhz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vMHPOhz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PpawsOZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PpawsOZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/G551JFq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022G551JFq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T12:11:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T13:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI wonder how their TWR compares to the kerbals\u0027 jetpacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T14:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUmm, those ones above had some serious flaws.
