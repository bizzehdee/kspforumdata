You can make such satellites, and they will bounce the signal back to Kerbin for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is two reasons you\u0027re only seeing direct connections to Kerbin right now. One, Kerbin\u0027s ground based antennas (the Deep Space Network, DSN, after the real life system of the same name) are several orders of magnitude more powerful than what you can carry on your spacecraft. Antennas automatically search for the most high-quality path home they can find. Because the DSN is so powerful, this highest quality path is almost always \u0022just talk to Kerbin directly\u0022. Two, not all antennas can bounce a signal. There are two different kinds: so-called \u0022direct\u0022 antennas, and so-called \u0022relay\u0022 antennas. Direct antennas weigh and cost less, but cannot route other spacecraft\u0027s signals through them. Only relay antennas can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first relay antenna you get is the HG-5. It is pretty weak, though. You\u0027ll want to put two or more of them on your relay satellites, and the landed vessels on the Mun will need a dedicated antenna of their own (not just the integrated transmitter in every pod or probe core). Alternatively, you could use the RA-2, which is plenty powerful for all your Mun relaying needs. But it takes more research to unlock it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore information: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CommNet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798800\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591540993\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204871\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Joe Kerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, Joe Kerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) this is more complicated.

The orientation of your control point matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, you might be able to right-click the probe core and set it to reverse control in the part action window.

This must use relay antennae like the HG-5 or preferably RA-2 as a direct antenna cannot relay signals from another ship.\u003Cbr\u003E\nA useful trick is to put relays just in front of and/or behind the Mun, or any other planet/moon for that matter, which can cover almost an entire hemisphere at once and will stay in the same relative position all the time, unlike orbiting relays which move in and out of line of sight as they orbit. Just be sure to match the orbit of the target planet or moon as precisely as possible or you risk the relay falling into its gravity well and crashing or being thrown out of the system entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-08T12:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223798809\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194536\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221591542380\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first relay antenna you get is the HG-5.
