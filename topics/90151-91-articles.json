If you are using extremely heavy stages, however, using Mechjeb to change the attitude of your craft may not be reasonable - often times the control signal is completely saturated since the ratio of the control signal to the error signal is so high due to the large mass of the stage and the small reaction forces generated by RCS / SAS. Patience is key when changing the attitude of the spacecraft in RO - it\u0027s not like stock where the SAS is so unrealistically powerful that you can move about with no consequence. Giving the spacecraft a small nudge manually towards your desired orientation and then using phyics time acceleration (up to 4x) with the spacecraft just coasting is a way to perform attitude changes in a more reasonable, game friendly amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrodriguez\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jrodriguez\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, with the new ignitions limits It is almost impossible to plan an automatic ascent profile using Mechjeb, every single time I have to \u0022take the control\u0022 to do a manual ascent.

This is completely unrealistic and often physically impossible due to the risk of re-igniting an ascent stage in orbit. Instead, you should be tuning your target altiude and gravity turn end such that all stages will burn continuously until you are circularized (or whatever your target orbit shape is). In Mechjeb, you can edit the ascent path and adjust the altitude at the end of the gravity turn as well as the turn shape - both of these factors are critical to performing an efficient ascent. The target altitude only tells Mechjeb where to perform the circularization burn which and does nothing to change the ascent shape and, as I say above, is not realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I disable the ascent autopilot (if I\u0027m using it) between staging and ignition of my upperstage so I avoid conflicts where Mechjeb wants to kill the throttle (and therefore flameout!) my mainstage engine. I try to tune my gravity turn start velocity, end altitude, and turn shape such that a continous burn of my second stage after first stage completion will result in entering orbit at my desired altitude - this is mostly accomplshed by trial and error, though there are some analytical tools you can use to predict how much time you need to apoapsis at first stage completion in order to successfully enter orbit on your second stage burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jrodriguez\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jrodriguez\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I feel RCS should be scalable via TweakScale because if you have an ultra heavy payload (let say 1000 Tns) RCS are almost useless because it will take forever to change direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee above about having patience as you adjust the attitude of large stages - in space, time is almost free, so there is no reason to rush anything. Higher reaction forces mean higher accelerations which mean higher structural loads at both the beginning and end of the attitude change which ultimately means, in real life, more mass, which means bigger boosters and greater cost. Granted, this is not really a something we need to take into account in KSP, but it is why RCS and SAS forces are kept low - there is no reason to make them higher and doing so, if anything, has negative consequences!

Another possible solution would be to try updating MechJeb to the latest stable dev build.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a bug with how MechJeb reads the torque available to a craft where it thinks it still has torque available from engine gimballing when the engine is not burning. I submitted a report in the official MechJeb thread a week or two ago. A subsequent dev build was released of MechJeb that had a fix for this issue, but I have not had the free time to test it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if I recall correctly deactivating the engine (and maybe disabling the engines gimbal) also avoided this bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IronSchu","CreatedById":132485,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T20:46:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may be a stupid question, but I just installed this into v1.0.4 that I just downloaded, and now I cannot get any rockets to launch due to insufficient fuel...I have never had this issue in the past, am I missing something with the install that may have effected this or am I not realizing a new step in the VAB process prior to launch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny and all guidance is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jandcando","CreatedById":66121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T22:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IronSchu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022IronSchu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis may be a stupid question, but I just installed this into v1.0.4 that I just downloaded, and now I cannot get any rockets to launch due to insufficient fuel...I have never had this issue in the past, am I missing something with the install that may have effected this or am I not realizing a new step in the VAB process prior to launch?\u003Cp\u003EAny and all guidance is much appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDifferent engines use different fuels, so now just slapping an engine under some fuel tanks doesn\u0027t magically work. You need to fill the tanks with the fuel mixture specific to the engine you are using. So put the engine on the tank, then right-click the tank and select the fuel mixture that your engine uses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--EDIT\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I thought you were new to RO, so I gave you the default \u0022my engines are working\u0022 answer.

I can\u0027t exactly stay up there AND return home so I assume this is not intended behaviour? Is this for Realism Overhaul or is there a thread of RP-O that I should direct this towards?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next is that quite often just decoupling boosters causes the fuel tank the decouplers are attached to on the main rocket to overheat and explode, is this due to some change causing heat to be generated by decouplers controlled explosions or just a glitch? about 9 time out of 10 detaching boosters results in my rockets exploding and I can\u0027t see what is different on that 1 time they don\u0027t explode so I\u0027m a bit confused by it all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from that, and a few minor glitches that are just from some of the dependencies which I will deal with, I LOVE THIS MOD! Just getting into orbit felt like an achievement (as it should) I had grown bored of regular KSP because I had played it so much everything became easy, first time I had felt a challenge in ages was when I undertook the Elcano Challenge, and once I finished that I sort of just stopped playing.
