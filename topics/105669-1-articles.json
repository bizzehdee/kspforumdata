With the addition of the new intakes and the new air brakes that both look surprisingly familiar, the ability to make flaps, and the fact that it is my favorite aircraft that I have even been blessed to have worked on IRL, I made an F.. um i mean K-15. \n\n[http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00006.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00006.jpg)\n\n[http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00007.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00007.jpg)\n\n[http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00010.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-28_00010.jpg)\n\nIts not a perfect replica and I had some debate over which mk-1 cockpit to use which ended up being the one I thought looked best, but it does fly and it flies well.\n\nEDIT: Design updated(Final Version)\n\n![2015-04-29_00002.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-29_00002.jpg)\n\n![2015-04-29_00006.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/2015-04-29_00006.jpg)\n\n![2015-04-29_00001.jpg](http://s1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg//2015-04-29_00001.jpg)\n\n[Download](http://kerbalx.com/wolfedg/K-15D) (Be sure to assign the flaps to your action group of choice and remove any axis from them.)\n\nEDIT 2: Update (See it in action!)

I was struggling with the engines the spacing makes it look closer to an F-14 but not a big deal to me. Another problem is that the center fuselage on the F-15 is more oval shaped and the sides down from the intakes are flat (unless it has conformal fuel tanks like the E model). There really is only so much you can do with stock parts, but I personally like the way it turned out, and its flight performance is the best of any of my aircraft after the update to aero. Very easy to fly and land."},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:08:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) It is somewhat a work in progress.
