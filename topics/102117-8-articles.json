Mostly because these should also be considered essential to a release-worthy product considering the fact that we have a set of parts that are great, but could use some of the missing pieces.\n\nGoing forward, I would say 50/50 between the two - Half of the effort put into general fixup of existing content, and the other half adding content. Each update should then be somewhat themed so that additional content sticks to one category. For example, 1.1 could contain any overhauls and bugfixes you come up with, as well as mk4 parts. 1.2 another batch of fixes and overhauls, as well as adding another gas giant.

I get a nice warm fuzzy feeling in my belly when I see \u0022Stability improvements\u0022. Not seeing stability improvements while seeing new features in release notes is like slam dunking purring kittens into a running meat grinder. KSP isn\u0027t fun when its being unstable at times. If its not fun to play because of issues it doesn\u0027t matter what the features are. When you lose the \u0022beta\u0022 title, its for real. You don\u0027t want to repeat \u0022Big Rigs\u0022 or any other similar game titles that claims to be finished (not beta, alpha, dev build, etc regardless of version) but clearly isn\u0027t finished or lacks polish.\n\nPersonally, something I\u0027d like to see in KSP is load parts only when flying a ship with parts to improve memory. Simple low poly previews or even animated icons for parts in the editor would suffice. Once you click that part, it loads in memory for the current session. Perhaps a \u0022flush parts\u0022 button somewhere to clear the current memory of loaded parts that are not in use on the current craft? No need to preload EVERYTHING unless you\u0027re using it. IMO its wasting already limited memory. Make preloading all parts an option for high RAM and/or 64bit machines. I think we could all create much bigger ships this way.

Early career is super grindy, and the contract system is slightly flawed in the way that it tracks achievements. I think the first few contracts should be more generic so that if you exceed your goal of 12500M and hit 46000M, you should get points for hitting all of the goals in between.

Aero seems to be the MOST important of these as it will affect everything else. It also seems from the dev notes I\u0027ve read over the past little while that procedural fairings, ISRU, and Valentina seem the most ready to be included in a 1.0 release. \n\nWhile I\u0027d love to see a deltaV number in the VAB for new players as well as an explanation of what kind of number you might need to go somewhere, the tutorials should suffice at this point to get people up and running if they\u0027ve gone through them.\n\nThanks again for asking us Max"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:17:13Z","Content":"From a purely release-oriented standpoint, it\u0027s best to fix what you have before you go adding in new content. From a development-oriented standpoint, those fixes are liable to break as you add new content. It\u0027s a tough line to walk, but seeing as 1.0 is a major release milestone, I\u0027d personally say that focusing on fixing bugs and updating existing systems should be the top priority."},{"CreatedByName":"Lhathron the Elf","CreatedById":118706,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:18:58Z","Content":"I\u0027ll be fine with whatever happens, but I think the best course of action would be polishing what we have now. Then whatever you need to add later you can add and then polish afterwards. But for now, make the game smoother and minimize the number of bugs. It would be better to squash them as they come out of the cracks then try to reach through the floorboards to get them or just letting more and more come out before you exterminate them."},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:20:28Z","Content":"My vote would be to add polish, such as clouds, a new skybox, etc."}]}
