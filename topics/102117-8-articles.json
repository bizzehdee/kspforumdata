I get a nice warm fuzzy feeling in my belly when I see \u0022Stability improvements\u0022. Not seeing stability improvements while seeing new features in release notes is like slam dunking purring kittens into a running meat grinder. KSP isn\u0027t fun when its being unstable at times. If its not fun to play because of issues it doesn\u0027t matter what the features are. When you lose the \u0022beta\u0022 title, its for real. You don\u0027t want to repeat \u0022Big Rigs\u0022 or any other similar game titles that claims to be finished (not beta, alpha, dev build, etc regardless of version) but clearly isn\u0027t finished or lacks polish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, something I\u0027d like to see in KSP is load parts only when flying a ship with parts to improve memory. Simple low poly previews or even animated icons for parts in the editor would suffice. Once you click that part, it loads in memory for the current session. Perhaps a \u0022flush parts\u0022 button somewhere to clear the current memory of loaded parts that are not in use on the current craft? No need to preload EVERYTHING unless you\u0027re using it. IMO its wasting already limited memory. Make preloading all parts an option for high RAM and/or 64bit machines. I think we could all create much bigger ships this way. Whackjob could end up creating 30,000 part ships because tanks engines girders \u0026amp; struts are already loaded and may make a smoother launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here\u0027s my order of preference...
