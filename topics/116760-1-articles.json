Explore, survive, and fight. Build space ships and equipment. The catch? It\u0027s going to be complicated.\n\n[www.iotapersei.com](http://www.iotapersei.com)\n\nIt\u0027s inspired a bit by KSP and also Minecraft. You fly around and explore just a few planets, but the detail is really in the planets, not in the space ship. There are animals and plants. There are spaceships, and some story parts, but not easy to find at the moment. \n\nIt\u0027s still in very early release, so lots of things are planned that aren\u0027t there yet.\n\nEnjoy, and let me know how you get on.\n\nHugo\n\n![screen7.jpg](http://www.iotapersei.com/screen7.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Niemand303","CreatedById":119422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:01:23Z","Content":"Looks promising!
