All functionality works except I cannot access ladder nor airlock. I tried different placements, shapes of colliders, reducing part base collider to 1 with overlapping origin and still dunno why it doesn\u0027t work. After EVA I can hover mouse over suppedly airlock area and it correctly shows \u0027crew hatch\u0027, Kerbal can feel its collider but the sign\u0027 press f...\u0027 doesn\u0027t show up.\n\nAny ideas what I am missing?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
