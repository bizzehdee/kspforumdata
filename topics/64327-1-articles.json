It worked earlier so I know it\u0027s installed the right side out. What\u0027s happening is that I see the \u0022undock\u0022 command in the context menu but clicking on it simply doesn\u0027t do anything and after I click on that once the command is gone from the menu. I\u0027ve had that happen before but usually reloading the quicksave fixed that, but not this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- what the reason might be (I didn\u0027t crash into the port and an EVA reports \u0022no damage\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- and if there\u0027s a fix that can be applied thru editing the save file. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had a look at the parts and I\u0027m certain I found the docking port in question but frankly I don\u0027t really know what to look for. All I can see is that the values look very much like those from the other docking ports that do in fact work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions? Thanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
