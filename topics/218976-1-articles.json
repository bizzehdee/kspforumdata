Is it here on the forums, the Twitter, Threads, or discord? Or do we have to check all of them? I thought the forums would have up to date info but I found out on Twitter that the 22nd was supposed to be a release but then discord said that it was delayed but the forums seem to say nothing about any of it. Or are we supposed to not really know about this stuff?

I don\u0027t use twitter or discord so was still expecting the next patch to drop today.

Is discord the place then? Because I didn\u2019t see on discord that the 22nd was a release date, I heard that from only Twitter. I\u2019m just wondering where the single main place to look is or if we have to go on a hunt around the internet for any bit of info like it\u2019s a leak or something.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoup","CreatedById":2804,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-22T21:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPast experience has indicated that, unfortunately, there doesn\u0027t seem to be a singular comprehensive place that you can visit for ALL the latest info for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe strategy seems to be to intermingle\u00A0 platforms. For example, it\u0027s advised that bug reports are not handled on Discord and only the forums, but at the same time there\u0027s a fair amount of smaller dev info that is only posted on Discord, with a ticker on the forums to keep up to date with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then things like Twitter get thrown into the mix.
