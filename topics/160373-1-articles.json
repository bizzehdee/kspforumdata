Where does the orbit get higher? That should tell you a little about how to get to other bodies (or other spacecraft, in different orbits). Roughly, you raise or lower an orbit to cross another body\u0027s orbit. The trick is to time it such that you are near the other world\u0027s orbit\u00A0when that world happens to be there as well. KSP fails to provide tools for this (it should), btut you can try with maneuver nodes to see what happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a craft in orbit over Kerbin. Place a node and simply pull the prograde burn marker, watching the orbit rise on the other side from the maneuver node. Pick the Mun to start, and select the Mun as target (in map view). You\u0027ll see markers showing how close you will come to the Mun. If you move the maneuver node around the orbit you are in, you\u0027ll get a feel for how much you need to lead the target.

For someone unfamiliar with physics or spaceflight this game is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E, especially at first. You really have to do the research and practice a lot to get good at it. It takes patience, smarts, knowledge and determination; getting skilled affirms these virtues in yourself. You just don\u0027t get that feeling of being a steely-eyed rocket man when you solve your all your troubles by hitting Alt-F12.\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EThat\u0027s\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethe cheating you should feel bad about, because it\u0027s a huge part of the long term enjoyment of the game and you\u0027re missing out on it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T23:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223049804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160373\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221494282325\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022175702\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Avery616\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/8/2017 at 5:25 PM, Avery616 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in KSP i cheat a lot \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E Basically i don\u0027t know much about orbital maneuvering. I can get into orbit around kerbin. And modify the orbit to make it higher or lower and make it into a polar orbit and back but that\u0027s it. I don\u0027t\u00A0 know how to get between celestial body\u0027s. So when i do get between them i use the cheat screen and turn on unlimited fuel. I do put limits on my cheat usage through by requiring fuel usage turned on to get the craft to space and to make the initial orbit around kerbin and...that\u0027s it. I guess i feel really bad about using all these cheats. So should i feel bad about this? Is this a bad thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo? It\u0027s not like you\u0027re playing the board game \u0022Battleship\u0022 with another player and move your vessels around between every third turn. Or playing Monopoly, as the banker, pay yourself an additional $200 as the other players pass \u0022go.\u0022 Those examples would be cheating. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you are describing is simply having fun in a one-player game.
