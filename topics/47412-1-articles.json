I\u0027ve never had much luck with either. I find it easier just to go to orbit, then land again from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe suborbital hop, if done perfectly, would probably be the cheapest on fuel. However, you have to guestimate how much to lead the target, which takes practice. And you have to get the hopper properly oriented to make an accurate \u0022gravity turn\u0022 immediately upon leaving the ground. And then you have to pitch over just the right amount and burn just the right amount so that your gestimation of required lead turns out to be rght. If you arc too high, you fly longer so the target moves more. And being just a few hairs off at point in the launch process will put you miles off target. So, you\u0027ll most likely have to proceed in a series of short hops instead of trying to do it all at once, each time, risking landing on too steep an incline or at least on one that causes even more difficulties getting heading the right way when launching the next hop. All this adds up to a lot of fuel and frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find that hoverers are a LOT easier to get going in the right direction, especially because you can more easily steer them once you get moving. However, Mun\u0027s gravity is enough to require pretty substantial upwards thrust pretty much continuously, which either means short trips or a rather bigger thing than the job really calls for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why I just say screw it and go direct to orbit in whatever direction the hopper\u0027s facing on whatever hillside it starts from. Odds are, your destination isn\u0027t at the same latitude as where you start so you actually want an inclined orbit. So, just wait a few orbits until your target is in the right place relative to your flightpath so you lead it correctly during your descent, deorbit, and land like normal. This just seems much easier and stree-free compare to the other methods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T03:33:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThirdHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo I have a few bases set up on the Mun, and I\u0027m looking for a good way to move supplies/Kerbals from place-to-place.
