For a game this complex this is quite a feat.\n\nAnd is it worth its money? YES! definitely yes. Like hellion13 said, it was worth its money since 0.18 at least.\n\nKSP isn\u0027t like any other game. KSP is more like your first LEGO-set. Thanks to the incredibly awesome modding community you can build on it, extend it, change it, play every variation you can think of and make it the very game you want it to be."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:00:47Z","Content":"Isn\u0027t there already a thread on the exact same subject as the OP???\n\nEdit: Yep, right below this....."},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T14:09:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Isn\u0027t there already a thread on the exact same subject as the OP???\n\u003E Edit: Yep, right below this.....\n\nTitle similar, thread contents not even close.\n\nAll the \u0027stuff\u0027 going on in these forums just goes to prove the internet peanut gallery is alive and well.

There are aspects to the latest Batman game that are in a totally different league. Despite the horrific bugs, the optimizations on Batman are still miles and miles ahead of KSP. The texture and terrain qualities are also beyond compare. I doubt KSP could handle even 1% of the digital assets present in Batman.\n\nConsidering the hardware we have today, the fact that games like Batman even run is miraculous. Graphics cards are not magic. Pushing top-tier games through them requires skills and training wholly absent in Squad. They are in two different development universes."},{"CreatedByName":"Megadeath","CreatedById":144236,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:17:15Z","Content":"Anytime I think of a game shipping broken, my mind jumps to skyrim. I\u0027m surprised fewer comparisons with it come up. When it first released (on console, mind you) the game was almost unplayable. But I still considered it money well spent, restarting every 30 minutes and all.\n\nI Heard about KSP late, and didn\u0027t buy it till 0.9. Before that I played the demo, and if I\u0027d paid as much for the demo, as I did for .9 ($30Aus) it would still have been one of the best, and by far best value of all the games I\u0027ve played. It\u0027s not perfect, and it really shouldn\u0027t be consider as a \u003E1.0 build since they\u0027re still adding features, but it\u0027s infinitely better than it\u0027s competition, because there is none."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T09:20:15Z","Content":"On the other hand Batman is shaped rather unaerodynamically and his thrust levels are also quite low.
