This isn\u0027t much use with the stock set of parts, but can be pretty useful in combination with things like the Joyeuese 2\u002B1 couplers. (The example rocket OrbitalTwelve requires those couplers in addition to the rotated tricouplers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbitalTwelve tweaked to use latest version of the Joyeuese couplers and updated for KSP 0.8.1, with realigned solids.
