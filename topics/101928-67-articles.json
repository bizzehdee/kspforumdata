On the ground I assume you\u0027re meant to move parts along the ground by repeatedly picking them up and placing them, which works since you have some ground to use, in orbit you don\u0027t have anything to gradually shift it with like that, and keeping kerbals near parts in orbit is a real pain (perhaps extend the distance some in orbit?).\n\nReason I use KIS for orbital construction is that OKS parts are so large that it\u0027s hard to get em all into orbit at once, and adding senior docking ports between all parts triples the partcount of a station and makes it really floppy.\n\nNot sure how to improve the orbital construction, one idea I got that I\u0027m not sure is possible to implement is to have 2 or more kerbals grab onto large parts in orbit and basically work like RCS thrusters for the part, maneuver the part until it\u0027s chosen attachment point (surface, nodes) is close enough to another part and have it attach after you push a button to confirm the placement."},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T13:29:09Z","Content":"**K3|Chris**: There\u0027s more to manipulating mass than just lifting it.

In all cases though, open the zip or rar and keep opening folders until you find the Gamedata folder in it. Copy the contents of that folder to your own KSPs Gamedata folder. If there is no Gamedata folder in the zip, just copy the root folder across to inside your KSPs Gamedata. But in 100% of cases I know of, if a folder contains a version number e.g. KAS\\_v0.5.4, then it should never be in KSP\\Gamedata.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Okay, I don\u0027t have that.

The solar panel will become its own ship, which you can then delete in the tracking station.
