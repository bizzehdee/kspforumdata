On the ground I assume you\u0027re meant to move parts along the ground by repeatedly picking them up and placing them, which works since you have some ground to use, in orbit you don\u0027t have anything to gradually shift it with like that, and keeping kerbals near parts in orbit is a real pain (perhaps extend the distance some in orbit?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReason I use KIS for orbital construction is that OKS parts are so large that it\u0027s hard to get em all into orbit at once, and adding senior docking ports between all parts triples the partcount of a station and makes it really floppy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how to improve the orbital construction, one idea I got that I\u0027m not sure is possible to implement is to have 2 or more kerbals grab onto large parts in orbit and basically work like RCS thrusters for the part, maneuver the part until it\u0027s chosen attachment point (surface, nodes) is close enough to another part and have it attach after you push a button to confirm the placement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-21T13:29:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EK3|Chris\u003C/strong\u003E: There\u0027s more to manipulating mass than just lifting it.

I\u0027m having the same issue, anyone has a solution/workaround?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t manipulate broken solar panels with KIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best you can do at the moment is detach the parent part from both the rest of the ship and the solar panel, by repeatedly using \u0022H\u0022 (and maybe \u0022G\u0022 at the end) on the parent part. The solar panel will become its own ship, which you can then delete in the tracking station. You can then reassemble the ship (since it\u0027s now probably in 15 pieces, depending on what the parent part was).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T02:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25305\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecould KIS make a parachute pack/item to wear that has a chute to deploy? such as EVA chutes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Samapico","CreatedById":125867,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T05:09:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKIS needs a selfie stick prop that kerbals can use and take screenshots with!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V8jester","CreatedById":136093,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-05T19:00:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey does anyone know how to set the max radius for the KIS bomb in its cfg to start higher than 10m?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T14:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022V8jester\u0022 data-cite=\u0022V8jester\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHey does anyone know how to set the max radius for the KIS bomb in its cfg to start higher than 10m?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry using several spaced 15m apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Verios44","CreatedById":125676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:00:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny compatability issues with 1.0.5 I need to be aware of?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fireblade274","CreatedById":134571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T16:07:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Verios44\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Verios44\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAny compatability issues with 1.0.5 I need to be aware of?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyea when you launch the game it says cant use mod please use 1.04\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
