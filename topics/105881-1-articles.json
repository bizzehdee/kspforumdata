She fell down a few meters to the desert ground (west of KSC) since I have no ladders yet. The moment she touched ground the whole solar system disappeared. I was able to go back to the KSC-Screen, but there was only bird chirping in space, no buildings, no Kerbin. After completely closing and relaunching the game I had do load my quicksave where she was still in space. So I landed again but now all the nice things like \u0022Reach 2500 m/s\u0022 missions are gone and thus the chain of getting the \u0022next level\u0022 of them seems to be broken. :\u0027(\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreetings,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArti\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
