You are stuck with gel - a gel you should be able to replenish, and produce out of organic waste, or synthesize it in some way. In any case you\u0027ll need the production/recycling facilities. Definitely more complicated than algae tank or lichen(though lichen would need atmospheric nitrogen)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need \u0027plant nutrients\u0027 - you need nitrogen and magnesium obviously (no green - no profit), some phosphorous and a dozen other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlants need a lot of water. Plants are mostly water, you\u0027ll need to bring quite a lot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever when I get to think about it the biggest problem is space (no pun intended). If we assume that you can somehow grow our known crops, 2800kcal/day, no waste, multiple cucles:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes rather large space to produce food for a single person, the less energy dense, the more space you need (it will also weigh more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider lettuce - biggest part of it is edible, but... at 130kcal/kg, you need like - 20kg per day \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E (not that you could survive eating only that but). Now since lettuce does not grow overnight, you\u0027ll need 25-45 days for maturity. Do the math. Tomatoes are 180kcal/kg. So if you see sci-fi where people grow lettuce or tomatoes in in space, and are self sufficient, feel free to have laugh about it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk potatoes are at 700/kg, and rather easy and resilient. Still that is 3-4kg in food alone. (though you\u0027ll probably need no drinking water at all). Still you need quite some space to grow them. Two square meter of crop will yield your daily consumption. It takes 70 days for the crop to mature, so need some 140 square meters to feed a person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven cereals need quite a lot of space. If you ate only cereal, (around 3000/kg) (assuming earth peak efficiency, and multiple harvests), you\u0027d need around 1-2 square meter for required daily meal. The time it takes to harvest can be anywhere between 60 and 200 days (though you don\u0027t actually need to plant the stuff for 200 days, but store the seed at particular conditions). Quite some difficult to recycle biomass stays behind as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is of course the miracle soybean (4400/kg \u002B calcium and other good stuff). Unfortunately, its is pretty low yield, however also low plant, so if you are growing it on racks, will probably end up as most cereals. Also needs the micro-flora and atmospheric nitrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeanuts - well if they somehow manage to grow these they\u0027d be great at 5700/kg and similar yield to soybean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately most other nuts come from trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorn is well - pretty tall\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need different types of plants for diet which won\u0027t kill you with malnourishment. source of protein, source of fat, calcium etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood processing - human digestion system is rather bad in absorbing energy from raw ingredients, and most high energy foods are not exactly edible when raw. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnergy - most standard plants seem to be pretty dependent on the light cycle, greenhouse on the moon might be an issue - you\u0027ll need to provide artificial light etc. When it\u0027s dark, plants actually release more CO2 than they absorb (and lose biomass) Also if you are going to outer planets, you\u0027ll get less solar energy etc... So more lights, batteries etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELife/recycling byproducts - You need to collect every gas, every liquid, every solid. You need to process them differently - Nitrogen - phosphorous oxides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecycling - it\u0027s a lot more complicated than \u0022let it rot in the soil\u0027. . It can take months and years for process to complete. You take part you eat it, it ends up some place else. We got issues with that on Earth, that\u0027s why we fertilize, crop rotate, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPollination - no fruit without pollination, certainly solvable problem though. Tuberous crops/greens don\u0027t have this issue in general, however most fruit/nut/bean/cereal require pollination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHybrids - most high yield crops we use are hybrids - that is you\u0027ll need a lab to produce high yield seed, or grow non hybrid progenitors separately for seed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are of course other venues - algae tank, or lichens (no gel very little waste, one of the promising )\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T17:46:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aedile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aedile","CreatedById":104353,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T18:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panarchist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panarchist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, no, they need about 2,800 calories.
