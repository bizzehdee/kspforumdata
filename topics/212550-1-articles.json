I clicked the palette icon to open the colour manager tab. I can\u0027t find any way to close it. Clicking the button again doesn\u0027t do anything, and there\u0027s no \u0022x\u0022 button in the corner of the tab. If this is a bug I\u0027ll make a report, but I\u0027d like to know beforehand if I\u0027m just missing something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brettpersson","CreatedById":202314,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T01:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick on Selection Tool to the left and it will close the color manager.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"modus","CreatedById":207631,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T08:09:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it would be so much easier if you could just click it again to close it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T08:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay questions\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FuelX","CreatedById":163054,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T13:28:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes clicking the other buttons in the toolbox close it.
