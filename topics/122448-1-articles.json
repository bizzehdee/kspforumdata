It was the easiest part of the flight for me. Now, however, something has gone awry and I\u0027m not quite sure what it is. Basically, when I try to launch a rocket (a design I\u0027ve used successfully in the past), whenever I start to angle it to begin to gain horizontal velocity it continues the maneuver, uncontrollably, until it flips and points completely upside down. I checked COM, because I have a sneaking suspicion it is related to this, however it is just about in the center of the rocket which I thought was, more or less, the proper place for it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am really at a bit of a loss as to why the rocket is flipping over.

Simply lock the upper few tanks so fuel is taken from the bottom stack and thus keeping the rocket top heavy (which is good). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOR simply use \u0022fine\u0022 control mode by pressing CAPSLOCK.

In that case, I just let it reach a higher altitude and try to pitchover again. Once your CoM is in control (locking the upper tanks until you drain the lower ones, or your rocket stages in a way to do this) and you\u0027re in the thinner atmosphere, you shouldn\u0027t flip much at all.
