However, we were anticipating a lot sharper rocks. The EVA suit used on Apollo was a two-layer garment, each of which was then made up of several sublayers itself. Not counting the \u0022union suit\u0022 water-cooled long underwear, you had the pressure suit itself, which was \u0022a one piece, five-layer \u0022torso-limb\u0022 suit with convoluted joints made of synthetic and natural rubber at the shoulders, elbows, wrist, hips, ankle, and knee joints, \u0022link-net\u0022 meshing to prevent the suit from ballooning at the joints, and a shoulder \u0022cable block\u0022 assembly to allow the shoulder to be extended and retracted by its wearer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver that, you had the Integrated Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment, the tough white cover layer that everyone associates with EVA suits (the actual pressure suit itself on the Apollo suits was light blue!). This was to protect the pressure suit from abrasion by dust, rocks, or contact with the LM, protect it from possible micrometeoroid penetration, and was white to help control heat buildup in the suit. \u0022The garment was made from thirteen layers of material which were (from inside to outside): rubber coated nylon, 5 layers of aluminized Mylar, 4 layers of nonwoven Dacron, 2 layers of aluminized Kapton film/Beta marquisette laminate, and Teflon coated Beta filament cloth. Additionally, the ITMG also used a patch of \u0027Chromel-R\u0027 woven steel (the familiar silver-colored patch seen especially on the suits worn by the Apollo 11 crew) for abrasion protection from the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) backpack. Chromel-R was also used on the uppers of the lunar boots and on the EVA gloves. Finally, patches of Teflon were used for additional abrasion protection on the knees waist and shoulders of the ITMG.\u0022 Basically, even though we didn\u0027t know how abrasive the dust was, we DID provide them with a cover layer over the actual pressure suit itself that was just this side of being bulletproof. Most likely our next-generation lunar suit (and Mars suit, and other surface-exploration suits) will use a lot of Kevlar in the ITMG, to provide even better impact resistance. I do know that the Project Constellation Lunar Surface Activity Module (the big brother to the Apollo Lunar Module) was going to include a full airlock that could act as a \u0022mud room\u0022 for putting on and removing the EVA suits, preventing dust contamination of the spacecraft itself, and that it\u0027s now expected that future EVA suits will use a \u0022suitlock\u0022 feature where they mount directly to the hatch with an airtight seal, with their own rear entry hatch, so that instead of having to carry a heavy airlock, future spacecraft will carry the EVA suits on the outside and the crew will merely enter and exit them directly into the spacecraft. (The prototype of this can be seen on the prototype Surface Exploration Vehicle. Presumably, there will remain a small airlock for loading surface samples into the spacecraft, but that\u0027s smaller and lighter than a human-sized airlock, much less the consumables required to depressurize and repressurize the entire vehicle whenever an EVA starts and ends, like was done on Apollo.)

(According to astronaut Michael L. Gernhardt, \u0022[a] big leak\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AClike a big hole in the suit, say a half-inch hole or something like that, or if your glove blew off\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20ACwould pretty much be a real bad day for you.\u0022) Thus far, there has only been one known suit puncture, on STS-37, when a glove was punctured. The leak was partially sealed by the astronaut\u0027s own blood(!), and nobody even noticed the puncture until the suit was inspected back on Earth.

(From what I understand, in terms of the level of silicosis, having been on one of the Apollo \u0022J-missions\u0022 with the lunar rover, three days on the lunar surface, and five or six EVAs, meaning breathing quite a lot of lunar dust, is about equivalent to spending one year or so working in a coal mine. You\u0027ll end up with detectible silicosis, but it\u0027s not enough to hinder you in any way; you\u0027ll just cough a bit more often and be a little more susceptible to sinus infections and chest colds, and might not even notice it if you weren\u0027t being monitored so closely for medical effects from your space flight...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the record, the \u0022tongs\u0022 they mentioned at the end of the video essentially *are* the same as a set of $10 reach extenders; they were primarily intended for picking up rock samples, since you can\u0027t really bend very well in a pressure suit. They also proved quite adept at retrieving dropped tools, and, when fitted with the head of a six-iron, performing one-handed sandtrap shots...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-24T14:21:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2013 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rdfox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
