I\u0027ve been eying off Kerbal for about a year, and finally have a heap of spare time, so I purchased last week, and since then have blown lots of things up, crashed into the Mun quite a few times, launched a successful multi-stage rescue mission to get Jeb off the Mun which led to me building a base on the Mun, now I\u0027m scanning planets for Karbonite \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027m so hooked, it\u0027s a bit scary.

I get the odd bit of random lag and an occasional CTD but nothing unrecoverable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeeling good about the community here as well..
