You will also notice that this file contains the boolean value\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022isHomeWorld\u0022: 1,\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that by changing this to 0 and setting it to 1 for another planet, you could play the game from another planet, which could be fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the problem is that changing the value of the field radius does not work as expected, and a bunch of problems arise, like the fact that the coulds and atmosphere are now below the surface, and Kerbin ends up with no atmosphere, as well as much more serious problems when going into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt thus looks like simply changing the value of the field\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022radius\u0022: 600000.0\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ewith AssetBundleExtractor is not enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWould someone here have enough knowledge of Unity and of asset bundle to explain me how to properly modify the size of planets in KSP 2 ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E I\u0027m out of ideas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance to you all !!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunas Only Moon","CreatedById":224915,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-21T13:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a unity user but i think if you change the homeworld to 0 and dont let anything be a homeworld, the game will reset the values\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atipique","CreatedById":228724,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-24T02:24:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes but what about the radius ?
