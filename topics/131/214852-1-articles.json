I\u0027m interested in creating/editing some partfiles. Seems like the part definitions are rather similar to ksp1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSaw that Space-Warp\u00A0has some support to load Assetbundles but in the mods currently out there it is only used for the UI elemets and I\u0027am not that sure if and how it would work for parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought it wouldn\u0027t that hard to edit existing ones and saw that the medium size nuclear engine is included but currently hidden. In it\u0027s json file it has the \u0022oabEditorCategory\u0022 property set to \u0022NONE\u0022 and for all other useable parts it is set to \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0022. So it looks promissing that it could be activated by changing the property and repack it in the old bundle or otherwise in a new one and load it with a mod. Also all necessary information to create some of the future interstellar engines is included in the files so it would be possible to create them. Only the ressource definitions for antimater and helium are missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any easy way (or a good guide to do similar) to bundle custom partfiles or edit existing ones in bundles?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-10T21:01:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2023 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Mukki\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"munix","CreatedById":212686,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T21:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need Unity (KSP 2 uses version 2020.3.33) to package addressables, which are used for parts, and you can find the general process in Unity documentation.
