I think it was a beautiful piece of engineering and I loved watching it launch. It had some unique capabilities that served us well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0But the way I see it, \u003Cu\u003Ewe just don\u0027t need those capabilities anymore.\u003C/u\u003E We\u0027re not building any new space stations or repairing Hubble. Moreover, the STS was never as safe or cost- effective as other launch vehicles for the job of delivering crews or payload to LEO.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0The Shuttle was sucking up NASA\u0027s budget, getting old and more dangerous with each flight, and keeping us confined to LEO. It was time to let it go and move on IMO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I loved it when we had it. I and all of my nerd buddies went out and drank a toast to it on the successful conclusion of it\u0027s last flight... but I don\u0027t mourn it. I\u0027m glad we\u0027re moving on to bigger and more ambitious projects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest,\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Slashy\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T01:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a rather remarkable and iconic launch vehicle. Perhaps with a more focused development process it could\u0027ve been an excellent launch vehicle, but it tried to accomplish too many things at once and was unable to accomplish them all. We learned a lot of costly lessons from the Space Shuttle, which have helped inform us as we attempt to fill the many goals of this all-in-one vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn example of the tradeoffs: the USAF wanted it to be able to carry Keyhole satellites, which meant a large cargo bay and payload capacity. That drove development of the very high-performance RS-25, an engine so complex that it probably would have been cheaper just to build new engines to a simpler design each time. Use of this extremely expensive and complicated engine drove up costs, reducing its effectiveness as a cost-effective launch platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe RS-25 in particular has probably served as an object lesson to SpaceX and Blue Origin, who focused more on ensuring their engines were robust enough for reuse than on extracting every ounce of performance they could out of their engines. The Merlin is an open-cycle gas generator, the BE-4 operates at a relatively low chamber pressure, and the Raptor uses methane rather than kerosene to reduce coking in the engine (something that also goes for the BE-4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat it was a manned vehicle:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight have been necessary for reuseability at the time, due to poor computer hardware and the need for precision landings (though this is to me an argument that the Shuttle was ahead of its time).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDrove up refurbishment costs because the parts for a man-rated vehicle have to be very thoroughly checked (not to mention the spotty abort mode coverage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConflicted with the intent to use it as a cargo vehicle. The cost of everything goes up for a man-rated vehicle, such that it\u0027s best to send the cargo up separately in a cheaper-per-kilogram purely cargo vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile there were some remarkable missions carried out by the Shuttle, such as servicing the Hubble Space Telescope and building large sections of the ISS, I\u0027m glad it\u0027s retired: it was too expensive and too dangerous to continue flying. It\u0027s taken longer than I would\u0027ve liked, but now we\u0027re finally returning to the capacities we once had. The US is now becoming a leading launch services provider, the Commercial Crew Program should transport astronauts to LEO by 2019 (maybe even this year), and between SpaceX, Blue Origin, and ULA, we\u0027ll have a variety of medium to heavy launch vehicles to conduct ambitious missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the Senate Launch System, but the one good thing I\u0027ll say about that is that it\u0027s probably safer than the Space Shuttle was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-15T01:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Shuttle played a big part in me deciding to become an astronaut as a young child, so I\u0027ll give it that.
