At least not without some upgrades.

Despite their common usage on the forums (and despite the fact that KSP uses meters for length, tonnes for mass, kiloNewtons for force, etc.), the unit of volume is not quantified in the game.

Then, voila! The fuel densities are no longer five times higher than expected, and the capacities of the fuel tanks are no longer five times smaller than expected.
