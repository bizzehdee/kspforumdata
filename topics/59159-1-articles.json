You can look at it from perspective that black hole is static and the rest of the universe is flying by. So an object orbiting a black hole will orbit it exactly the same way regardless of whether it\u0027s moving or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, from perspective of an outside observer, orbital motion around a body traveling at .99c is going to look weird due to time dilation and length contraction. This is so regardless of the source. But with black hole, orbiting object itself can be traveling at high fraction of c, making it more pronounced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022WestAir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022WestAir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFinally, if two stellar black holes traveling in opposite directions, each with a velocity of 0.99C relative to the Galactic Disc, collided head on, would the resulting deceleration allow the singularity to become visible to an outside observer before the ergo-sphere re stabilized?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActual collision is above my pay grade. GR is non-linear, so things will get crazy before the two event horizons overlap. Before that, a ton of energy would be released as the two accelerate towards each other. Once they merge, however, no energy can escape, so all that kinetic energy would end up contributing to new black hole\u0027s mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrostX1","CreatedById":99553,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T12:53:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/7e5-0t0pTF0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI feel this will explain.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat video explains that Morgan Freeman is omnipotent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe is everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobhendly","CreatedById":70841,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would pay Morgan freeman 86 Million Dollars to read me a child\u0027s bedtime story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe power of the FREEMAN.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
