\u00A0I removed the aeroshell and guess what, it launched just fine into a polar orbit. \u00A0There has to be something i don\u0027t understand at work here. \u00A0How can a part that is supposed to reduce drag increase it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce launched successfully it was quite routine to obtain the scans, kerbin scanned first followed by the Mun. \u00A0Unfortunately I couldn\u0027t find a Minmus encounter with my remaining fuel that the Mun didn\u0027t interfere with and I was unable to find an approach resulting in a stable minmus polar orbit with my remaining DV. \u00A0Simply put I had not packed quite enough fuel,rather than leave the device in a useless Minmus orbit\u00A0I sent M700SAT off into a kerbol flyby instead to fulfil a contract and launched a second M700 to scan minmus. \u00A0Things got weird again, the same design would not launch into an equatorial orbit with or without aeroshell. \u00A0The LV had gone back to flipping at around 6-10 KM or 350 m/s aprox. \u00A0The fix this time?
