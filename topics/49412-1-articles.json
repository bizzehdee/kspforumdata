First, you don\u0027t need to refuel as you can create a stock ship that can visit all of the Kerbal solar system without refueling. And second, when the mining parts patch comes along, space stations are not gonna be generating fuel, so your better off just mining and filling up on a planet you ran out of fuel on. I think some form of resource generation from space stations seems appropriate. Science generation would make sense while fuel and Kerbal bucks doesn\u0027t.

Why haul around a couple tons of food for two way mission to Jool when you can haul enough for the initial journey, resupply from \u0022Laythe Orbital Gardens\u0022, land or do whatever, then send the kerbals back to dock with the station to chill and eat all the food there until the return transfer window. Now there\u0027s simply no reason to keep your little green men in space suits chilling on a station from a gameplay perspective, or to dock with one apart from refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor science I think the problem with stations is difficulty of putting a station into orbit versus benefits. In real life while putting a station into orbit or assembling it is difficult, the main issue is keeping them continuously supplied. The latter in KSP doesn\u0027t really happen unless it is a refueling station. But why not send experiment specimens/materials/tools to a station? You send the necessary stuff, transfer it to the station\u0027s lab and start experiments. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned earlier in this topic it takes a long time to finish them, it could be a fixed length or a varied random length. You can either have the \u0022payout\u0022 be in a single message when the duration of the experiment is over or gradually over the course of the experiment. Although the latter would require a some new GUI elements so you don\u0027t miss the fact you\u0027re getting science. Once the experiment is over you can send something new there and work on that. 3-4 different kinds of experiments for the orbital lab total, with separate science pools and once long running experiment not draining the entire pool like other experiments. It would take effort to get those points, although it could resemble a bit of a grind (but then again you can farm science from all Mun biomes rather than go beyond for a long time, depends what you like). Another issue I see with this is how do you justify seeing how kerbin spiders weave webs in a Jool station as getting you more science, sans typical kerbal silliness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I think that the problem with space stations is that they\u0027re not that good for interesting gameplay from a pure SCIENCE! perspective, landing is more fun. I think that if they tied into the greater logistics of going into space somehow, providing incetive to build and dock with them, people would also be inclined to use them for science as an icing on the cake feature. You need a station to refuel around Jool or to restock on tasty Kerbmatos from the hydroponics gardens, why not add a science lab to it so it can do something more as well? Even if the reward wouldn\u0027t be big or \u0022instant\u0022 like from landing and getting a soil sample, you would feel inclined to do space station science because it would require little extra effort and you would want to send spece stations somewhere for other and arguably better gameplay reasons than science which you can get from other sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMapping or long term observation orbiters are another thing, I would personally be happy if probe cameras could do \u0022crew reports\u0022 as you fly over biomes. After you take a few snapshots yourself you could leave it in orbit for long term study, by setting it in such a mode, and have the probe inform you when it has data ready to send back. Long term study for experiments could be a seperate but minor pool. Not big discoveries so you don\u0027t feel forced to time warp and do nothing (unless you are obsessed with getting everything ASAP, I know that there are such people). But that would need an event notification GUI like a log or calendar, which we need anyway for true multiple mission at the same time space program gameplay, if only to integrate Kerbal Alarm Clock features into the core game (which are really needed, especially the launch window calendar).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stijnovic","CreatedById":57858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T12:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, space stations need a real role in the science part.
