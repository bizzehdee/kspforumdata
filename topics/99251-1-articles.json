The small jet folds back for thrust and the rotor blades telescope out, most likely the rotor mount flips up from behind the seat. I assume that altitude control was mainly via throttle. Being a gyrocopter, landing would be simple. Cut the throttle and let it autorotate down. No danger of the rotor stopping because it\u0027s airflow through it that makes it spin.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T09:13:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T05:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ll need IR for that.

Might be able to do it manually. I got Spaceplane Guidance to crash it once without killing Jeb. Knocked one rotor completely off and two blades off the other. The pastebinned one is the last revision of a large number of revisions. Might be a bit bendy without KJR. All stock parts except for the IR free spinning docking washers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I tried a single rotor but for some reason the movement through the air only spins the rotors at a slow speed. With a single rotor it gets retreating blade stall at the slow RPM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt holds altitude and heading with SAS or MechJeb\u0027s spaceplane guidance. Doesn\u0027t handle too bad with manual piloting. Proof of concept but without having rotor blades that will windmill a lot faster it\u0027s not too practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil this last revision they all had poor roll stability. This one has the rotors tilted inward a little, and with the four ailerons it\u0027s much less rocky in the roll axis. Still wants to dive, smack the runway, bounce, flip on its side and explode when landing. Probably should put a parachute on the radial attachment part but nobody at Alan Aerospace Recycling and Packaging knows how to sew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/r8b3Rp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7285/16490095385_08f037ddfa_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216490095385_08f037ddfa_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/r8b3Rp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot24\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/27748767@N08/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eg_alan_e\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/qQHnFn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16303826759_5ff903a0a9_z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002216303826759_5ff903a0a9_z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/qQHnFn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot23\u003C/a\u003E by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.flickr.com/people/27748767@N08/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eg_alan_e\u003C/a\u003E, on Flickr\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T09:12:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 09:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
