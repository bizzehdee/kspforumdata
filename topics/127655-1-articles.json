For me, this means my art team\u00A0can improve the visuals a lot. Alternately I could have improved the performance. This might help KSP as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLower memory consumption.\u00A0I don\u0027t know why, but we\u0027re using 30% less memory than Unity 4 on iOS (I haven\u0027t profiled on OS X or Windows since we don\u0027t really care on those). Since I don\u0027t know why, I can\u0027t predict the effect on KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn iOS, the il2cpp backend is much\u00A0faster than Mono AOT. Totally irrelevant to KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFaster development speed\u00A0because I can ditch a couple of plugins I was using that now have built-in equivalents, so now I don\u0027t have to wait for them to recompile and reimport their assets. I don\u0027t know if this helps KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cost:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSome old plugins don\u0027t work anymore. In particular, iOS -- we yanked some old features because we couldn\u0027t port them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSome of my code doesn\u0027t quite work anymore either.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHad to redo all the shaders. I wanted to anyway, but it\u0027s still a cost.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSwitching has taken a couple of months, and I\u0027ve probably got an order of magnitude less complicated a system than KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T15:54:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm hoping we at a minimum get out pre 1.0 performance back (the new heating and aero have really harmed FPS with larger vessels), with teh ability to have one core per vessel at a minimum allowing say 3-4 500 part ships loaded in the same area with total part count exceeding say 1500 parts and not much lag.\u00A0 Ive hear that only one core works per vessel, but that would be fine if well, each core can at a minimum support 1 500 part ship (back in 0.90 i could easily have 1 500 part ship before lagfest kills my enjoyment of the game).\u00A0 RIght now, anything above 300 parts starts to get some stutter/lagging, and anything above 500 parts becomes laggy enough to make the game not very enjoyable.\u00A0 Honestly if i wasnt dependent on many of the new features id prolly revert to 0.90 and play that one as the lag was way less and not as much of an issue there, but ive taken too much a liking to the new bugfixes in 1.0.5, so despite the fact that i actually liked the 0.90 aero more (i mean common, sci-fi stuff worked so much better back when jets had orbital velocity, and perfectly flat flying saucers flew fine sideways, ect ect ect), i think ill stick to 1.0.5 since many of the really agrevating bugs were fixed (claw is useable which is good as its my primary method of docking 2 ships together, water isnt a guaranteed wet grave, ships dont randomly explode due to energy flowing from cold to hot areas, ect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
