The problem is where they have to \u0027grab\u0027 or \u0027climb\u0027 back. I just can\u0027t seem to manage it. I get them to the bottom of the ladder, click F for grab or climb, they move onto the ladder and slip back down. I have tried adding several ladders to see if that helps, but no, the same thing happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do you all get them back in?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeith\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T16:45:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich version are you running? Is it modded? That problem should have been mostly fixed around version 1.2.1 or something. If you are sliding down and off ladders once you have grabbed them, then tap W to climb a bit to counteract the sliding problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T17:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like maybe you are going past the top of your ladder? Boarding can be tricky, close enough is not close enough with a ladder I had just off to the side of the port. Grab the ladder, tap the \u0027W\u0027 key to climb and look for the \u0027B\u0027 board. Maybe if you posted a screen shot we could see where the problem is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T17:27:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo mods, and it is the new beta version. I am not going past the ladder, it is trying to actually get on and stay on. However, by adding lots of ladders it can be done, but it is not that easy. Tapping the w does help though, once I ma on the ladder. Not sure if a screenshot would help, but I\u00A0can certainly add one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander I created had four rockets on the sides of the fuel tank, the ladder to the capsule in the middle. I think there was not enough space for the ladder - but I will try to post the pciture and see what you think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T17:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the fuel tanks are knocking you off the ladder? I have had some luck with the space bar for a jump, but you have to be ready to grab the ladder on either your way up or back down. Sometimes I will even get the \u0027B\u0027 board during my jump.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ty Tan Tu","CreatedById":167214,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T18:00:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suppose it would rather tricky, but maybe you could utilize you jet pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-04T18:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk - the issue seemed to be getting on the ladder. The new lander has the side rockets higher, so the ladder reaches the ground - almost. By using the F key and then the W key it seems to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe morale of this story is to ensure your ladders get close enough to the ground! I have little luck with the rocket pack - not very good at using that.

Something I always do is try out landers on the Launchpad first to eliminate teething problems. Rovers get a full field test around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E to check not just drivability but also entry/exit, resetting experiments etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
