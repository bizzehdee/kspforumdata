It is one of the facts that I used to check my work. It gave me some comfort that the values calculated by the current re-entry heat physics model that is used in the module already agree quite well with this. You can set the \u0022DisplayHeatShieldUI\u0022 parameter to \u0022True\u0022 in the heat shield\u0027s part.cfg file if you want to view the shock temperature all throughout the re-entry.

This explains the current re-entry heat physics model in detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the question then becomes, do we use a physics model that has at least some physical significance and basis in aerodynamics \u0026amp; thermodynamics, or do we just fudge it? I prefer to stay with the physics model currently used in the module because it isn\u0027t just based on a rough rule-of-thumb. This allows re-entry effects to be varied somewhat realistically for different planets, merely by changing one or two constants in the model. The model will then respond according to the properties of the atmosphere that exists on that planet. That is the way it works right now, with the exception that gamma and the simplified heat transfer coefficient are the same for every planet/moon with an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as for making this module work with other heat shield/aeroshell parts, maybe the best way to do that would be to expose the HEAT_DAMAGE_LIMITS constant as a parameter that can be set in the part.cfg file. Heat shields and aeroshells that are designed for higher speed re-entries could have higher heat damage tolerance, maybe with a corresponding weight penalty to maintain some play balance and challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-25T20:50:07Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2012 08:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddavis425","CreatedById":14725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T21:52:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI did a short suborbital flight to see the effects, but all I got was 2 puffs of smoke.

Think of it like fried ice cream or waving your hand through a flame. You can expose objects to very high heat for short periods without appreciable heating. When you do a very steep re-entry, the spacecraft slows down so fast due to atmospheric drag that it doesn\u0027t have time to heat up. In that case, the spacecraft is destroyed by g-forces, rather than heating. I regard this effect as another piece of evidence that the re-entry heating physics model is actually working the way it should.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-26T21:07:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/26/2012 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by PakledHostage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
