The ascent stage fires its engine and begins its journey back to the command module. Unfortunately though, it only carries enough fuel for a suborbital flight, so it has to rely on RCS fuel in order not to crash. This detail was, however, not released to the public, because it\u0027s basically equivalent to an ocean liner propelling itself by wagging its rudder from side to side, which looks really silly and is really embarrassing for the owners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aylSIaJ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aylSIaJ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rSAE5h6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rSAE5h6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PMyNq1r.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022PMyNq1r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELander jettison and departure\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe time has come to return home and the now useless lander has to go, but first everyone searches it for forgotten belongings to make sure no one has to tell his wife that he left his wedding ring in Munar orbit. Once Ribsy has spent a few minutes playing in its seats while imagining what it would\u0027ve been like to land himself, the ascent stage is abandoned.
