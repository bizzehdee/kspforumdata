I loaded my old savegame from before the last update and soon I noticed a weird problem: the flags I planted started falling over. I browsed the forum and apparently I am not the only one, but I couldn\u0027t find a solution. Anyone know what the problem is and if there is a solution? Does anyone know if it only affects flags placed before the update, or is it a problem with newer flags as well? I am considering revisiting the landing sites where the flags are placed, but I also have a backup of my savegame from before I resumed playing, so if there is a solution that prevents the flags from falling over in the first place I would much prefer that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
