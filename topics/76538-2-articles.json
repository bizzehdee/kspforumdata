Don\u0027t know why it should be but I built it to be able to dock to an open node at an orbiting platform (which is what a tug is supposed to be for - providing maneuvering and docking of delivered supplies/objects that join the orbiting platform. It can be launched by itself (.craft file is available but I need help in posting it). It can be attached to other cargo being launched to provide rendezvous and docking assistance even for items with no self guidance. It can pick up an item in orbit, make orbital changes, rendezvous, and dock. The limit is rcs fuel but if the cargo has rcs fuel, the tug can use that too. An all around beast. I have designed a long range add on (extra fuel, ion propulsion, lights, jr size dock adapter, etc.) to prove it could be done but have left that for others to have fun with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1fU8SPpEn50atrCC7W3FyLP4WXjwJLVSe7XmMANJvQ=w260-h259-p-no\u0022 alt=\u00221fU8SPpEn50atrCC7W3FyLP4WXjwJLVSe7XmMANJvQ=w260-h259-p-no\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, enter A.R.M.

The second type is essentially to give a control-less piece of what have you a control module or bring some power and PVs to a damaged craft. Both can obviously be made smaller or more purpose-built depending on what you want to do with them. In my demonstration I attached to a fuel barge I already had out in space.

I made a small mission to supply the beginning of a space station with an energy module. It didn\u0027t use half of its fuel or monopropellant. It is designed with two nuclear engines for small, medium, and large payloads (it has 2 small, 1 medium, and 1 large docking port(s)). Nuclear engines have low thrust and high efficiency making it safer to use and the tug can be used two or three times before returning to the planet with its parachutes(I assume money will play a role in.24 so reusability might become essential). I have two .craft files in the download: one is the tug itself and the tug with a launch stage to get it onto orbit even if you do it very inefficiently (~20,000m gravity turn). The tug has two advanced SAS\u0027s (1 big, 1 small) but it has solar panels and generators to keep the electric charge level nominal. Aesthetically speaking, the design doesn\u0027t look terrible for being an adapter/tug with the all docking port sizes, with nuclear engines, with the generators, and with the ability to return to the planet. There are no action groups beside the ones being automatically set which are the docking lights (red). I took too many pictures just to make sure I got the important parts. To make the crafts more stock-like, I gave them a description:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1. \u003C/strong\u003EFrom the actual tug: \u003Cstrong\u003EReusable Adaper Tug MKIII (Stock)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a simple Space tug which can dock to payloads and vic-versa.

It escalated quickly and the government thought it wasn\u0027t good that companies with the ability to build rockets, missiles, and planes were fighting over something. The design was confiscated and thrown carelessly into a random junkyard. Little did they know that they gave Jebediah Kerman\u0027s Junkyard and Spaceship parts co. this design. The government didn\u0027t bother fighting because they knew Jeb would win the lawsuit anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first two attempts to create an adapter tug failed because it couldn\u0027t pull the heavy payloads very effectively. it hadn\u0027t come kerbals to mind to radially attach engines that didn\u0027t have the word radial in its description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2.\u003C/strong\u003E From the tug with the launch stage:\u003Cstrong\u003E Adaper Tug MKIII (With Launch Rocket)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a small Kerbodyne rocket (small for Kerbodyne) with the Adapter Tug MKIII.
