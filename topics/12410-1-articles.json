Commander Jeb Kerman wasn\\\u0027t taking Bill and Bob with him this time. Sean-lock and Bugsy sat left and right of the legendary Kerbonaut while the rocket began to climb. The large launch gantry tower promptly exploded and caught fire as the searing exhaust reduced it to a hot-lava style mixture. The pad was molten and 300 of Kerbal Space Center\\\u0027s best technicians were flung \u00E2\u20AC\u201C alive \u00E2\u20AC\u201C into the ocean like rag dolls. The rocket was so powerful, in fact, that during building, they didn\\\u0027t calculate for half of the thrust it would actually develop. The Vehicle Assembly building was toppled and three months worth of dangerous and explosive creations leaked toxic rocket exhaust onto the neighborhoods nearby. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Lift off!\u00E2\u20AC Jeb exclaimed, inside the rocket\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He smiled as he built up four G\\\u0027s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153How can you tell?\u00E2\u20AC Sean-lock asked. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I think we\\\u0027re collapsing!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153I can tell because every vertical facility, Kerbal, structure and piece of metal just exploded!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They continued on in this way until the it was time for staging. Jeb pressed a large button reading \u00E2\u20AC\u0153First Stage\u00E2\u20AC. Promptly, the first stage fell away, unbeknownst to the astronauts, with some fuel left in it. The entire booster exploded, throwing hundreds of pieces of metal into the second stage engine bell. Shrapnel peppered the grassy lands below, as the rocket had only just completed the pitch maneuver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Woops.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb joked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153What happened?\u00E2\u20AC Bugsy yelled. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153We\\\u0027re not moving!\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Yeah. The second stage booster just exploded. Stand by.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb spoke calmly. Afterall, he was used to this sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He turned a handle reading \u00E2\u20AC\u0153abort\u00E2\u20AC, which fired the launch escape tower, ripping the capsule away from the third stage booster, now inexplicably burning on a ballistic course towards the next continent. Almost instantaneously, the command module\\\u0027s hatch busted open,depressurizing the cabin at an altitude of 30KM, where the pressure is low enough to kill a Kerbal. Jeb, Sean-lock and Bugsy pressurized their suits immediately and hung on tight to their straps to avoid falling out of the hatch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Hey look!\u00E2\u20AC Jeb laughed. \u00E2\u20AC\u0153We\\\u0027re in zero-G.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Free-fall had its effect on random nuts and bolts now floating around the capsule, suspended in mid air. After passing their Apokee, the command module should have deployed its parachutes, but \u003Cstrong\u003Efortunately\u003C/strong\u003E they were ripped out during the instant cabin depress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Brace yourselves, fellas.\u00E2\u20AC Jeb said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E They pushed back in their seats and slammed into the water doing 119m/s. The entire pod was nearly disintegrated, but Jeb and his fellow explorers suffered nothing but being flung 50 feet. When he surfaced in the middle of the ocean, Jeb looked around, examined his surroundings, analyzed the shape of the vehicle and turned to Sean-Lock and Bugsy to spit some water out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00E2\u20AC\u0153Alright. Grab the tape from the CM, let\\\u0027s put this launch vehicle back together again and give it another run in a few minutes.\u00E2\u20AC\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leopardenthusiast","CreatedById":26084,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T00:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHah, that\\\u0027s one of my typical launches when I use addons.
