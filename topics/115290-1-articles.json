I have to cheat the game by force closing it before it saves when a kerbal is killed. I feel like if new kerbals didnt require as much money in order to hire them it could make playing on hard more a little more enjoyable. And before you say Hard is supposed to be hard, there is no challenge in having to grind 100k\u002B after you lose a pilot, to get a new one, when you are already grinding to upgrade the buildings."},{"CreatedByName":"nekogod","CreatedById":103186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T14:05:39Z","Content":"I agree, someone else mentioned this in another post.

It doesn\u0027t take long for a Kerbal to cost more than the Jool mothership.\n\nEach method of acquiring Kerbals has problems:\n\nDirect Hiring at Astronaut Complex\n\nPros:\n\n\\* Instantly available when you need them.\n\n\\* Can see class / bravery / stupidity / gender up front so know what you\u0027re getting.\n\nCons:\n\n\\* Ridiculous price growth, especially considering you just get a totally trained rookie.\n\n\\* Cannot delete applicants off the list, so if it\u0027s spammed with Kerbals you don\u0027t want, the only way to get rid of them and get another batch of candidates is to hire the ones you don\u0027t want, which drives up the price even more.\n\nRescue Missions\n\nPros:\n\n\\* Cheap: In fact, you often turn a profit, especially if you can do several rescues in 1 flight.\n\n\\* Get rep rewards, which can be converted to cash / science or saved to get more lucrative contracts.\n\n\\* Rescued Kerbals come with the experience they earn from being where you found them.\n\nCons:\n\n\\* No idea what the Kerbals will turn out to be until you get them on the ground. Depending on luck of the draw, you might end up having to do a bunch of rescues to get what you want, which drives up the price.\n\n\\* No control over when rescue missions spawn so you might have to wait a long time, which can be a problem.\n\n\\* Actually have to spend time flying the rescue missions instead of doing your real space program stuff.\n\n\\* Difficulty of rescue missions increase as you progress in the game. This increases the cost and the play time required to do them, although you can still usually turn a profit."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T15:50:23Z","Content":"I only hire if bads=true.

If not, this is a good opportunity for one.\n\nThe way I would structure it would be to have zero-star levels the cheapest with the costs increasing exponentially with experience from there. I\u0027d also have the lower levels to be relatively common with higher levels increasing in rarity. I\u0027d tie the skill level of the available applicants to your prestige, because the best candidates would generally want to work for the best organizations.\n\nI\u0027d have the candidate list cycle over time, so you don\u0027t always have the same ones sitting there. I\u0027d implement some sort of half-life where some drop off faster than others.\n\nFinally, I\u0027d have some randomness to it all, so you could occasionally pick up someone for a bargain, or find a high-level candidate willing get in on the ground floor of your low-prestige startup.\n\nIf possible, I would have the cheapest to be some sort of unspecialized, raw cadet, which would have to be trained in a specialty before being able to perform any mission tasks (otherwise they are essentially tourists). I might even arrange it so it would be a little more expensive than hiring a zero-star astronaut, but you would be sure of getting exactly what you\u0027re looking for regardless of what\u0027s on the board at any given moment. \n\n(A tangent: Maybe it would be possible to implement some kind of training system for all your astronauts. For some amount of money, they can train and gain experience while in the complex. Training would also take time, with those astronauts unavailable for missions until their course is complete. Cost and time would increase with level, and the maximum level attainable through training would be capped depending on the level of your complex. I\u0027d probably have the levels capped at 1, 2, and 3 stars respectively, with 4-5 stars only attainable through actual missions.)\n\nSorry if this doesn\u0027t make any sense, I normally rely on rescue missions to impress captives hire recruits. Apparently in Kerbal society, if you save someone\u0027s life they now have a lifetime debt bond to you."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T19:05:18Z","Content":"300K?\n\n300K?!?\n\nMy Kerbals are costing over a million funds now!
