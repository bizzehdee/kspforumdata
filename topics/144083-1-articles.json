So the deadzone between zero movement and\u00A0full speed could have the sweet\u00A0spot right there. Otherwise the full speed needs to be quite fast\u00A0to get around the screen, but just add some smoothness to the center stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery happy to see Kerbals on Xbox!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T08:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums AxsFin, if you\u0027re having trouble with the cursor try holding a shoulder button, it\u0027ll slow the cursor movement, making it a bit easier to handle \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
