It uses a blue million kilowatts of electrical power, too. I built a ship to send to Moho that initially had something like 35,000 dv when I first started building. By the time I had included a nuke reactor (also from Near Future) to power the engine, it had dropped considerably. I began my transfer burn (after adding RCS, a lander, and all the various doo-dads and whatzits I needed) with around 8,000 dv. Still impressive, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T20:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENFP rules. Try it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
