That way you can easily add and remove mods without having to handpick the files out of the folders again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case that a mod overwrites stock parts it should simply ignore it\u0027s stock parts and instead use the mod\u0027s ones. (Anyone ever tried to deinstall Ferram Aerospace Research? Hope you made a backup...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in the rare case that two mods overwrite / add the same parts, well dunno, first comes, first served? Doesn\u0027t really matter, you can\u0027t load two at the same time now either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also in the progress of writing my own mod manager and even though I\u0027m using crc checks to find installed parts correctly that fails when mods happen to overwrite stockparts with partial stock files. Well either that or I messed up the deinstallation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this approach would get rid of these problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: I\u0027m not complaining, it\u0027s wonderful to see a game like this have addon support so early :3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso it\u0027s portable and doesn\u0027t rape the registry which just makes it even more worth the money \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(loading time\u0027s a bit big though but w/e)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: PPS: sorry if this was already suggested, tried a short search but didn\u0027t find anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Two weeks and no response from anyone, guess no one except me cares.
