How much depends on the plane (too much and it can cause wobbling/overcompensation; may also need to mess with derivate gain to keep it from wobbling).\n\nJust guessing here, but instability might be caused by the relatively blunt nose. Probably not a good idea to place those wings like that. You also seem to have narrowed the fuselage in the middle - and area ruling won\u0027t help too much when too far beyond Mach 1. For hypersonic speeds, use simple shapes (avoid any kind of parts sticking out), pointy leading edges, small face surface (? Not sure if that\u0027s the right word; cross section when looking at it from the front), and small wings (big surface area will also cause too much drag). B9 procedural wings will come in handy for that. Also helps to keep the entire plane as small and light as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T19:07:47Z","Content":"I mean the main reason for the wobbly yaw while rolling is pretty obvious. It\u0027s cause I tied the rudder into roll inputs in order to let the AI use it for rolling (if purely human controlled, I\u0027d just use the rudder pedals to apply yaw for my high alpha rolls), trying to figure out a way to make the AI use the rudder for rolls while not making it have so much an effect during sustained rolls or when doing minor corrections.\n\nAs I mostly want it to operate in the mach 0.4-1.4 region and potentially jump between transonic and mach 1.2 a lot, having good area ruling is useful (it\u0027s around 0.5 at the moment)."},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T19:50:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Phearlock said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E artificial yaw stability (% AoA on the rudder)\n\u003E \n\nI think that your issue comes from here. %AoA is usefull for fine tuning pitching, for example if you have elevators on back on plane that don\u0027t have enough pitching authority then you add canards in front. But canard can cause too have too much pitching sensitivity if you put pitching on manual controls on both, canards and elevators at back. In such case you only use %AoA on canards with 0 manual controls and use 100% manual pitch control on elevators.\n\nFound this combination quite usefull on large craft design too, using %AoA in front control surfaces to act as slats. Can be good method if you have trouble fine tuning neutral pitching point by moving main wing lift in close proximity of COM.\n\nIf I understand your configuration properly, having %AoA for yaw will mean that whenever craft have some pitching different than 0 AoA, craft will automaticaly start to yaw left or right too. Why you would want that ?\n\nSlight dehadrial angle can help with roll/yaw issues you encountering. Whenever AI want to yaw craft, it will automaticaly roll too and vice versa, it might help you much better than what you want to accomplish with %AoA on rudder. You can use it on your craft design on just ailerons sinnce it have significant surface area for such small craft, or you can try with very light dehadrial with main wing.\n\nYou need to find middle ground between stability and maneuverability, too much dehadrial might also cause to have too stable craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T20:15:11Z","Content":"Actually the AoA% is applied relative to the control surface, not the vehicle. The way it\u0027s set up will actually make the rudder try compensate for yaw regardless if the FAR Yaw assist is enabled or not. It doesn\u0027t have a large effect while in level flight or low sideslip angles, but it actually is required for the craft to not depart during violent maneuvering.\n\nI might see if there\u0027s a way to split the tail up into segments where the controls are a bit more isolated. At the moment both Yaw, Off-angle Yaw (AoA%) and Roll all apply inputs to the single rudder, considering this amount of inputs, I should be thankful it\u0027s as stable as it is. So far pretty happy with it though, the available instantaneous turn rate without thrust vectoring is excellent, and it recovers from awkward flight angles quite well. Maximum pitch input will make it stop nicely at around 25 AoA, and it will have a hard time going to into stall regions unless the thrust vectoring is enabled.\n\nI\u0027m mostly interested in tuning for the bdarmory pilot AI, as I\u0027m not sure what the best settings are for this sort of craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T20:25:02Z","Content":"Start the BDA settings very much to the left. You might want to add Dynamic Deflection also, that can really help tuning for ai dogfights. If you\u0027re yawing a lot and it\u0027s causing problems you want static yaw stability rather than trying clever things with surfaces. Leave fancy yaw maneuvers for thrust vectoring, you\u0027ll just bleed energy in uncontrolled sideslips anyway.\n\nThe top \u0026 bottom AI settings ( steer xxxxx ) are Kp \u0026 Kd for the internal PD controller ( the last commit had an integral as well, but I haven\u0027t tried it as BDA isn\u0027t terribly safe in 1.1.2 ).\n\nTip - add \u002Bve AoA to ailerons, then you can roll even with the wingtips stalled. I had craft in previous versions which the AI would fly down to ~35deg AoA/55m/s \u0026 still be in control, you just have to carefully set limits for the craft. The current AI AoA/g-limit restrictions are ok, but they take time to start functioning so the pilot can still pull into a high-AoA stall.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-17T20:27:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2016 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Van Disaster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Phearlock","CreatedById":90274,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-17T20:45:04Z","Content":"The aircraft by itself isn\u0027t yawing much at all if left to its own devices, it\u0027s just the BDarmory AI that keeps doing it.
