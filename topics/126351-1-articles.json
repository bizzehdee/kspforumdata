I\u0026#39;ve already made all the parts needed for a more complete \u0022submarine tool kit\u0022... 3 sizes of ballast tanks, an electric fan (that also works for aircraft on worlds without oxygen), and intakes/nacelles to supply the electric fan with \u0022IntakeAtmosphere\u0022 (instead of \u0022IntakeAir\u0022... works on Duna, Eve, and even Jool although I haven\u0026#39;t made any designs that fly there).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe nacelles use the old engine nacelle model, the electric fans use the old basic jet model, also there\u0026#39;s intakes using the old radial intake model... it didn\u0026#39;t take more than 2 hours to put together, and tweak values until I had something that seems reasonably balanced... all it needs is a retexture for the ballast tanks...\u003Cbr\u003E\nalthough better \u0022artwork\u0022 for the intakes/fans/nacelles would be nice, and a retexture for the ballast tanks...\u003Cbr\u003E\nalso it would be nice if the ballast generator only worked when the craft was \u0022splashed down\u0022/in water.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nas to the biomes...

More space oriented stuff should be what Squad focuses on.[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think adding entirely new planets is quite a different proposition than adding a ballast tank and electric fan part....\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said... I would love a uranus/nepture analogue (The outer planets are now grouped into 2 gas giants, and 2 \u0022ice giants\u0022 we have a gas giant analogue... lets get an ice giant analogue!), and an eris and/or sedna analogue... I can\u0026#39;t easily mod those myself, and keep my game largely comparable to other people\u0026#39;s... but I can and already have given myself electric fans and ballast tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat said... the \u0022space\u0022 part has become pretty easy for me now... at least as far as sending a kerbal to go plant a flag and come home...\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I said earlier... now the space challenge for me is bringing not simple a single kerbal, but a complex payload from Kerbin\u0026#39;s surface, to space, and then to the surface of another celestial body. I\u0026#39;m looking for new an interesting payloads, rather than just generic landers, surface habs, rovers/aircraft to get around the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting a functional submarine to orbit, and then from orbit, and softly into an ocean, sounds like a fun space challenge to me.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSure, I could make a \u0022dummy submarine\u0022 and do that... but if I go through all that, I\u0026#39;d like the submarine to actually do something other than look cool.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]PS There is an Underwater Easter Eggs in KSP. Which could only be found by mods last I checked. But now I believe its possible to actually go check it out yourself.[/quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think you\u0026#39;re talking about the smiley face, no? at least an easter egg below an extra-kerestrial ocean would require spacetravel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote]I also think Squad should just make another Kerbal game for underwater Exploration XD. Instead of Spacecraft, make water/sub-marine craft. Be more about making larger ships that scan the watery depths, than the physics of space travel. It defiantly could be its own game haha, just not this one.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Kerbal Naval Program (tm)[/B][/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\nYea.... then they\u0026#39;d need to model increasing pressure, crush depths, etc...
