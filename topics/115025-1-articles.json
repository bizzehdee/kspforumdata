My first task since 1.0.4 was to convert all of my (1.0.2) airliners to have Wheesleys rather than Whiplashes, since (I have to admit, it looks good) SR-71 effects are not really good looking on an Mk3 airliner.. (Okay, they kinda are.)\n\n![VCHlk2a.png](http://i.imgur.com/VCHlk2a.png)\n\nOf course, I intended to keep it on some aircraft (Such as the DC-8 and Boeing 707) for realism - Just look at those engines! And pollutants. Kind of.\n\n![0541868.jpg](http://cdn-www.airliners.net/aviation-photos/photos/8/6/8/0541868.jpg)\n\nMy final ship in 1.0.2 was a Boeing 747-100 intended for use as an Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for inigma\u0027s space shuttle - It flies. Kind-of marginally. Better than not lifting off, right? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe first thing I did in 1.0.4 was test this ship - It was highly vital. A true classic.. \\*mesmerized\n\nYes, I am an incredible aviation enthusiast. Why else would I be making this? (other than of course, releasing it)\n\n![UQpinHT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UQpinHT.jpg)\n\n![AdZCSPj.png](http://i.imgur.com/AdZCSPj.png)\n\nThrottles open!\n\n![EHZ5T9L.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EHZ5T9L.jpg)\n\nThe take-off was a bit rough. And kinda slow.\n\n![BfogcV1.png](http://i.imgur.com/BfogcV1.png)\n\nLet\u0027s turn around for a landing, shall we?\n\n![cDuQv8Z.png](http://i.imgur.com/cDuQv8Z.png)\n\nBecause I\u0027m a terrible pilot, I ended up crashing the plane in the water during the turnaround.\n\nCertainly needs some tweaking, especially that it\u0027s going to carry multiple-ton shuttles soon!\n\nLet\u0027s see..\n\nNope, no cheating here, move along!\n\n![6z0hdc8.gif](http://i.imgur.com/6z0hdc8.gif)\n\nSecond test flight - Hope this works!\n\n..***Nope.***\n\n![eO9dEMt.png](http://i.imgur.com/eO9dEMt.png)\n\n![NnX21fJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/NnX21fJ.png)\n\nI swear this was working in 1.0.2! I\u0027ve got a lot of things to do..\n\n..Anyways, after a few minutes of clipping canards into the fuselage days of hardwork, sweat and frustration, I\u0027ve been able to get it an \u0022Airworthiness Certificate\u0022! a.k.a just basically taking off and flying back into a patch of land.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

You\u0027re high!\n\nThis is going to be a bumpy ride. \n\nAnyways..\n\nI\u0027ve looked into the videos I took from the failures, and it seems that the main problem is the gear.\n\n![8s7orZq.png](http://i.imgur.com/8s7orZq.png)\n\nAs you start the engines, the aircraft speeds down the runway.. quickly.\n\n![iMelZdi.png](http://i.imgur.com/iMelZdi.png)\n\nAt around 50-60 m/s, the gear starts to tremble and wobble. Violently.\n\n![ka1FeAU.png](http://i.imgur.com/ka1FeAU.png)\n\nBy this point, the aircraft starts to bank hard--A wing hits the runway.\n\n![fBMnWRD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fBMnWRD.jpg)\n\nThe collision ends up shoving and pulling the whole plane towards that direction.\n\n![H0pBEYN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H0pBEYN.jpg)\n\nThe fuselage flips over. By this point, it\u0027s clear that disaster is inevitable.\n\n![UXLyguR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UXLyguR.jpg)\n\nThe structure fails and tears apart..\n\n![dDayT1C.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dDayT1C.jpg)\n\nResulting in an overall explosion.\n\nI\u0027ve recorded this gif for your amusement.
