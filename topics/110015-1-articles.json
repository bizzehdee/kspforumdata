It isn\u0027t fun anymore as far as rockets go. For planes it is definitely great compared to .90 but the .90 Aero was perfect for rockets. It was still a challenge to get your stuff to space but you could at least get what you wanted into space and move on... \n\nIt feels more like a chore spending countless hours tweaking and balancing and rigging just to get around the gauntlet of simply getting your stuff up to an apoapsis you want, not to mention hoping to have enough fuel to circularize to actually play the game beyond just getting into orbit.\n\nThe fun of KSP has lost stability and is tumbling because of the new Aero and it needs to be fixed.. Why has Squad said/done nothing since their knee-jerk 1.0.1 and 1.0.2. \u0022You can\u0027t complain\u0022 you will say... The hell I can\u0027t, I spend $ for a game and they took 2 steps backwards from .90 BETA."},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:10:26Z","Content":"Yeah, I remember when I played it yesterday and it was fun.

Weird, because that means it\u0027s on **your part**, not the dev\u0027s.

Although it is definitely more of a challenge to get into orbit, I embrace these new challenges to overcome them, and learn. If anything, it breaks the routine of simply going to orbit with no problem (and it certainly breaks the unrealistic 45 degree turn at 10km method). I embrace this new level of critical thinking that comes with something as simple as putting a payload into orbit. If anything, I have become a better pilot.\n\nSome tips to help with your ascent are as follows:\n\n-Do not deviate too far from the prograde marker (even a little bit can cause the rocket to flip)\n\n-Add fins\n\n-Do not accelerate/go as fast: something that is stable while subsonic may be aerodynamically unstable when supersonic.\n\n-Reduce drag as much as possible near the top of your rocket\n\n-Experiment with different designs"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T23:22:47Z","Content":"*Another* complaining thread?
