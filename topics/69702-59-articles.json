I agree, and feel you 100% of the way. I started the mod \u0022WindowShine\u0022 based on the fact that I can edit textures, and not that I can code/mod. WindowShine runs completely dependent on TextureReplacer\u0027s reflection plugins. All I did was edit the parts config and texture files. The coding behind it is credited entirely to Shaw. And same with my cloud pack! I based it off of old-EVE and Better Atmospheres. I also feel that the hot-topic modders get a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of complaints if their work is still in WIP state. Before my \u0022mod\u0022 threads sank, I got around a 1-3 ratio of complements to complaints.
