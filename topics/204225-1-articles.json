Where before I had target/antitarget, normal/antinormal etc. now I have only hold attitude and maybe pro and retro grade.\u00A0 This is on dozen of craft that I launched with full capabilities and now they are reduced. Was there an update? Is it triggered by my recently researching drone cores(if yes, how?)?
