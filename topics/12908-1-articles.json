This is my first (semi-succesful) rocket designed to go from Kerbin, to the Mun and back to Kerbin.The reason for which it is semi-succesful is that I simply can\\\u0027t land (on the Mun) and I can\\\u0027t come back to Kerbin.

And I want to minimize the use of extra liquid fuel tanks, for weight and aesthetic purposes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:(pics added)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7gjvN.png\u0022 alt=\u00227gjvN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nVpmS.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nVpmS.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3mlej.png\u0022 alt=\u00223mlej.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy data:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.15\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdvanced Decouplers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELunar Lander Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENova Punch Remix Pack (Demo friendly version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC7 aviation pack with the experimental release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like if someone could accomplish my objectives (go to the Mun and return) and (if possible but greately apreciated) post a video on how you did it.
