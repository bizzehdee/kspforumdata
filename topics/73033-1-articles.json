In this example, a speed of 50% of terminal velocity is reached after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15 seconds to reach 99% and so on.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does this merit a thread in the KSP Forums you might ask? Because, long ago, KSP players proved that the most efficient speed for a rocket to ascend in the KSP physics engine on a planet with an atmosphere (stock, *NOT* running FAR) is at terminal velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis led many players to assume that you should launch rockets with a Thrust-Weight Ratio (TWR) of 2 on the launchpad, as that will cause the rocket to increase in speed moving upwards at exactly the same rate as if free-falling downwards, and seek to maintain that TWR = 2 at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore advanced players realized that, since a rocket starts out stationary, you need to start out with a TWR greater than 2, in order to \u0022catch up\u0022 to terminal velocity, and then drop down to a TWR of 2 in order to maintain it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, neither of these statements is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it is true, in an infinitely tall atmosphere, a TWR fixed at 2 would lead to a rocket attaining terminal velocity and never leaving it until it ran out of fuel; in a REAL atmosphere such as Kerbin\u0027s, atmospheric thickness falls off as you ascend, therefore causing terminal velocity to increase as the rocket ascends, and never be reached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, as you ascend, terminal velocity is constantly increasing, and you constantly have to \u0022catch up\u0022 to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA TWR = 2 rocket will \u003Cstrong\u003ENEVER\u003C/strong\u003E keep up with the rate of increase of terminal velocity, however, even if it attains it briefly (before it drops its SRB\u0027s, for instance), as velocity will approach terminal velocity asymptotically with a rocket with TWR = 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat that means is, in a real atmosphere, since it takes exponentially longer for each incremental increase in velocity towards terminal velocity, a rocket\u0027s maximum velocity at TWR = 2 when thrusting straight upwards is terminal velocity, and terminal velocity is constantly increasing as the atmosphere thins, a rocket with TWR = 2 will theoretically \u003Cstrong\u003Enever\u003C/strong\u003E reach terminal velocity, so long as it is ascending straight upwards...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious answer, then, is that a rocket needs a TWR that is \u003Cstrong\u003EGREATER THAN\u003C/strong\u003E 2 in order to attain terminal velocity during the vertical portion of its climb...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, however, that how much greater the TWR needs to theoretically be than 2, in in order to actually attain and keep up with terminal velocity during an ascent, falls off the longer the path-length through the atmosphere- so if that TWR is 2.4 during vertical climb, for instance, it might fall to 2.3 and then 2.2 and then 2.1 as the rocket begins and then deepens into its gravity turn...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all this breaks down if you add lifting parts, or install FAR (which makes every part a lifting part, even a fuel cylinder, by adding the real-world effect of body-lift...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same effect persists with a scaled-up Kerbin in Real Solar System mod, but the atmosphere becomes taller and falls off more gradually, and thus the path-lengths increase: so ideal TWR during the vertical limb might be 2.04 instead of 2.4, for instance...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T08:38:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 08:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T02:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I have to say is this: It\u0027s \u0022Trust-to-Weight Ratio\u0022.

That is simply not the case in many rocket designs. In the upper stage, you\u0027re already going like, over half of orbital velocity, and your rocket is pointed more or less parallel to the ground. The whole point of having high TWR is to waste very little fuel in counteracting gravity drag. However, there is zero gravity drag when you are pointed parallel to the ground! All an upper stage needs to do is raise your periapsis above ground level before you re-enter the atmosphere. Thus, upper stages often can get away with a relatively low TWR. In many cases, 0.5 is fine. I\u0027ve had even less work, but there have been some rocket designs I made that needed a upper stage TWR of \u0026gt;1 (generally, the upper stage was a bit over-sized on these rockets). It all depends on what fraction of orbital velocity you are going when you ignite the upper stage. IN GENERAL, vacuum Isp is more important than TWR for an upper stage, but that is of course, a generalization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne place where this generalization can really break down is when using asparagus staging, which I generally use for my larger rocket designs. In asparagus staging, the upper stage ends up being the central \u0022stalk\u0022. As asparagus staging requires that all \u0022stalks\u0022 on the rocket be firing their engines all the time, I end up making the central stalk generally similar in TWR and Isp characteristics as all the other stalks.
