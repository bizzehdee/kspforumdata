It started out basic, but from it, we developed an artficial air bladder based wheel called a tire, which is not the original, it is something new.

If you take a star and keep adding more mass what you get won\u0027t be star according to current understanding, just a dense nebula.

One of their valves could be easily actuated by an electric motor. Poppets are terrible for many reasons (air flow shrouding, piston interference, etc). The rotary valve has many improvements(less detonation from more quench area making higher compression is just the beginning) for recip piston engines. Combining direct injection, turbo, electric rotary valve variable actuation, and variable compression (like in the \u002720 Nissan 2.0 turbo) would be a huge jump in efficiency and power. I think the rotary valve is actually the new thing needed but car companies have refused buying the design and favoring in house or out of patent designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-08T02:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223701761\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189633\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221573169166\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002289439\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022StrandedonEarth\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, StrandedonEarth said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReciprocating internal combustion engines (piston engines).

longer, but I suspect they will soon be largely used as range extenders for hybrid cars.\u00A0 Electric cars have too many advantages (except range, where a tiny ICE can help).\u00A0 Note that if the engine is small enough (like a prius engine) it is relatively easy to make extremely efficient at normal cruising speed (and let the electric be efficient at everything else).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlash memory is already going 3d, but logic is already limited by power density.\u00A0 Going 3d simply makes the power density even worse, although I\u0027d love to see a two-layer CPU (or GPU) where one layer is standard logic and the other is a DRAM memory chip that is used as a cache with arbitrarily high bandwidth to the chip (DRAM and logic use essentially inverted processes, so the DRAM that went on your XBOX (or whichever chip used a lot of it) didn\u0027t have nearly the density of your normal \u0022off the shelf\u0022 DRAM).\u00A0 There used to be a lot of research into things like \u0022reversible computing\u0022 that would be far more efficient, but modern 21st century transistors simply leak too much power (a nano-amp here and a nano-amp there and with a few billion transistors it really adds up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d put internal combustion engines at the top of this list.\u00A0 There\u0027s a few more places to eke out a bit more efficiency, but electric engines are almost certain to sweep them into history before they can get there.\u00A0 The engines used by power companies to generate power might well also be on this list.\u00A0 Not thanks to upcoming obsolescence (it will take acceptance of nuclear power or an obscene amount of batteries to do that), but to simply hitting Carnot\u0027s efficiency (or really, really, close).\u00A0 You simply can nae get more power without breaking the laws of physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of the \u0022laws of physics\u0022, I\u0027ve heard that error-correction-codes can pretty much hit mathematical limits.\u00A0 This doesn\u0027t mean that everybody that uses ECC will hit those limits (the stuff that does takes some time to do all the calculations), but for things like Starlink (woo-hoo, actual space reference there) expect to see near-Shannon rates (either through Turbo codes or LDPC [LDPC was a curious \u0022forgotten tech\u0022 invented by then man who \u0022wrote the book on data coding\u0022 but didn\u0027t include LDPC because it was a theoretical exersize and he was writing about important and real work.\u00A0 Fast forward a couple of decades and someone develops the Turbo codes (a development that was such a jump that it inspired claims of fraud.\u00A0 You know you have something patent worthy when big names are claiming it can\u0027t possibly be true).\u00A0 This lead to digging through the records and finding LDPC from said \u0022guy who wrote the book\u0022\u0027\u0027s thesis

batteries being on this list.\u00A0 Certainly, fuel cells or ideally liquid batteries (closed loop reversible fuel cells) would be better for most situations, but batteries always seem to improve by a fixed small percentage every year, and as we\u0027ve seen form Moore\u0027s law that can really add up.\u00A0 I\u0027d be really curious if methanol could be used as a car/truck fuel for a fuel cell (hydrogen simply seems too much of a problem in itself.\u00A0 The fact that it isn\u0027t overwhelmingly used in space (and not at all in aircraft) makes me laugh at the idea of using it in cars).\u00A0 When batteries stop steadily gaining in power density/cost/power you can stick them on this list.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think this will happen as long as a significant percentage of the worlds gross product is spent on cell phones and other battery operated

Add to that the environmental impact of mining and refining the needed materials, recharge time, and other customer bothering issues like the cost of replacing the batteries every 2-3 years and you have a significant problem to overcome. Most electric and hybrid cars are on the road to attempt to push the technology forward while getting paid by customers that believe they are/will be better. I\u0027m not saying they won\u0027t get better but a new way to store energy is really needed.
