I have a few designs that work fine below 10Km and get very unstable higher up, but no idea how to fix them. Hopefully someone who knows this stuff a little better passes by the thread. That design I posted a screenshot of is great under 10K, but if I put a turbo jet engine on it and climb above that, it becomes very wobbly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T12:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it altitude, time or speed that triggers it? If it\u0027s altitude then it may be that your axis of thrust isn\u0027t in line with your centre of mass and with the stabilising drag of the wings reduced your thrust that\u0027s pushing at the bottom of the plane causes it to rotate upwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thordan Ssoa","CreatedById":33501,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T14:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime. I\u0027m betting it\u0027s time. I\u0027m shootin in the dark a bit here, but I think it might be that as my fuel tanks empty, the center of mass moves towards the back. Eventually, it moves behind my center of lift, which is where my flipping problem came from before. In theory, this should be a simple fix. However, if anyone who knows better comes along, please do say something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
