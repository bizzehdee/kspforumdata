It adds 1 gas giant, 8 planets, and 3 moons. I have created biomes for each of body, and have taken some liberties with Barney, Slade, and Joker as the original stars they were orbiting I decided not to include as I didn\u0027t feel it necessary and I think they were more examples than anything else. I put Barney in a far orbit around the sun, with Slade and Joker as it\u0027s two moons. I\u0027m not certain I\u0027ll keep them there, but it will work for now. Some of you may notice there is no Moonar. I was going to include it as well but realized it was a rather poor quality planet and I think it was just a quick example thrown together by Krag so I decided not to include.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have done rather extensive testing on these planets and I think they are rather stable but may need some tweaking here or there. I have also tried to do my best to make them as accurate to the originals as I could get them.

I will say that Ablate is very difficult to get correctly. Simply taking the original files and copying them in kopernicus doesn\u0027t work due to a number of issues so I had to try to work around them. The scaledspace I don\u0027t think is ever going to match up perfectly with the actual body due to how the flatten mod works. The flatten is applied after the prefab so Kopernicus isn\u0027t aware that the planet should be smoothed in scaledspace.
