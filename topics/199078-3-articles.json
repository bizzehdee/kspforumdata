But these engines cannot handle anything like in KSP. Inside them is a made up fhisics that handle a narrow range of values that are adapted to scale, display and data structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much none of this is true. DLL stands for dynamically linked library. Even if physics in a particular engine comes as a dedicated library, which isn\u0027t always the case, nobody in their right mind would link that dynamically. Please, avoid using terms if you don\u0027t understand them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if canned physics engines couldn\u0027t handle \u0022anything like KSP,\u0022 then we wouldn\u0027t have KSP, because KSP runs on PhysX which is as plain and boring physics engine as they come. And it works because the only things that are handled by the physics engine in KSP are collisions and joint forces on the craft. That\u0027s it. That all it does and all it needs to do in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll other forces, like aerodynamics, propulsion, and gravity are applied by individual components during update. Same as in any other video game. Because when you shoot an object in an FPS and that sends the object\u00A0flying, it\u0027s not the physics engine that responds to the shot. The projectile or weapon component detects a collision and then applies an impulse in exactly the same way the thruster component on a KSP craft applies impulse to the craft. None of it works any differently.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only reason KSP exists at all is because under the hood it\u0027s not that different from any other game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223900623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609240624\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208078\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vv3k70r\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, vv3k70r said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat You see in game is unity. But it is just a display from dynamicly build flat 3d of local structures that unity can handle. But speeds avilable in games allow players to crash this whole structure just by getting fast on land. In common engine You just put max_speed value and problem is solved, here it would be an offence even if terrain cannot be switched that fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are literally describing streaming. It\u0027s been a problem in games for a very long time. Have you ever played GTA III or later? For modern games, it\u0027s just a fact of life that you can\u0027t have everything loaded at once. And every single modern game engine handles this pretty much the same way. The only difference with KSP is that it has a greater LOD range which comes at a cost of lower visual fidelity. Again, there is absolutely no special code because all of this is, once again, handled by Unity, which is a generic game engine, not written for games like KSP specifically.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if I suggested to any of game designers that instead of handling streaming we\u0027ll just slow down the player movement, they\u0027ll complain against me to CTO. In basically ever game, we have to handle resource loading regardless of how fast the player is moving. In games where player is on foot, we load higher fidelity assets. In games where player is moving by vehicle or some other means, we load lower fidelity assets so it can be done faster. Most game engines will be able to adapt based on how fast you\u0027re moving. Because even in games where you can\u0027t move all that fast as a character, you do occasionally want to have camera pan around or move quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223900623\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609240624\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208078\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022vv3k70r\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, vv3k70r said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn such a solution You load to graphic engine only local objects for display and handle phy on Your own process. It is why KSP quite often do not match with display, especialy when You go fast and low. It is why it need workarounds with joints strength and so on. And quickload it is just a disaster.

This has nothing to do with physics and rendering running in lockstep, which is standard fare\u00A0for most engines. Though, many do allow\u00A0 several\u00A0frames of simulation to run per single rendered frame.

Imagine that you\u0027ve already brought the first N rows to\u00A0 triangular form and you are now working on N\u002B1st row. You need to subtract from current row every previous row divided by its pivot element and multiplied by the element in corresponding column in N\u002B1st row. Lets say, I have several cores available. Rather than do one row at a time, I\u0027ll kick off the process on the first core with the first row. Once the second element of N\u002B1st row settles, I\u0027ll launch the second core working on second row. It has all the data it needs, and so long as decrement operations on the N\u002B1st row are atomic it doesn\u0027t matter that two threads are working on it at once. Once the 3rd element settles - that is, both cores 1 and 2 have processed it - the 3rd core can be launched on 3rd row, and so on up to the core count. The synchronization can be handled with a single monotonic counter which can also be handled with atomic increment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is still nowhere near 100% CPU utilization, there is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ea lot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of overhead, especially when you consider that x86-64 CPUs\u00A0still don\u0027t handle atomic increment and decrement with floating point values, and we\u0027re just talking about a toy version of the problem.

It\u0027s a full generation ahead, has way better performance in games, and the MSRP is only $80 more. You can\u0027t get 5950X for that price right now, but that should improve in a few months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other reason is that situation with graphics cards is even worse. A basic RTX 2080 is currently going for significantly more than I bought my water cooled OC RTX 2080Ti for, and I got mine before the 3xxx series was even announced. This is absurd. Since good GPU is way more important than CPU for game performance, if you\u0027re planning to get good mileage of that Ryzen 9, you definitely don\u0027t want to buy a crap graphics card. And unless you\u0027re prepared to spend over $3,000 on your build, you should either wait or scale back. If you end up going with something like a 1660 Super on top of a 3950X with 32GB it\u0027d be a C\u003Cem\u003Eolossal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0waste of money. If you\u0027re looking for gaming performance, and you absolutely must buy the PC right now, you\u0027d be way better off going with something like a 10850K or maybe even 10700KF and pairing it with something\u00A0 like an RTX 2070 and 16GB of RAM. That will get you a much, much better gaming machine for roughly the same price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you\u0027re streaming on Twitch and encoding videos in the background while playing your games, or doing some other tasks that can actually make good use of 32 threads, then yeah, maybe 3950X makes sense. But there aren\u0027t any games for which that\u0027s going to outweigh a good graphics card. And KSP specifically is notoriously bad at multi-threading, and 10700KF will actually have better performance than 3950X in KSP because of its single thread performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 5950X, that\u0027s another story. That gives you both the core count and single thread performance. Yeah, the thread count isn\u0027t as high, but it does so much more with individual cores. Unfortunately,\u00A0it has the same problem as GPUs right now. Supply is very short, so you can\u0027t buy it at MSRP.

Realistically the boost is probably in the neighborhood of ~5.3ghz. The I9-13900K has a boost of 5.8ghz on a single core under the perfect conditions.
