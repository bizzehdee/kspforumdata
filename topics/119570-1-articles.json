It\u0027s important to realise that although the ship might leave its parent planet in a fairly straight line, it still travels in circles/ellipses around the sun, and never ever travels in a straight line from one planet to the next. Interplanetary missions always rely on changing the shape of the circle/ellipse to make things line up or pass close to each other, not by stopping and setting off in a different direction - that would be technically possible, but it would be very, very inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the shortest distance between two planets (often called the closest approach) is interesting and useful to astronomers or stargazers (because it gives a particularly good view of other planets), but not so useful to rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Having warmed up my observation engine, I noticed you\u0027re far from a noob about the forums.
