There doesn\u0027t appear to be any pattern to it, the game just hangs for around 20-30 seconds then comes back. Whilst my pc is fairly old, I\u0027ve never encountered this sort of issue before - anyone experiencing the same problem or have any ideas?\n\nThanks"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:31:19Z","Content":"Please see the support stickies Bertie, we\u0027ll need the logs from your game ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bertie","CreatedById":90712,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:39:06Z","Content":"Yeah read them after I made this post but couldn\u0027t change it as it hadn\u0027t been approved yet, then found a similar thread anyway!\n\n[www.bassettmatthew.webspace.virginmedia.com/output_log.zip](www.bassettmatthew.webspace.virginmedia.com/output_log.zip)"}]}
