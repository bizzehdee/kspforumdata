Well.. it\u0027s not really, because there\u0027s a post saying that instead. It\u0027s the same thing as \u0027don\u0027t think of a pink golf ball\u0027 and \u0027this page intentionally left blank\u0027, you know? The fact it\u0027s telling me to ignore it makes me NOT ignore it because I\u0027m reading about how I should ignore it.\n\nSo, is that text really necessary? Is it possible to just not show anything at all? Would look a bit odd if other people quoted/referenced that post, but that would be better than a glaring break in the thread flow saying that something I specifically did not have an interest in seeing exists."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

I suppose the crux of my issue is the size of the notice - why not just a tiny \u0022hidden post\u0022 that I can click to reveal? Less of a break in thread flow for me, less likely to grab my attention, still retains ability to see the post if wanted."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T23:50:21Z","Content":"I\u0027d answer but your post is hidden.\n\nJust kidding, unfortunately I don\u0027t see any options to change this in the admin panel, it looks to be default vBulletin behaviour, it probably needs a plugin to change it."},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T23:53:16Z","Content":"This; for me but less so thread flow and more \u0022what the heck did they say this time\u0022 curiosity.
