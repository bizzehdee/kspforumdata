I am trying to lift a payload that is 82.5 tons into orbit using a new launcher design.\n\nIve managed to lift this behemoth into space before using a different launcher but now with the changes the game performance drops to an unbearable situation (less then 1FPS on the pad). The old launcher with the payload weighed just over 400tons and the new launcher brings it down to about 310 tons but I am having problems with the way fuel is being consumed, by the time I can do the orbit burn I have fuel left but 1/3rd of my engines cant get to the fuel which prevents me from making an orbit.\n\nI think I have it fixxed but I have to go to a county meeting today and cant test it until Saturday.\n\nBut it got me wondering.\n\nWhat was the heaviest payload anyone has managed to get into space using only stock parts? Anyone know, and screenshots if possible.\n\nBy the way, the thing I am trying to lift is like a role-playing space station to practice in orbit intercepts with, it holds 11,000kg of rocket fuel and 3,750kg of RCS fuel. It has to finish the orbital burn using its own fuel at this point but when its done its got a LOT left over. I know its got a lot left over because the old launch system had almost no problems with it, but this new one does not work so well.\n\nIf the test on Saturday goes wrong I just move on to plan B."},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-25T02:23:27Z","Content":"Pics and/or craft file pluz.
