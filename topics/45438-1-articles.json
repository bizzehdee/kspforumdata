I\u0027m just curious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods come in two basic flavors: Parts and Gameplay. As I read through the forum posts, some players have very definite opinions concerning the use of mods in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E==========================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGameplay. Some folks are concerned that a mod, such as MechJeb auto-pilot (kindling for a flame war), changes the fundamental game dynamics and should not be allowed to anybody. Others view these mods as helpmates which enhance or ease the player\u0027s experience. Mods, such as Kerbal Alarm Clock, don\u0027t change gameplay; it just helps in the same way that time warping helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine how boring gameplay would be if there was no time warping. Yet, warping is built-in. If it were a mod, some folks complain that it changes the game play experience. I believe that if Squad hired more developers, they would eventually develop Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===========================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParts. \u0022I just use stock parts.\u0022 How often we\u0027ve seen statements similar to this. Squad provides quite a nice inventory of stock parts. Yet, this inventory is limited by the number of developers at Squad. These same developers must devote time elsewhere as well, so they can\u0027t add more very often. If Squad suddenly expanded its modeling and texturing staff, then more stock parts would be forthcoming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, Squad must work within its budget. So, no new hires for new parts. However, Squad has at its disposal, a huge staff of modelers and texturers. And, they work for free. This volunteer staff are individuals who create the mod parts that many of us use. There parts mods cover the gamut from command pods to tanks to engines to...whatever. Other parts mods, like KAS, are unique and very helpful. KAS does change gameplay experience in a subtle way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E============================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe come now to the crux of the matter. To use mods or not to use mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssume Player NoMod hates mods, won\u0027t use them, and doesn\u0027t want them available in the game to anybody. Player UseMod uses a variety of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy does it matter to Player NoMod if Player UseMod uses a mod, especially a Gameplay mod? If a mod enhances or eases Player UseMod\u0027s experience, then why does it matter to Player NoMod? For instance, MechJeb auto-docking helps new players who have trouble docking. (On this issue, we often read the smarmy, self-righteous \u0022Learn to do it manually!\u0022 or \u0022I docked my first time. It\u0027s not that hard.\u0022 statements.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Player UseMod wants to use a mod part, why should Player NoMod care if Player UseMod uses that part? What is it that sanctifies a part if it is a stock part versus a mod part? Stock part, good. Mod part, bad. However, if Squad were to incorporate that mod part into the stock inventory, then it\u0027s OK according to Player NoMod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=============================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMHO...there is no right way or wrong way to play KSP. Well, actually, there is a right way...YOUR way. Play it the way that makes it fun for you. If you want to use HyperEdit to put every vehicle in space and make perfect landings on Eve, then use it. If you don\u0027t want to use mods or a specific mod, then don\u0027t bloody use it. Just don\u0027t condemn those who do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull disclosure: I use mod parts. I use MechJeb to plan, but not execute some maneuvers. I use Maneuver Nodes extensively for planning as well. And...(donning my flame retardant suit now)...I use MechJeb auto-docking to help dock, though I do 90% of the work by toggling auto-dock off and on while using NavyFish\u0027s DPAI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss.
