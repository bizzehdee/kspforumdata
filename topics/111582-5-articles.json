Not in current game. But in the pre-v1.0 game, Jebediah once fell to his death while testing ladders. Previously I had managed to drop Bob from 120,000m or so. He bounced mightily but was otherwise fine. Thus I reasoned that the game had misled me to believe that the Kerbals were basically indestructible outside a rocket. And since I had been misled I was entitled to revert or reload. Likewise, while my memory is rather vague on this, I\u0027m reasonably sure that a full crew succumbed once, while a rocket just spontaneously self-destructed on the launchpad. I think I had speeded up time to get daytime, and when back to timewarp 1, the rocket just collapsed. Again, I figured the game had been \u0022unfair\u0022 and so I was entitled to revert the Kerbals back to life.\n\nI do revert often. But not to save any lives. Usually it\u0027s an unmanned testvehicle and I revert because it\u0027s the quickest way \u0022back to the drawing board\u0022, or VAB.\n\nI\u0027m very cautious, meticulously careful, and care a lot about my Kerbals and safety. I enjoy the game more, that way.\n\nI test, test, test, test and test. And anything dangerous is tested unmanned.\n\nP.S. And I just remember. There was an incident in my current game as well. I had a ship in solar orbit, when there was a big boom. When I went looking for the vessel, it and it\u0027s crew had ceased to exist. I had no problems considering it \u0022unfair\u0022, whatever had happened, and reloaded an earlier save.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-09T16:48:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2015 04:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vermil**"}]}
