Sounds normal, right? Well, there was this giant, floating cartoonish-looking mouth hanging in the center of the arena, speaking in EXTREMELY loud, sort of mechanical-sounding screeches that were painful to my ears. I guess this one was a bit of a lucid dream as well, because at one point I was able to control the dream long enough to realize that I was dreaming and realize there really was no noise at all. Don\\\u0027t ask me, it\\\u0027s a weird dream for a reason =P After this revelation, I never had that same dream again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then a few months ago, I had perhaps the weirdest dream of my life. My memory of it is a bit fuzzy, but this is what happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was walking down the street next to a forest, when a random oversized chinchilla came running out of the woods and stood next to me. I picked up the chinchilla, and suddenly it seemed a lot smaller, and could fit easily in the palm of my hand. Then, a completely random taxi pulled up, and a pizza man jumped out, took the (now full-sized again) chinchilla from me, and drove off. In the taxi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuddenly, I was looking at myself from a third-person point of view, and there was a minimap in the corner of my vision, like in video games. It had a trail on it following the pizza man, so I hopped in car that apparently appeared right then and sped off after it. When I finally caught up, the taxi had crashed at a curve leading onto a highway. I got out of my car, opened the driver-side door of the taxi, and out jumped the chinchilla, once again tiny. I picked it up and drove off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I was suddenly at my school, once again in first person, and the chinchilla was about the size of a dog now. I was near my school\\\u0027s band room, and for no reason I walked over and opened my band locker. Inside it was the chinchilla that had just been standing right next to me, and when it came out this time it was even bigger (Nearly the size of a horse, so pretty freaking huge) and had wings. Sadly, I woke up before I could ride it off into the sunset and live happily ever after with my chinchilla horse pet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Candre","CreatedById":15181,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-02T00:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve had some strange \u0027dreams.\u0027 Most of them were when I was semi-asleep:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe oldest occurrence that I can remember is when I had stayed up late playing a Mario game when I was ~12 on a school night.
