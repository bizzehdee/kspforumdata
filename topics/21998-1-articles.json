From looking at some of the files I notice that the IVA seems to be a separate model that loads itself upon switching to IVA. I was wondering how to tweak the cfg to use a dae model as IVA for testing before compiling mu files since I don\u0027t have a copy of unity yet or the mod tools, or if I have to use the mu files for making IVA\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips help would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd because I can, here\u0027s to IVA view I\u0027m working on, I\u0027m trying to keep the poly count low and still need to stitch some models together(the struts/columns before fully testing this).
