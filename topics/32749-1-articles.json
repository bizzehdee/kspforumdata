Bigger ship, with \u0022fighters\u0022 and landers attached. Here is video of me putting the center in orbit and then docking the two \u0022Pickle Fighters.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m basically going to write out a mission report in the form that it would be sent into HQ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Statement:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo design, launch and operate an Interplanetary Carrier, Capable of traveling with our[Kerbin] system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoals: (In order via priority)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.{Completed} Design/Launch Center Structure into orbit. Must contain 4 Small and 4 Medium Docking ports. The 4 Small ones must be inside the ship and accessible via a 1 meter diameter ship with some wiggle room. Main Engine on center section must be removable for later replacement with a Tri-Nuclear Engine Section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. {Completed} Design and Launch two fighters of the same type and attach them inside the ship via small docking ports. Fighters must have IVA Accessible cockpit for maximum effectiveness, also fighters must be able to fly on RCS or BP-119 Rocket fuel[regular rocket fuel] and be able to switch from one to the other during flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. {ETA 1 day}Design Robotic or Manned \u0022forklift\u0022{Via EVA CHAIR}.

Retrieve Jebediah.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. {ETA 8 months} Leave Kerbin Orbit, head for 150km Duna Orbit. Once there wait for further Instructions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, anyone elses posts counts off?
