After a bit of stargazing i\u0027ve noticed something unusual - the star Castor in Gemini Constellation appears unusually bright, and is also blue-red in colour - even while high above horizon. I\u0027ve never seen this star like that. Like i said it might be due to atmospheric conditions - but i would appreciate if someone in Northern hemisphere went outside and took a look \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EJust in case.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T17:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Scotius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Magion","CreatedById":97022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T13:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreetings from your south-neighbouring land, the Czech Republic,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECastor and Pollux are ones of my most favourite stars, so I know quite well, how they look. Because they are so close, it\u0027s pretty easy to compare them - Pollux is usually a tiny bit brighter than Castor. Yesterday I went out and took a look at them, but I hadn\u0027t seen any change of Castor\u0027s magnitude relative to the Pollux. Dunno what could cause your Castor to look different \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
