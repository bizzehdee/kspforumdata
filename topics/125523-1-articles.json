It\u0027s virtually ubiquitous (practically every mod out there uses it), and it has a very rich config language that lets you do amazing things without having to create new parts, models, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if all you want to do is alter the resource quantities without any other changes, you could create a snippet of ModuleManager config (literally, just two or three lines of text that you could bang out in a text editor in about two minutes), that codes something like this: \u0022For every fuel tank that has a resource LiquidFuel or Oxidizer, double the amount\u0022. It would be simple, you wouldn\u0027t have to go through every tank on a tank-by-tank basis, it would be easily maintainable (since any new tanks added would get the benefit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI looked at your mod, and it appears that you have a large directory tree with dozens of folders for all the various fuel tanks, and complete model files and config files and everything for every one of them. Aside from the amount of work involved to put all that together, it\u0027ll suck up a lot of resources (memory, mainly) on the player\u0027s computer. You could replace essentially your entire mod with a single .cfg file that has a few lines of ModuleManager config in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModuleManager is your friend, it\u0027s well worth learning and doesn\u0027t require any specialized tools to use.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T19:25:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 07:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asdfCYBER","CreatedById":94319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T16:12:11Z","Content":"\nUgh.

I feel this is a classic case of a person finally figuring out how editing a .cfg file works, or learns how to model a fuel tank in Blender and is over eager to share whatever it is that they made.

If in real life an oil drum can hold x amount of gallons of oil, then there is no way to squize more than that into it. The same goes for the fuel tanks in the game. Their sizes are directly proportional to the amount of content that can fit within them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPeople really should spend more time researching the forum for Requested Mods before spending their time making mods that are quite frankly unnecessary.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gary_P","CreatedById":67878,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-30T15:16:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDamn, you guys are rough.
