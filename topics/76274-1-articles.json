Also what velocity of collision is fatal for a Kerbal? The reason I ask is that I have a ship orbiting Gilly at about 5km and an orbital velocity of about 20m/s. Judging by the shadow of the ship the surface comes very close at times and it is tempting to EVA down, but I am not sure if I can get back. I will of course try but some knowledge of what it takes to kill a Kerbal and what delatV they have in they EVA pack would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-29T22:29:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2014 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by THobson\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T19:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUnless it has changed in .23.5 (I don\u0027t think it has, they where going to use monopropellent but held back on that) then the pack has a delta-v of 600 m/s. You have plenty of delta-v to get off Gilly and board, it\u0027s just a matter of accurate piloting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for fatal collisions that\u0027s a harder question. It seems that it matters a lot the position and angle of the impact - for some reason Kerbals can survive some pretty bad impacts if they land on their head or at an angle. I think Scott Manley has some videos where he explores that question.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"R0cketC0der","CreatedById":106748,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-29T19:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbals have the highest impact tolerance when they land on their head.

Landing on their head at high speed doesn\u0027t appear to matter much to them either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou shouldn\u0027t need to worry about that though.
