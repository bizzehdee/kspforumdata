I have plan to begin new great programm: exploring planet systems made with Krag\u0027s Planet Factory mod, with a couple of some other plugins. That will be something new for me: I never built massive ships before. We will see about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat elce can I say... Sometimes my grammar su... Being not best, I mean.

But you must to mock around with center of thrust and center of mass... But sometimes that way is more time-efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you make base on the planet with atmosphere, you can assemble the base on orbit and just use parachutes to land. That works perfectly with thick atmosphere, but on Duna you may encounter some problems...
