In terms of the mechanism the Klaw is no different than a set of landing legs. They just open and close.

To keep the experience immersive and avoid breaking the fourth wall from this perspective the Klaw could reasonably be placed in its own branch, still in a later tier as it is now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo really the only reason to keep it with there is because Squad got lazy and made it out of a docking port, and as reasons go, that\u0027s really silly one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jXvsi7DRyPI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T12:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
