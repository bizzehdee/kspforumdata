So I am wondering if it would be possible to introduce a text-based story mode.\n\nImagine it as follows: \n\nYou all remember the early help-popup-windows telling you how to use the VAB, astronaut complex etc.. Now what would happen if you could trigger such a window right after completion of a certain quest.\n\nFor example a window appears and warns you that crazy Jebediah Senior was stuck on the Mun after he was Hearing voices and jumped into the neares trash can after adding a few Boosters and somehow got there. Your Job is to rescue him from Muns surface and convince him to go back home. After your return however another window Pops up with him telling you he was right all along and found proof of some kind of conspiracy in the Kerbol system. All you need for him to prove it is to build a relay station on the exact north pole of Minmus.... and then sending you to find an old transponder orbiting somewhere around Duna.\n\nBasicly you could build up an entire story mode with \u0022help\u0022-windows telling you to do stuff in the known Kerbol system. And of course a lot of fiction-writers in the KSP-fanworks section of this forum could let their imagination run wild with ideas why old Jebediah Senior would send you to retrieve and old Rocket that got lost in the outer rims of the known System but had a new type of snack-recipe on board.\n\nPlease tell me this might be possible...\n\nGreetz\n\nBlack Dog"}]}
