The final payout of a biome sample could be randomized in a certain interval while the total payout is constant over either the body or the solar system. Processing data could give you pointers as to which biomes on which body might be rich in science. Or there could be interconnections - say a biome on Duna could hold mucho science treasure but it is overlooked - you don\u0027t know it\u0027s there and you cannot access it until you found something else on Laythe.
