Honestly, I think tapping 2 seperate actions keys for rudder control seems quite a hassle. Especially if you need either fine tuned and/or hard control inputs in the upper atmosphere, i.e. to get into space. Nevertheless I will try this method and see how well it should perform.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
