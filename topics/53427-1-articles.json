What might work is if you could flag the affected parts to be highlighted when you revert to VAB (or SPH), with the highlighting \u0022sticking\u0022 until you manually clear it or save or something. Of course, that would also mean the only way into showing the highlighting would be reverting, which I can see some people not being entirely thrilled about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe an option to flag the affected parts on the craft file itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T18:01:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA step button might be cool, since odds are if you didn\u0027t revert fast enough most of your craft has failed by that point.
