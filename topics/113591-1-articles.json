You already have some part of the rocket built (say a probe payload) and you add the fairing to the bottom of this.\n\n2. The part you attach is just the base of the fairing, a disk-shaped thing. As soon as you place it, the game automatically goes into \u0022fairing-building mode\u0022 so you\u0027re dragging a procedural fairing bit around as you move the mouse. If you\u0027re not ready to actually build the fairing yet, right-click to get back into normal editing mode.\n\n3. When you\u0027re ready to build the fairing, right-click on the disky and select \u0022build fairing\u0022. Now you drag the mouse around to shape the fairing as you desire. This usually has to be done in several steps because the game only allows fairing sections to be so big. At all times, look at the text at the bottom center of the screen. If the text is green or blue, you can place a fairing section there with a left-click and then immediately start making the next section. If the text is any other color, the fairing section is too big or has some other problem (clipping, for example) so you\u0027ll have to reshape it by moving the mouse until the text is green or blue. It works like this:\n\n\\* If the base disk of the fairing is the same diameter as the payload above, the 1st fairing section is the \u0022base section\u0022, which has to come out horizontally some distance to clear the payload above. If the fairing base disk is a larger diameter than the payload, you can just plae a regular \u0022fairing section\u0022 straight up. Anyway, move the mouse until you this 1st section is where you want it and the text is green, then left-click.\n\n\\* Now you\u0027re working on the 2nd section. Move the mouse to shape it as desired, either straight up or tapering in or out as needed. You can only go so far, however--still need green text. Click when ready.\n\n\\* Continue in this way, tapering the top of the fairing in when you can. Eventually, once it\u0027s been tapered down enough, you\u0027ll see \u0022close fairing\u0022 in green. Click that and voila, you\u0027re done.\n\n4. Fairings can also be used interstage, like from the top of the transfer stage to the bottom of an Apollo-style CSM, covering up the LEM in the middle. This works pretty much the same as above except when you taper the fairing in towards the CSM, the text will turn blue when you can close it off. This seems to be only possible if the top of the fairing is on a part that allows radial attachment, such as the CSM\u0027s fuel tank.\n\nAnyway, that\u0027s pretty much it for how to build them. As to how to use them, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nA. Mass\n\nStock fairings are pretty heavy, so keep that in mind when designing your rocket, so that you have enough dV for where you\u0027ll still have the fairing on.\n\nB. Wobbles\n\nAnything tall sitting atop a fairing base disk will tend to wobble unless strutted. This is one of several good reasons (see below) to always use a wider fairing than the payload, so you can strut down from the payload to the upper side of the base disk.\n\nC. Aero Stuff\n\nFor the least drag, the fairing shouldn\u0027t bulge out much or at all. If the fairing base is wider than the payload, then you can make a straight-sided fairing that\u0027s effectively just a nosecone. Then the rest of the rocket is the same diameter as the fairing disk.\n\nD. Hung-Up Fairing Sections\n\nIt sometimes happens that not all fairing pieces release when you stage the fairing. When that happens, the game gets weird. Despite your rocket still being in space, the game will say it\u0027s landed, refuse to draw its orbital path, and won\u0027t let you warp. This is usually caused by fairing bits clipping the rocket, such as if you\u0027ve run struts through the fairing shell. Fortunately, this is fairly easy to fix. Just spin the rocket in roll (Q or E) to sling the stuck fairing pieces off, and all will return to normal."}]}
