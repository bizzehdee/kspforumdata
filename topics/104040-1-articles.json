I have been playing KSP since a year or so and finally gotten around to learning the \u0022fine arts\u0022 of this game: Efficient SSTO design (w/o R.A.P.I.E.Rs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ), station building, docking. \n\nMy question revolves around the latter two aspects. I\u0027ve got a nice little station in orbit around Kerbin (career mode). Docking and undocking various vessels has not caused any problems yet. However, I am using the Station Science mod. Thus I sent up a vessel consisting of the Mod\u0027s lab and two experiments (plant growth and prograde kuarqs) that are DOCKED with their small return vessels. Now the game will not let me undock these vessels and only offers me the \u0022control from here\u0022 option, when I right-click the docking ports (any side). \n\nThe ports are aligned OK, all vessels have command modules, power,... .\n\nHow do I get these to undock now? I\u0027ve attached a screenshot. Any help is greatly appreciated. The KSS is bound to be extended and docking ports are in high demand ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) .\n\n[![screenshot3rcsyl.png](http://abload.de/thumb/screenshot3rcsyl.png)](http://abload.de/image.php?img=screenshot3rcsyl.png)\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T14:57:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by plotz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T14:20:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E two experiments (plant growth and prograde kuarqs) that are DOCKED with their small return vessels.\n\nThose aren\u0027t docked.

Go back to the VAB, you should be able to move it a bit outwards. The port has a plate on top, you can see it in the back of your screenshot (with purple light).
