Or maybe Dres once had a so so strong gravitational force that one day, when an enormous asteroid encountered it and went so close to it, the pressure was so high that it shattered into small asteroidlings. But as time passed on, Dres\u0027 gravity got weaker and weaker. (How, you might ask?\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EMagic\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
