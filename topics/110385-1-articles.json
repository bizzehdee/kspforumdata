Here is my analysis, my apologies to all those who\u0027ve already been through this... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know of 4 general paths for a Mars land-and-return mission (see a NASA review \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mars/marsprof.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Conjunction class. So called because Earth and Mars go through a conjunction during the flight. You take a (roughly) Hohmann path from Earth to Mars, then wait about 18 months at Mars to take the next Hohmann window back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Sprint class. You take a considerably higher-energy path to Mars, spend a short time at it (A week or two, the longer you want to spend the higher the delta-v requirements) then take a high-energy path straight back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Opposition class, Venus first. \u0022Opposition\u0022 because Earth and Mars go through opposition during the flight to Mars. With this you take a near-Hohmann path to Venus, fly by it and get flung to Mars. After a week or two at Mars you take a near-Hohmann flight back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Opposition class, Venus last. In this you take a near-Hohmann path to Mars, stay at Mars a week or two, then fly by Venus to get back to Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are rough delta-V requirements and mission durations for a favorable example of each the 4 types. I am assuming a 10-day stay at Mars for the fast missions. Assumed start and finishes are from a 200x200km circular orbit. This does not include the landing or returning to orbit requirements at either world, which would be the same for all cases. Aerobraking to the final Earth landing is assumed. I used my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/110106-WIN-Flyby-Finder-for-Real-Solar-System-Mod-V0-70\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFlyby Finder\u003C/a\u003E to get this data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType........Leave Earth.......Brake at Mars.......Return from Mars......

But you can save a lot if you aerobrake into orbit at Mars. Let\u0027s look at the total dV requirements with and without Martian aerobraking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EType.......

For comparison, going from LEO to a Lunar orbit and back to re-entry takes about 5000m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my mission parameters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-This is a test/plant-a-flag flight more than a science gathering mission. Think Apollo 11. I therefore picked a short Mars stay, with mission option 3 being the best deal for duration (consummables mass) versus dV (fuel mass) required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I limited my launcher to Saturn-5 size, so launch weights below around 2800 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-After lots of testing I found my speed at Martian atmospheric interface cannot exceed 7800m/s for a managable aerobraking. I also wanted to be able to abort the Mars aerobrake and do a free-return to Earth if needed. This tightly constrained my Earth-Venus-Mars leg. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I Settled on a crew of only 2 Kerbalnauts. I don\u0027t intend to leave anyone in Martian orbit. The carrier won\u0027t do anything while the Kerbals aren\u0027t on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-CG is critical for the aerobraking to work, so all motors and RCS on the carrier/lander use the same fuel, which can be pumped between 3 tanks as needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I cheated with H2 boiloff (details below), and fudged the centrifuge and DRE at Earth, but other than that I used the mods as-is. I use all the required mods and most of the difficulty mods except Remote Tech and Engine Ignitor. It\u0027s RO version 8.1.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETHE WINDOW\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the FFRSS readouts for the Earth-Venus-Mars leg and the Mars-Earth leg. This is the best one I found before 1980, the Mars return is fast and relatively low-dv, and the E-V-M leg gets to Mars exceptionally early. Note I limited the E-V-M graph to only show paths that arrive at Mars before day 8175. Most of them had to be rejected because the arrival speed at Mars was way too high. I will depart from Earth on June 3rd, 1972 (Y22 D160 at 0:00, UT day 7825) and arrive at Mars on May 19th, 1973 (Y23 D145, UT day 8175). Spend 10 days on Mars and fly back to Earth from May 29 1973 to Nov 4 1973.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5D5sF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

This is followed 1 day later by the crew lifter, which is carrying 6 Kerbalnauts-Jeb and Bob who will go to Mars, and 4 engineers who will test all systems on the ship over the next 5 days. Once they give their OK, the 3rd and final launch, on D-1.5, puts 144 tons of LH/LOX (8 tons can boil off by D-0) and the departure motors in orbit. A spacewalk puts in reinforcing struts and joins the cables between the carrier and the tank. The crew lifter returns to Earth with the 4 engineers on D-1, and the ship is ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/R2gzQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

I have not mastered H2 boiloff yet, and between running out of battery power at night and the 36 hours between the tank launch and D-0 I lost too much and had to Hyperedit 3 tons back in to make the departure. (I have to finish all the orbital insertions manually and didn\u0027t have the heart to try another launch of the tank.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEARTH-VENUS-MARS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED-0. The departure burn is 3941m/s, plus a 7m/s correction burn after leaving Earth\u0027s SOI. The tank is then extended from the carrier via the 4 cables and the assembly is spun up to 2 RPM with RCS. The CG is closer to the carrier than the tank, but I calculate the radius as 35M at the \u0027lowest\u0027 occupied section for about 1 lunar gravity. The Venus flyby is at D\u002B160.4. The assembly would have to be despun for the manuevers 2 days before and 2 days after Venus flyby, then respun for the trip to Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/oNFzP\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was suprisingly easy to get it safely extended and spun up, but the moment I hit time warp I got a \u0027cannot warp while under acceleration\u0027 message. If I took tension off the cable the 2 parts would fly apart and rip the cable when I hit time warp. So I didn\u0027t really spin it the whole way. Despinning was a nightmare anyway. And how would the ship keep an antenna pointed at Earth during spin? I decided next time I will eject an autonomous antenna platform with a large high-gain antenna to talk to Earth, and a small omni antenna to talk to the ship, and keep it about 1 km from the ship for the E-V-M leg. I\u0027ve also found a \u0027maintain spin under warp\u0027 mod, I\u0027ll try that soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also need to put clouds on Venus, though I fear the memory hit as I\u0027m running near my limit with so many mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMARS AEROBRAKING AND LANDING\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days out from Mars the empty tank is released before the Mars periapsis adjustment. This is the last chance to switch to a Mars flyby and direct return to Earth if the aerobraking has to be scrubbed for some reason. To prep for the aerobrake all fuel is moved to the frontmost tanks and the panels are retracted. Periapsis is 45.1 \u002B/-0.15km, too low and the ship breaks apart, too high and it is not captured into orbit. Apoapsis after braking is around 1500-2000km. Peak deceleration is ~4.5 gees. At 1st apoapsis the periapsis is raised to 160km. Fuel is moved back to the carrier and the lander separated. Lander periapsis should be from 65-75km depending on where you want to land. The lander is rock-steady when aerobraking, that huge heat shield makes it easy. Drogue chutes release at 25km and 1500m/s, main chutes at 3km and 350m/s, heat shield then releases, gear out and motors on, release chutes and land on rockets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/j4wkH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first aerobrake is tricky, it\u0027s at the edge of possible. RCS is needed to keep it stable, and the ship moved a bit too much and lost 2 rear RCS thrusters, one solar panel array, and the outer TACLS container (that was there for balance). Turns out I forgot to remove the waste tanks from that container and it was heavier than I planned for, (yes, my plans were full of s**t) but after it ripped off the ship was more stable and survived the aerobraking. Final carrier orbit was 160x1500km, well within specs. The landing went well (the result of about 20 test runs when designing the lander) and the guys were on Mars after a 350-day journey! Note: for some reason the landing motor gimbals worked in reverse so I turned them off and used RCS for direction control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMARS EXPLORATION\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe guys lived in the Itinerant module while on the surface. They spent the first day inside getting used to moving in Martian gravity. Near noon on day 2 they took their first steps on Mars. In later days they unloaded the rover and experiments and did some science. After 10 days on the surface they returned to orbit and docked with the carrier. The only trouble was the rover dynamics, when crossing certain lines the rover would get kicked up in the air. I kept it below 8m/s and it never sunk into the terrain. Communication with Earth would be a trick, a high-gain antenna can communicate directly when Earth is above the horizon, but what do you do after Earth sets? I\u0027d accept being out of comm for 12 hours at night and early morning, the time lag means they are never really in direct communication anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERETURN TO EARTH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took about 4200m/s to get the SSTO lander back to the carrier. I debated moving the lander RCS units to the carrier to replace the lost ones but decided that would be too unrealistic. I had 1000m/s more return fuel than needed, I could have kept the lander on during the trans-Earth burn, and even used the lander\u0027s motors if the carrier main motor had failed. But I discarded the lander and did a 2519m/s burn to get back to Earth. The lost RCS was a problem- The carrier was unbalanced at this point and needed all the RCS to keep it on course near the end of the return burn. So I had to break the return burn into 4 parts and repoint the ship when it got too far off course. This main motor also gimbaled in reverse so I couldn\u0027t use its gimbals either. Maybe a result of flipping the ship around during construction? In any case my huge fuel surplus allowed me to use a faster return to Earth than I had planned- only 159 days instead of 180 in my original plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/PgcnO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy final cheat was on Earth re-entry. I hit the atmosphere at 12.1km/s, about 1.2km/s more than a moon return. This turned out to be utterly impossible with the standard DRE settings, the ship would heat up to 2000C and explode around 82km, even with a periapsis at 80km where the deceleration was trivial. So I changed the DRE settings to allow it to survive. The Stardust mission reentered at 12.4km/s and survived with a PICA shield so I don\u0027t feel too bad about this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMISSION SUMMARY\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimary crew total time in space: 525 days\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal launch weight: 2216\u002B243\u002B2775 = 5234 tonnes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo landed on Mars: 3.5 tonnes (The Itinerant container and everything attached to it but not the ascent stage and fuel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s time for me to upgrade to the latest RO and figure out H2 storage and high-speed re-entries. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"immelman","CreatedById":90345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T23:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a fascinating and informative mission.
