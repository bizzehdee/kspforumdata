And here\u0027s the issue. Typically, I just do science, kethane survey, take selfies, whatever once I reach another planet\u0027s orbit, then I just leave the ships in orbit until I have a return to Kerbin window and, in the meantime, do other things with other ships in other places.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Jool\u0027s system, being large and having several moons has another challenge. After capture, some of my ships end up in orbits that cross the inner moons orbits. One of them, for instance, will enter Vall\u0027s SOI (at almost 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, so that\u0027s not affected) and will just receive a small gravity assist that will increase the orbit altitude just a bit... this time. So, I wonder, what happens when a ship enters another body SOI when it\u0027s not on focus (ie, I\u0027m playing with a ship on Eve\u0027s orbit or whatever). Does the game run the same calculations anyway? Meaning that I need to make sure none of my ships on Joolian orbit cross a moon\u0027s orbit, or that all of them are in an orbital resonance with the moons in their way (is that even possible)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027m trying to keep my ships in orbit for some 100 game days while expending the least amount of fuel possible. What\u0027s the best way to achieve it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T18:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all no it is not safe, vessels that are not in focus may get flung out of Jool\u0027s SoI by a pesky moon while you\u0027re doing other stuff. I wouldn\u0027t worry about Vall doing it though, Laythe in particular but also Tylo are quite fond of doing it as their SoI\u0027s are very big so it is easy to get an encounter. Vall\u0027s SoI is rather small, so the risk of an encounter is small, and if you get one Vall\u0027s weak gravity won\u0027t change your craft\u0027s orbit much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I park all my stuff around Laythe, usually I do a direct aerocapture at Laythe itself rather than diving into Jool\u0027s atmo. Saves a lot of delta-v, doesn\u0027t take a lot to escape Laythe\u0027s SoI, makes orbital rendezvous fairly easy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other option would be to do an aerocapture around Jool, but you\u0027ll end up with a periapsis very close to Jool and unless your apoapsis is also low odds are the vessel will also be on Laythe\u0027s SoI\u0027s spacecraft sweeping path. Best place to park it from a Jool aerocapture would be between Vall\u0027s and Laythe\u0027s orbits, takes a bit of delta-v to do it though as you\u0027ll need to raise periapsis to a decent altitude beyond Laythe\u0027s reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally depends where and what you want to do around Jool though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T19:00:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d think the safest and most efficient method would be to enter orbit around one of the moons themselves. Choose the one nearest you (the one easiest to reach) and get into orbit there. It doesn\u0027t even have to be a very circular orbit either, but the SOI of the \u0022parking moon\u0022 will ensure that you\u0027re not picked off by any other SOIs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-23T19:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022juanml82\u0022 data-cite=\u0022juanml82\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, I wonder, what happens when a ship enters another body SOI when it\u0027s not on focus (ie, I\u0027m playing with a ship on Eve\u0027s orbit or whatever).
