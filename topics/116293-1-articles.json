However, if no fairing was used then the mass saving compensates for the drag and overall you end up with more dV by orbit. \n\nYou can see from the last picture that drag is being accounted for with the fairing deployed. The craft was also more wobbly, indicating that the air-flow was not even because of the uneven payload. \n\nYou also have to remember that fairings (undeployed) have quite high drag themselves and launching a craft with the fairing pre-deployed removes that drag. \n\nConclusions:\n\nFairings have high drag and high mass. Quite often you are better off not bothering with one if you have relatively few or low drag parts to occlude. Also the size and shape of the fairing is very important, have a large blunt one and it is heavy and draggy.\n\nI don\u0027t know how to work out the break-even point for using a fairing. Best bet is to launch with and without and see which flies better. \n\nI suspect that the 1.0.4 change of halving the mass of fairings did not go far enough. The drag needs halving too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T10:16:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 10:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T11:15:53Z","Content":"selfish\\_meme,\n\n To be scientific on the fairing test you\u0027d need a third launch that would test an otherwise identical craft that never had a fairing.\n\n That way you could see clearly if adding a fairing and then deploying it on the pad has any benefit.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T12:17:58Z","Content":"That\u0027s such an interesting result that I felt compelled to test it, too.
