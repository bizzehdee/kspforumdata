I\u0027ve been attempting to do the same thing recently, what level of transparency should I make the textures (I\u0027d like to do the same thing as this with a few custom suits).

There\u0027s a bit more to it like selecting by colour to create an alpha map to paint fill, pulling out solids prior to adding alphas and stitching together components. You also need to refill components yourself and set the layer transparency using the Mk1 eyeball plugin. You can definitely spend alot of time on it and pull out more stuff. But, for the moment I\u0027m happy with the number of layers I can work with on the suits. I\u0027ll be adding my own stripes, insignias and decals at a later point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T10:27:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETexture Replacer permanently breaks this mod.\u003Cp\u003EEven if I remove and re-install EVE, it won\u0027t work if the game has previously run with Texture Replacer installed - even if it is not installed alongside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has been a reoccurring problem for me and only now have I found the cause.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter installing .24 the first mod I tried was this.
