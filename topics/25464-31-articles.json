I replaced the standard jet engine with a turbojet (this plane will not be a rover, so I don\u0027t have to worry about knocking off the longer engine while driving around). I took off all the solar cells and batteries, and replaced all those parts with one RTG (it\u0027s not a rover, so it\u0027s not nearly as power hungry as a BirdDog). I also stretched the fuselage a little by adding an FL-T200 fuel tank to feed two Rockomax 24-77 engines (in anticipation of maybe doing long suborbital hops).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RSViJWn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RSViJWn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing gear were moved to the ends of short girder segments, each of which also got three rear-facing XM-G50 Radial Air Intakes arranged into wedge-shaped pontoons. These parts overlap, but you don\u0027t have to turn on clipping to build them. I was originally going to remove the docking port from the top, but later found out that this bird can go to space, so I put it back on at the CG and also replaced the single rudder with twin rudders to make docking to the port easier. The plane sits and floats at a slight nose-up angle to help with taking off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SnA1fQN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SnA1fQN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow we see a picture of the underside of the Mallard. The two Rockomax 24-77 engines are mounted below the centerline of the fuselage because the landing gear structures shift the CG down below the centerline. I also added two small control surfaces to the trailing edges of the delta wings to bring the center of lift back a little (this helped reduce the tendency the BirdDog has to suddenly pith up under high angles of attack).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sx0QBwk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sx0QBwk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial prototypes were tested by Jebediah Kerman.

The plane makes rather disturbing violent splashing noises when landing or taking off from the water, but so far it has never been damaged on the water. At full throttle it can zoom along on the surface at over 100 m/s, but I can\u0027t imagine that\u0027s energy efficient. If the landing wheels are lowered, it can safely drive out of the water and up onto the shore at 19 m/s under low jet power (possibly faster, but this was not tested).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mNaPrul.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mNaPrul.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring high altitude testing, I was amazed at how fast the Mallard could zip along through the upper atmosphere. At first I thought this might be because of inadvertent air-hogging due to all those extra intakes (despite them facing backwards), but I added an action group to disable all of those intakes...and the plane still performed marvelously up high and fast. Turbojets are a wonderful thing.

The rear FL-T200 tank was also active for when the rocket engines would need fuel. Fuel flow from the forward tank was disabled to keep the CG from moving too far backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HYOTUaL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HYOTUaL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear 34,000 meters, the SSTO magic started to happen. Once the periapsis value (see the Mechjeb readouts on the left) approached 20 km, the orientation of the view automatically flipped 90 degrees and the apoapsis value began to rise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0L3o0xh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220L3o0xh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPassing 36,000 meters, the turbojet flamed out for the first time. Ludgar dropped the throttle a little, the turbojet reignited, and he continued to fly higher and faster, allowing the apoapsis value to continue to increase. At this point it starts to become a bit of a battle to keep the plane from rising too fast because the surface of the planet is curving away below it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NNLzfUi.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022NNLzfUi.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The Mallard exceeded an altitude of 40,000 meters and a speed of 2,400 m/s. The throttle was down to 50% by this point, but the apoapsis value was over 111 km and still rising. A younger me would have already kicked in my rocket motors before this point, but it\u0027s much more efficient to fly on jet fuel and push that apoapsis up, and also get above as much atmosphere as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wMnlSNA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wMnlSNA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear 48,000 meters, the turbojet was still eeking along at very low throttle. The speed was down a little, but the apoapsis and periapsis continued to to rise. There was still plenty of jet fuel, so Ludger held to the plan and held his rockets in reserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/akAZV0J.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022akAZV0J.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, the apoapsis value got up over 150 kilometers when the turbojet finally gave out near 50,000 meters, so Ludger didn\u0027t even do a rocket burn at that point. Instead, he coasted up in to space as the apoapsis slowly fell, and didn\u0027t use the rocket engines until he reached apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The Mallard made it into a 79.77 by 139.74 km orbit with 489 m/s of vacuum delta-V to spare. Ludger seems very pleased to report this to KSC as he passes overhead. The Mallard doesn\u0027t have RCS because it\u0027s primary use is not to be an SSTO and fly to targets in space...but it does have a docking port on top in case some orbital ship wants to come dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SeOPbnz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SeOPbnz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 bar graph indicators on the left (in the picture ABOVE) are somewhat misleading because the front tank still had its fuel flow disabled. In the picture below, all tanks were enabled (the middle tank was empty, the front tank was full), we can see that the ship had a little over half of its fuel left. But what matters for orbital maneuvers is the amount of oxidizer left, and the picture below shows us that the Mallard had only used 8 units of its oxidizer for its apoapsis kick.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fcHGYkM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fcHGYkM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some photos and snack bars, Ludger faced the Mallard toward retrograde and made a deorbit burn for return to KSC. The 24-77 engines give the Mallard a tendency to pitch up a little, but the cockpit torque can easily handle this. The retro burn used 32.4 units of oxidizer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/o2bWu1l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022o2bWu1l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Reentry pictures of the Mallard surrounded by ionized air.

Full throttle, and up he went at 45 degrees, just like before. True, he had a little less than half of the fuel he started with...but the Mallard was now lighter by that amount, so it shouldn\u0027t need as much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: Once again, Ludger was at 40,000 meters, zipping along at 2440 m/s, and pushing the Mallard\u0027s apogee out beyond 157 km. The indicator shows that the front tank still had 67.9 units of fuel, so he just kept pushing the bird along on jet power to get above more atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fGwISOL.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fGwISOL.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnnnd...SPACE. Ludger once again had not bothered with a rocket burn down inside the atmosphere, and had only used the rocket engines at apogee to put the Mallard into a 79.5 by 106 km orbit. The delta-V remaining was 335 m/s (vacuum)...which seems like a lot, but that\u0027s because he still had over half of his oxidizer left. Fun!

They just hate to waste those launch window opportunities. And because Kerbodyne was still practically giving away rides on their new Big Advanced Reusable Rockets, those were chosen for the flights (it had nothing to do with the fact that I\u0027m lazy and didn\u0027t want to launch twice as many of my older Reusable Rockets to do the mission, I assure you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow: The Mallard is mounted vertically on the top of the payload stack. A BirdDog is normally launched with one of the GasStation vehicles under it, but the Mallard can\u0027t use the GasStations. Yes, the Mallard has a docking port on top, but the Mallard lacks any rover wheels, so it couldn\u0027t be maneuvered into place under the GasStation\u0027s boom. But the newer Refueling Fidos can be used to link up to the Mallard and refuel it, and there will be one of those at Laythe Base (it\u0027s still enroute at the moment)... but this payload stack includes a second Refueling Fido rover (just in case there is an accident with the first one...and, if not, this one can be landed elsewhere on Laythe). The two clusters of tanks below the Refueling Fido are Extra Fuel Tank Cluster modules. One will remain attached and taken to Jool as part of this payload. The other one was added because the BARR has excess lift capacity on this mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fl0CObH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Fl0CObH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd we have liftoff! The FL-T200 tank sticking out below the Mallard is there so that the center of mass can be adjusted horizontally by tweaking the amount of propellant in that tank. The nine FL-T200 tanks in the Refueling Fido rover have had their contents tweaked to carry mostly liquid fuel, and not as much oxidizer. This Refueling Fido has four Rockomax 48-7S engines for deorbiting the rover and softening its landing. The rover\u0027s wheels are protected by a (pretend) heat shield (just because I think it\u0027s goofy to expect tires to survive reentry heating).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, yes...I know all this ungainly stuff should be inside an aerodynamic shroud...but we should also have nice hinges and stuff to make our payloads fold up.
