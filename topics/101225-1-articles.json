Those were not layed on each other. It was one placement that went to 8x. I then kept hitting x to recycle down to 3x but it kept getting larger! Kind of like the bug though. We should have way to do this as a feature.\n\nIf I picked up the item and kept trying to replace it I could keep increasing the number of radial parts endlessly. But after deleting it the phenomenon went away and future XL solar panels acted as normal.\n\nThought I would post it though in case it helped solve problems later.\n\nActually, it just happened again. but goes away after replacing the item with a new one.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T16:39:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 04:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela**"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T23:20:01Z","Content":"I believe this is a known bug, though I can\u0027t quite remember how to reproduce it myself... there is a definite set of scenarios that will easily trigger it, though. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BagelRabbit","CreatedById":95028,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:37:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I believe this is a known bug, though I can\u0027t quite remember how to reproduce it myself... there is a definite set of scenarios that will easily trigger it, though. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n...I\u0027m going to make a video on how to get this to happen reliably.
