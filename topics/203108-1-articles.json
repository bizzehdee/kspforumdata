Autostruts to root and grandparent parts could also be affected if the combined craft plus asteroid has a different root than the craft alone (maybe the asteroid is the new root?) and generally speaking, if any autostruts get recalculated in flight it ends in explosions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E switched on can make it worse as the control point will be some distance from the centre of mass, as would the reaction wheels generating the torque; any small wobble would be amplified by the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E constantly overcorrecting and if this is happening at the same time as glitchy autostruts, bye-bye asteroid grabber.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDisable autostruts and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E before grabbing, then once you grab the asteroid, release the grappler pivot, target the asteroid\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and point the craft right at it,\u00A0then lock it back in place- this makes it a lot easier to move around with that big space rock attached, especially for moving with the main engines.
