I am an engineer (true story). Lately, I have not been letting KSP influence my work much, though it is difficult to ignore this world-changing piece of software that has been the subject of much discussion by the wise and the powerful of this planet. This may explain my recent engineering successes, really, because my earlier attempts at using KSP as a design tool had landed me in hot water - or, to be more specific, in a hot flaming ball of burning fuel. Call it a major career-limiting move. But I digress. I do think that, despite my occasional long face, real-world space and scientific matters should very much be joked about, because if not, my workplace would be full of sad gits. Current engineers, mathematicians - scratch that, not these guys, just engineers - deserve to laugh, too. We need it. It is for our sanity.
