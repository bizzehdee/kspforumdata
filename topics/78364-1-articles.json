Install blue light reducing application on your phone. Avoid coolwhite fluorescent light. I\u0027m saying all that because it\u0027s clear you\u0027re watching too much blue light before you go to bed, and probably not too much during the day. It disrupts melatonin secretion which ends with insomnia.

As a patient with celiac disease, my parents had access to a special shop where no force rationing of goods imposed by our communist government, additionally they could stock up on difficult to access in PRL (People\u0027s Republic Poland) exotic fruits such as bananas, oranges, tangerines, lemons. Some cleverly parents and celiac people have been doing on the money. Let\u0027s say someone bought a kilo of oranges and then sold in the bazaar per 6 times the purchase price. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy celiac disease itself gave way. I think as a kid in 1991, I came to the Hospital Memorial Health, childhood heroes of the Warsaw Uprising (Research Institute) was devoted to children soldiers who perish per poland mainly (scout) (Damn I was moved to tears as I thought about the Warsaw Uprising and our Polish heroes of the Second World War) it was and still is the most prestigious children\u0027s hospital in Poland, was built in 1975 it was a propaganda campaign the Communists wanted to show that they care about the kids and the name chciili wyw\u00C3\u2026\u00C2\u00BCe\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 impact on Western-Germany to pay larger war reparations per World War II, was some friction Soviet Union, which had a population that gets a contract to equip the hospital and they earn on that a little bit terms of image. Unfortunately, the first secretary of the Polish United Workers\u0027 Party (the de facto head of state Polish) decided that the hospital equipment buy in \u0022capitalist countries\u0022 mainly UK, France and the USA, then a little pissed off \u0022Soviet comrades.\u0022 Apparently he said he wanted to Polish children had medical care the same or at least comparable to that of children in the U.S. and great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGierek praised the Soviet Union that they are doing the best medical equipment in the block wchodnim much better than Poland, but not less equipment meyczny the \u0022rotten West\u0022 is still better but the eastern bloc make up this gap, and Polish children deserve the best. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is not the first time I pissed Brezhnev, perhaps the most pissed off him July 20, 1969 when Poland teleizja pa\u00C3\u2026\u00E2\u20AC\u017Estowa as the only socialist country broadcast live Landing Armstrong on the moon :-) As he said \u0022he could not deprive the poles of this epochal event.\u0022 Even some joked that if in the 60\u0027s or 70\u0027s free elections on your head Member Edward Gierek was to be won. Apparently in the USSR do not like him because he was too independent, but had popular support among the Poles in what the Communists took quite considerably so the USSR could not it just get rid of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGierek even supported the development of space research, for this gave the green light for the missile program for peaceful uses the code name \u0022Meteor\u0022 was a rocket test for solid fuel 90 km altitude record :-) it was 100% Polish construction, then the cooperation of scientists from the GDR , when the Brezhnev was furious (because playing with fireworks in the Eastern bloc can only Russians) had ordered us to close the rocket program to wipe the tears of our pilot sent Miroslaw Hemrszewskiego on obirit\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 the program Intercosmos the Soyuz 30 mission \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe man who stood per the program meteor want to use them as boosters in his design of multi-stage rocket that could be achieved low Earth orbit, Russians reportedly destroyed most of the sketches, although apparently the rocket itself would not be too proved something of an American rocket, Vanguard.
