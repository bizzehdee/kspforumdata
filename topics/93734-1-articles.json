I like the idea because the specific combination of situations you have to test makes the challenge very unique. For example, a contract that has Flight (specific speed, altitude), landed at Mun, orbiting Minmus, and in flight again at Kerbin is a very unique challenge, and combining them in different ways will give you an infinite set of unique challenges. The contract generator will have to be pretty smart and avoid generating \u0022impossible\u0022 contracts however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo expand on the original post, I think programs consisting of multiple, logically connected missions would be pretty fun too.

A new mission is generated that asks you to land within 10km of 3 different places on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-One particular site is found to be particularly promising.
