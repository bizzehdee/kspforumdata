New poster, long time player. So I just got a new machine, after a long time without a computer, so naturally I decided to fire up KSP. Well, try as I might, I can\u0027t get the game to work. It loads okay (I have an HDD so I wasn\u0027t too worried about that), but as soon as it goes to the main menu, it starts moving in stop-motion and freezing. I\u0027ve been able to load the Space Center (took about five minutes!), but I can\u0027t register a click on anything else. I wasn\u0027t expecting that level of lagginess out of this computer. I\u0027m not super knowledgeable about computers. I know the basics, but not an IT guy or anything. So I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s the game, the system, or if I borked something up somewhere else. Have the game requirements changed a lot since 1.1? (Last time I played.) Any help would be appreciated!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecs and stuff. Computer:Dell Latitude E6540, Windows 7 Pro, Intel I7-4800MQ processors 2.7Ghz (supposedly \u0022Turbo Boost\u0022-able to 3.8), AMD HD8790M Graphics Card, 16GB RAM, 250GB HDD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP: 1.9, both DLCs, fully stock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-29T16:12:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour specs look like they should be more than enough to run a pure stock KSP 1.9 (are you sure you don\u0027t have 1.9.1?), so there might be something else going on. Try closing all other programs before launching KSP, then open Task Manager and keep an eye on how much CPU and RAM the game is using as it loads. If you see any major drains on either outside of KSP, end the process if it\u0027s safe to do so (don\u0027t end system processes, it can get ugly!). Try turning the graphics settings down as far as possible and see if the performance improves (there\u0027s a mod called ShowFPS which enables a FPS counter if you press F8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the game still doesn\u0027t run properly, look in this folder location:\u003Cbr\u003E\nC:/Users/your_username_here/AppData/LocalLow/Squad/Kerbal Space Program (you should be able to copy and paste that into windows explorer and get to the right folder, AppData is a hidden folder so might not show up if you just try to click your way through the folder tree). You should have a file called Player.log and possibly output_log.txt; if Player.log was last modified after you launched KSP, open it up and look for errors (ERR), exceptions (EXC) or warnings (WARN) using ctrl\u002BF. If you see any, upload the file to a file sharing site and link to it here; if not, try updating your graphics card drivers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf none of the above help you, then I\u0027m out of ideas... Try uninstalling and reinstalling?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
