Is there a way to select the AP or PE points precisely instead of eyeballing it?\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T19:19:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 07:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KingWolfWorm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:02:56Z","Content":"Not without mods, I\u0027m afraid."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:04:02Z","Content":"The AP and PE markers on your orbit indicate Apoapsis and periapsis.\n\nIs that not what you are referring to?"},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:08:36Z","Content":"There\u0027s not really a way to select the precise location of your AP or PE for a maneuver node, but you can get pretty close by comparing the time to maneuver and time to AP/PE. You\u0027ll know you got it almost spot on when your AP and PE switch location almost instantly with the addition of tenths of m/s dV, that should give you a AP and PE that are only a couple hundred meters apart."},{"CreatedByName":"RAINCRAFTER","CreatedById":127524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T19:12:27Z","Content":"Sorry dude, I just do not know.

You can get it within 5 seconds or less to the apoapsis/periapsis, although I don\u0027t see why such precision would be necessary, you have a time to \u003Cinsert node=\u0022\u0022 here=\u0022\u0022\u003E right?\u003C/insert\u003E\n\nIn my experience though, perfect circular orbits are not dependent on where you place your maneuver node, but how carefully you execute your burns."}]}
