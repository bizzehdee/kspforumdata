Lots of planning. Stuff like: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I have sketched on paper my future interplanetary ship (Ring-shaped, fuel tanks tacked on the rings) with docking at the back to carry cargo, passenger or Expeditions like Jool-5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I revised my Jool-5 plans, but with all the new pieces, including the new engines I\u0027m pretty sure stuff will change along the way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I\u0027d like to do a Grand Tour with Outer Planets mod installed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I want to set-up the \u0022Halley Station\u0022 (Match the Kerbal equivalent of the Halley\u0027s comet), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - Also explore all of Eve/Duna/Laythe biomes using an electric electric prop plane (smaller than my 0.25 version since no need of science lab anymore !). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo lots of stuff to design/plan for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got a few things sketched out and ready to try.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also starting to list mods I want to have... some I even do not know their names. Is firespitter still around ? I know my old improved nuke engine mod is gone, I need to try and get EVE and Planetshine to work... science alert, KAS, K-engineer, maybe remote tech (I like the computer that comes with it a lot... I wish the same cpu was available as stand alone... asked creator, got no response). Outer Planets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso on another build of the game, 1/10th RSS... with I hope all planets up to Pluto and it\u0027s moons eventually. Now that memory wont be a problem, why not ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was Alternis Kerbol I never tried... I know there\u0027s \u0022New Horizons\u0022 that 5th Horseman is playing and it looks almost the same, but I wonder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to mod the tech tree... I feel the current tree is worse than the old one we used to have. Now it\u0027s impossible to have Ion engines at low tech. I want to make them available before the nerva in the electricity node. Never tweaked the tech tree before, so I hope it\u0027s not too hard. I want to make most science instruments into the same line as well and over at low tech tier so I can make complete science vessels early and not have to come back to a biome every time my scientists learn of a new gadget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also want to design/rework some of the parts in the game... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving hour long burns with the Ion engines kill the fun... same with nerva on huge vessels. So larger parts (2.5m ion engines same with nerva) with same ISP but better thrust. for Ion think between 5-15 thrust, nukes about 250.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENecrobones did a revamped RadioIsotope generator last week (I think it was 1.5m ?) I want that as well as it will be useful when I get to the outer planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to duplicate the ISRU refiner (with animation) into a nuclear reactor that uses a new resource \u0022Uranium\u0022 (only possible to get some from the VAB)... so nuclear reactor with a finite life time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso electric propellers for my Eve/Laythe/Duna planes... If I cant make Firespitter work okay again I\u0027ll mod the wheesley basic jet engine to only eat electric power and adjust ISP to be reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said... lots of planning. lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot touching the game until 1.1 but I\u0027m starting to want to play it... and it\u0027s itching more and more as weeks go by. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-15T06:38:41Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2015 06:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Francois424\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T14:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETaking a break and concentrating on a book I\u0027m readying for publication.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sabor","CreatedById":59932,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T15:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlaying 64bit hacked 1.0.4.
