This will be hard to calculate at Mulbins current stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I had thought about something similar earlier on but I\u0027ve decided that my time is worth more \u003Cem\u003Eto me\u003C/em\u003E than anything I want to see on a pricetag. Granted, my panel is completely hand soldered and work could be cut down by manufactured PCBs but still, it is a lot of work. I believe I\u0027m easily reaching 100 hours of work at the moment and I don\u0027t have code yet that works on the AVR.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-10T09:49:31Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2015 09:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrOnak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T09:59:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re a much braver person than I.

And, you want to buy the panels that hold all the buttons pre-cut from a metal work company, once you go in the double digit amounts this is quite affordable. And laser-cut metal sheet looks awesome. So then the hours are just assembly and soldering.\n"}]}
