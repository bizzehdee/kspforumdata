I\u0027m sure it seems like old hat to just about everyone in this forum, but I have only really started to spend any significant time in KSP in the last few days, and I\u0027m doing so in Career mode and with no add-ons. I wanted a bigger chunk of science than I\u0027d gotten on my first four or five flights, so I decided to finally try for a Munar orbit. Well, Jeb got out there more or less, with a pair of materials bays and a pair of goo canisters along to make the trip worthwhile, but my Munar insertion ended up being more of a gravity assist than an orbit, and after the one close pass by the dark side of the Mun (should have been some Pink Floyd playing for that one) it was going to catapult Jeb and the ship right out of Kerbin\u0027s orbit entirely. He burned up all of his remaining fuel in an attempt to keep that from happening, but the fuel ran out when he was still not going to get any closer to Kerbin than 2700km. So ... after a moment of despair, he and I decided to do the trick I\u0027ve read about here, and Jeb proceeded to do about a dozen EVAs in which he pushed the capsule with his own thrusters until he managed to get it onto a path that would bring it and the 200\u002B science points on board (plus himself) back home.
