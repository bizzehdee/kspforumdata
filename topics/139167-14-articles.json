I am a big fan of RemoteTech. I\u0027m now playing a career with RT and lots of other mods. However, as I progressed into it, I noticed my FPS drops with each new flight. With just 12 flights going on, my FPS in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E dropped to 15 (with no vessels, it\u0027s 40-60). When I removed RemoteTech from Gamedata folder, the FPS went back up to 40 in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, same career, same number of flights. It appears that RemoteTech eats a lot of CPU power. Is this a bug, or a \u0022feature\u0022? Is there a fix for it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-02T22:58:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had made my own custom settings back before KSP 1.1 came out.

I used it to practice how docking works: got it into orbit, undocked then tried to redock . . . I figured it might be easier to learn that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then moved it to the lower orbit (apo \u0026lt; 250km) to set it up to fulfill a second mission: Kerbal Space Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it is up there right now, and of course, as it is my only orbital antenna it goes out of contact pretty frequently, like\u00A0 . . . 4 ours out of every 6 hour day it seems!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, my questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. As you can see, I have all the solar panels in one direction: a compromise for costs/size. A subsequent version has a mirror set of panels and \u0022edges\u0022 so it should provide more or less 360 coverage. It does have alkaline cells for backup and like 3500 electric power cap . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI naturally orient it toward Kerbol while it is in contact, and _sometimes_ it seems to retain this orientation, but then other times, it turns right around. Is this an inherent aspect of orbiting? Is there a way to get a sat to point in a particular direction and ALWAYS try to automatically point in that direction so it doesn\u0027t loss contact/power?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. It seems it is \u0022not a good idea\u0022 to try to dock with an unmanned vehicle like this while it is \u0022not in radio network?\u0022 I\u0027m certainly no pro on docking (really just now getting the hang of it) and I also am using DMagic\u0027s \u0022flexo-docker\u0022 on the incoming vehicle so that might be a problem in some way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I have experienced is this: I get the incomer lined up, eliminate all radial motion and pro/retro motion and wait a bit to make sure, then slowly pro-grade in with \u0022H\u0022 key on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters. Get it down to 0.1m/s for the last 30 m. Then come to full stop, and watch it to confirm little to no motion, switch to target (the unmanned satellite) wait for it to come into network and turn it toward incomer . . . actually it didn\u0027t work out quite this way: I realized my window for orienting the satellite was nearly closing so I did the \u0022orientation\u0022 at more like ~200m gap. Tired and got a bit off center I guess (not even sure how on-center it MUST be for stock let alone this modded docking port) and by the time they were close things were just a hair out of line and the sat had gone out of network. They came into contact at a slight angle and wobbled around for a while and then the sat toppled over and started drifting away spinning a bit at a very unfortunate periodicity/angle: effectively making it much WORSE than it had been.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if having had the sat in full control all the time might have helped me to dock this (I suspect it would) and that is what this question is really about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 A. Is it just a \u0022bad idea\u0022 to try to dock with an uncontrolled vessel in general?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 B. Is there a way to temporarily disable RT in these instances (to reflect the fact that, the pilot in the incoming manned vehicle should be able to make contact with the target vehicle and effectively \u0027take control\u0027 of it\u0027s reaction wheels)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0C. Might there be any plan to include in the mod functionality so that manned vehicles with sufficient comms equipment can \u0022take control\u0022 of unmanned vehicles in their network even when they are otherwise out of network? It might be a coding nightmare, but it would seem cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD. Any general suggestions on good/fun/challening/realistic ways to cope with these early career game issues while using RemoteTech?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Obviously I haven\u0027t got this far yet, and this is sort of a variation of question 1 above, but . . . once I do have a couple more unmanned comm sats up, is there a way to tell them to always maintain orientation in particular directions so that they don\u0027t wobble out of contact? I haven\u0027t noticed any obvious stuff in the interface, and honestly I\u0027m just exploring it as I go, so if there is such functionality, appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhantastic Mod!! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nADDIT: ah one more question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Do the \u0022cones\u0022 of effectiveness actually work as advertised? Meaning for example, the ones on that sat, supposed to have a 45-degree cone (which I assume is an actual \u0022cone\u0022 shape with the apex and center of the base aligned on the central strut of the antenna when it is deployed?).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce I got it up there, I fiddled with setting some to target Mun, and some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and while the \u0022being on the wrong side of the planet\u0022 effect certainly is clear, it was pretty difficult to make out how the \u0022cone\u0022 effect was playing into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis question might well also be a slight variation on #s 1 and 3 . . .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-07T15:27:10Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2016 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EADDIT\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T17:41:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76097-diche-bach/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002276097\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/76097-diche-bach/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Diche Bach\u003C/a\u003E:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoly compound questions, Batman!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, in order:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne solution:\u00A0 The flight computer.\u00A0 Tell your sat to point to a particular heading (you\u0027ll have to figure out which direction points to the sun, though) and it will face that way.\u00A0 You\u0027ll have to revisit it periodically, though, because as Kerbin orbits the sun, the sun, relative to Kerbin, will appear to precess about the sky and thus you\u0027ll need to reorient your satellite every few months.\u00A0 It\u0027s probably better the throw a few extra panels around the sides of the next module.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext solution:\u00A0 Get the mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/102277-113-persistentrotation-15/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPersistent Rotation\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and select body-relative rotation with respect to the sun once you\u0027ve got it lined up.\u00A0 Essentially, this is the same as the above, but where it does all of the calculating and readjusting for you.\u00A0 It sounds attractive, but keep in mind that it also causes uncontrolled ships to keep rotating indefinitely--meaning that the timewarp-to-stop-spinning trick won\u0027t work--so if you\u0027re relying on that to help you as you figure out docking, you\u0027re going to be making docking a lot more difficult to master.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPermanent-for-the-future solution:\u00A0 For your next satellite, stick some panels on the ends of those booms you\u0027ve got (the ones with the ladders on them) and that will give you some coverage in every rotation except with the sun directly behind you.\u00A0 Just don\u0027t shake it too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA:\u00A0 It can be tricky, but good idea or not, it\u0027s necessary.\u00A0 By definition, one of the vehicles involved in a docking procedure is always uncontrolled, because you\u0027re controlling the other one.\u00A0 I think what you\u0027re driving at, though, is how to dock with something when you don\u0027t have good stability on it and every nudge sends it wobbling off into nothing.\u00A0 Use the flight computer for that, as well.\u00A0 Usually the best thing is to tell it to point normal or antinormal.\u00A0 This is going to come into conflict with having it point towards the sun per the last answer, though.\u00A0 Here\u0027s why:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn uncontrolled but non-moving ship in low Kerbin orbit will always point the same way with respect to the stars.\u00A0 However, relative to Kerbin\u0027s surface, this means that it rotates once every orbit.\u00A0 Relative to the sun, it additionally rotates once every year.\u00A0\u00A0A craft that is set to point prograde will rotate with respect to the stars once per orbit and be nonrotating with respect to Kerbin\u0027s surface.\u00A0 Since low Kerbin orbit has an orbital period of approximately thirty minutes, this means that such vessels rotate with respect to one another by several degrees per minute, and that can make docking unnecessarily difficult.\u00A0 Pointing the ship in a radial direction gives you the same problem; it\u0027s really the same as prograde except that your command pod is pointing sideways rather than straight ahead.\u00A0 Pointing normal gives the ship a whay to actively orient itself, but allow it to maintain\u00A0a nonrotating orientation relative to the stars and thus the most motionless position for you to use as a docking target.\u00A0 If you nudge it while it is normal-oriented, it wil stop spinning and you can try again.\u00A0 Also, since the flight computer is making this happen, it works without a radio link.\u00A0 Power can still be a problem, though; I hope you have lots of batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nB:\u00A0 There is; it\u0027s in the settings UI under \u0027cheats\u0027, I believe.\u00A0 RT somewhat compromises between options here and says that a single pilot is not capable of flying two ships, but allows a team of six (plus the right core) to\u00A0fly everything it can link to.\u00A0 Perhaps you ought to be able to \u0027ping\u0027 another ship and tell it to turn on its reaction wheels, but in any case you can\u0027t do that in RT without bringing the requisite personnel and hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nC:\u00A0 It already exists.\u00A0 If you take six Kerbals and the largest probe core (the 2.5 metre RC-L01 Remote Guidance Unit; it\u0027s pretty far down the tech tree), you can set up remote command posts.\u00A0 It\u0027s handy for landing Jool and Eeloo probes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nD:\u00A0\u00A0Most of the\u00A0advice I can give\u00A0pertains to\u00A0what you\u0027re already figuring out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut a solar panel on each directional axis so you\u0027re not trying to keep weird orientations to maintain power.\u00A0 If you point the ship in the normal direction for docking, but it then runs out of power after a minute, well, that wasn\u0027t very good, was it?\u00A0 If and when you switch to deployable panels, put pairs of panels at right angles to one another for this reason, as well.\u00A0 I\u0027ve lost many probes because I had deployable solar panels in 2-symmetry on opposite sides of the probe;
