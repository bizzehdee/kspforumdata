The KAL-1000 comes in pretty handy when you want have multiple parts moving in unison.\n\nIn my opinion the KAL-1000 not checking for limits is a pretty big oversight of the game designers. KSP is supposed to be a somewhat realistic spaceflight simulator. You cannot run real-life engines at negative thrust to produce fuel, nor can you run real-life engines at, say, 10x their rated thrust.\n\nAnd besides, using the KAL-1000 in that fashion removes almost all difficulty from the game.
