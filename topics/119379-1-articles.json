But really there is no reason to have the parts max amount in persistence after launch. The reason it is like that is because the Resource node is universal, it\u0027s used in tanks, batteries, everything that contains an amount of something. Since batteries and tanks can be refilled it needs to know the max amount for the part, but for ablators that is not the case, they can\u0027t be refilled. So to correct this, all they have to do is alter that max amount when the craft is first launched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mod should be able to do this really easily.
