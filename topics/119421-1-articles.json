Are you sure you reverted, versus trying it with another vessel? It looks like you managed to get the contract into an unwinnable state - the vessel it\u0027s looking for to meet the second parameter no longer exists, and it won\u0027t try to pick a new one because the first parameter is already met. You\u0027ll have to cancel the contract and re-accept it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, there\u0027s probably a few better ways for this contract to be written that are less error prone.
