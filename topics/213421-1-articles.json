One solution to this is to have stage decouplers in their own stage so that they can be staged separately from the upper stage motor. The safe practice is to stage the decoupler, wait until the lower stage is clear of the upper stage motor, then stage the upper stage motor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this process is followed while performing a burn that requires contributions from multiple stages, then the burn time and navigation lines in the map view are screwed up when the user returns to the map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet up maneuver node in map view (e.g., setting up a transfer from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to Mun)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStart burn\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen lower stage is exhausted stage the decoupler\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitch to Flight View to ensure the lower stage is clear of the upper stage before staging that motor\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStage the upper stage motor\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitch back to Map View to observe the progress of the maneuver\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen returning to the map view in a case like this the projected trajectory generally shows your vessel headed for a hyperbolic escape from the body you\u0027re orbiting.
