It makes the game damn near unplayable. I have a lot of modded parts that need to be switched modes or I need to empty or fill storage or fuel tanks.\n\nIs there an alternative key that does the same function ? Or some work around ?\n\nIve searched through different posts on the internet and it seems to be a known problem BUT exiting the VAB and reentering DOES NOT fix my problem the right click still does not work"}]}
