KSP 2 will be using a new engine in a newer version of Unity, which means that Star Theory can restore the beloved boulder back to where it should be - in orbit around Ike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if they don\u0027t restore the Magic Boulder itself, there\u0027s still a chance that they can add the Magic Boulderoids (the glowing asteroids added in 1.3.3) instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alaygrounds","CreatedById":180712,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-21T22:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe they could have a kopernicus type unselectable moon\u00A0 which you can see in orbit of ike sometimes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
