This does not mean, however, that Treeloader cannot be patched. I\u0027m curious as to whether it would be acceptable to distribute a plugin that would patch treeloader after it has already been downloaded in the original format very similar to the way module manager patches config files. I\u0027m curious as to the legality of this and whether this is even possible, as I have not delved into plugin development thus far, but knowing what I do I feel as though this wouldn\u0027t be difficult at all, and I have heard that treeloader really only needs minor modifications to fix it for .25. Is this true? Or would the extent of the changes fall into the category of the patcher essentially already having a modified version within it? Where is the line drawn?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T19:23:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I were you I\u0027d PM r4m0n, he might be quite welcoming to someone willing to patch it.
