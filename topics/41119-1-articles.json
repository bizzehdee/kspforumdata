It would be beneficial to have the option to create action groups while the space station is in orbit. This way you could control solar panels with the press of a button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T09:55:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit has already been suggested plenty of time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat the moment you can use this mod: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24882-Actions-on-the-Fly-Edit-your-action-groups-in-flight-mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24882-Actions-on-the-Fly-Edit-your-action-groups-in-flight-mode\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T10:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe mod answers your question, get the mod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I fully suggest you standardise your action groups in the VAB as standard practise.
