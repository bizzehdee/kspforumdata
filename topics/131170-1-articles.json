Experts say that the idea can be useful in medicine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn their experiment, the scientists from Viena and New York used a laser and a stencil of a cat.

The Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger presented in 1935 an experiment about an imaginary cat trapped in a box, that could be both dead and alive at the same time, to demonstrate quantum entanglement of particles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe experiment by Anton Zeilinger and Gabriela Barreto Lemos is based on the same idead and they were able to \u0027take photos of Shrodingers quantum cat\u0027 in the process, following an according to an article published in Nature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientists made a circuit across which they shot pairs of yellow and red photons and with different wavelengths (after coming from a divided green photon). The yellow photons were sent toward the sillouette of the cat while the red photons toward the camera. By the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, the red photons formed an image of the cat thanks to their entanglement with their paired yellow photons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe device with which the experiment was performed can be found in use in medical applications.
