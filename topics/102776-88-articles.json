They don\u0027t owe you anything.\n    - It\u0027s incredibly rude and inappropriate to demand more free stuff from them.  It\u0027s also against the forum rules (2.2.p).\n    - It\u0027s fine to express *\u003Cu\u003Eappreciation\u003C/u\u003E*, and to *\u003Cu\u003Epolitely\u003C/u\u003E* and *\u003Cu\u003Enon-demandingly\u003C/u\u003E* ask questions, e.g. \u0022Wow, great mod, I\u0027m having so much fun!  Thank you for making this.  Are there any plans to add any more planets?\u0022\n    - It\u0027s not okay to make *\u003Cu\u003Edemands\u003C/u\u003E*, such as \u0022Moar plernerts plz?\u0022  This is bad.  Don\u0027t do it.\n- **Do not deliberately post l33t-speak or other deliberately cutesy language.**\n    - We understand that it\u0027s easy to make accidental errors-- for one thing, lots of folks native language isn\u0027t English, and we welcome everyone.  If your English isn\u0027t perfect, that\u0027s fine!\n    - However, it\u0027s very much not okay to *\u003Cu\u003Edeliberately\u003C/u\u003E* obscure your language.\n    - Saying something like \u0022Moar plenerts plz\u0022 isn\u0027t \u0022cute\u0022 or \u0022funny\u0022.  It\u0027s simply annoying to everyone.  It also makes your post hard to read for the many forum users whose native language isn\u0027t English.  It\u0027s also against the forum rules (2.3.b).\n- **Stay on-topic.**\n    - The purpose of a mod\u0027s thread is to discuss *\u003Cu\u003Ethat mod\u003C/u\u003E*.\n    - Don\u0027t derail a thread by posting irrelevant fluff that\u0027s not related to the topic at hand.  It annoys everyone.  It\u0027s also against the forum rules (2.2.0).\n    - It\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Eespecially\u003C/u\u003E* inappropriate to derail a *\u003Cu\u003Emod\u0027s\u003C/u\u003E* thread with off-topic stuff.  Mod creators put a lot of work into their mods, and they generally put a lot of work into maintaining their mod\u0027s thread, too, so as to keep it a welcoming and helpful place for their users.  Going into their threads and spamming off-topic nonsense is like going into someone\u0027s house and dumping trash on their floor.  It\u0027s in very poor taste.\n    - In particular... don\u0027t make posts just to say how cool you think some *\u003Cu\u003Eother\u003C/u\u003E* mod is.  If you like another mod and want to talk about it, great!  But don\u0027t do it *\u003Cu\u003Ehere\u003C/u\u003E*.  This thread\u0027s about *\u003Cu\u003Ethis\u003C/u\u003E* mod.\n- **Do not ask for things that are already explained.**\n    - It\u0027s rude.  Don\u0027t do it, please.\n    - For example, don\u0027t demand screenshots when the main post for the thread *\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ealready has a \u0022Screenshots section\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E* with a comment from the author saying *\u0022Screenshots from v2.0 will be uploaded soon, please have patience.\u0022*  He\u0027s already asked for your patience.  Politely.  Rudely failing to provide such patience is a poor way to show appreciation to someone who is giving you shiny new toys for free.\n- **Do not backseat moderate.**\n    - You\u0027re not a moderator.  \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIt\u0027s not your place\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E to tell anyone else on the forum what to do or what not to do, no matter how irritating you think they are.\n    - Trying to enforce rules on other people is called \u0022backseat moderating\u0022, and it\u0027s against the forum rules (3.2).\n    - It\u0027s against the rules for the excellent reason that it never helps and only makes things worse.  Yelling at someone for being unreasonable-- *\u003Cu\u003Eeven if you\u0027re right\u003C/u\u003E*-- won\u0027t make them stop being unreasonable.  It will just make them yell back at you, and then a flame war ensues and everybody loses.\n    - So, *\u003Cu\u003Edon\u0027t do it\u003C/u\u003E*.  If you see someone behaving in a way that seems to you to be inappropriate forum behavior, please just *\u003Cu\u003Ereport the post\u003C/u\u003E* and do not otherwise respond.  That will ping the moderator team, and we will take a look and adjust anything (or anyone) that needs adjusting.\n\nThank you for your understanding."},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-21T20:01:51Z","Content":"\u003Cfont face=\u0022Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, sans-serif\u0022\u003EThis.
