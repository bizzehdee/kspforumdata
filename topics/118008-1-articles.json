It\u0027s pretty good to have a wide variety of them, too. But there\u0027s a niche slot that, as far as I\u0027m aware, hasn\u0027t been looked at: High altitude engines meant for subsonic high endurance aircraft. Something that one could use to loiter over an area for hours on end, or to perform detailed mapping of a particular area without the cost associated with a specialized satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGranted, high altitude performance is also highly dependent on airframe design, but I\u0027ve been disappointed with the engines I have access to right now. The J-33 can push my Angel 1 aircraft up to 9720 meters... but not a meter more. Need to try the Whiplash engine, but I suspect that it\u0027ll have the same issues at altitude and low speed as the Wheeley.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what I\u0027m looking for is an engine that can maintain, oh, 30kN of thrust?, all the way to 15km altitude while remaining under 250 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Never mind. Whiplash CAN provide me with the performance I seek.
