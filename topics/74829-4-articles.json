Atmospheric drag isn\u0027t a huge issue, delta v-wise; I think I read somewhere it\u0027s only a few hundred m/s on Earth, out of a 10 km/s total delta v to LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere isn\u0027t a good way to compensate for scale.

I\u0027m happy to have what I have now. The amount I paid for the game is rather small, and compared to the hours I\u0027ve gotten out of it, I have absolutely nothing to complain about. There are things that I\u0027d like fixed, things I\u0027d like added, and things will be added that I disagree with, and I accept these facts.
