It\u0027s stable at lower altitudes and speeds, but once the jets get into the meaty part of the power curve it starts to yaw in one direction or another and eventually spins.

If the yaw starts while you\u0027re putting in pitch or roll inputs, then this could be it. The reason is because they are swept back. Putting in roll inputs will also cause a small bit of yaw input.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not making any control inputs when control is lost, though SAS is on and likely doing small corrections. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s asymmetric thrust as I was closely monitoring the jets for just that issue, ready to modulate the throttle if necessary.
