The modifications help, but it may also be ascent profile differences that needs to be taken into consideration too. I did a flat 25 degree pitch the whole way to orbit. (It had a very high TwR)\n\u003E -snip-\n\nInteresting, very interesting. My ascent profiles with spaceplanes have been the more typical 35 degree pitch up until 10km, then building up speed at 15 degrees, hopefully hitting 1200m/s or 1400m/s if the craft is capable and taking it from there. 25 degrees from literally the ground up is not something I considered, but I\u0027ll certainly try that out along with the modifications suggested; 500m/s dV is a bit over double (I think) what I had left over. I\u0027ll try the modifications with the bog-standard ascent profile, too.\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Never give up, never surrender, RogueMason. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n*Do not go gentle into that good night...*\n\nYou know, to quote the poem in the film that inspired my Ranger line ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:51:13Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *Do not go gentle into that good night...*\n\u003E You know, to quote the poem in the film that inspired my Ranger line ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nThat *might* be slightly overused lately.... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E d)either intakes crate less drag facing backwards, or they don\u0027t decrease the drag of the node they cap if they are moved to face inwards. That one is awaiting further experimental testing involving nosecones and rocket mode. I think it\u0027s the former, but it could go both ways. In any case, the difference is minuscule.\n\nI think I have it confirmed. Out of three otherwise identical test rigs, the one without drag-reducing measures of any kind ends up slowest as we expected, but check this out: of the two others, the front-facing rear intake, the onehidden inside the engine so that it sees incoming air how an intake is supposed to, and thus gives more air to the engines (that last part is confirmed by a higher intake air reading throughout the whole flight) creates more drag than the rear-facing, 100% drag reduction one. That one ends up with the highest speed punching out of the atmosphere, even tough it has less frontal surface to give air to the engine! \n\nSo drag is a significant enough factor that the extra speed you get out of a cleaner design with a rear facing intake offsets the higher frontal area. That tells me there is a v^2 somewhere on the intake\u0027s equations! Also, that the intake drag is dependant somehow on how much air it\u0027s sucking (or the exposed frontal area to the airstream, which is the same thing since they are proportional to each other).\n\nRune. It also makes me happy to be sciencing it."},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T08:16:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E These have been tested to improve aerodynamic flow of the aircraft and significantly improves dV performance:\n\nExcellent work, and a disturbing conclusion.
