It has completely changed the way I play Kerbal and I now can\u0027t imagine playing without it. Very much looking forward to all future releases.\n\nNow on to my problem...\n\nHas anyone tried making a 1.5 stage rocket along the lines of the Mercury Atlas launcher using SSTU?\n\nThe closest I can get is in the (terrible) test vehicle shown below using the SSTU decoupler with hollow collider enabled mounted to the interstage node of the central engine. The remaining outer engines are attached to the decoupler and use the \u0022pyrios\u0022 mount. If I use a fuel line I can get all three engines to fire and I can stage the outer two engines but I just can\u0027t get it to look nice no matter what I try. If I use the offset tool to line everything up then all of the engines are destroyed upon staging and if I try a different mount on the tank then there is still a large gap in the structure as seen below.\n\nHave any of you managed to build a working (and good looking) layout such as this and if so could you please share how you did it? I know BDB has working (and beautiful) parts that I could use but I wanted to try and build it using SSTU.\n\nIf this is not possible then could I request that it may be considered as a future part option? Perhaps it could be achieved by adding a hollow collider and interstage node to the \u0022pyrios\u0022 engine mount option? I don\u0027t know how to code at all though so obviously this is just a guess and I expect it\u0027s massively more complex than that.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions.\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\n![1AFE209E0C3C102B247606878866E522C2F20602](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/861734447430408326/1AFE209E0C3C102B247606878866E522C2F20602/)\n\nTest launch of 1.5 stage to orbit...\n\n![D88C4C3A1095A45D001BFD8EA7C950F165BB9339](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/861734447430409090/D88C4C3A1095A45D001BFD8EA7C950F165BB9339/)\n\nAfter staging, main engine still running."},{"CreatedByName":"Jhorriga","CreatedById":180947,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T12:43:55Z","Content":"ffffffffffffffffffffff.....\n\nDownloaded so frigging fast\n\nbroke finger\n\non way to hospital and play\n\n10/10 would break again"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike\u0060","CreatedById":180637,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-23T12:44:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, gmiddlemass said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Has anyone tried making a 1.5 stage rocket along the lines of the Mercury Atlas launcher using SSTU?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027ve mostly used solid first stages in my career.

Once RP-1 is exhausted in the new super stage (remember I never said remove S-II\u0027s TANKAGE!) the 4x F-1 engines are jettisoned and can be recovered via Parachute.    The Monster Hydrolox M-1 now engages..... and flys the Saturn V variant in a more efficient profile than the old S-II assembly could have.\n\nThe results in this scenario are more money saved than a standard 5 F-1 5 J-2 engined Saturn V upgrade...   For a similar payload to LEO.   IRL this was one of the proposals to try to save the Saturn V from no longer being produced... Make it partially recoverable.\n\nAtlas D/E/F/F(Hypothetical) and II are my primary satellite launcher for KSP because I can stack some chutes on the booster assembly and thanks to STaged recovery can gain some currency back.   Probably the best bang for the buck in Satellite launching.\n\nMy least used launchers are Atlas-V (BDB) and Delta IV (SSTU.)  Both are used but no where near as much as the older tech Atlas families.

I was just regurgitating several \u0022studies\u0022 mentioned here in various forums for KSP.   Ofcourse most of them are based on the Saturn V-C and V-D proposals but those were 5 F-1 engines with the S-ID Stage and a half  first stage.\n\nThe only positive is that the M-1 and the F-1 had somewhat similar LOX flow rates IIRC and thus maybe a 3 tank stage???\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-24T15:49:14Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2017 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Pappystein**"}]}
