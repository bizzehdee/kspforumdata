Honestly I think I had to fly a few airplane survey missions, and a few orbital missions before I set off for the Mun. I do find the parts testing to be absurd in some cases, but then I don\u0027t take those contracts. Also, I think some folks don\u0027t understand (and I did not until recently) that prestige helps you get bigger, better paying contracts. I made 1/2 a million on one lunar survey mission (enough to pay for my shiny new science building) and some absurd amount of science to go with it.

I never really worked with the aircraft component of the system before, and the kerbin surveys forced me to learn how to build a decent basic aircraft (though I will complain that landing gear should probably be included with the basic aircraft parts). I very seldomly used to launch probes and satellites, and now looking at those lucrative launch contracts changed my mind on that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m torn a bit on the lack of maneuver nodes at the beginning, but at the same time you can get to the Mun, and minimus and back without them (luckily I learned how back before the maneuver node system existed).

Otherwise there is always sandbox mode for people who want to start off with everything, and science mode for those folks that are just interested in that part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T23:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Apexazimuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Apexazimuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI find the part testing missions grindy, tedious, and sometimes just downright stupid.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I disagree with the grinding issue (keep in mind we\u0027re all veteran players re-playing world 1-1 over, and over, and over), but yeah the part-testing contracts are exhaustively dull.
