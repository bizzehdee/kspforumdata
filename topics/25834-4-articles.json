Do you see humans use any chemical rocket engines in that movie (little solids on the missiles aside)? Their Valkyrie SSTO is equipped with four fusion engines - two fusion rockets for orbital manourver and two fusion hybrid turbojet/scamjet for atmospheric flight and HTHL landing and hovering capability. Before discovering anti-matter rockets mankind have already mastered fusion rockets and jets to such a degree that they can cram four of them on a SSTO and still have impossibly high payload fraction on that craft. Now imagine mankind of that age trying to design an interplanetary craft, how easy would interplanetary trip be when every man and his mother could just slap a pair of fusion rockets on a tin can that can keep air in and go pretty much anywhere in the solar system?

Not for any sane definition of \u0027faster than the speed of light\u0027 anyway. Although if you understand then Lorenz transformations, the phrase \u0027faster than the speed of light\u0027 doesn\u0027t actually mean anything anyway. It\u0027s like saying you believe in circles with a circumferance to diameter ratio bigger than Pi, because why not? Numbers can be bigger than Pi, so why can\u0027t circles have bigger circumferance to diameter ratios?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing relativity to vague best guesses made hundreds of years ago doesn\u0027t cut it. Relativity made numerous provable predictions that have been shown since to be correct. It\u0027s earned it\u0027s right to respect the hard way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless I\u0027d be fine with an FTL system in KSP that only works well outside the bounds of any planetary system so the current feel of the game is preserved. My understanding is that this is the plan.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yes, and Bussard Ramjets. Turns out they make better brakes than engines. The magnets you need to contain the fusion process for a CNO Cycle would have to be so powerful they\u0027d tear the ship apart. Also the theoretical top speed for a BR, assuming perfect efficiency and no lost energy, is 0.119C because you have to first speed up the protons you\u0027re collecting to your current speed before you ejects them as exhaust, and there\u0027s a limit to the net energy they get from the fusion process. In practice, your top speed in likely to be a small fraction of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other problem is that the collector scoop systems for a BR would have to be huge, on the order of the diameter of the moon. Good luck assembling that in KSP. It\u0027s several orders of magnitude bigger than the physics simulation range anyway. Light sails have the same problem. It would likely take you hundreds of years of game play to build one and the even huger solar arrays and laser focusing systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe, I like my KSP as close to the way it is as possible. The ideal would probably be to have other systems just be a long way away but still reachable. Say put the outer planet of the nearest systems 5 or 10 times further away than the orbits of the outer planets round Kerbol. That would be unrealistic, but a decently playable compromise. However it might cause problems for the simulation engine. The way I see it, a hyperdrive that only works far away from a star is essentially just a loading screen for entering another game context for the new planetary system. If it solves some tricky technical problems for the devs, that\u0027s fine by me. I\u0027d rather they spent their extremely valuable time providing fun things to do in the game rather than solving overly complex simulation engineering problems that don\u0027t actually add to the in-system exploration game play we all love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimon Hibbs\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-08T09:49:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2013 09:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by simonh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T09:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temstar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temstar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI fail to see how an antimatter engine with fantastic Isp and much better TWR than current ion engine (obvious since you can use it to build huge ships that can reach 0.7C at constant 1.5G acceleration) would not be useful also for interplanetary travel.
