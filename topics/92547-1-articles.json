All was going rather well with a few journeys to Mun and Minimum under my belt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever at some point I\u0027ve been attacked by the Kraken ... and now although my game loads --- i do not see anything. The screen is black, and all I see is the overlay - the nav ball etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is ... I really don\u0027t want to start again.

When you start a new game, click on the difficulty button and select your previous difficulty. This will set up all the multiplier levels and other basic options to what you had before (or whatever you want now). Then click on the Custom tab. At the bottom left there are sliders where you can adjust the starting funds, science, and rep. You\u0027ll have to know roughly how much science you need to unlock the tree to the point you were at before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, start up your new game.
