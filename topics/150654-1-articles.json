(or Aether... or hill... or The.... whatever you want to call me, everyone has a different name for me).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni\u0027ve been playing Kerbal for a few months. I have 120 hours into the game so far. But I\u0027m new to the forums, thought I should introduce myself here since this is here as well ;3\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play modded KSP for the most part. I go for realistic when I can, so RemoteTech, TAC life support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc (if you have any more mods that make the game realistic you should recommend them (not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E) :3 ). My current personal achievements/milestones in the game has been landing on the Mun. In my current save, creating a working CommSat constellation that allowed me to communicate with my Mun probe, this probe is now orbiting the Mun collecting SCANsat data for me :3\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy next mission is to either land another probe onto the surface of the Mun, or create and land a rover there. I\u0027m unsure if I\u0027ll do that before or after I begin creating a space station. I think I\u0027m going to have to create a reliable launch rocket to do either projects but we\u0027ll see how it goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m interested in creating KSP mods as well, so in the coming weeks or months you may see my name more often \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0keep an eye out for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, that\u0027s about it for now.
