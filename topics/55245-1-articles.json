Early experiments with reentry vehicles that were \u0022intuitively\u0022 aerodynamic--i.e., pointy end first--were frustrating because they kept disintegrating due to heat buildup. However, one test had an accident that saw the RV come in blunt end first, and survive essentially unscathed. The surprised engineers did some analysis, and realized that coming in pointy-end first had lower drag... and thus let speed build up a lot more in the upper- and mid-atmosphere, so heat built up much quicker and higher and caused thermal failures of the casing that resulted in the vehicle breaking up. Coming in blunt-end first, with its high drag coefficient, allowed the vehicle to start to slow down much earlier, thereby greatly reducing peak thermal loading and making it more likely to survive. This is why so many early ballistic missiles had blunt noses--that was the blunt end of their warhead, positioned up front to simplify the job of having it come in that way, rather than requiring a turnaround maneuver in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern ballistic missile warheads, for the record, come in pointy-end first, but that\u0027s an adaptation made in the late 60s as anti-ballistic missile technology was being explored; they chose to switch to that configuration for two reasons. First, the much higher descent speed of the pointy RV made for a much more difficult intercept problem for an ABM, and second, coming in pointy-end first would allow the use of fins or vanes on the RV (apparently never deployed operationally--but then, we don\u0027t know that much about RV design for security reasons!) to allow terminal maneuvering, initially intended to try and dodge ABMs, but later considered to improve accuracy. They can do this because someone figured out that the depleted uranium used as a neutron reflector in the warhead, if shaped properly, would also make a dandy ablative/heatsink-type thermal protection system for the rest of the warhead, even coming in pointy-end first...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T14:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rdfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rdfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe surprised engineers did some analysis, and realized that coming in pointy-end first had lower drag... and thus let speed build up a lot more in the upper- and mid-atmosphere, so heat built up much quicker and higher and caused thermal failures of the casing that resulted in the vehicle breaking up.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed doesn\u0027t build up.
