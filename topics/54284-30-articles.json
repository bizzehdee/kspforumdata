Found out that if you weld parts together in EVA and then grab the main part the parts welded to it explode. lol. Guess KAS doesn\u0027t like Lazor welded parts.[/QUOT\u003Cp\u003EThanks for info and reply.....I will check out the Ubio welding then. I make enough things explode without any extra help......\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-13T06:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixing the pad to deal with \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E modification to the spawned vessel prior to release is not something I can do for a 4.0.X release, it looks like too big a job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I say \u0022\u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u0022, that might be a bit too strong.
