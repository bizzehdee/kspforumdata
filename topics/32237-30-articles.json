TGAs are just as editable, but slightly larger. For TGA I recommend the TGA_Compressed setting, TGA_Uncompressed is almost as large as an MBM.

If I had a non-square texture as wasmic insists, Unity will simply double the rectangle\u0027s height so that it turns back into a square, and then generate the mipmaps as usual, thus negating any hypothetical memory savings from wasmic\u0027s proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - I reserved the other half for future parts like solar panels, payload rack holders, procedural trusses, etc. If I started out with a rectangular texture and UV mapped my existing parts accordingly, I\u0027ll have to redo all the existing maps all over again if I expand the texture for the new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are certainly welcome to reduce the sizes of the textures as much as you please in your own setup, but that\u0027s not something I\u0027ll offer support for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedInvader","CreatedById":106018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T05:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOD (Load on demand) doesn\u0027t need anything to be optimized, all it does is shift texture handling away from unity until the texture in question is called by the program. Basically, it just keeps the game from having to load every texture into memory at a small cost in access time. As a result, the memory that KSP shows as an increase when loading a part is usually just to normal amount of memory that part would have taken, but is not shown normally because its mixed in with all of the memory allocation for the other parts. Ultimately, the mod allows you to have a ton of part mods without getting OOM errors before you even get to the main menu as it only loads the textures you actually use on a ship / part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I understand the concept of having a common texture for everything (it\u0027s a pretty good idea, just like the interchangeable models), I think we\u0027re just making the point that there are still large for what they are accomplishing. That being said, I also understand your reasons for keeping them large for the time being, I was just trying to make the point that even shrinking the pngs can save hundreds of MB of used memory. I will shrink them for myself in the short term and look forward to something more optimized when this is finally completed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also done some poking around with squad\u0027s parts and have found that they seemed to have capped their texture resolution at 2048, with many of their parts being as low as 512, which is probably why they have such a low impact on memory usage compared to the textures used in many part packs which are often 4096.
