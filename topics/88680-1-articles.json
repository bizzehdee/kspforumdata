This makes it easier to build a deliberately low-tech design, whether as a test for Science or Career mode, as a self-imposed challenge, or simply a way for new players to dripfeed themselves into rocket design without being overwhelmed by all the part choices. (I\u0027m aware there\u0027s Science mode for the third bit, which is what I did. I soon moved on to Career mode though, and found it so much fun I stuck with that until I surpassed my current progress in all my Science mode games, forcing me to use the Wiki to plot out the rest of my tech advances.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-27T20:47:57Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2014 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Spheniscine\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ringerc","CreatedById":128140,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T12:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds great to me, especially if it was a quick and easy Level 1, Level 2, etc, not individual tech selections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all, getting to Mars with an asparagus clump is awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
