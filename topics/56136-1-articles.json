He can afford it. Once you heard this information, was there any need to argue about it any further?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas there any need to spread hate because of your ignorance or small mindedness?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStop and think for a second. Answer these questions to yourself:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Does a popular game reviewer playing KSP affect you if you don\u0027t know him? (No.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do his videos have millions of views each? (Yes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Can he offer a lot of publicity and raise awareness of KSP, bringing it to a MUCH wider player base than anyone of you can? (Yes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Can he influence people to buy this game - EVEN if they will just mess about - raising more money for Squad with each copy? (Yes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Is his fanbase exclusively 12 year olds? (No.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Do children playing KSP affect you in the slightest? (No, how could they? It\u0027s Singleplayer and even with MP mods you can have private servers....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will Children affect the community? (No, the community can be easily moderated, problematic children will be banned - most won\u0027t even bother with Forums)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will Children have money to pay for a game like KSP? (I sincerely doubt that anyone below 12 will even have money, anyone above that age will probably spend it on candy and cellphone credit... such is life)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Will the community change in any significant way? (No. Kids will be banned if they cause trouble, doesn\u0027t affect anyone really)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing that irritates me more than empty hatred of something/someone because you simply don\u0027t look beyond the cover. That\u0027s borderline judgmental. I thought this community was made up of mature people who put thought and consideration into what they say and who don\u0027t force their opinions upon others like you have done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFYI, It was a dumb thing to say \u0027\u0027Give him a free copy\u0027\u0027 I mean really... That\u0027s probably half the reason for this backlash in the first place... Still, come on people. Think BEYOND your own prejudiced opinions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd please, consider how this could also benefit you and the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- popularity will draw fresh blood into the game, people who have a genuine interest will stay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more funding for SQUAD to develop the game because of new traffic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more funding means more features, possibly more staff, better updates and even more detail\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- richer game will in turn make for a richer community\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do like PewDiePie, I find his videos funny and I have tried many games that he has played. Actually, if not for him, I would probably never get to know certain Indie titles. If you guys could only focus on the positive side of this argument, everyones lives would be much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL: DR\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPewDiePie should play KSP but he will have to buy his own copy like the rest of us. He will bring attention and publicity to KSP, bringing in more money to develop the game. Community can be moderated, getting rid of people who will be here to spoil the experience and those who care about the game will stay with us.
