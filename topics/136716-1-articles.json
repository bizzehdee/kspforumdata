I rotated the remains of the plane prograde(down), and tried to make it glide. the plane resisted rotating, making it hard to turn, but i managed to pull the prograde vector up about 15 degrees from around\u00A050 degrees down. at around 500m i turned fully prograde and slowly pulled up. The prograde vector pulled up drastically, to around 15 degrees before i hit the water. I somehow, unbelievably survived.\u00A0The winglets\u00A0broke, but everything else was fine.
