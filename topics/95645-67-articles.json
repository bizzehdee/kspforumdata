Changing the tech tree during a game was probably not considered by squad...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a complete tech tree rewrite planned after ksp 1.1, which is the main reason why the changes of 0.9.6 were restricted to the early tree. With the rewrite I plan to make some more radical changes. Additional outsourcing of fuel tanks are among them and per your suggestion I\u0027ll add the big wings as well. I also plan to move some tech \u0022lanes\u0022 around. Like the orbital stations and colonization line right next to the command modules, thus making a \u0022manned space parts\u0022 cluster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking part stats dependent on KSC upgrades is problematic, since that would create a dependency between SETIctt, SETIrebalance and CustomBarnKit. Also I m hoping that CustomBarnKit allows the addition of more \u0022steps\u0022 in the building upgrade progression. Especially the VAB and LaunchPad would imho benefit from more than 3 levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTemperature is so unbalanced in stock, that I can\u0027t really build upon it unless I balance it first, which imho is not worth the time at the moment, with so much other stuff to do. As you said, that is more like a CCF topic at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRefraining from starting a new career until 1.1 reminds me of people waiting for ksp 1.0 for a new career. I would definately make and keep a proper 1.0.5 install (including manual kerbal engineer and station science download), since some 1.1 features look really broken even from the design stage, like the new probe connection mechanic without flight computer. Not to speak of the ksp track record regarding implementation, especially since 1.0...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ll have to take a look at those early craft.

In fact it is my favorite probe core for everything not neading a top attachment node. Since it lacks the top node, I figured it would need less structural mass, so I made it more mass efficient than any other probe in terms of capabilities (taking a look at it, it should be 0.07tons, will have to correct that in the next update). Since the early days of the SETI mod, the stayputnik is balanced to be the lightest probe core with reaction wheel, which kind of picks up on part of the design emphasis of sputnik, to be extremely mass efficient in terms of mission focus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was planned to have the \u0022stayputnik\u0022 from SXT as a representation of the real sputnik, since that one actually has the ability to detach the sphere. I hope the SXT pack will be a little more modular for 1.1, decreasing the hurdle for supporting parts of it.

As for the STACK, I do feel it should remain heavier than the Stayputnik, given that it is relatively more useful than it (you can attach some science parts, as well as antennae).

In game though I consider that mass to include both the probe core itself, as well as the four Communotron 16s I always attach to further mirror Sputnik. Coincidentally the four Communotrons add just enough to mass to bring the total to just over 80kg, if the Stayputnik\u0027s mass is about 0.05. As for the STACK, I do feel it should remain heavier than the Stayputnik, given that it is relatively more useful than it (you can attach some science parts, as well as antennae). It is the reduced mass of the Stayputnik that incentivises you to use it on earlier missions, instead of the STACK (or formerly the HECS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget that the STACK lacks a reaction wheel.

And since the settings file was not installed but auto-generated when RemoteTech was first loaded (afair), that seemed to be a sensible choice. So that people who wanted to change the settings could just go to the normal location of the config, eg for signal delay or mode or colors and so on. I guess with RemoteTech settings it is the same as with life support mods, using more than one is trouble. I m not even sure how the ground stations would work on a resized kerbin.

On one hand I want to keep the stock resemblance, on the other hand the early tech tech nodes are a bit cluttered now.
