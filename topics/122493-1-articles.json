I mean I can somehow live with the fact that they get overheated (though in real life any designer of an engine that overheats before it makes even LK(E)O would lose his job pretty soon) but what I don\u0027t understand, why don\u0027t they cool down if not used in a 150KM orbit? One would suspect that out of athmosphere it is pretty chilly outside and heat would dissipate quite quickly but no, I was warping through time in the space center for 7d and when I switched back to my rocket, the engine was still overheated exactly the same as 7d before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I think this hole overheating mechanic is broken, the engine should begin to cool down the instant it gets shut down, especially when there\u0027s no air worth speaking of to cause friction on it.

I tried the same with two LV30 (the 1.25m ones with fixed gimbal), they begin overheating around 80km and get useless (read: 100% overheated) around 140km orbit.

First off, I don\u0027t know why but when I did a flight just yet to take some screenshots the problem wasn\u0027t so severe. The engines still got overheated a bit but I managed to get into 150K orbit without it exploding. I then increased AP to well over 1000k and the overheating was completely gone. I thought maybe they released 1.05 but it\u0027s still 1.04 so I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve done differently this time - demo effect anyone? Anyways, as you see in the following screenshot I fly the most basic rocket to achieve a high orbit of 10\u0027000k for my sattelite (needed for a mission).
