I do appreciate all the work that was put into the automatic weighting process, but you notice as you progress into the mid and late game the ways in which you\u0027ve pidgeonholed yourself into contract types early that may not be important to you later. It doesn\u0027t really allow you to make broad changes to your playstyle as you progress. For instance a player might select things like part-testing and tourism early on but later decide they\u0027d like to move more heavily into\u00A0mining and base-building. If, however, players could with some small investment effect the probability that, for instance, rescue missions would appear directly through a strategy it would give them much more specific control over their options and allow them to make big changes mid-stream if they wish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome examples might be -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rescue me\u0022 - Rescue missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If You Build it\u0022 - Construction missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All Mine\u0022 - Extraction missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blinded by Science\u0022 - Data collection missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Phone Home\u0022 - Satellite missions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\netc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhoo.

I\u0027d call them programs though. The problem is in order to change the strategies to something sensible and enjoyable the whole career mode would have to change. But if I was to design it the more conservative way I\u0027d imagine it to be more or less like this (only a few examples):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNational Programs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAircraft Research Program - Research and build planes until you get all the atmospheric parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E Program - Research and build SSTOs, get missions to test components, fly them, etc. and still progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLocal Exploration Program - Research vacuum engines and test them in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E/Mun/Minmus, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeep Space Exploration - Research deep space habs, probe bodies and atomic/ion engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommercial Programs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeep Space Resources - Prospect and exploit potential resources in space and either use them in-situ or bring them back to your home planet for good money.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTourism - Anything that is connected with tourism (orbital hops, vomit comets, space hotels and stuffz).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientific Programs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteranetary Science Program - Send probes everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLocal Science Program - Make a space station and research stuff there (test parts, grow food, make nanotubes, whatever)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sentinel Program - Make telescopes, look for asteroids, grab asteroids, things like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is just few examples.
