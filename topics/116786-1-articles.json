However, I can\u0027t manage to get a complete download from the KSP store - it\u0027ll get up to about 100- 120mb and then stop, unable to get going again. I\u0027m not sure if this is an issue with my ISP or the KSP site or something else. Are there any approved download mirrors or anything? Anything odd going on with the servers today?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEdit: proof [http://i.imgur.com/Gdkb8Xe.png](http://i.imgur.com/Gdkb8Xe.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T01:27:01Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Coyote27**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T15:18:02Z","Content":"Hi Coyote27, the download is working, can you try another browser?"},{"CreatedByName":"Coyote27","CreatedById":141964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T15:21:21Z","Content":"Well, it worked today.
