Most people won\u0026#39;t step foot onto a plane driven by a computer until they\u0026#39;re already used to having their lives in the hands of computers - and driverless cars will get people used to the concept. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a pretty good idea on what would need to be automated versus what is already automated on a fixed wing and I\u0026#39;ll tell you that the person above who said it\u0026#39;s just a matter of automating takeoff/landing/cruise is far off the mark. The first drone airliner is going to be a brand new aircraft backed up by brand new ground equipment. We\u0026#39;re not even halfway to where we need to be to automate passenger aviation. You can\u0026#39;t just take a 747 and have it start itself, taxi itself, get from LA to Sydney, taxi to a gate, then shut down under every airline SOP, airport operation, nation-specific airspace rules, and unique aircraft configuration possible using the technology on the shelves today, and if you do then it\u0026#39;s reinforced using ground based equipment that isn\u0026#39;t always reliable and certainly isn\u0026#39;t installed in more than 1% of the airports that are out there. That\u0026#39;s just one plane, now you have to do it for all the others.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I said, it\u0026#39;s probably a few decades away. I\u0026#39;d be surprised if we had it by 2040, and surprised if we didn\u0026#39;t by 2115. By then someone, human or otherwise, would have figured out the kinks. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: As a side note, my buddies who operate little helicopters tell me it\u0026#39;ll never ever ever ever be automated. I dunno if they\u0026#39;re serious or just trying to protect their job, but since I\u0026#39;ve never been on a helicopter before I thought I\u0026#39;d throw that in.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T20:49:31Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WestAir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WestAir","CreatedById":59115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T21:36:06Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027llanthas\u0027]We could probably adjust the definition of \u0022automated\u0022 to change the answer from \u0022never\u0022 to \u0022already happening\u0022...
