The reason I didn\u0027t multiply the mass is because, at this point you should kill your horizontal velocity, which uses fuel, which decreases mass. After completing the horizontal burn :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuicide burn altitude ~ Altitude fraction * mass (kg)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should, when your vertical velocity gets to 0, leave you a few hundred m above the surface. If you were skilled enough, or had the automated aid, to keep your Thrust to Mass ratio (TMR) constant it -should- leave you a few m above surface (because of the conservative g value).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how I figured out how to calculate suicide burns, now on to clarifications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuicide burns are not particularly efficient. We all know that hovering is as inefficient as you can get (using the highest possible dv to go nowhere) and can be defined as having a TMR equal to g. A suicide burn is TMR - g (a) for t seconds to equal the vertical dv, so your \u0027gravity waste\u0027 dv is equal to g*t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat isn\u0027t even the biggest offender of dv usage, which is the suicide burn itself. The higher from the surface you are, the more vertical dv you need to burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore minimize the dv needed, you need to minimize the vertical dv (reduce height) and decrease burn time (increase TMR and reduce vertical dv). The increase to TMR has to be tempered with mass and fuel usage which is beyond my scope of understanding to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample (Mun suicide burns, total values include the dv used to bring it down after the suicide burn thus breakdown values are approximate, using a ~ 3.8t lander with 50kN engine):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E28.8k x 28.6k : 900 dv (530 h dv, 285 v dv, 75 gw dv)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.2k x 8.8k : 760 dv (540 h dv, 166 v dv, 60 gw dv)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer orbit between them: ~23 dv\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the lower orbit saved about 115 total dv on the suicide burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main points are suicide burns are not as efficient as most people think, however they do allow a certain amount of ease for determining landing sites. Also, the burn should be done from as low an orbit as possible (mainly within limits of maneuverability and terrain). And as always make sure to buffer your dv budget, in case fun things happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EADDENDUM (theory crafting aka untested):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was the quick and dirty way, now to increase accuracy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest way to increase the accuracy of the burn (lower the height when vertical velocity is 0), it to keep a constant TMR. You can adjust the throttle (or presumably thrust in 0.23) to match the mass lost with the burn, but this is ... difficult to do manually. You can also plan around average mass of the craft while burning, but to do this you need to know how much fuel is used. This gets us:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe quick and dirty method:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst we need to know the fuel flow rate (m-dot) for the stage (thanks Advanced Rocket Design tutorial).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em-dot = thrust / (Isp * 9.82) // This is a constant for the stage (unless you turn off/on engine(s))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em-avg = m0 - (dv / (2 * m-dot * (TMR - g)))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe accurate method (based off of the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em-avg = (m0 \u002B (m0 / e ^ (dv / (Isp * 9.82)))) / 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em-avg is the average mass to plug in to the altitude fraction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em0 is the starting mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETMR is the starting Thrust Mass ratio // Hey, I did say quick and dirty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee is, of course, Napier\u0027s constant. ~2.71828\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you\u0027re finishing your burn closer to the surface. Which may or may not be a good thing. Next step, how do we use less dv on the burn? Easy! Basic trigonometry. Now I nearly failed my trig class all those years ago, so there is undoubtedly a more efficient way, but I figure this will do as a start. This also requires a relatively flat stretch of area, so kilometerage may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027ve calculated your vertical dv. Good. Now look at your horizontal speed. Figure out the dv needed to reduce your horizonal velocity to your vertical dv. You see where I\u0027m going with this, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to calculate your mass after the horizonal burn. This will be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick and Dirty:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 = m0 - (hdv / (m-dot * (TMR - g)))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccurate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 = m0 / e ^ (hdv / (Isp * 9.82))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em1 is the final mass after the burn\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em0 is the starting mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehdv is the horizontal delta v\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETMR is the starting Thrust Mass ratio\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee is, of course, Napier\u0027s constant. ~2.71828\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou plug m1 into the m-avg formula as m0, and multiply the dv in that formula by sqrt(2) (~1.4142). Instead of rad\u002B, you put the pitch to 45 deg retrograde, wait for the altitude it spits out and burn. This should save about 1/4 of the vertical dv that you initially calculated, which may or may not be worth the effort.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T16:44:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 04:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Hetsin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrection\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
