Mechjeb and safe file editing optional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETime: 20\u002B Hours\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Not tested)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBACKGROUND: The year is 2020. After exploring, mapping, and colonizing every moon, the kerbal Space Program had nothing left to do. Well until one day a particular Kerbal was stargazing after a heated conversation on when ether Miniumus was made of sorbet or not, he spotted a distant rock. Gene Kerman got a whiff of it, and realizing he was back in business, sent an massive space probe into an orbit around Kerbol on a orbit matching Eve. What the ship saw was the mother of all asteroids on a collision course towards Kerbin. Realizing he was back in business, Gene Kerman immediately started a program that will deflected it as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPRERPATIONS: Use hyper edit or safe file editing to send a 200m asteroid on a collision course towards Kerbin at an altitude higher than Eeloo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: All probes must be unmanned and self sustaining. Try doing this by your self as much as possible but you may use mechjeb to help but no autopilot, only guidance. Must have a comm device on there also. MUST SCREENSHOT TO VALIDATE YOUR CLAIMS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETIP: Try finishing this as soon as possible, lest you worry the public. Try making the cheapest, most efficient design possible. KSP suffered some budget cuts earlier on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbinal 1: Send a satellite on an orbit around Kerbol at a similar orbit to Eve\u0027s orbit around the sun. This should be the optimal orbit for taking pictures of asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOPTIONAL: If you can, make the asteroid course\u0027s pass by the Kerbinal within 1 km as it heads toward Kerbin. Screenshot it if you complete this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESavior 1: Send a probe to rendezvous with the asteroid and take a picture of it. Post your photos below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESavior 2: Send a impact probe to collide with the asteroid. Fill it with scientific instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESavior 3: Send a probe to land on it and take surface samples with the scoop o matic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESavior 4: Send a probe to be permanently stationed there.( In case any spacecraft gets in the way, or it decides it like your massive colony on Eve better.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge: Recover all probes by the end of the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: All of your Iron Curtains (except 4) should be equidistant when finished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIron Curtain 1: As a back up send a ship designed to deflect in an orbit around Kerbin close to Miniumus. ( In case it passes Miniumus.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIron Curtain 2: Same specification as iron curtain 1, Except in a different place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIron Curtain 3: Same specification as iron curtain 2. Except in a different place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIron Curtain 4: Make it in Geostationary orbit, with a dish comm device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge: Make All Iron curtains point to at least another one at any given time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin\u0027s Fist: Launch a rocket that will push that mother of an asteroid back to where it came from. And try not to hit any planets or spacecraft along the way. If you do, at least hit Jool ! You can\u0027t even land on there, anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBonus: Deflect it before it reaches an altitude below Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterword: KSP was in the public spotlight for a short time after this intense event. But the most important thing happened a year after this\u0026gt; The Kerbinal satellite had been providing some clear pictures, and if you squint really hard, you could see NEW PLANETS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for doing my challenge, and I hope you enjoyed it. I will be posting more soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. But until then, keep on flying, and don\u0027t forget to pack the snacks! - ThinkOutsideTheHangar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
