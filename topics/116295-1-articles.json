It would be great if someone was able to come up with curved segments of such as the FusTek Station Parts currently being worked on by Sumghai.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35043-1-0-X-Experimental-FusTek-Station-Parts-(WIPs-on-GitHub)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35043-1-0-X-Experimental-FusTek-Station-Parts-%28WIPs-on-GitHub%29). The reason these are great is that down is to the side of the cylinder as opposed to the end like in the hitchhiker and mobile processing lab IVAs.\n\nIn terms of parts, whilst no modular torus parts exist (or if they do let me know!), the best and most user friendly (I think) centrifuge part to create the spin itself is from Angel -125 DSEV mod. I just remove all the extra parts not needed.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87070-WIP-1-0-4-Deep-Space-Exploration-Vessels-1-0-0-RC3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87070-WIP-1-0-4-Deep-Space-Exploration-Vessels-1-0-0-RC3)\n\nFor complete toruses ready to go:\n\nAlso, you could try PorkJet\u0027s habitat pack\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64442-Habitat-Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64442-Habitat-Pack)\n\nOr Lack\u0027s Mk2 Centrifuge\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542-1-0-4-SXT-Lack-s-Stock-Extension-N-1-and-Aero-update-SXT-20-6-05JUL15-KSC-v3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542-1-0-4-SXT-Lack-s-Stock-Extension-N-1-and-Aero-update-SXT-20-6-05JUL15-KSC-v3)\n\nPeace."}]}
