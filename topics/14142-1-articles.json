The lander section weighs around 2.8 tons, and the section to return is 1.9 tons. The base was built using the Probodobodyne kit, and the return module is the Probodobodyne small core and a couple of fuel tanks, with the MechJeb pod version\\\u0027s engines and fuel tank around them (great little engines, those). I\\\u0027m relatively confident that they should be able to make the trip, although my launch vehicle needs some work; I keep losing all stability towards the end of the gravity turn, tumbling helplessly past the apoapsis, and plummeting back down.
