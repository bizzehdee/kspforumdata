Here is as simple as I can describe why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll orbits are ellipses. Basically, you want to change one ellipse into a different ellipse - one that has a skinnier minor axis. In order to do so, you have to change its eccentricity - but one of the defining characteristics of eccentricity is the location of the foci. Essentially, you are trying to change eccentricity (make the orbit/ellipse more skinny) without moving the foci - it can\u0027t be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mathopenref.com/ellipseaxes.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.mathopenref.com/ellipseaxes.html\u003C/a\u003E \u0026lt;- Here is a fun little math thing you can use to play with ellipses. Try changing the minor axis - see the foci moving around? You can change your orbit with respect to the foci, but you can\u0027t change the foci with respect to your orbit (unless you\u0027re God, if so I have a few questions you might be able to answer about life, the universe, and everything.) =p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s possible to do this with more than one burn - actually, it only takes two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(In any order) thrust prograde at Periapsis to raise your Apoapsis, thrust retrograde at Apoapsis to lower your Periapsis. Your last burn should be done such that it changes altitude of that node exactly the same as the altitude change for the other node. In the end, you\u0027ve increased eccentricity of your orbit, which also decreases the minor axis.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-25T18:35:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2013 06:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by EtherDragon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T17:48:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou probably could, but it would take multiple burns\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T18:31:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need a more eccentric orbit; your Periapsis (lowest point) needs to be as low as possible while your Apoapsis (highest point) needs to be as high as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem comes in that the body you are orbiting is always at one focus of the ellipse, so if your major:minor axis ratio is too high one of two things will happen:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your highest point will be too high, and you will be on an escape trajectory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The lowest point too low: either will be inside the atmosphere of the orbiting body (if it has one) and/or below the surface of the body (meaning you\u0027ll crash into it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this fundamentally limits how eccentric your orbit can be.
