He had just gotten back from a meeting with Rockomax Launch Conglomerate. He was keen on taking a short nap at his desk before his next meeting. Unfortunately, this just wasn\u0027t his day. A knock on his door, three knocks followed by a kick to the door.\n\n\u0022Come in, Linus\u0022 Wernher sighed.\n\n\u0022Good afternoon Dr. Von Kerman, how was your--\u0022 Linus started.\n\n\u0022Get to ze point please Linus.\u0022 Wernher was too tired for small-talk.\n\n\u0022The United Kerbin Space Probe Agency\u0027s Joolno probe has found evidence of an entirely new type of anomaly in orbit around Jool. They\u0027ve asked to schedule a meeting as soon as possible, their sensors seem to suggest it\u0027s going to be some pretty big news.\u0022 Linus placed an envelope on Wernher\u0027s desk. Wernher looked at it, and decided to go through with the meeting.\n\n* * *\n\nThe press conference at the Kerbal Space Center was held inside the Astronaut Complex. Walt, Wernher, and Bob Kerman were sitting at a panel, a crowd of photographers and news reporters eagerly awaited the announcement.\n\n\u0022Greetings Kerbelles and Kerbalmen, we have exciting news today about a new space probe program.\u0022 Walt began. He motioned at Wernher to begin his announcement.\n\n\u0022Last week, the United Kerbin Space Probe Agency discovered a new type of anomaly. It was found near the Joolean moon Bop, and has been presumed to be a result of Kraken activity strong in the Boppian area of space.\n\nAs we all know, anomalies have been a major curiosity to the Kerbal Space Program and its related agencies for the past half century. They have ranged from mysterious spacecraft to magnetic abnormalities to SSTV transmitters. In what was thought to be an unrelated phenomenon, the Deep Space Kraken phenomenon has caused spacecraft mysterious problems related to some manner of spacetime distortions in physically stressful situations. For the first time a link between these two phenomenons, the Anomalies and the Krakens, has been found. A spherical object wandering around Bop has been detected that emits strange radiation.\n\nWe are now ready to unveil the latest Space Probe Program, the *Inversion Program.* The Inversion Program will attempt to make up-close observations of the anomaly and try to identify what it\u0027s relation to other anomalies is. Unlike any other Space Probe program since the Munar and Dunar explorations nearly 40 years ago, the Inversion Program will be crewed.\u0022\n\n\u0022Any questions?\u0022 Walt asked the audience.\n\nOne of the reporters stepped up to a microphone. \u0022What is the current theory as to what the new Anomaly is?\u0022\n\n\u0022The best explanation so far is that it is some kind of gravioli-funnel like a black hole or a neutron star, but much much smaller and less massive. But this is all hypothetical. The Inversion Program will greatly expand our knowledge on the subject.\u0022 Wernher answered.\n\nAnother reporter stepped up. \u0022Who will be the astronauts for the Probes?\u0022\n\nBob stepped up to respond. \u0022The veteran Astronauts Jebediah Kerman, Bill Kerman, and myself Bob Kerman will lead the first expedition, followed by a second crew led by Valentina Kerman, Halnie Kerman, and Kirrim Kerman.\u0022\n\nA particularly angry sounding reporter then charged up to the mic. \u0022Are you aware of the possibility that perhaps Space doesn\u0027t WANT to be Probed? Maybe the Space Kraken is INTENTIONALLY trying to keep our devices out of space? Have you and your United Kerbin Space Probe Agency ever considered that? What if...\u0022 At this point security escorted the man out of the complex.\n\n* * *\n\n4 months until launch date, Jebediah was at the Horizontal Integration Facility inspecting the vehicle. It was an otherwise conventional rocket, the front end of a Kerpollo Command/Service Module welded to a large LV-N Powered transfer stage, with a nuclear reactor attached haphazardly to the rear between the fuel tank and the engine block. Jeb did notice a peculiarity. Two large nacelles hung off of aerodynamic struts on the reactor. He pulled an engineer aside. \u0022Hey, eh, what exactly are those two thingamabobs on the side of the rocket?\u0022 The engineer was just as puzzled as to the function. \u0022I don\u0027t know, some part test contract from some Zephram guy who\u0027s paying high-dollar for a test near the Anomaly. They\u0027re not telling us what it does, just how it needs to go on. Needless to say, it\u0027s hard to work with something you don\u0027t understand.\u0022 The engineer wiped his brow. Jeb was flabbergasted at this. \u0022In my day\u0022 he thought to himself \u0022We knew exactly what greeble was stuck to the side of our probes and ships!\u0022 He decided to find Wernher and confront him about that.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T17:56:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T05:25:09Z","Content":"Interesting.

We\u0027re pulling Sarnus-Fives out of mothballs but we still needed to develop the science hardware and the spacecraft and the lander. We\u0027re selling payload space and Dr. Zephram Kercrane payed for a *lot*. We\u0027re not going to risk that contract by being too nosy.\u0022 Wernher explained.\n\nJeb was fuming.\n\n\u0022I am *NOT* going to risk the mission on a contract to test something that needs a metric crap-tonne of nuclear power! It could excite the anomaly, we don\u0027t know what it will do!\u0022\n\nWernher rolled his eyes.\n\n\u0022Bob and I both agree it is safe. Bob is the scientific adviser for the Astronaut Corps. He\u0027s the authority on this matter. You\u0027ll have to bring this up with him.\u0022\n\nJeb fumed away."}]}
