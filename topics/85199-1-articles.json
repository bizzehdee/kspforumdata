So here \u0027s the idea: have some sort of time delay specially when staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I have a command module connected to a science lab. Both are armed with parachutes, what I want to happen is that when I stage, the science lab detaches and after 3 seconds or so, the parachutes deploy by themselves without having to switch to them. Or for another example, I have a plane armed with \u0022missiles\u0022. What I want to happen is for the decoupler to drop the missile first and after a second, the \u0022missile\u0022\u0027s engine fires.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really don\u0027t know if anyone can do it but I think this could be really useful.

It would certainly be helpful when the SRB\u0027s of my space shuttle burn out. From time to time the decoupler fire before my sepratrons ignite, resulting in the boosters just falling down rather then flying away from the remaining vehicle.
