You can just drive, walk, or fly straight through them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI pretend they are solid and try to go round them. It really adds to the challenge of trying to drive fast across Mun, but I\u0027ve have lost several rovers in horrific crashes as a consequence. I nearly crashed my grand tour craft on Pol as I had to move over a bit to avoid a cluster of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you do? Do you also pretend that they are solid and carefully try to avoid them, or do you go crashing through them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWill they ever be solid?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T19:32:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mean you can actually drive THROUGH them??!!
