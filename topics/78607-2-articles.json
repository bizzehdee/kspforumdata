Now, I\u0027m not saying that there should be an actual satellite feed window, or anything of the sort, but in the background you could run a similar simulation to that which unlocks portions of the map in ScanSat. You could include a module that lets players \u0022begin exploration\u0022 and with that, in a ScanSat fashion, a background function would keep track of what areas have been visited by the rover since that module was activated.
