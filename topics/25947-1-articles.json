I just love building weird looking things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, this is the Double Ring Fighter Plane I built after I saw some pics on google with starwars looking planes and ships. It\u0027s no star wars replica, but I love the way it looks. and because I just couldn\u0027t help it, I also mounted 8 missiles \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img59/1451/2013050700002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013050700002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img194/406/2013050700003x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013050700003x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlying it is very straight forward. As always, keep it straight on the runway and at about 120 m/s pull up hard-ish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt flies very smooth. I left the UI on so you can see there\u0027s no SAS required, UNLESS you fire the rockets, which will make the plane spin like crazy if you\u0027re not careful. The fuel is a bit of a concern, but I managed to fly for about half an hour.
