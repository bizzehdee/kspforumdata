I went with the orange in these WIPs because it matches the large orange adapters, and the Kerbodyne logo has orange in it (also orange stands out in the blackness of space). However, I know that if you try to attach t202 to t404 it might seem awkward, seeing as t202 is structural as well and ad being\u00A0light gray in color. T202 is also made out of angular metal struts, while the new T404 is made out of round metal tubes. So, one way I could resolve that is by making the t202 out of round orange tubes, another way is to make the T404 tubes light gray. The issue there is that the metal panels that make up the curtain walls of the T404 would have to be a different color or they would overmatch with the tube framing.

My intent was for them to be used in propellant depots. However, that\u0027s the fun of KSP, using parts in unexpected ways. Problem is, having multiple nodes with stacked symmetry and crossfeed makes for weird fuel flow issues. One solution would be to remove the other nodes leaving just one on the bottom and one on the top. Another way is to add a giant decoupler that fits the tank clusters, but then another problem appears in the form of multiple engines to one decoupler. Hmm, have to think about that more.
