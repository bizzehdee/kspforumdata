I want players to be able to use the solar wings for power generation, and still get useful thrust from the  engine. 4x275=1100 which is close to my goal of 2mW for full thrust. Meaning, if you use 4 solar wings you can get 1mw which equates to half the thrust.

My intent was for them to be used in propellant depots. However, that\u0027s the fun of KSP, using parts in unexpected ways. Problem is, having multiple nodes with stacked symmetry and crossfeed makes for weird fuel flow issues. One solution would be to remove the other nodes leaving just one on the bottom and one on the top. Another way is to add a giant decoupler that fits the tank clusters, but then another problem appears in the form of multiple engines to one decoupler. Hmm, have to think about that more. Thanks for bringing it to my attention!\n\n2) This is why I gave the behemoth engine cluster a high gimbal range of 8 and response speed of 8. For comparison the \u0022Vector\u0022 engine has a gimbal range of 10.5 and a response speed of 8. When I tested the system with a 1000 ton payload (6 behemoth asparagus using radial decouplers), it performed as expected with no fins. I\u0027ll do some tests.

I do like the yellow-orange on the WIP T404 parts. Since these are meant to be end game, what\u0027s the possibility of including a couple of other end-game OP-drives as well, like Orion Nuclear Pulse and a Warp Drive, in your art style, as optional downloads? I totally understand though if you are against the idea of using OP drives like those. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerenatus","CreatedById":151246,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T12:37:29Z","Content":"The light colour of T404 trusses is unwilling to change no matter how I change RBG settings.\n\nAnd what about make the colour of those static solar panels dark-red-ish and black-ish just like the \u0022Leviathan\u0022 ?\n\nAlso, I love the new square-alike version, and am excited to hear you decide to make DOORs![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) for the trusses so that our poor green creatures and their cargos could no longer be constantly exposed to dusts and radiation![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022).When I use B9 HX parts, I always want a functional door of some sort, and now the dream comes true,haha."},{"CreatedByName":"Bonus Eventus","CreatedById":115722,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-20T14:45:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Kerenatus said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The light colour of T404 trusses is unwilling to change no matter how I change RBG settings.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And what about make the colour of those static solar panels dark-red-ish and black-ish just like the \u0022Leviathan\u0022 ?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Also, I love the new square-alike version, and am excited to hear you decide to make DOORs![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022) for the trusses so that our poor green creatures and their cargos could no longer be constantly exposed to dusts and radiation![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022:wink:\u0022).When I use B9 HX parts, I always want a functional door of some sort, and now the dream comes true,haha.\n\u003E \n\nThis is do to how I chose to animate the light in Unity.
