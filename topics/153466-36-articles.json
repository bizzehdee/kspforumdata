The test team however are always up for a challenge, and they have been working hard at finding bugs, albeit minor ones, which have been fixed this week.

It\u0027s not against the law to sell bad games. It\u0027s not like the console version wouldn\u0027t\u00A0start at all from the moment you got it. Credit card companies often provide some method for customers to \u0022charge back\u0022 purchases that retailers refuse to refund.

As far as I\u0027m aware this still isn\u0027t common with Microsoft\u0027s or Sony\u0027s online stores. If the retailer says no refunds, I\u0027m not sure you can do anything beside talk to your credit card company. Software is often expressly sold \u0022As-is\u0022 with no warranties, guarantees, refunds, or liability on the part of the retailer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a \u0022Buyer Beware!\u0022 situation in the software world, and progress has been slower to change that than in some other industries/markets.
