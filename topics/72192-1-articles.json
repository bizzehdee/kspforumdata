I reckon Kerbal Space Program would be great as an MMO, a whole system buzzing with hundreds, even thousands, of active players and ships, but I can also see how that would be a real challenge to handle. At the very least there\u0027d need to be a way to avoid performance degradation when lots of high-part-count ships get together. Of course if the server is distributed we could have both: the official Squad servers for MMOness, or our own private ones for playing with a few friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) How\u0027s timewarp handled. As I understand it the Kerbal Multi Player mod has shown one way, I don\u0027t know the details. For non-massive multiplayer, a viable option might be to just put the server admin in charge of the timewarp, maybe with some \u0022safety checks\u0022 so timewarp isn\u0027t activated when someone\u0027s flying in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
