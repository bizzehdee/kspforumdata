You start focused inside the sun instead of your vessel, and have no control whatsoever. Also \u0022End Scenraio\u0022 simply doesn\u0027t react at all. You are essentially forced to ALT\u002BF4 the game, cause it won\u0027t let you out of the scenario, in which you can\u0027t even play.\n\nSo, I restarted the game, went back into that training scenario, it worked. Then I go to \u0022To the Mun part 1\u0022 Timewarp into the muns sphere of influence, get set back OUT of the sphere of influence, and get the \u0022You left the sphere of influence of the mun, Reset\u0022 message. I click Reset, and suddenly I\u0027m in control of an Asteroid somewhere in deep space. Also the reset message is still there, still resets me to the asteroid and the ESC menu is not even available. Sorry, but What the Stuff? How have such incredibly broken Training Missions made it into 1.0? New players that actually do tutorials before playing will not like this. They\u0027ll probably uninstall the game, and say screw that.

Also it would be mass neutral, not 2x (discounting tank mass). The latter is also for design reasons.

I brought a Mk1 Command pod, with heat shield, parachute and two thermometers back from a 178km orbit. The return trajectory was fairly steep and it passed through 20km with a velocity of around 1300 m/s. I turned on the thermometer to display temperature as I passed through the heating zone. The temp climbed to about 400 degrees on the command module and about 12% of the heat shield ablated. At around 15000m I deployed the main chute and had an uneventful landing in the ocean. During the rest of the descent the temp climbed to about 500 degrees, after splashdown, I watched the temperature continue to climb to 564 degrees.\n\nTo me this indicates an issue with heat radiating or conducting into a cooler environment. I can see a little temperature rise as the heat shield conducts some heat into the craft during and shortly after the max heating phase of re-entry, but to continue to climb as the source of the heat (air friction) is removed and then the craft is dumped into a huge heat sink does not model well with real world thermodynamics."},{"CreatedByName":"quantumpion","CreatedById":57602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:38:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Floppy rockets are back.
