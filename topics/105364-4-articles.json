The temp climbed to about 400 degrees on the command module and about 12% of the heat shield ablated. At around 15000m I deployed the main chute and had an uneventful landing in the ocean. During the rest of the descent the temp climbed to about 500 degrees, after splashdown, I watched the temperature continue to climb to 564 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me this indicates an issue with heat radiating or conducting into a cooler environment. I can see a little temperature rise as the heat shield conducts some heat into the craft during and shortly after the max heating phase of re-entry, but to continue to climb as the source of the heat (air friction) is removed and then the craft is dumped into a huge heat sink does not model well with real world thermodynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quantumpion","CreatedById":57602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Endersmens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Endersmens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFloppy rockets are back. The joint strengthening of 23.5 seems to have disappeared.

In addition, SAS behaves very poorly and way overcompensates, causing huge instability - even in a vacuum. It\u0027s completely useless.
