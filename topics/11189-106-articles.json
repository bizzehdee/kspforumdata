The plane is therefore all stock parts, and stock physics. I used no clipped parts, except for a small nosecone clipped into the RAPIERs. Other than that, what you see is what you get.\n\n![PZy0YRs.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PZy0YRs.jpg)\n\nHappy faces ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n![oR3zBXN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oR3zBXN.jpg)\n\nThe plane reaches Mach 1 without a problem.\n\n![biPdQBh.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/biPdQBh.jpg)\n\nHowever, there the engines struggle to accelerate. This is overcome by putting the plane into a 1000 m shallow dive.\n\n![Xzq9i41.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Xzq9i41.jpg)At 500 m/s, the pilot can pull up, and although that maneuver will cause the plane to slow to about 420 m/s, the plane will now continue to accelerate as the shock cones feed enough air into the engines.\n\n![kqSm5yH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kqSm5yH.jpg)  \n\nAt about 24 km altitude, the plane switches to rocket-mode (RAPIER Closed Cycle).\n\nSpoiler\n\n![tM49sBY.png](https://i.imgur.com/tM49sBY.png)\n\nFrom there on, it is quite a standard exercise to get into orbit: Apoapsis to 75 km... glide into space, and raise the Periapsis too. The only trick is to turn off the central 2 RAPIERS, because they are not aligned with the Center of Mass. This is by design, and made easy by pressing \u00223\u0022 (action group 3).\n\n![LFEMJac.png](https://i.imgur.com/LFEMJac.png)\n\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in the Galileo Pack is not located at the equator, so I had to correct 9 degrees (7 degrees left in the picture below).\n\n![jZpoVXI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jZpoVXI.jpg)\n\nOnce in orbit, the Space plane had a little rendezvous with a lost Kerbal.\n\n![wz7XRmo.png](https://i.imgur.com/wz7XRmo.png)\n\nSpoiler\n\nThe poor soul must have had a space plane too, but it totally disintegrated and only the inline cockpit was left.\n\n![EVXVpUJ.png](https://i.imgur.com/EVXVpUJ.png)\n\nDoodwin (I *like* that name) boarded the functioning space plane...\n\n![rpPfRtH.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpPfRtH.png)\n\n![E7MsTih.png](https://i.imgur.com/E7MsTih.png)\n\nDoodwin got to travel back home in economy class though.\n\n![d46FhX2.png](https://i.imgur.com/d46FhX2.png)\n\nAfter picking up Doodwin Kerman, the Periapsis was lowered to 30 km...\n\n![s3QwM6e.png](https://i.imgur.com/s3QwM6e.png)\n\nThe plane comes with a couple of rather pointless \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters at the nose to keep the nose up a little longer in the atmosphere.\n\n![JSSYyBU.png](https://i.imgur.com/JSSYyBU.png)\n\nWith the size and mass of the plane, these 4 thrusters were insufficient to make much of an impact. But that didn\u0027t matter much because the Kerbals entered the atmosphere a little early and didn\u0027t want to slow down at all.\n\n![73VJJjO.png](https://i.imgur.com/73VJJjO.png)\n\nThe plane was wonderfully heat-resistant. Only one control surface got really hot (which was surprising).\n\n![Acwmi33.png](https://i.imgur.com/Acwmi33.png)\n\nAt around 14 km, the engines were ignited again to fly to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n![cxrATcB.png](https://i.imgur.com/cxrATcB.png)\n\nA left turn was needed to get to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (because of the earlier plane change).\n\n![QcjG7SV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QcjG7SV.jpg)\n\nFinal approach. Not really aligned with the runway, but whatever... At least it\u0027s heading towards it!\n\n![KpGA8w8.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KpGA8w8.jpg)\n\nSpoiler\n\nThe Galileo Planet Pack \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is surrounded by mountains, but their height was slightly overestimated.
