In other words, fuel production. Funny enough, it looks small but has more mass and can carry more fuel then my 21 year old station. It got there with the tanks pretty much empty - but that\u0027s okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I designed my first 3-crew zero-G shuttle/tug. Never made a space tug before - I have made what I called space truckers but none of them were as effective as this tug. It has a senior docking port, two nuclear engines, and a ton of fuel - very much influenced by other tugs I have seen. But it has too much fuel. It took me hours to get it into orbit - even with Mech Jeb 2. I made it too big - at least too big for my skills. BUT I finally got it up there and docked with the old station. It should be useful in moving station parts to the one around Mun. Funny part is the senior docking port is between the engines, facing backwards. So a part can dock with the tug, even with the tug docked to a station. And the tug would attach parts by \u0027backing up\u0027 to the target port.

I generally use a BACC first stage, then an rt10, then a small liquid kick stage. If I need more payload, strapping two BACC\u0027s to the centre one, and having them fire first works well and is still dirt cheap.
