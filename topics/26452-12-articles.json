Another is entire-vessel (pad) fuel search.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe auger model is pretty lame: no animations at all. I might look into adding some particle effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the KAS attachment on the new pad, try using a detachable attachment placed after deployment. I haven\u0027t used the new pad at all, but this worked on the HL pad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skykooler","CreatedById":60459,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T22:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mihara\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mihara\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat reported, can I ask, why the new launchpad model is self-propelled, pretty much indestructible so it shouldn\u0027t need any landing legs, but has no non-moving easily accessible places for a docking port or a KAS connector, (Well, I found one, but I can\u0027t call this easily accessible, you have to dig deep inside to get there) or, for that matter, has no backup power generator of any kind, so if you don\u0027t land it fast enough it will spend all power on SAS torque?\u003Cp\u003EP.S. Oh, and the new launchpad model has \u0022debug = true\u0022 in it\u0027s config file. The launchpads from Spherical Launchpad package don\u0027t, which is apparently the reason why they can\u0027t spawn the test object at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is for the launchpad to have a docking port on the back of the cockpit. But I haven\u0027t figured out how to do that yet. So, for the meantime, since you can\u0027t attach anything to it, I enabled debug mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for landing it - it should have plenty of power to last as long as its engines do. If you\u0027re really worried about running out, you could always stick a RTG on the bottom which you decouple just before landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
