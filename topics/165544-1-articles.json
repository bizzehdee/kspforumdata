Is your realtime gameplay limited? It takes a little while, but it\u0027s safest and most profitable to taxi around in a small jet to do those experiments. Especially if you have a few airborne contracts to do too. You just drive around\u00A0avoiding the dangerous ridges, hop out when you reach a waypoint and do your experiment -- and when you are done on the ground you take off and do the airborne waypoints.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mk1980","CreatedById":163203,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-16T10:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nguess i\u0027d make\u00A0a small plane that can land in rough terrain. mabye add parachutes if you aren\u0027t good at landing (and a 2nd seat for an engineer to repack the chutes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntbh, i skip those contracts when they pop up. the reward is fairly low for the real time investment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spricigo","CreatedById":166502,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-16T12:04:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/Spricigo/KarlJatho\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethat one \u003C/a\u003Efly pretty well, just land near the spot and taxi around as Bewing suggests.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess you can try a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003Evtol\u003C/abbr\u003E design but seems unnecessary\u00A0overcomplication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223173560\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022165544\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221505558711\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163203\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mk1980\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, mk1980 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntbh, i skip those contracts when they pop up. the reward is fairly low for the real time investment\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDitto\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T22:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRockets and rovers are the way forward.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
