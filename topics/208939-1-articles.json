With loads of experiments, a biodome and hydroponics, cloning, teleportation, chemistry and obviously ZAMBIES, it\u0027s been a shower thought of mine for years. Recently I tried making my dream a reality through Roblox Studio, but I gave up*.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I think science is a genre that most games companies are overlooking. Sure, you could argue that cult classics such as Portal and it\u0027s multiple sequels and spin-offs is a \u0022science\u0022 game, but science is sort of a... secondary objective in those games, if you catch my gist. Again, Portal is technically a huge experiment the entire way through, but it\u0027s not actually science. You aren\u0027t the scientist growing weird fungus in the back of the office mini-fridge, you\u0027re the lab rat being injected with a mind control drug. Or the lab rat being given a space-time dimensional rift causing laser rifle.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main premise of the game would be doing experiments, making weird and deadly pathogens, causing humans to teleport through walls, that sort of thing. There would be a contract system (e.g. Make this lab rat become two separate sentient entities! etc.) But the further you progress, the more pressure you\u0027re given by your bosses to get things done.\u00A0 Say, you were told to grow this tree and feed this fish the fruit from it. Get that contract for your first contract? No pressure, dude. Grow it in your own time. Get that late-game? GET IT DONE! NOW!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust thought of a premise for a sequel; WAR!!!! Muahahahaha! You\u0027re told by the military to develop bio-weapons, and you don\u0027t like that idea. So you turn against your evil paymasters! Develop a bio-chemical, put it into the ventilation system of you\u0027re manager\u0027s manager\u0027s manager\u0027s manager\u0027s manager\u0027s office block and wreak havoc! Employ scientists to help you in your endeavor and develop cures for your rival\u0027s bio-weapons being deployed all over [REDACTED]! Eventually, you and your employees end the war by making both side\u0027s weapons completely inoperable and regain world peace.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do y\u0027all think? Would players like this idea or become bored immediately? Tell me in the replies and this poll!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Project is currently underway: \u0022Pinewood Trinity Complex\u0022.
