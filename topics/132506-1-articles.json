Bonus points if you can have the M\u00FCn encounter slingshot you in a way that allows even more gravitational assist maneuvers. Basically, start in low Kerbin orbit matched with Minmus\u0027 orbital plane. From that plane-matched low-Kerbin orbit, perform ONE engine-burn with as many gravitational encounters/escapes as possible without any extra engine-burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T22:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like fun, but don\u0027t forget to submit your own attempt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StevieC","CreatedById":146665,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-19T22:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll append a guideline. It\u0027s probably not a crazy enough trajectory unless you\u0027re forced to exit the game and tweak the limit on patched conics in the game\u0027s settings.cfg file. Not a requirement, but a good rule-of-thumb. I want to see screenshots with the trajectory prediction turned into a rainbow of different curved lines for each SoI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
