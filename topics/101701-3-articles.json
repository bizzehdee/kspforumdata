I suggest the react channel because it seems like it would be fun to see people react to KSP, particularly since they are likely to have many explosions in the mix. I suggest Rosanna Pansino because I quite enjoy seeing her make all manner of nerdy delights, and I think it would be fun to see her make something KSP related. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T14:18:21Z","Content":"I would kill to have HOCgaming return to KSP!

Not that when it is reached, you see \u0022game over\u0022 and credits roll. It simply means there is a hard to reach, final tech demanding, Expensive goal for the game. It needs something to propel you forward, other than your imagination.. How about a black hole that you have to \u0022probe\u0022 to get a final piece of equipment. When I say probe, I mean.. put in orbit without entering the event horizon, take some measurements, then return it back to kerbin. Realistically, This only requires making another \u0022black\u0022 planetary body, maybe 30 AU from kerbol, that has a huge gravity well. Add a contract to \u0022probe\u0022 it, and make the reward A piece of hardware that you didn\u0027t previously have. Maybe something \u0022sciencefictiony\u0022 ..
