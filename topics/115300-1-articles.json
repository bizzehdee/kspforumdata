You may need to stick some airbrakes if you need them though."},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T02:21:41Z","Content":"\\*Frantically spams Rep Button\\*\n\nGod that is awesome.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:06:26Z","Content":"That looks like it has a *really* low wing loading.

The stock MK3 cockpit doesn\u0027t really fit the part but hey, stock is stock...\n\nAnd yeah, most of the lift comes from the body as one could imagine but the screen is at 35-40 Km so lift improves drastically. Really love the way you can make a skip very high in the atmo, you could glide the thing all the way across the opposite side of the Kerbin."},{"CreatedByName":"Andromedaxd","CreatedById":159014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-21T01:52:50Z","Content":"I created a Skylon lookalike using the B9 Pack, and thats it.
