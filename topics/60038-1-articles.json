Here it goes:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI first started using clipping, I think, like everyone does: by accident. I still didn\u0027t get the building UI, hadn\u0027t looked up the controls on the wiki or anything, and I screwed up. I just dismissed it as a bug. Some time later, after I was already comfortable with the building UI, the structural parts got introduced (this way back at 0.17 or something like that, when I started playing). And with them the cubic orthogonal strut! Now clipping actually could be used in constructive way, to stick intakes in unlikely places. It was then that I started to notice some behaviors that actually got clipping to happen, to exploit it, but I was also shown the dark side of the coin, and the reason we say that clipping is like a superpower: \u0022with great power comes great responsibility\u0022. In this case, great explosions. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESee, the buggy no-clip rules are there for a reason. First, during building, clipping can make the UI confused about the part roots and make some truly spectacular bugs. I especially hate the one where you can\u0027t place a clipped set of parts with symmetry, but when you finally drop it you realize it did actually stick... only on top of itself, several times, bugging the craft file. Ever happened that to you, BTW? CTRL-Z immediately when it happens, the only way to not screw up the craft file. Then there are the RUD episodes when docking or relating to docking ports, especially those involving clipped cubic struts. NEVER put a docking on top of one of those, trust me. And the phantom forces... I had one of those recently, and yeah, it involved a docking port that was accidentally clipping a nearby structural element. Wasted flight, and you should have seen my face when the station started rotating for no apparent reason, faster and faster every second. ^^\u0027\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd yet, even while all those rules are there (supposedly) so you can\u0027t make a ship that will spontaneously combust on the launch pad, still there are times when they actually conflict with what should be legitimate ways of placing things. Ever been frustrated by having to place a cluster engine by engine because it wouldn\u0027t let you do it with symmetry? It always pisses me off when it happens, and you loose hours of your life to getting around that, or sacrifice symmetry (and I\u0027m a bit OCD about that, never mind balancing issues).\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnother one of those fancy rules is \u0022surface attachment\u0022, for example. Some parts have it on, some off (and you can only place them at nodes). That means some parts are hell to place because they want to stick everywhere, and yet other parts can\u0027t be strutted because from because they don\u0027t seem to have a surface mesh. Really, an exploiter\u0027s dream. Combine that with the weird placement rules that partially disables clipping if you are moving a part form that has already been placed in a legal site, and yes, you can pretty much clip 90% of the stuff you can clip with the \u0022cheat\u0022 activated.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnyhow, bugs apart, yet some more time later, and used to bring up the editor tools to turn part clipping off by default every time I got into the game, I got to learn about the mod \u0022Editor tools\u0022. That basically makes your life even easier by taking all those rules to avoid bugs, and giving you the option to turn them on and off as you please with handy keyboard shortcuts. I love it! It has cut my building time in half, and I save on parts by placing stuff with surface attachment mode. I totally recommend it, it will save you a lot of headaches once you learn its tricks (look up a tutorial/wiki!). \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESo yeah, in my opinion, the building UI has a learning curve, and it\u0027s not an easy one. And there are tricks that is good to know, and others that will save you a lot of time. Yet others will allow you to test the limits of the game in fun and spectacular ways that resemble real-world physics the way technobabble does in sci-fi (I want to remember here the \u0022\n\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ddzJzmLxtQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u0022: I think that marvel of kerbal engineering was, indeed, powered by the magic of two vessels, the kerbal and the egg interacting and clipping each other through the magic of ladders.

The \u0022challenge\u0022 part, I already did, and I encourage anyone to try it or experiment in general. It\u0027s the only way to get the really complicated stuff like how to manage fuel routing in heavily clipped designs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut after that? Yeah, I went for convenient over complicated on the SSTO Mk XXIV. I think that\u0027s the last one I showcased. And my denomination excludes a lot of one-offs that flew with mods or modified for a specific purpose, or were a straight copy from spy imagery (I do that a lot, recreate designs from the spacecraft exchange without downloading the .craft), I don\u0027t count those, so I\u0027m probably nearing 50 SSTO\u0027s since about... 0.18 I think I flew the first one. Anyhow, the point I\u0027m trying to make is, don\u0027t assume people use the cheats because they can\u0027t do without them. The main reason I use them is to save on parts while maintaining a clean finish that looks really cool, and with the least amount of cursing in the VAB.

You can get that (fuel tank, docking port, and cockpit) arranged in that configuration three ways: No clipping, an extra cubic ortogonal strut, and lots of building experience, and perhaps a couple of tries, and you\u0027ll have to use other auxiliary parts while building to trigger some bugs. The second way is with clipping on, a cubic strut again, and half the time. Then there is with the mod Editor Tools, part clipping on, surface attachment on, and no extra parts, saving one part and loads of time (it\u0027s all through shortcuts). Pick one, I go for the third, all will work on all computers and KSP versions with or without mods or part clipping on. If you do it wrong and the cockpit collides with the active part of the docking port, though... just try it and dock it \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the stacking bugs are something you only get with part clipping activated.
