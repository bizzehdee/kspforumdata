I\u0027ll look again, maybe the model is messed up. The KIS part being one piece, I don\u0027t think that would do it. Maybe it\u0027s the two colliders-which I could swear was only one... \n\nOh don\u0027t worry, there will be a greenhouse as well. The idea is that if you have a life-support mod like TAC-LS, the greenhouse will produce food air etc. Otherwise it\u0027s just a decorative piece.\n\nAnd great test, it definitely sounds like the Saddle needs work.

Right now, only the Geology Lab is available (and I am working on expanding its capabilities), but I do have others in mind that require more design work. Since Pathfinder is a separate mod from Multipurpose Colony Modules (MCM), you won\u0027t see templates that provide MKS/OKS functionality, like the Ponderosa had in MCM, as a core feature. Instead, I have stuff in the works that is appropriate for Pathfinder; things that help your prospectors and geologists do their jobs, things inspired by NASA\u0027s space habitat studies, stuff that gives you the tools to find that good spot before setting up a more permanent facility."},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T06:27:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Glad you like it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I have a bunch more work to do, such as straighten out the issues with the Saddle and continue developing the Geology Lab, but it\u0027s getting there.\n\nYeah... I had my first encounter with the Kraken shortly after switching back to the base area from the Tracking Station. Stuff exploded and the lab got hurled a couple hundred meters upwards. (I was on Minmus...) However, the Ponderosa and the Chuckwagon pods have proven to be extremely sturdy, as they survived the impromptu flying lesson, while the radio antenna I had bolted to the roof of the Ponderosa did not fare quite so well.\n\nThat said, there are some... balance issues... with the LFO Buckboard. Take a Buckboard with a Ponderosa and some other oddball part tucked inside, a 1.25m probe core, two 100 EC batteries, two solar panels, and an LV-909, and that little probe packs over 5 km/s dV.
