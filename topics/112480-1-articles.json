Extremely disappointed with the way that game turned out, the website still boasts promised features never implemented, and it appears that no attempt whatsoever was made to finish the story. \nAbandoned to the winds (and mods) as far as I can tell, I gave up on it ever being fixed some time ago. A real shame too, it had much promise.\n\nFelt very much screwed over, as I bought this before release only to see it abandoned in favour of v.2. \n\nWill not buy anything from this dev again.\n\nAs for the MOO remake...

Gamestar magazine:\n\n***Updated***  \n\nI have been following quill18 and his Early Access series on Master of Orion.  \n\nMy post will mostly be about the differences to MOO2.  \n\n- fixed research tree for everyone, no creative/uncreative~~/pick-one anymore~~, *some fields require the player to select of one of two/three technologies*\n\n- fixed starlanes/wormholes, no hyperjumps from anywhere to everywhere *- I assume it is easier to create an AI for this than for a free movement system, developers also claim that players disliked the possibility of random attacks by the AI opponents*\n\n- unsure if turn-based tactical space combat will happen, combat is to be \u0022quick\u0022 according to developers, *as of now space combat is real time, but can be paused and ships can be ordered freely to move or attack specific targets, some special abilities/equipment are seemingly manual and have a cooldown*\n\n*- planetary invasions are simulated and numerical in presentation only (no small soldiers running towards each other like in MOO2)*\n\n- ships can be designed as in MOO2, *two alternate models per ship class, equipment limited by available size, pretty much like MOO2, smaller ships seem to be way more viable than in MOO2, Doom Star class is limited to one ship of this size class per empire*\n\n- Space Pirates, bases produce raiders until destroyed\n\n- non-aligned worlds, similar to Civ5 city states *(not in yet)*\n\n- maximum number of turns *(1000)*\n\n- races in the game: Humans, Alkari, Sakkra, Psilons, Darlok, Klackons, Silicoid, Mrrshan, Meklars, Bulrathi *(called the original ten races of MOO - so MOO2 races are seemingly deemed non-original?)*  \n\nprobably not: Elerians, Gnolams, Trilarians  \n\nCollectors Edition: Terran Khanate\n\n- custom races are *still in development, so no info on MOO2\u0027s race perks, but differences as of now are quite minimal/limited to one trait*\n\n*- no leaders for colonies/ships as known from MOO2*\n\n*- no Transport Ship Poolpopulation can be shipped to other colonies by building a transport ship that takes 1 pop-unit and is disassambled upon unloadingfood is seemingly shared systemwide onlyproduction can be cumulated systemwide by building a system unique building on one planet in a system and setting production of the other planets to \u0022export\u0022*\n\n*- no annihilation of conquered population \\*cough\\**\n\n*- no cutscene for the Stellar Converter (yet?), but blowing up planets is still a thing, as is creating planets from gas giants or asteroid belts*\n\n*- Orion planet with guardian and salvaged techs upon defeating it*\n\n*- upgrading ships via credits in a single turn, not via planets production queue (automatic upgrading ship designs after new tech discoveries is weird and best done manually (for now))*\n\n*- space factories, ships that build outposts and military installations at the end of starlanes*\n\n*- morale system changed to population going on strike when low rather than offering a bonus when high*\n\n*- tax rate directly affects empirewide morale*\n\n*- pollution system changed, no production malus but accumulating pollution that will eventually lead to downgrading the planets biome class (some planets are uneffected, presumably toxic ones), has to be removed via a production project, creation can be reduced by certain buildings*\n\n*- almost every building from MOO2 is back, some have slightly different effects though*\n\n![11059776_1118452614833097_3570211803552239676_o.jpg](https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/t31.0-8/11059776_1118452614833097_3570211803552239676_o.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-07T09:41:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2016 09:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by KerbMav**\n  \nUpdated information"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T09:43:10Z","Content":"Shameless bump to get the topic back up as well as insight and opinions from others. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"11of10","CreatedById":90592,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T09:50:06Z","Content":"If I saw correctly, it has starlanes, so probably a dumb AI... dissapointed"},{"CreatedByName":"kookoo_gr","CreatedById":57720,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T16:18:50Z","Content":"from the videos i saw i made the conclusion it still is at an early alpha stage. for the price they are asking i\u0027ll wait for the full release after a big discount at steam.
