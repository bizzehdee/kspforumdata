However, I\u0027ve been thinking on how to use these mods effectively (other than the warp drives, they are pretty much strait forward). When dealing with electric engines (xenon, argon, thermal, et all), I often wondered why most of these engines have very low thrust\u00A0in a vacuum. I know that the authors of mods of this nature are often just emulating real world concepts and designs, but how would these technologies move big, interplanetary ships at a reasonable velocity, without having to add several engines to the mix and not to mention the power and fuel to run these things (and heat control). Where\u0027s the balance? The faster you want to go, the more you have to add to your ship. The more you add to your ship, the heavier it is. It\u0027s a never ending cycle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I haven\u0027t really done any research into these technologies on paper, so I may be out of my league to express\u00A0my confusion. But, is that the concept? A slow burn while using light fuel to achieve velocity goals? So you\u0027ll have to really plan for injections into other SOI\u0027s? I\u0027ve read The Martian and the engine in that was 5 mm per second (I think), but it wouldn\u0027t go that fast, it would build up speed. The times I have made a ship based on these technologies, the thrust appears to stay constant, instead of progressing in velocity. Or am I not seeing that aspect (if it\u0027s even implemented in game).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease forgive my ignorance if all these questions have been answered, don\u0027t stone me to death, I beg of you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hoojiwana","CreatedById":57079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-13T21:12:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222407550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455396805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291567\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ComatoseJedi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA slow burn while using light fuel to achieve velocity goals?

They measure burn time not in minutes or hours but in weeks or months or even years. Because those burn times are neither feasible nor fun in KSP, the stock ion and mod engines have hugely increased thrust. To give you some numbers, the stock ion has 2000 newtons of thrust whereas the NSTAR engines that propelled the stock ions namesake Dawn to Vista and Ceres have 0.092 newtons of thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just about amount of thrust. In KSP this means you may have to fly things a little differently since you don\u0027t have the TWR to do quick manuevers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-13T21:14:30Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2016 09:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by hoojiwana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T03:30:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222407550\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132042\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221455396805\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291567\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ComatoseJedi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, ComatoseJedi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe times I have made a ship based on these technologies, the thrust appears to stay constant, instead of progressing in velocity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo put some (more) numbers to what Hoojiwana said - That 2000m/s burn you do with a LV-T30 may take a couple minutes. With your 5mm/s acceleration its going to take a little over 100 hours. The acceleration of the Ion engine doesn\u0027t increase (ignoring the loss of mass from expended fuel) but it can keep piling on the velocity for a long, long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
