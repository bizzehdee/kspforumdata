Launch your satellites into a relatively low orbit. 1,500 km is a good approximation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make the satellite communication links, and make sure they work. A \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; B \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; C ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Get them into a somewhat rough shape of how you\u0027d want them to be in geosynchronous orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, you have a rough, approximate version of your final geosynchronous orbit. If you mess up, at least now you can rely on the window when the satellite passes over KSC to regain control of your satellite and make any needed adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get that set up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Pick one of your satellites by random, and try to adjust its orbit so that the apoapsis is at 2868 km (geosynchronous), slightly ahead of KSC. You\u0027ll have to do some trial/error/math with this to get it right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. At apoapsis, circularize. Don\u0027t worry about fine-tuning the orbit yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Repeat 4 and 5 for the other two satellites, or however many you have. But for them, put the apoapsis where you\u0027d want the satellite to be relative to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Go back to each satellite and make the final adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, this is MUCH simpler than trying to launch straight into a geosynchronous orbit. The main problem with doing this in one shot is that if you mess up, and your first satellite isn\u0027t somehow set up properly prior to losing connection, then it will never move relative to Kerbin\u0027s surface. So adjusting it becomes much, much, much more difficult. You also save a lot on fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T01:36:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow Pecan, I guess some people just have enough friends already, huh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I shoot for GSO I use a manned vehicle with a cargo bay to deploy my relay, but it would work just as well with a probe as long as you use an antenna that\u0027s safe to low orbit.

Then I start to circularise quite gently at first being careful to make sure that I keep my craft more-or-less straight above KSC, i.e. not too circular too soon as that will make me orbit faster than Kerbin turns below and I\u0027ll leave KSC behind.

Unless you have a very large case of OCD you will always have 1 of the sats drifting out of sync after a game month or so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally what I do is put one into geosync directly above the ground station then fill a lower orbit with antenna relays... for me these are the \u0022Build Orbital Station\u0022 contracts from Fine Print, a pair of empty hitchhiker cans, a probe core, a omni anteana, solar panels, and a docking port. Set them as Debris so I don\u0027t see them again.

Then set up burns to increase the apo everytime the KSC has a communication range until you get it out to geosync. Might cost you extra Dv if you don\u0027t want to wait for direct alignments but as long as you stay out of the atmo your good.
