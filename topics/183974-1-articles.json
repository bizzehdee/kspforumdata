Some provide simple real-time telemetry and even log it to CSV files, so you can later analyze their performance. I also tried to document the code with comments, so you can see what\u0027s what. Most of the scripts can be used separately from one another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll keep improving them as I play, so check for updates.
