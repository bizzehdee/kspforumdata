Both are lifters to get a load from the surface of kerbal to somewhere like Duna. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth have a 16 ton load on top before test launching. The first is a multi-stage asparagus rocket. The second is a simpler, lighter three-stage rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first has, according to MJ, a delta V of 12,516 and the second has a delta V of 13,046.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust looking at it it feels like the first will get farther because of all the extra fuel it is hauling. And, sure enough, it does. It gets to Duna with a load of fuel to spare. It could probably make it back to Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second though, despite it higher initial delta V, I can\u0027t even manage to get into circular orbit around Duna before its out of fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is obviously more to this than just the delta V numbers.

Quite easy to point the case when you know the vacuum Delta-V, but the true Delta-V you have is curtailed by the vessel flying in atmosphere. A slow ascent, then requiring longer to leave the atmospehre, would certainly impact on Delta-V more than a fast one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, a slow ascent also means more gravity losses. So, if the ascent stages have a lower TWR, your craft is going to lose more of its initial Delta-V than if those stages have higher TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHigh TWR (or, better, acceleration) is also required to properly perform some orbital maneuvers. Like ejection or injection burns. Some engines have very high ISP but conversely very low thrust, and they take a long time to provide the Delta-V required in those burns. But to be effective, such burns are to be performed close to periapsis, in a limited amount of time. If it takes too long, some of the energy gain from burning at periapsis (read: Oberth effect) are lost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T16:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHard to know: how much dV do you have left on both crafts once they reach Kerbin orbit?

If your thrust is too low, you can lose a bunch to gravity during your ascent from Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith 12-13 km/s though, you can almost go back and forth between Duna and Kerbin four times.

You must have a good TWR at liftoff.. no amount of delta-V will compensate for that. Most posters here aim for at least a TWR of 2.0 at liftoff from Kerbin. This gives you good acceleration out of the gate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T17:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother factor to consider is how the engine Isp changes with atmosphere. All engines lose efficiency in atmosphere, but some are worse than others.

Inefficient ascents can cost you a fair bit of delta-V.

I sometimes use a small trick, don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth it though : when i need a long burn (more than 10min) because of low TWR, i split this burn in 2 or 3 maneuvers, first time, i activate engines 2 or 3 minutes before the node, and stop at the same amount of time after, then i wait a complete revolution around the planet, and i do another burn to complete the maneuver, 2 maneuvers next to the periapsis seem to save extra energy loss than 1 long. However, be careful about not reaching moons SOI between your 1st and second burn. As i don\u0027t understand completely the Oberth effect on the paper, i am not sure this is efficient, but it seems so from my own experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-27T19:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the info, guys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to make both journeys as similar as I could.

Less, and you\u0027ll probably never reach terminal velocity so will lose some dV to gravity. More, and you\u0027ll hit terminal velocity and either lose some to excessive air drag, or have to throttle down which means you\u0027re carrying a heavy engine that you\u0027re not using to its fullest and pay the fuel price for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in space, TWR doesn\u0027t mean as much.
