Yes, you can pack more radiation protection on a cycler... if you needed radiation protection, that is. You won\u0027t have enough to make a significant dent in cosmic rays, and solar storms can be shielded against with surprisingly little effort (I.E: supplies and fuel tanks between you and the sun).
