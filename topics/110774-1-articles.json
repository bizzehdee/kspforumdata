Probe Cores:\n\nIf you attach an inline probe core to the floor node of the service bay, or on top of something else inert (SAS, inline battery, etc.) that is itself on the floor node of the bay, no problem. However, if you hang the probe core from the ceiling node in the service bay, you get horrible shakes as soon as you launch.\n\n2. Clipping Through Floor/Ceiling of Service Bays:\n\nNot really a problem for \u0022inert\u0022 (non-animated) parts. For instance, I routinely hang the large radial RCS tanks from the ceiling and their feet clip through into whatever part is stacked above the bay. The only time this causes a problem is if that other part is a docking port, which of course usually don\u0027t work with anything clipping into them. However, it\u0027s a different story with animated parts, IF the moving components themselves clip the flor or ceiling of the service bay. If they don\u0027t, then no problem.\n\n3. Service Bay Door Collisions\n\nThis is when the swinging doors impact some other part of the rocket. There are actually 2 ways this can cause problems:\n\nA. In the VAB/SPH\n\nWhile the doors move harmlessly through other rocket parts in the editors, the EFFECT of them having passed through the other parts remains when you later go to fly the rocket. This results in the whole rocket vibrating badly. This situation usually arises when you belatedly remember you need to assign action groups to parts in the service bay and you\u0027ve already built more rocket around the bay in the way of the doors (you don\u0027t plan on opening the bay in flight). So the lesson here is, if you\u0027re loading up a bay you don\u0027t plan on opening in flight, be sure you do everything necessary to the parts inside before closing the bay the last time and then building stuff around it.\n\nB. In Flight\n\nBay doors that impact other rocket parts will opening in flight don\u0027t usually result in vibrations, Instead, they work like bulldozers, pushing hard on the surrounding parts. Depending on joint strength, the other parts will either bend out of the way and snap back no problem, or will break off. As with all animations in KSP, the moving doors are an irresistible force so will never be stopped by anything in their path."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:46:16Z","Content":"I\u0027ve found that in my latest spaceplane, which ended up needing a service bay, it shakes when first loaded but stops as soon as the bay moves, either opening or closing, and remains stable after the animation finishes. My guess is the source of the problem is related to the animation and the colliders turning on/off improperly."},{"CreatedByName":"pvtnum11","CreatedById":58904,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:48:53Z","Content":"For fun, trap a Kerbal inside a bay while on EVA.
