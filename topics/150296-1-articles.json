My assumption was that, due to the thicker atmosphere, planes at lower altitude would experience more drag and atmospheric heating. However, I didn\u0027t notice as much difference between the performance at low and high altitude as I expected\u00A0(high altitude heating was if anything higher than at low altitude\u00A0and drag only seemed to be noticeably higher at low altitude\u00A0with a fairly flat nose). The heating difference\u00A0might be due to residual heat from lower altitude flight\u00A0though and I might just not have gone fast enough to encounter higher drag with the pointy version at low altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this normal and I\u0027m just an idiot, or is this a bug, or something else?

I don\u0027t know the exact formulas, but this is the main reason why reentry trajectories that are too flat kill you just as surely as reentry trajectories that are too steep (or would, if stock KSP didn\u0027t have such big margins built-in). Really high up in the atmosphere, you still have medium heating, but pretty much no drag at all. As you go lower, heating only increases moderately, while drag really spikes up. So you want to get through the upper reaches fast, then stabilize in the medium layers of the atmosphere for an ideal reentry. Otherwise, your craft will just soak heat without slowing down much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, there\u0027s convective cooling.
