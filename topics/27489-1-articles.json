So I got Mechjeb to do it for me. Does it more exact, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I had Mechjeb 1.9 or 19 or what it was. Wanted to try 2.0, because docking gets tedious... Did it many times, so why not let the metalbrain do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a tiny mission to the Mun.

My last landing went seriously haywire... Went smooth up to like 100m from the Mun surface... Then I don\u0027t know what happened but the damn craft just started spinning like a drunken fly... I think MechJeb\u0027s having a hard time landing things in pin-point proximity (real- less than 1000m)... Dunno why... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest automating the deorbit and correction burns and just doing the breaking burn yourself...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T00:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the weird things about Mechjeb 2 (or it\u0027s been weird since I\u0027ve been using it), is that if you just type in coordinates into the Landing Autopilot, it will generally fail to land, either by not completing its burns, or by failing to bring itself down properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you click on the \u0022Select Landing Target From the Map Screen\u0022 button, and click anywhere on the planet you want to land on to set a target landing zone, and /then/ type in the coordinates, it generally works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tokay Gris","CreatedById":58301,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T00:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHm... ok, I will try that...
