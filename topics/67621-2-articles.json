They get a kick out of the \u0022mission accomplished!\u0022 part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the solution to that is: have both, in the end. Have parts obsoleting other parts and have parts that reward you by opening up more avenues (3.75m parts, the choice of ISP vs. TWR vs. time trade offs, manned vs. unmanned etc.). But to do that, KSP needs a better UI - one that allows you to filter parts in sensible manner and replaces \u0022obsolete\u0022 parts (much like in Civ where an upgraded unit completely replaces the previous one).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T19:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think they are great, but then again I like to make pigs fly! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Franklin","CreatedById":89718,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T19:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maccollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maccollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGraph made by stupid_chris\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m3aqgU2.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/m3aqgU2.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new engines could be balanced by a disproportionate increase in both thrust and mass, where the mass increase more than the thrust.

A craftsman works in a closed system, where all materials, tools, and techniques are already known, and all of them have their uses. He/she strives to learn the materials, tools, and techniques as well as possible, and uses them to build products that are as good as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engineer, on the other hand, works in an open system that is constantly changing. New materials, tools, and techniques are introduced all the time, while old ones become obsolete. The job of the engineer is to create order from chaos: he/she uses a principled approach to make sense of the new situation, and builds products that are good enough for their purposes or better than the existing ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, craftsmanship is about perfection, while engineering is about progress. You can make a good game based on either of the approaches, but if we have a game about rocketry and space exploration, progress seems to make more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing able to filter the parts based on tech level or some similar criteria is a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T23:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe poll is still a bit too polarised to represent my opinion, so here goes the long answer:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should be no hard and fast rule for Squad to follow.
