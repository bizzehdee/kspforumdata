As a social/behavioral scientist I am in fact quite sympathetic to the perspective from which the question arises. However, I think that ultimately the question is fallacious as it poses a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Either-or_fallacy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0022False Dilemma.\u0022\u003C/a\u003E The question itself is nonetheless interesting philosophically in that it reflects on the shortcomings of humanism or the \u0027incomplete\u0027 status of human \u0027ascendance\u0027 for lack of a better term.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost all the problems you describe are 99.99% preventable. Take for example, death by rabies. This terrible disease (and terrible way to die) takes the lives of (IIRC) several tens-of-thousands of humans every year, most of whom are residents of less-advantaged nations, and moreover remote area dwelers where proper health care infrastructure is lacking. A simple post-exposure treatment after an exposure (animal bite or whatever) is in 99.99% of cases sufficient to \u0027cure\u0027 rabies before the irreversible onset of the fatal symptoms. It is simply the lack of availability or knowledge of the fairly inexpensive and easy to administer post-exposure treatment that is the ultimate cause of these peoples deaths every year. In theory, if a couple billion were spent to setup proper health care / communications infrastructure to under-served regions of the planet, these deaths (and a lot of other preventable deaths too) could be avoided. However, this theory is quite faulty in that it assumes that all that is needed is to spend the money and *poof* a perfect solution is then permanently in place. In fact, health care even in the most advantaged nations is exceedingly problematic and plenty of people still \u0027slip through the cracks\u0027 even when the systems put in place are impeccable. Not to mention the operating and upkeep costs. Not to mention the vulnerability of such systems to corruption, etc., etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, if you wanted to save those people from dying of rabies, you\u0027d probably need to \u0027take over\u0027 all those nations where those deaths occur at a high rate and manage them yourself so that you could avoid these issues: yeah right! We all know that, even in the most \u0027advanced\u0027 nations, corruption, in-fighting, partisanism, etc. make \u0027solving\u0027 these kinds of complex problems seemingly impossible. Not to mention that many of these issues that we could label as \u0027Failures to Advance Toward Utopia\u0022 are in large part reflections of nothing more than arbitrary cultural values and not even a result of malfeasance per se.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, North American automobile fatalities. Working just from memory here, but . . . they peaked at about 80,000 per annum back in the late 1980s prior to the advent of seat-belt laws and Federal imposition of a speed limit system. I\u0027m sure that changes in vehicle design played part too. Over the past ~30 years this rate of death (and morbidity too) has dropped pretty steadily, but with some very clear plummets immediately following imposition of various regulations (such as the seat belt laws). In recent years, this rate of mortality has hovered in the 50K ballpark, and if memory serves it took another major drop a year or two ago, down to less than 40k. There are obviously many things that go into this drop in preventable traffic fatalities, but what I\u0027m really getting at with this example is as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Most people don\u0027t really care about automobile fatality rates even though they are in fact one of the most salient risks to which we are all exposed to varying degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The ~59,000 sum total of U.S. military service personnel who were killed in action during the total duration of U.S. involvement in the \u0022Vietnam Conflict\u0022 has probably received 10,000 times as much social commentary as the millions of automobile deaths in the U.S. alone. I figure an average of 60k over the course of 50 years? what is that ~3 million killed in the \u0022North American Automobile War?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Despite problems like automobile fatalities being largely unacknowledged, the change in rates demonstrate that the problem is largely preventable. If a few policy changes and enforcement practices can snowball societal changes leading to reductions of ~50% over the course of ~30 years, then it would seem logical to conclude that: with the right policy changes and enforcement it should be possible to reduce automobile fatalities down to the absolute minimum, reflecting _ONLY_ that rate of deaths which is completely unpreventable (random mechanical failures, freak weather events, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this to say: putting a man on the moon is easy relative to actually creating \u0022Utopia.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoreover, it is not really a matter of either (a) putting a man on the moon, or (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E creating Utopia.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I hope my ramblings above show, creating Utopia is exceedingly complicated and cutting space programs would be unlikely to drive advances toward Utopia any more than promoting space programs deters such advances. In fact, because things like the International Space Station necessitate more and better international cooperation, one could argue that, in general space programs contribute indirectly to the sorts of cultural and social changes that ultimately make advance toward utopia _more_ likely. Thus, as I said above, I believe this question is a false dilemma. It is not a matter of EITHER we advance space exploration OR we advance utopia.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T16:06:21Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Diche Bach\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T19:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExploration leads to innovation.
