I can\u0027t remember if the devs ever talked about a museum but I know players were really into the idea at one point. Then it just kinda faded from memory. I don\u0027t remember most of the old discussion of the topic, but the general idea was that you\u0027d be able to manually save scale models of successful ships, rovers or landers as well as things like samples or pictures for exhibits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea that I always liked was the encyclopedia idea. This was simply to showcase your progress in the solar system. The science menu kind of functions like this but in a far less quaint sort of way. The idea here was that whenever you started a new game, you\u0027d have an encyclopedia. This encyclopedia would be mostly empty, with some detailed surface pictures of kerbin and some grainy pictures of the mun...and maybe minmus with quirky little text entries for each. Then, when you build(or first use, if KSC construction/investment doesn\u0027t become a thing) your observatory, you\u0027d get slightly more detailed pictures of these bodies as well as grainy first-look images of more distant planets. From there, you\u0027d have to send out probes, orbital telescopes and even kerbonauts themselves to these celestial bodies to fill out the encyclopedia\u0027s pages with progressively more detailed images and paragraphs of information.
