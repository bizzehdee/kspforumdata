The first Proton rocket was launched in 1965. Modern versions of the launch system are still in use as of 2015, making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight. During it long years of service, it launched many payloads, some of which were quite famous, such as the Salyut stations and the TKS. Nowadays it mostly lanuches heavy satellites, using The Briz M upper stage, to propel the payload to higher orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Salyut programme was the first space station programme undertaken by the Soviet Union, which consisted of a series of four crewed scientific research space stations (DOS modules, or true Salyuts) and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations (OPS modules, aka Almaz). Salyut 1 and 4 were first generation stations, having only one docking port. Salyut 2, 3 and 5 were actually military Almaz stations, launched under the civilan Salyut name. Salyut 6 and 7 were second generation space stations, which had 2 docking ports, and were the transition from monolithic to mulit-modular stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe TKS spacecraft was a Soviet era spacecraft, designed for resupply flights to the military Almaz space station. It consisted of two spacecraft mated together, both of which could operate independently: The VA crew capsule, and the FGB (a station module-like vessel). Only 4 unmanned flights took place, the first was a solo test flight, while TKS-2 and TKS-3 docked with Salyut 6 and Salyut 7, respectively. The last flight was Kosmos 1686 (TKS-4), which had a modified VA craft. Much of the crew facilities (seats, parachute and deorbit motor) had been replaced with scientific equipement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TABLE=width: 1000, align: center]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]\u003Cstrong\u003EProton K\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count: 142\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Payload capacityto LKO: 22,0t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TD]\u003Cstrong\u003EProton M\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count: 212\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Payload capacityto GTO: 15,0t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Payload capacityto GSO: 12,0t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TD]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TR]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/TABLE]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[table=width: 1000, align: center]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ESalyut 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 190\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 44\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ESalyut 4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 185\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 39\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ESalyut 6/7\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 174\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 28\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EAlmaz\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 185\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 39\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003ETKS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 205\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 57\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E [td]\u003Cstrong\u003EKosmos 1686\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on launch: 199\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Part count on orbit: 53\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/td]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/tr]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[/table]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen launching, you\u0027ll have to throttle the first stage down during flight, or press 1 at approximately 15km.

Each Atlas V booster configuration has a three-digit designation that indicates the features of that configuration. The first digit shows the diameter (in meters) of the payload fairing, and always has a value of \u00224\u0022 or \u00225\u0022. The second digit indicates the number of solid rocket boosters attached to the base of the rocket, and can range from \u00220\u0022 through \u00223\u0022 with the 4-meter fairing, and \u00220\u0022 through \u00225\u0022 with the 5-meter fairing.

Once docked to a station, it could fill up entirely to greatly enhance it\u0027s range (up to 1845m/s dV). It is launched using an Atlas V 402, meaning that there are 2 engines on the Centaur second stage. Before launching, clip the camera into the orbiter\u0027s nose, and select control from the probe core, in order to fly with a properly oriented navball. After liftoff, roll to the desired launch inclination, and follow a standard ascent profile. Press 1 at about 20km, and 2 at approximately 40km, in order to throttle the first stage down (this can also be done manually). Once in orbit, detach the second stage and deorbit it. If you choose to, you can pump some fuel from the spent stage to the orbiter, but leave some vapours in for the de-orbit burn. Don\u0027t forget to activate the fuel cell, which is hidden in the nose as well.
