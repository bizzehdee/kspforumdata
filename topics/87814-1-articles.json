The nozzle just improves the direction of the thrust. Using the nozzle as a combustion chamber like an afterburner does is extremely inefficient, which is why it\u0027s only used in military craft that need that kind of power on demand.. While one could theoretically place the afterburner in a secondary combustion chamber, the backfeed would make the primary combustion chamber produce little to no thrust when the afterburner is off.
