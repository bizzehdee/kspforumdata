I have my monitor at 75fps, and I can usually play at that rate with godrays off. The setting was used during the time of day on Kerbin, maybe 1 hour after sunrise. My CPU usage stayed pretty stagnant at around 30-40%, although my 9100f has 4 cores and it doesn\u0027t tell me it doesn\u0027t have enough. CPU utilization doesn\u0027t tell me that.\n\nIve played Simple Planes before, and with 5 AI planes, the fps will suddenly go from 75 way down to the 20s, although CPU usage stayed the same. My cpu has 4 cores with no hyperhreading (Damn you Intel), so its bad mulit-core performance does affect me largely.

That\u0027s just it, the GPU is doing a bit more work. I\u0027m not seeing exactly why you are reporting this? Anyway, I always say that if you\u0027re not hitting 100% GPU usage you overpaid.\n\nCPU wise it\u0027s true that\u0027s only 30% but that\u0027s actually close to topping out because KSP doesn\u0027t use more than 2 cores, and that\u0027s on Directx11.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-15T13:59:08Z\u0022 title=\u002201/15/2021 01:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"BlackEyedPhantom","CreatedById":203318,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-15T15:56:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Spaceman.Spiff said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you look a few posts above you\u0027ll see the gargantuan post about blackrack\u0027s progress on scatterer.

I have tinkered a ton with the detail settings in the Parallax mod but haven\u0027t touched any in Scatterer.   I did look at the Scatterer settings for Eve, and noticed it does have a fair amount of settings in the atmos config file and that\u0027s how I ended up wondering about them.   \n\nIt\u0027s not a huge deal though really.  I tend to avoid Eve anyways. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)  And anyone using anything better than my old potatoey GTX960 is going to be fine.
