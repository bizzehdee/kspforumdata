So the biome will only be accurate to within twenty kilometers...you\u0027re going to have to get pretty far out into the ocean for the science system to notice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn engines: TF: Engines have different roles. You can\u0027t expect to safely air-light (i.e. as a second stage) an X-405 or LR-79 engine, and you can\u0027t expect to light an AJ10 when there\u0027s high dynamic pressure (aka going fast in the atmosphere--wait until the air thins out more). That\u0027s taken into account by TestFlight. It\u0027s also highly recommended that you do some ground tests of your engines before flying them on rockets; that will build up flight experience and make them more reliable. Finally, engines have rated burn times; they are much more likely to fail the longer past the rated burn time you try to run them. EI: Liquid Engines require propellants to be settled (i.e. at the bottom of their tanks) for them to function. This isn\u0027t a problem on the ground, because gravity handles it, but in freefall liquid propellants will \u0027float up\u0027 in the tanks, leading to the feed lines having vacuum or pressurant in them. Thus you need to settle the propellants yourself before ignition (by thrusting \u0027forward\u0027 using solid ullage motors or RCS) or ignite the engine before the propellants have a chance to unsettle, i.e. before the prior stage burns out (hot-staging).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the altitude contract: As of v0.26, you can complete that contract in the starting node--we support flight as an alternative path now! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Echrisl: sounds like an issue for the DRE thread, but make sure you\u0027re using the absolutely latest RO and FASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobotsAndSpaceships: they were moved to Realism Overhaul.

Along with my problem report, I asked about a set of DRE configs for FASA parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, this issue was also caused by RO. After much sifting of my output_log.txt file, I found that the FASAApollo_CM_HeatShield part was created in FASA (obviously) and altered by only three mods: RO, RP0 and Better Buoyancy. By default, FASA set maxTemp=3600 for this part. However, RO makes a couple changes. In one change (RO_FASA_ApolloCSM.cfg), it adds the \u0022ModuleHeatShield\u0022 and does not alter maxTemp. But in another change (RealismOverhaul_Global_Config.cfg) all parts that don\u0027t have either ModuleEngines or ModuleHeatShield get their maxTemp set down to 800. And apparently RealismOverhaul_Global_Config is being applied before RO_FASA_ApolloCSM. The end result is that FASAApollo_CM_HeatShield is having it\u0027s maxTemp lowered and then having the ModuleHeatShield module added. It might be a good idea to have RO_FASA_ApolloCSM update the maxTemp at the same time it\u0027s adding the ModuleHeatShield to the part just to make sure an appropriate maxTemp is being setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T19:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that\u0027s weird, it should be updating the maxTemp to be 2000.

From what I can find, the Titan IIIE should be able to put 15.4t into LEO or 3.7t into Trans-Mars Insertion, so putting a tiny .24t into GEO should be well within it\u0027s capabilities. And when I was creating the UA-1205 using procedural SRB (which means basically 100% thrust for entire burn), that was completely doable. But with the UA-1205 with \u0022proper\u0022 thrust curve, I\u0027m about 800dV short of reaching GEO.
