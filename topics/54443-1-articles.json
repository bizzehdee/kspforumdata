My next challenge for my space program is to get to Laythe, and eventually put a small base there. However, for the time being, I simply need to land three crewmembers there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need some designs/pictures for a three man lander. Nothing minimalist. I\u0027m not planning on landing on the water, so it needs to be something with enough fuel should I end up far away from my landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virindi","CreatedById":84021,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T02:39:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have personally found that the most effective way to land on Laythe is with an aircraft. This is mainly because it is hard to avoid the water with such small landmasses, and much of the land that you do have is mountainous, so your landing target has to be relatively precise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny SSTO that can make orbit around Kerbin can likely make orbit around Laythe, and there\u0027s no reason you have to even use one that works on Kerbin. Just make sure you have a large amount of wing area for the weight so you can get your landing speed really low. If Kerbin is a problem, launch it from there on top of a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jasmir","CreatedById":76744,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T10:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33312-Showcase-SSTO-s%21-Post-your-pictures-here?p=782446\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post782446\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/33312-Showcase-SSTO-s%21-Post-your-pictures-here?p=782446\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post782446\u003C/a\u003E) are two SSTOs that can land \u0026amp; take of from Laythe. One is a plane (Crewcapacity: 1) and the other is a normal Rocket (Crewcapacity: 2). The plane is way better to do presision-landings _and_ have a Rover-Mode to drive around using only electric charges. The Rocket lands on Chutes, so it\u0027s hard to aim for a small landing-spot with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T10:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/685965905526670633/1BE849A8085AB3218EBF57A238187D68A4808CCC/\u0022 alt=\u00221BE849A8085AB3218EBF57A238187D68A4808CCC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/685965905526666883/39DB8E5461B591ECB6B5F1617CC365F43E1EBFCE/\u0022 alt=\u002239DB8E5461B591ECB6B5F1617CC365F43E1EBFCE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/685965905553471762/E93D3C79F761F70FBCE24F3B0150E7278CC60EF7/\u0022 alt=\u0022E93D3C79F761F70FBCE24F3B0150E7278CC60EF7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/685965905556486401/8596C357C5D9D21DA679096C2E4CE00320BE6DAD/\u0022 alt=\u00228596C357C5D9D21DA679096C2E4CE00320BE6DAD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest advice is to accept a long interplanetary burn from those efficient but weak ass nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T13:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis one also made it to Laythe easy enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/884115325877837712/D841C833C4676541F54CFB1673F8708F4FEC14BE/\u0022 alt=\u0022D841C833C4676541F54CFB1673F8708F4FEC14BE\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/884117328045727787/0B52552C4A9D187AD58806256B84CD304358FD3D/\u0022 alt=\u00220B52552C4A9D187AD58806256B84CD304358FD3D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough looking back at that old craft, I see many things that could be improved upon.
