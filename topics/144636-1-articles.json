The node_attach point for the tail connectors is on the wrong side but it would be easy to edit the part configuration to produce a part that attaches on its sloping side. (I don\u0027t want to just rotate it inwards because then the stack attach end won\u0027t face directly forwards).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do intend to put something relatively pointy on the clipped end - probably a (possibly scaled up) shielded docking port. (The aim of this exercise is to fit a cockpit with good look-down visibility under the nose of a large craft, while having a docking port more or less on the main axis through the CoG of the vessel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T13:09:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up using the Mk2 Extension\u0027s radial mount pieces. If the cone is comprised of two large adapters with a short flat-sided piece (like a reaction wheel or tank) in between them, it works quite well. The Mk2 pieces hanging off the side can be given a long tail piece to merge nicely back into the cone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
