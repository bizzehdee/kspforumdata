Have a thermometer and a communotron 16.\n\n1. Log temperature\n\n2. Transmit\n\n3. Log temperature\n\n4. While the antena is retracting from the first transmission (2.), transmit the second record (3.).\n\nThe first temperature is then transmited but the second vanishes. So anything you transmit while antenas are retracting vanishes most probably.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T12:56:53Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Beduino**"},{"CreatedByName":"ebookah","CreatedById":104280,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:51:14Z","Content":"This has been happening to me also but, my game is modded.
