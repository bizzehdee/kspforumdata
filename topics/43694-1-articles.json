Really? I\u0027ve been keeping an eye on the drag coefficient and drag speed losses calculated by MechJeb with gear out and without to make sure of exactly that. I have not noticed any difference whatsoever. Does MechJeb get it wrong, or do the gears really change drag when open and closed? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s also this issue of drag in KSP being dependent on mass. Gears have mass while in VAB, but actually do not count towards ship\u0027s mass when in flight. Can they affect drag at all this way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T07:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMihara is right. I too have never noticed any negative effect, or positive for that matter, of \u0027forgetting\u0027 to raise my landing gear. Forgetting the B9 or FireSpitter airbrakes will seriously affect your flight but that\u0027s exactly what they are designed for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the B9 and Firespitter airbrakes have variable drag. The further the flap is opened the higher the drag value. (Place them \u003Cstrong\u003Ebehind\u003C/strong\u003E your CoG or you \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill\u003C/strong\u003E flip your plane!)

I already have about 6 other very well strung together combo parts, I was just needing some kind of velocity stabilizer for the VTOLs for the project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, using InfiniteDice\u0027s or Firespitter\u0027s airbrake code/parts helps a lot combating drift for VTOL landings, as most of your \u0022drift\u0022 is solely in the forward direction. Dampening or zeroing this gives you a lot more precision. Unfortunately, this is outside the scope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir-fueled RCS blocks work fairly well, and give you good taxi power to boot, but still no dampening effect. If you want fine control, you need to use the translation keys in addition to piloting the jet with the normal keys. Still, I just did a 10-X bullseye precision landing on the VAB roof.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T14:36:40Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
