I like the idea of getting science in specific areas depending on how you gathered it and the environment you gathered it from. Perhaps we could take this one step further and give contracts to test an experimental part that would reward science in a branch or even open up a new branch of science. For example, testing an experimental rover wheel to unlock a branch of science in rover wheels, or testing a wing on Eve to get science in aerodynamics, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mart!an","CreatedById":122431,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-17T20:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat suggestion, contracts being directly linked to the tech tree is really interesting and would definitely allow you to shape your space program more than in stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps even a non linear tech tree design?

A probe core might require that you visit a world outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, and send back science to get them. Instruments might be required to be landed on the Mun to be able to later buy them.
