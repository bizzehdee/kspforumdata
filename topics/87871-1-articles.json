Stock-Vanilla KSP one day, then RSS KSP the next? Do you want multiple Kebal-system each with their own physics? Kerbin-172 with Stock aerodynamics; Kerbin-7318 with FAR and DR? Does this sound like a set of parallel dimensions or a multi-verse to you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all applies to me, so I\u0027m in the process of developing a VB launcher script that will allow me swap between different mod-sets, and thought people here might be interested as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin a Multiverse folder, I have a folder for each individual mod-set containing the GameData and Saves folders for that set, as well as a shortcut to the Multiverse launcher script. When invoked, the launcher script replaces GameData and Saves in the main KSP game-folder with junctions pointing to those GameData \u0026amp; Saves folders and then launches KSP. (A similar thing could be done under Linux and OSX, but would need different launcher scripts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould anyone else be interested in this? I\u0027ve about got this ready for my own use, but would want some input/advice to prepare this for use by others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T23:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be intrested in this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever that I think this is considered a tool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is not a external application, you need a licence\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebest is BY-CC-NC-SA v3.0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"philotical","CreatedById":109390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T16:59:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to use that.. - but I would like to add some feature requests too..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas a mod dev, it\u0027s annoying to play without any parts just to make loading faster..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I could just activate one or two part packs for one or two test sessions and then dissable them again without having to move/change my dev folders, that would be great..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I have a gamedata-backup folder where I store all unwanted mods to get them out of the loading process..
