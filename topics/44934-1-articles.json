When enough people decide \u0022Ah, why not, this could be fun to play\u0022 and chip in for those $125 dollar ships, it adds up to being enough to actually develop the game.

If you want, you can wait until the game launches, buy the game for $60, then play and get absolutely everything any of the backers have got, and never invest another cent into the game. Chris made it really really clear that he didn\u0027t want pay-to-win; everything that can be bought with real life money can be earned in game. The only reason ships cost money now is so that the game can get made. Chris said awhile back that the RSI Constellation, which is a medium-sized 4-player merchant ship with turrets and missiles and a snub fighter, which costs $225 right now, can be earned with roughly 60 hours of gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T15:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SuperWeegee4000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SuperWeegee4000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt looks awesome, but... do they really expect you to shell out $125 for a virtual spaceship?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$125 seems a bit much but maybe that\u0027ll go down.
