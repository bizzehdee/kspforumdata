I am Mrs Stella Kwale, a Banker here in GHANA. I believe it is the wish of God for me to come across you now.

Sadly Dr Dean was among the death victims in the May 26 2006 Earthquake disaster in Jawa, Indonesia that killed over 5,000 people. He was in Indonesia on a business trip and that was how he met his end. My bank management is yet to know about his death, I knew about it because he was my friend and I am his account officer. Dr Dean did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, and he Dr Dean was not married and no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that I should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract. I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means to handle the situation, because if my Bank Directors happens to know that Dr Dean is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the funds for their personal use, so I don\u0027t want such to happen. That was why when I saw your last name I was happy and I am now seeking your co-operation to present you as Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you have the same last name with him and my bank head quarters will release the account to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I from any breach of law.
