This makes dV a lot more precious, since it takes so much more fuel to achieve the same amount as in stock. I\u0027m also not the world\u0027s best pilot, so I would like to give myself as much margin for error as I can. I\u0027ve got a nice little Apollo style ship, with seperate reentry, service, and lander modules. The lander is also a two stager, just to give me that little bit extra to get back to orbit and to rendezvous more easily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, my fuel margins are all really tight, so I\u0027m trying to shave off as much as possible on the transit by using the Mun. However, I\u0027m now doubtful if this is actually going to save me anything, or even cost a bit more. This is because my trajectory seems to change a lot in a pretty unpredictable manner when I cross SOI boundaries, even when I make sure to do this at 1x. I end up using almost as much dV to correct for these errors as I would save from the gravity assist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo is it worth it at all to go for a gravity assist? Also, if anyone has any tips/suggestions as far as getting the most accurate trajectory which includes multiple SOI changes? Hell, I\u0027d also appreciate any general advice on how best to pull this mission off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T16:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eunless you are playing RSS, going interplanetary and have a lot of time to dedicate to the calculations required, or the mission at hand, it\u0027s not worth it. The dV savings, while significant, require such a long mission time that it\u0027s not worth the savings for most people, and it\u0027s certainly not worth it if playing stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-10T16:06:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would definitely say when going to Minmus, a Munar gravity assist is not worth it. The difficulty in getting it lined up in such a way that it actually saves you dV outweighs any fuel savings you will find. I imagine you could save a little but I think it would probably be a matter of quicksaving and quickloading a lot of times to get it just right, and that spoils the fun in my opinion. I would look elsewhere for dV savings. Are you launching from Kerbin at the right time to minimize inclination corrections? Do you end up having lots of monopropellant left over? If I go very slowly, I can easily dock a small lander without any mono, just rotating and using the main engines to correct the trajectory, with the throttle limiter set around 10%. That will allow you to remove any mono tanks and empty it out of your crew modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
