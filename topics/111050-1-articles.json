I hated it to the point of severe anger and depression. Plus, I had a horrifying traumatic experience in the form of a nightmare. *I will not* describe it and don\u0027t ask me to. This on top of my severe depression really affected me both physically and emotionally. I was barely eating anything for the longest time and I felt like my life wasn\u0027t going anywhere and that nothing I did mattered. I, like many other victims of drpression even considered suicide. I didn\u0027t have any escape routes besides my computer, but even that wasn\u0027t solving the problem. I know a lot of people struggle with depression in the way I did. Up until I got the hell out of 8th grade, I was so damn miserable to the point of it being way too unhealthy for me. The point is my life sucked until summer came around. Finally when I discovered KSP and how fun it could be, I was so very happy. I just wanted to say thanks to the community for letting me channel my emotions into long ass paragraphs like this. I figured out the problem was I had too much time to think. I used to be really quiet in school but since I\u0027ve been able to express my thoughts like this, my life has made a full 180. So if you\u0027re struggling with depression like I did, just bottle your emotions up and pour it all over the internet. (Not literally) At least this technique works for me. Anyway, I wanted the community and maybe even SQUAD to know that the video game community can change lives in ways that no one would ever be able to imagine.

No one said teachers were morons. I actually said they are under-paid which implies the opposite. As to flouting education.

It\u0027s great that you\u0027ve found something that helps, and there really is a great community around this game. Talking really is the best thing. Though while it\u0027s a wonderful and supportive community, I would really suggest talking to someone close to you about your problems too. Sorry if you consider that intrusive.\n\nBut as to the sentiment that bought me here, I wanted to say thank you too, to any and all reading this.
