I hated it to the point of severe anger and depression. Plus, I had a horrifying traumatic experience in the form of a nightmare. \u003Cem\u003EI will not\u003C/em\u003E describe it and don\u0027t ask me to. This on top of my severe depression really affected me both physically and emotionally. I was barely eating anything for the longest time and I felt like my life wasn\u0027t going anywhere and that nothing I did mattered. I, like many other victims of drpression even considered suicide. I didn\u0027t have any escape routes besides my computer, but even that wasn\u0027t solving the problem. I know a lot of people struggle with depression in the way I did. Up until I got the hell out of 8th grade, I was so damn miserable to the point of it being way too unhealthy for me. The point is my life sucked until summer came around. Finally when I discovered KSP and how fun it could be, I was so very happy. I just wanted to say thanks to the community for letting me channel my emotions into long ass paragraphs like this. I figured out the problem was I had too much time to think. I used to be really quiet in school but since I\u0027ve been able to express my thoughts like this, my life has made a full 180. So if you\u0027re struggling with depression like I did, just bottle your emotions up and pour it all over the internet. (Not literally) At least this technique works for me. Anyway, I wanted the community and maybe even SQUAD to know that the video game community can change lives in ways that no one would ever be able to imagine.
