Is it possible to make the missiles or guns editable in part cfgs? I bet many people would just love to make their own weapons using modules just like stock parts. I knwo it would be hard, but for example missiles could have: durability, accurcay, autoTrackDelay, warheadTypes, HEBlast, HEPen (Same for other ammo), maxRange, maxSpeed, thrust, mass, burnTime, flare (True/False), etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECannons could have: durability, ammoTypes, HEBlast, HEPen, maxAmmo, maxRange, speed, mass, flare (True/False), reloadTime, pivot (True/False), calliber, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArmour could have: thickness, durabilit, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also try to add armour angling physics, where the more of an angle armour is at relative to the shell the harder it is to pen. This would make vechicles based on some USSR tanks much more effective, especially ones like the T-34.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing I thought about were auto-loaders. These would have a very long initial reload but once reloaded, there would be a number of shells (4-10) ready to fire with a very short reload time in between and still eb able to deal lots of damage, especially from a higher calliber gun like 90 or 105mm, if they ever get added (hopefully larger calliber gns will eb a thing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally my last suggestion; Artillery Cannons. These would have a large last radius, extremely long reload, and would be fired upward to come down at the enemy. A way of aiming could be to target a vechicle and the artillery would auto-aim, but it would be really innacurate, as said before have an extremely long reload of about 30s-1min, wouldn\u0027t be able to reliably hit smaller targets, and would have extremely low ammunition which would also be extremely heavy in ammo crates making it impossible to carry a lot of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T17:37:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure Infinitedice already has said no to the above suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf123","CreatedById":77544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T00:45:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHEY!

They are passive tracking weapons, which means there is no way to know they are on the way until they are seen. Depending on the IR/Heat seeking missile will affect its ability to be spoofed by flares.

Maybe I am dropping them to high, I am dropping them from what I feel is a safe altitude for that type of ordance, usually 2-3km AGL. And the sad thing is the LAU rockets are faster than the AIM-9K or the Zephyr. Both of those missiles travel in excess of mach 4.
