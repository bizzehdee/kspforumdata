This proposal would make significant changes to the way science works, but mostly by adding new things. Science collection in general will feel very familiar to KSP players, but it will be more streamlined and balanced, and make more sense. More total science will be available to collect--I won\u0027t show a revamp of the research tree but I\u0027ll touch upon some ideas to expand it and make room for the science without adding a ton of new items.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of your data collection science will revolve around a base set of experiment types:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCrew Report\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEVA Report\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSurface Sample\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGoo Study\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaterials Study\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThermometer Reading\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBarometer Reading\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSeismometer Reading\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGravometer Reading\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nEarly in the tech tree you will unlock all experiment types in their most basic form, you can easily have them unlocked before you leave Kerbin to go to the M\u00FCn or Minmus, but later you will unlock better versions. These may allow you to collect a larger percentage of the maximum science on the first try but they will not increase the maximum amount of science you can get from any given experiment type in any given collection region. This means that if you send out a long mission early in the game, that mission can carry all of the important scientific instruments you\u0027ll need along the way. It would be great to take advantage of higher technology, but it won\u0027t be mandatory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like now, each experiment type/biome combination will have its own maximum cache of science. For instance, there\u0027s a limit to how much science you can gather from performing goo studies while landed on the M\u00FCn\u0027s midlands, which is separate from the science you can gain from thermometer readings while landed in the M\u00FCn\u0027s midlands, or from goo studies while flying over the M\u00FCn\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists can increase the science gathered when you collect data, and can slightly increase the maximum science you can gain from an experiment in any given location, but the scientist must be the one performing the experiment to get the bonus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny science processing unit can be used to increase the transmit value of experiments (except crew/EVA reports which already transmit at 100%) and any kerbal can operate these facilities, but scientists increase the bonus transmit value.

Returning more surface samples from the same biome gives much less science--you have to take home a whole ton of material to get the full 100%, but you can make it to 75% by bringing back just 100kg. Later in the tech tree you will unlock a surface collection unit which can collect the surface material rapidly and can store 100kg of surface sample, and then a storage tank that can hold a full ton of surface sample material and maybe a larger tank that can hold several tons--if you were to gather from multiple biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurface samples provide a way to get extra science from the same places you\u0027ve already been to. It\u0027s generally a lot more productive to explore new places for science, until you start to run out of places to explore. Also, they have the largest gap between maximum transmit value and potential recovery value, so they are your biggest incentive to bring the experiments back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGoo Study:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBase maximum value: 15\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase transmit value: 20%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase processing bonus: \u002B50%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMax transmit value: 60%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase recover value: 66.67%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mystery Goo Containment Unit, like other material-based experiments, has a low base transmit value. It is best recovered. There is a diminishing return on how much of the max you get for recovering it--the first one gives 2/3rds of it, and packing a few extra goo units can squeeze a bit more out if you\u0027re willing to run multiple goo experiments per biome. Later in the tech tree you\u0027ll unlock the Mystery Goo Habitat, a larger and heavier unit which has more and more lively Mystery Goo inside, and is better for study. The Habitat returns for 100% recover value in one try, and yields half more transmit value, 30% of the max up from 20% but has a much larger transmit size in MITs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMaterials Study:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBase maximum value: 50\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase transmit value: 15%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase processing bonus: \u002B25%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMax transmit value: 45%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBase recover value: 50%\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Science, Jr. unit offers your first mobile research lab, and these will become a staple for squeezing out as much research as possible from any biome, but they are also the heaviest module to tug around. Initially it recovers just 50% and you can run several to increase the recovery, but it would take an exorbitant amount of Sciences, Jr. to reach 100% due to the diminishing return. However, with just a few you can get significantly higher than 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in the tech tree you unlock the Science, Sr. which is a much larger 2.5m in-line lab with a base recovery of 80% and a base transmit value of 24%. You can get close to 100% total recovery with just a few of these, but they are a lot bulkier. The Mobile Research Laboratory is a late tech tree unlock, it\u0027s a huge 3.75m unit which can perform a materials study at 100% recover or 30% transmit value, it can collect and store some surface material, and it is able to process experiments to increase their transmit value.

They can also clean experiments. These units can be operated by any kerbals, but scientists are able to squeeze extra transmit value out, in addition to their overall science bonus based on their level. The Mobile Processing Laboratory (2.5m) and the Mobile Research Laboratory both have the full processing functionality, but the smaller Mobile Processing Unit (2.5m, much shorter) is only able to process for half the bonus.

As long as there is one scientist in the crew, you\u0027ll get the full scientist bonus, but the extra based on the scientist\u0027s level is taken from the highest level scientist in the crew. The small MPU has room for only one kerbal, but it\u0027s still faster than the other units because it doesn\u0027t process the data as far.

The true maximum is 230 with a max-level scientist. The module has a base transmit value of 15% and a base recovery value of 50%. The scientist increases the recovery by 12%, to 56% or 112 science on the first try. It will transmit for only 33.6 science, but we can process it higher. A non-scientist processing the experiment in a full-scale station would get it up to 42 science, but our level 4 scientist can process to \u002B95%--however the materials study experiment type only processes half as high, so our scientist can process it up to \u002B47.5%. The scientist would also add a 12% value to the experiment, but it already has a 12% bonus modifier applied to it since the same scientist gathered it in the first place. The final transmit value is 49.56 science, about a quarter of the base max for recovery.

Important structural elements should be provided early on, allowing you to construct a spacecraft of any shape you wish, but later research could unlock upgrades to the same shapes, making them lighter and stronger. Even large engines should be available pretty early in the tech tree, but later research would unlock more efficient and powerful engines. Later fuel tanks could have a smaller dry mass fraction, or contain advanced fuel that increases engine specific impulse. Wing surfaces could become lighter and stronger as well as gaining a higher lift rating. Early photovoltaic panels could be stationary, and later panels would rotate to track the sun automatically. Later docking ports need not only be larger, but can also have a stronger grip and be thinner/lighter/more durable. And as I have talked about above, the science experiments are all available early in the tree, but have later variants that improve them--though it is possible to get all the science with the starting experiment units.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChanging the tech tree in this way would give the player more freedom early on, and would allow players to plan ahead in their space program rather than forcing them to build crap spacecraft that are quickly made obsolete by new science unlocks. One thing that bothers me about KSP is that I have to explore first before I unlock the parts I need for exploring. I want to build my spacecraft, then send it out on a grand mission, and have that grand mission benefit my space program. It doesn\u0027t feel right when I have to unlock the whole tech tree just to prepare for launching my grand mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-25T02:45:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2016 02:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness2\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etrying to add image, new forum editor sucks\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaporized Steel","CreatedById":108520,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-24T20:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea that Scientist can increase the Science value gathered from experiments.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for your statement of 1Kg mass per sample.

I picture the Mobile Processing Unit (MPU) (the small one) being similar in size to the Science, Sr., about the size of a 2.5m monopropellant tank and probably having around 0.5 to 1.0 ton mass. The currently existing Mobile Processing Laboratory (MPL) is 2.5m wide and very tall, with a mass of 3.5 tons.

With the advanced instrument, you collect 100% data on recovery. Even with just the basic module, you still get 80%. There\u0027s only a small gain from monitoring over an extended period of time. However I was thinking that since the orbiting craft would pass over multiple gravity biomes, it should only collect data while traveling over the right biome. So, then, you could set up an orbiting probe with multiple gravity readers collecting data on all biome types as it passes over each one. To match this for the ground, perhaps a seismometer could very slowly catch readings for biomes it\u0027s not in, with the collection rate sped up for every other seismometer actively reading while on the same world but in another biome. So if you land 3-4 craft in different places with seismometers, you could just sit there and gradually soak up all biomes worth of seismic activity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022 So when you transmit data and a Scientist is onboard you\u0027ll get the transmit bonuses, but only if you transmit that data right? \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientist attaches the bonus to the data unit when it is gathered.

I have always noticed that despite being much smaller than our rockets, kerbal rockets are much more flimsy and less durable as well as being more dense.

Returning more surface samples from the same biome gives much less science--you have to take home a whole ton of material to get the full 100%, but you can make it to 75% by bringing back just 100kg. Later in the tech tree you will unlock a surface collection unit which can collect the surface material rapidly and can store 100kg of surface sample, and then a storage tank that can hold a full ton of surface sample material and maybe a larger tank that can hold several tons--if you were to gather from multiple biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForgive me if I missed this, but are surface samples then equivalent to ore, and can you fill up your 1t with a drill?

I could set non-scientist base to 25% and scientist base to 50%, and let them go up 10% per level, so they still get to 100% max. Now it\u0027s a lot more important to use a scientist. The processing speed boost could be 10% but it doesn\u0027t need to be very high. The processing module doesn\u0027t take that long anyway, so it\u0027s a minor bonus. Consider how much speed boost you get with three level 5 scientists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bonus to maximum science needs to be small. At 15% max bonus, it still makes a huge difference. Say you sent a probe around the Joolian moons gathering 80% of the max science for gravity scans from each biome, gaining 160 science for each one. Later you can come by with a level 5 scientist and gain 70 more science from each one. I don\u0027t think leveling up your scientists should essentially refresh all the biomes. I\u0027d rather encourage people to visit new places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might make sense to grant a recovery bonus for scientists. I didn\u0027t want the base recovery to be too low, or the max recovery to go above 100%. But maybe just take all the existing values and that\u0027ll be for level 5 scientists. Each level lower will collect 2% less, and non scientists will collect 80% on recovery. These smaller percentage values on recovery are multiplying larger numbers than on transmit, so it\u0027ll still be just as important to have a scientist for recovery as for transmit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would caution you against the diminishing-returns technique.
