My kerbals would then commandeer said vehicles to still unresearched biomes, attach science devices to their craft and perform science.\n\u003E \n\u003E The problem presents once a device has been attached:\n\u003E \n\u003E - The attached device is basically trembling: its contextual menu flickers and it is unusable.\n\u003E \n\u003E - after several secs of trembling, it explodes.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is this a known bug, or i\u0027m doing something wrong? I already used KIS in a variety of situations but this thing never occurred. It makes performing field science basically impossible, at least in the way I had in mind.\n\u003E \n\u003E thanks in advance and kind regards.\n\nScience equipment not working can usually be fixed with a quicksave \u002B reload cycle. No idea what causes the explosions though."},{"CreatedByName":"anxcon","CreatedById":148336,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-29T05:27:34Z","Content":"quite a few mods used the KASModuleGrab module to allow pickup of items- with that no longer there, the equiv looks like ModuleKISItem?\n\ni looked at the fields listed for both, seems like fairly compatible to make an MM script to convert old KASModuleGrab to ModuleKISItem?"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T04:03:22Z","Content":"I see an onslaught of questions and suggestions here, so I feel kind of bad adding mine to the list...\n\nBut is there a way to make the fuel lines / struts work as they do in the VAB via KIS? As it is, the root part can be attached via a drill but you do not get to place the second attachment point. I\u0027m guessing this is because those parts are procedurally generated. I don\u0027t know a whole lot about coding, so I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to integrate into KIS, but I thought I would ask / point it out. Would be great to add fuel lines for transferring fuel from undock-able tanks or connecting parts with struts."},{"CreatedByName":"Chittychad23","CreatedById":69440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T22:00:01Z","Content":"OK so I clicked on a part to drop it or temporary place it somewhere else but when I try to do that, I get \u0022too far from source\u0022. any help to get this frustrating thing cleared up."},{"CreatedByName":"STARKEngineer","CreatedById":148713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-03T21:45:37Z","Content":"I am having a problem where I cannot attach or detach parts.

An inventory slot is available and there\u0027s 70L of space left.

I\u0027ve released the \u0027G\u0027 first and the mouse button first with the same results.\n\nI must be thick (or just a little short of O2 on my EVA) but what the heck am I missing? Is the part too large?\n\nAnother question: Is placing the part in the inventory the only way to detach a part and reattach it a long distance away, i.e. outside of the Kerbal\u0027s immediate reach? I tried translating using the RCS but the keys don\u0027t respond if I\u0027ve grabbed a part.

I sent a probe containing materials for a 4-panel solar array. As soon as I assemble the array, or while assembling it, I get bad overheating problems. For example, at my 2nd landing site, I placed a battery onto a large cubic strut attached to a ground base, only for the initial panel I fixed on to explode due to overheating.\n\nI can\u0027t find anything outstanding in the logs, and I\u0027ve had to quicksave-quickload repeatedly before attaching the individual parts, which consist of nothing but a Ground Base, a Portable Karbonite Generator, 4 OX-STAT XL static solar panels, and 1 large cubic strut, as well as 4 AES struts, which are basically sets of 5 small cubic struts welded together.
