This is especially true after strong course corrections, be it in atmosphere or in space. It seems that SAS just tries to cancel out a given course input by oversteering in the opposite direction. Like this, a very strong pendulum movements is induced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most annoying situation is when I lift my plane from 10 to 40 degrees ascend angle, already after liftoff @~200m/s. It starts to pendulum up and down, but never ever holds the 40 degrees which I steered it towards. I always have to counter-counter steer with multiple waves of manual input. At greater heights and speed, even then SAS cannot hold the new ascend angle and I have to press \u0022S\u0022 continuously in order to keep the heading (thus, risking a stall). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA similar thing happens when you have relatively little torque on a vessel in space. Once you stop your steering input, SAS is supposed to stop the movement and hold position. What it actually seems to do is trying to get back to the position exactly where the steering impluse stopped. Like this, I can never achieve a stable change of course and always have to manually deal with the obligatory resulting, unnecessary, annoying pendulum movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is terribly annoying and makes flight a chore to deal with. Does Squad knows about these annoyances and intend to do something about it?
