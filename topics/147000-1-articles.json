To those of you who were where I was all those years ago - you can make your way into aerospace. Study hard, learn your maths and your physics, take your academics seriously and you\u0027ll manage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T00:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s awesome. \u00A0KSP and similar games seem like a great way to get people (young and old alike) interested not just in space and space exploration, but in logical thinking, problem solving, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a bit of a similar story, though not to quite that degree. \u00A0I also very into space as a child - I was spellbound by a children\u0027s book called \u0022Adventures in the Solar System.\u0022 \u00A0My mind was blown when I saw the movie Contact. \u00A0But I was never that into the actual technical\u00A0details of how we go about exploring space. \u00A0And in general my interest kind of receded, and I did not go into a STEM field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut after playing KSP for six months or so, I find myself reading up on the latest SpaceX flights, perusing Wikipedia articles on the Apollo Program and how all of the equipment worked, trying to figure out how the @*\u0026amp;$ a Hall Effect Thruster actually works, wondering if the EM Drive is for real, etc. \u00A0I don\u0027t think any of it will end up being more than hobby, but it\u0027s very cool to pick up an interest back 20 years later. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeefTenderloin","CreatedById":25612,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T14:00:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWent through my post history on here and found this\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yh3UDMO.png?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yh3UDMO.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T14:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWoohoo! \u00A0Nice one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
