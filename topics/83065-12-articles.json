I haven\u0027t read through all 28 pages of the thread (and that is probably to my detriment), but one argument seems to be that new players have expectations about the way KSP should work and that when it behaves in a manner inconsistent with their experience, the result looks unpolished. What I\u0027m about to say is anecdotal and should be taken in that context, but in my experience, new players don\u0027t see it this way because they have rarely have enough experience to know what to expect to begin with, and whatever model of rocketry they\u0027ve formed in their heads is drastically flawed, anyhow. Let\u0027s look at some common mistakes that new players make:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew players often launch straight up when they are trying to achieve orbit. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew players often build insanely huge rockets (then again, who wouldn\u0027t?), even though a smaller rocket would get the job done. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENew players often burn radial when they are trying to leave orbit and will burn directly towards targets \u003Cem\u003Enow\u003C/em\u003E instead of trying to find a suitable transfer orbit. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will start off by saying that I think there is merit in shattering misconceptions that arise out of common sense. I think KSP is fun simply because when you fail, it is usually catastrophically and hilariously. With that being said, I would hazard to wager that the new player\u0027s experience with respect to orbital mechanics is fundamentally incomplete; I know that mine was when I started playing KSP. As a result of KSP, I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I really wanted to do my own self-study on the issue. I think we sometimes forget that to these players, even getting into orbit under stock conditions is rewarding (even under stock conditions) because they have no concept of what constitutes a realistic rocket in this case. I now play with FAR, RemoteTech, TAC Life Support, and Deadly Reentry, which I have found can (and often do) punish relatively minor sins against physics with an iron rod. I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I actually like this, but I am not so sure a new player will. If they really want that experience, our capable and diligent mod community has toiled without end to provide it to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t misunderstand me: I think there is certainly room for improvement in KSP and some additional realism in stock will help that. I occasionally also find that Squad puts too much emphasis on new players sometimes, and that has occasionally manifested itself in some rather silly ways (like spaceflight preceding the invention of the wheel and manned exploration preceding probes). Spaceplanes are still a chore to design (although they appear to be receiving some much-needed love in 0.25). For all of stock\u0027s idiosyncrasies, however, I think that it kept me motivated to keep on playing and to eventually desire a more realistic simulation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have suggested, perhaps the best way to approach this issue is to allow certain aspects of the simulation (such as aerodynamics model) to be chosen at the start of a new save; then, it\u0027s just a matter of providing sane defaults. I wouldn\u0027t blame them for not focusing on this quite yet, however; I\u0027m sure they have a lot of things they want to get knocked out first, and they seem to know what they are doing (I haven\u0027t yet seen a patch that was anything short of awesome). Until then, knowing that mods are available to mitigate this issue has worked wonderfully for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-02T01:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EToo many options is a non-issue.
