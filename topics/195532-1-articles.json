It was based on the J-2X back when it was used on the SLS Upper stage, but it always looked awkward to me. Maybe make it a little skinnier, smaller nozzle with larger nozzle extention, and maybe an EUS variant for new SLS Replicas? Vector remake will be similar, just maybe with some pipes(i like piping)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"coyotesfrontier","CreatedById":181596,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-11T02:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not use Restock and have every part revamped?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RP1IsSuperior","CreatedById":202667,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-11T03:45:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really like the idea of restock, but personally I like the look of the stock parts better, especially the new ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not use Restock and have every part revamped?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-11T03:46:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2020 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by RP1IsSuperior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding quotation for context\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
