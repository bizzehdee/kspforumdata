I built a probe with a fairing. Below that was a transfer stage with a 2.5m tank and nuke engine. My launch vehicle was 3.75m, so it looked ugly. Just out of curiosity I put another fairing below that, and when I built the fairing and put my mouse on the fairing base for the probe, the \u0022Close fairing\u0022 text turned blue! Clicking closed it onto the other fairing base, making a straight inline fairing with no part clipping! When deployed, it breaks away like a sliced up cylinder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, never saw this anywhere else in the forum or announcements. Did I just miss it?

If there is any part anywhere near where the fairing needs to go it won\u0027t allow it to be created (even if it doesn\u0027t look like it would be a problem). And sometimes they just won\u0027t create at all, what I\u0027ve found in these cases is that saving the craft and then re-opening it quite often enables you to then create the inline fairing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you don\u0027t need two fairing bases to create them, they\u0027ll join up to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Jh8wEUi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Jh8wEUil.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you don\u0027t need two fairing bases to create them, they\u0027ll join up to other parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Jh8wEUi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Jh8wEUil.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was getting the impression from the OP that if you use 2 fairing bases you can have a smooth fairing wall without any curvature.
