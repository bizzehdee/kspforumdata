If reading a whole book about C does not ruin your English syntax then you are truely multilingual. lol. I just saw the same code written in hexadex and C, remarkably the hexadecimal code was easier to understand, ;^). The problem with I pad is that when you move your fingers rapidly close to target letters, even without contact they add characters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, but the divalents should not be able to evaporate off a still pond surface, There is extensive chelation between the oxygen of adjacent water molecules and the outer electron shells increasing the effective molecular weight. The only real way to make them accumulate is to add a monvalent acid like hydrochloric. In the basic form with CO2 present they will be pretty much in a powdery film at the bottom of the pond. According to the folks that studied radiation in farmers around chernobyl, the true and significant danger came from burning chaff, the radioactivity was not bad, but chaff contains associated dirt from roots and that contained strontium isotopes that was only volatlie in the context of a highly convective fire, and breathing was the way in. So its not actually easy to get strontium isotope into the body, its not easy to build up a concentration at higher pHs but if somene were to go suitless diving to the bottom and started taking in water they could get dosed with isotope. If they did that repeatedly I suspect they might start to see bone specific radioactivity. So the little graphic showing the danger dose zone, but the rods could be on one side and the diver could be handing off the bottom and stirring up radioactive carbonates on the other side, simply because thats where the carbonates settle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether or not strontium leaches out from the pellets depends on the coating, but i would suspect that fission results in decreased density of the products, so that there would be a tendency for the pellets to expand and present fissures.

If you want to keep the smell down the boric acid is a problem so they would need to add a base. Sulfide has a pka in the eightish range so you kind of want the pH around 9 or so. A base above 9.5 would constantly absorb CO2 from the surrounding air and raise carbonate concentation, basic sulfides are attraced to metals like iron and will preciptiate. Once the filters are pulled into the air the higher pCO2 will cause them to start smelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving thought about the metallic strontium, even with one outer shell electron would not be a good thing. Since hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide would not neccesarily be stable or a good thing, sulfate is a stable situational oxidant that could be added to prevent reduced strontium from producing H2 gas, therefore its probably added to prevent this from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-08T13:20:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2015 01:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-08T11:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GDJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GDJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe most toxic stuff I\u0027ve had to personally deal with:\u003Cp\u003ECondensate (crude oil additive)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenzene\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrazine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrogen Peroxide (90% concentration)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmmonia\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELithium\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECaesium (accidental low level exposure.
