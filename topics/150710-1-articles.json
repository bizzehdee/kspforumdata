Taking an EVA report while jumping, for example. Knowing where to find the 14 biomes at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E campus.

If you are going to stay on Kerbin for a few days, then you need to research scientific instruments and airplane parts -- and then start flying around a bit. But flying takes a lot of gametime.

Goo cannisters also have weight as separate parts, so they need to be perfectly balanced. So you always take two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can EVA, you can remove the crew report from the command pod, then store it back in the pod, get back in, and do another crew report. Every landing should be made to count - so go west too, get out once landed, remove and store experiments from/to the command pod (as mentioned above) and do an EVA report and another crew report on the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith just those three \u0022experiments\u0022, you can get quite a lot of science in the first two or three flights if you head in different directions - which allows you to unlock at least one more experiment and the basic rocketry stuff that can get you suborbital.

The best I can suggest is to take it easy: add a little to your rocket and see how much further it can get you. Don\u0027t try to add too much at once: less is often more. Do try to make the absolute cheapest heap go as far as possible, especially for tourists, but don\u0027t scrimp on the lightweight science experiments ever - you never know when you might land in a new biome, and you\u0027ll kick yourself if you forgot to bring a thermometer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
