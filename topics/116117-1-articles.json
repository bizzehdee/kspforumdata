Doing amateur rocketry \u0022safely\u0022 includes not being thrown in prison.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t have the book: what is your \u0022ingenious apogee detector\u0022 and how does it work? It\u0027s possible that there are some better ideas.\n\nNow, provided all this is legal in your jurisdiction:\n\nIf you are in the US, I would STRONGLY recommend buying some model rocket motors from Estes BEFORE you test-fly experimental motors. This will let you determine that you can successfully fly a rocket safely without the extra failure modes of your experimental motors. Second, do NOT try to fly a multi-stage rocket until you have succesfully flown a single-stage one, AND ground-tested your motors in the staged configuration to make sure your booster can actually ignite the sustainer.\n\nA few other points:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My basic idea is to take the idea of The King of Random\u0027s parachute charge (here, timestamped and all) and modify it to blast the upper stage away from the lower stage on a short delay (my main parachute won\u0027t be deployed like his; his is unreliable). I do have two problems with this idea, however. I want to salvage the lower stage as well as the upper stage, so how can I strap on a parachute? I also am not sure what to make the coupler out of. I need something sturdy enough to go up during the flight, but weak enough to actually decouple.\n\nThere are two problems here. First, your black powder ejection charge on the booster stage will just blow your upper stage off without igniting it. Build your booster like the Estes booster engines: an endburning propellant grain without any end cap; at the end of the burn the remaining disc of propellant gets so thin it breaks, sending exhaust gases forward and up the nozzle of your second-stage engine. This will light it much more effectively than the brief explosion of a black powder charge. Also, for a rocket this small, a delay isn\u0027t very useful.\n\nSecond, the \u0022delay grain\u0022 method is reliable enough that on rockets of the size you will be building nearly everyone uses it, and it works quite well.\n\nNow, I\u0027m assuming your airframes will be cardboard tubes; if they aren\u0027t, seriously rethink your materials selection.\n\nIf your rocket is not minimum diameter, i.e. there is an outer airframe tube, and an inner tube that holds the motor casing, separated by rings, then you will make a coupler by taking a short length of tube, cutting a small amount off lengthwise, putting it back together and gluing it into the top of your first stage. It should stick up into the back of the upper stage at least 1/2 the airframe diameter, and extend as far into the lower stage. Make sure the rear centering ring on the upper stage is far enough into the airframe that the coupler will fit. Alternately, if you\u0027re using standard commercial tube sizes, just buy a coupler from the manufacturer.\n\nIf your rocket is minimum diameter, i.e. the motor case fits right into the airframe, then have your second stage motor stick out the back of the airframe at least 1/2 a diameter, preferable 1 diameter. Make sure you leave room on the booster to insert it all the way.\n\nIn either case, the joint between stages will stand up to the first-stage motor\u0027s thrust, but because it\u0027s only held together by friction they can easily slide apart when the first stage motor burns out and the hot gases push the first stage backwards and the second stage forwards.\n\nA couple other tips: for your first attempts, do not use more than 20 grams of sugar propellant per motor. And do NOT, even if it\u0027s legal in your jurisdiction, use more than 125 grams of propellant in a flying vehicle unless you really know what you\u0027re doing.\n\nFor lower stage recovery, the lower stage will be unstable without a sustainer on top, and will be fairly light. It will simply tumble back to the ground from a low altitude. The only likely source of damage is thermal damage from the upper stage igniting.\n\nEDIT: I don\u0027t know if your book mentions this, but always test motors from behind a blast shield. If your propellant grain has large voids or cracks, it may burn much faster than you expected, overpressurizing the case and turning it into a pipe bomb. Assuming you\u0027re using a cardboard or plastic casing and under 20 g of propellant, most of your shield can be plywood. For parts you want to see through, use polycarbonate plastic, NOT glass or acrylic. Oh, and don\u0027t use a metal case; aluminum cases are for people who really know what they\u0027re doing, and steel cases are for people who REALLY know what they\u0027re doing, aka professionals. (here in the US, even the launches that let you fly 300 lb rockets 20 miles up in the air don\u0027t allow steel cases).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-19T09:19:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Armchair Rocket Scientist**"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T13:47:48Z","Content":"The book \u0022How to Design, Build, and Test Small Liquid-Fuel Rocket Engines\u0022 (Out of print, PDF [here](http://majdalani.eng.auburn.edu/courses/09_propulsion_1/ref_roc3_How_To_Design__Build_And_Test_Small_Liquid-Fuel_Rocket_Engines.pdf)) has a good test stand design.
