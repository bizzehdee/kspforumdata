I just thought I\u0027d go ahead and finally post a greetings on the forum. I\u0027ve actually been playing KSP for a little while now and I can truthfully say that I am in love! It all started from seeing YouTube videos of people creating these amazing rockets and planes in this amazing game, and I knew I had to have it. So yeah, I\u0027ve been crashing and experimenting and crashing more, and enjoying every second of it. So there\u0027s my random hello and thoughts and whatnot, I think I\u0027ll enjoy this community fully and look forward to becoming a part of it. Thank you for your time!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T00:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KevinTMC","CreatedById":28909,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T01:40:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome, and may you continue to have lots of enjoyable and/or successful and/or hilarious missions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As a Kraken, though...watch out!
