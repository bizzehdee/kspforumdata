There are two members of my family, I believe that everyone is familiar with, \u0022rabbit\u0022 (rover) and \u0022Firefly One\u0022 (Mars).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a dream, I want to be like \u0022rabbit\u0022, to fly into space in the near future, to complete the mission that Firefly One did not complete. You know what? In astronomical telescope, it was a beautiful planet. Master said, it is a far, far away places, first around the globe to do 20 to 25 days of accelerated motion, and then embarked on the Red Planet Journey nine months. There and the earth, but also the changing seasons, but on a quarterly basis to be six months, to 24 hours a day 39 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen flying over the moon, I\u0027ll bring everyone\u0027s blessing to \u0022rabbit\u0022, the \u0022Chang E\u0022 accompany and everyone\u0027s attention, she should not be lonely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a dream, I want to travel to the mountains of Mars, basins, volcanoes, canyons, Mars has the most beautiful landscapes. Do not look at my small size, I have a a large arm, I can stand up up to three meters tall and look over an area more than three square meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a mast with four high-definition cameras, this is my \u0022eye\u0022 that can not only look at the road, but also a wide range of shooting and long-distance navigation. On my back I have a pair of solar energy can be opened or closed, and with it I have energy. I have 6 wheels that can be adapted to the surface of Mars terrain, which is different from the \u0022rabbit\u0022 mesh wheel. I can climb 25-degree slope, crossing the 300 mm barrier and can remain stationary at 40 degrees slope. I can only go around walking, you can walk like robots stepped in climbing, obstacle when, by adjusting the gait and coordination, to achieve a smooth walking and exploration, this is before any country Mars Patroller have not had a.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to take samples of Martian soil and rocks, as a gift back to Earth; I want to record Mars like the same wonderful view of the universe and every moment, to tell you the story of the constellation; I use my flexible forearm, in the Martian surface drilling, grinding and sampling, looking for a beautiful stone to Mars. Do not underestimate the stone, maybe on earth can become a \u0022Crazy Stone\u0022, because through it may be able to find new sources of energy or traces of life on Mars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to help my master to establish a permanent base on Mars, even better than the US Mars analogue homes, not only have the bedroom, but also a laboratory and a gym, maybe you can do with the Earth micro-channel, remember the \u0022@ bug\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to look for other probes that have arrived like NASA\u0027s Mars \u0022Sojourner\u0022, \u0022Opportunity\u0022, \u0022Curiosity\u0022 or ESA\u0027s \u0022Beagle\u0022, as well as long-lost little friends; I am looking for humans who have been looking for aliens, and proudly told them: I am the one from Earth \u0022bugs\u0022; I have to take my master to Mars to travel.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that was odd \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, this was made by the rover creators by the way, not me.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-24T14:48:37Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2014 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by xenomorph555\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T14:22:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it that difficult to get an English translator?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is horrible.
