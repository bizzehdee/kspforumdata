It opens in a small window and will not allow me to maximize or resize the window. I tried going into video settings and the right side of the screen is cut off. I check off fullscreen and apply and accept and nothing happens. I cancel out and no change to screen size. Please advise and thanks for your time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValleySRT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
