When I lunch a rocket and press M for the \u0022map of Kerbin\u0022 I can only see my grey trajectory without AP and PE. I also don\u0027t see the little (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on) icons on the left side of gimball/gyroscope like the prograde and retrograde. So I\u0027m asking, what do I have to change to see them?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T18:53:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you playing KSP1 in career mode? If so, you will need to upgrade the tracking station before you get all the course projection indicators.
