Even if it\u0027s a differently named spaceship. or with different parts. I\u0027m crashing them at a rough 10km radius, but the first one got registered while it crashed more than a hundred kilometers away from the sensor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m waiting for the final stage of lithobraeking, not switching ships. there\u0027s power and coms on the ground station, and sometimes it seems to record a crash, sometimes it does not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what\u0027s the value that\u0027s getting measured? With crashing probes at more than 1 km.s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E in the ground, I barely got 8% of the science (but I was out of fuel, so not accelerating by yself at the time). Is it mass ? Is it acceleration ? is it speed ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSending crashers into Mun gets boring fast, and after four of them and not all of them getting picked up, I\u0027m starting to wondering what do I do wrong.
