This sets a mark for everyone to shoot for, and can help to clarify what you want the challenge to accomplish. In the case of your challenge, am I correct to assume the craft would need to be reconfigurable so the command portion of the craft can be moved to the side? If so, I think a lot of player\u0027s space stations already fit that category. Also, I\u0027m a little confused about the \u0022either \u0026lt;22500 or en route\u0022 requirement. With one you would be dealing with the atmosphere, the other... really nothing. Would these be in the same category? Also, how would someone go about winning this challenge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, is this something that players are going to find challenging and fun? As I\u0027m sure you could guess, that one can be a little harder to predict. Usually though, if the challenge is well planned and presented, you\u0027ll get some clever participants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027d like to take a look at an example of a format that usually leads to a successful challenge, I\u0027d suggest checking out [thread=27296]this thread[/thread]. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
