The question, as originally stated, is defined fully by constraints. It doesn\u0027t have anything to do with means of propulsion.\n\nThere are two constraints. First, is the rolling constraint of whatever vehicle.\n\nv\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = r\u03C9 \u002B v\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nWhere v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E is forward velocity of the vehicle with respect to ground, v\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E is the same for surface of the belt, and \u03C9 is angular velocity of the wheels, r being their radius. For simplicity, lets just deal with wheels of equal size.\n\nSecond constraint comes from the problem. \u0022Belt matches speed of the vehicle.\u0022 There are several ways to interpret that.\n\n1) Surface of the belt moves with respect to ground in reverse at the same speed as the vehicle moves forward:\n\nv\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = -v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nIn this case, the vehicle is free to move forward. We can solve for \u03C9 = (v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E - v\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E) / r = 2v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E / r. In other words, if the car is moving forward at 20mph, the belt is moving in reverse at the same speed, and the car\u0027s speedometer shows 40mph. The car has no trouble just driving off the belt in this case. But in the original thread, where this whole story starts, it is said that \u0022in a way that would keep car stationary.\u0022 Which leads to a second popular interpretation of this constraint.\n\n2) Surface of the belt matches speed of rotation of the wheel. That is, for a car, matching speedometer speed.\n\nv\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = -r\u03C9\n\nAgain, it is easy to solve for the missing variable. v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = r\u03C9 - r\u03C9 = 0. The vehicle remains stationary. And it doesn\u0027t matter at all what kind of propulsion we\u0027re dealing with. The very statement of the problem demands that the vehicle is stationary. If the vehicle moves, we have not satisfied the conditions of the problem. Is it possible to move the belt in such a way? Well, I\u0027ll get back to that in a moment. But first, there is one final interpretation, which I wouldn\u0027t even have thought of, but it\u0027s what Mythbusters have gone with, so it bears mentioning.\n\n3) Surface of the belt matches some constant reference speed.\n\nv\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nMythbusters considered two cases. Electric toy car and airplane. For electric car, v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E = r\u03C9\u003Csub\u003Emax\u003C/sub\u003E of electric motor, which lead to the condition v\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = r\u03C9\u003Csub\u003Emax\u003C/sub\u003E - v\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = 0 preventing the electric car from going up the belt. This does not generally work the same with internal combustion cars, by the way, but they never went full scale with this. And for an airplane, they chose v\u003Csub\u003E0\u003C/sub\u003E = v\u003Csub\u003Etakeoff\u003C/sub\u003E and so simply had airplane wheels spinning at twice the rate they were meant for. That can cause wheels to fail, but not on a tiny plane they used in the show, so naturally, they had no problems seeing the plane fly. What they were trying to demonstrate with all of this, I have no idea.\n\nOk, so the first interpretation is straight forward enough. Neither a car nor a plane have any trouble making it off the treadmill if it simply matches the vehicle\u0027s forward speed with respect to ground. So is the third. No matter how fast the belt moves, that either exceeds some mechanical limitation of the vehicle, or it doesn\u0027t. Plane has advantage, as its propulsion system is decoupled, so the only way to prevent the plane from taking off is by moving the belt fast enough to shred the wheels. But what about second interpretation? Can the belt be moving in such a way as to match airplane\u0027s wheel speed always, thereby, preventing it from taking off? This is where we take our equations of constraints and add them to equations of motion. I\u0027m not going through conventional derivation from Lagrangian, as that is needlessly mathy, but go with Newton\u0027s laws instead. First, we need to reframe constraints in terms of acceleration. (By taking derivatives on both sides.)\n\na\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = r\u03B1 \u002B a\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E\n\na\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = -r\u03B1\n\nMoreover, from Newton\u0027s first.\n\nm\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003Ea\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = \u03A3F= T - F\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E\n\nHere, T is thrust and F\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E is the force with which the belt pulls on the wheel. The wheel is free to spin, and if it was massless, that force would be zero. But the wheel does have some rotational inertia. So we have the following.\n\nI\u03B1 = rF\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E \n\nHere, I is combined moment of inertia of the wheels. And putting it all together, we can now solve this mess.\n\nF\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = T - m\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003Ea\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E = T - (r\u03B1 \u002B a\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E) = T - (r\u03B1 - r\u03B1) = T\n\na\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003E = -r\u03B1 = F\u003Csub\u003Eb\u003C/sub\u003Er^2^ / I = Tr^2^ / I\n\nSo since T, r, and I are finite numbers, there is definitely the right amount of acceleration with which the surface of the belt can be moving, such that due to \u0022drag\u0022 generated by the pull of the belt as it tries to spin up the wheels of the plane, the thrust completely cancels out, keeping the airplane put. For a real airplane, that works out to something in the broad neighborhood of 100g. There are two things I can say about that number. First, it\u0027s doable. You could construct a treadmill that will provide you with ~100g of acceleration at a sustained force matching thrust of the airplane. Second, this situation can\u0027t last for very long. Putting aside difficulties of maintaining these conditions on the treadmill itself, within about a second, almost any airplane\u0027s landing gear will disintegrate due to combination of heat and centrifugal forces.\n\nOn the net, we have a problem that\u0027s fully resolved in constraints before we even have to talk about physics. If constraints are matched, the behavior does not depend at all on what kind of vehicle is placed on the belt. The only place where the choice of vehicle matters is in how spectacular the failure will be when the constraints can no longer be physically maintained. For a car, if the driver\u0027s gunning it, the RPM limiter\u0027s going to kick in pretty quickly, and probably prevent anything bad happening. For an airplane, most likely a big fireball."},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T04:17:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Of\uFEFF \uFEFFcourse not.

It can\u0027t detect the rolling speed of anything other than the belt itself.\n\u003E \n\nThe answer to both of these is that there is a rolling constraint between the wheel and the surface on which it is rolling. Whether the axle to which wheel is attached moved forward a meter, or the surface was dragged the opposite direction underneath, the wheel will have to turn a certain amount. And because the wheel has mass, making it rotate faster requires an input of energy. That energy has to come from somewhere, and that means there is a sort of \u0022drag\u0022 between surface and vehicle that depends on relative acceleration between the two. And that\u0027s what letting us apply a force to the vehicle via the belt. That force simply has to counter whatever propulsion system is in place, whether it\u0027s propeller or torque delivered directly to wheels from a car engine.\n\nI\u0027ve outlined the relevant equations in the post above.

On an car you have to accelerate the drive train not only the wheels and you will reach maximum speed as your rpm even on highest gear get redlined, you will have friction in engine and drive train in addition to the rolling friction.   \n\nThis will happen much faster than an normal acceleration as you don\u0027t have to accelerate the heavy car just the wheels and drive train.   \n\nThe treadmill has to speed up its not insignificant mass of rollers and the belt as fast as the car can accelerate it wheels and drive train up to speeds above 300 km/h.   \n\nDoable but hard you need to reinforce the belt who increases mass and you have to keep inverting its direction on the end rollers.  \n\nOn an plane you have an constant trust, the only thing restricting you is the rolling resistance of wheels and friction in bearings, in short the treadmill has to fight jet engines   \n\nTo be real evil put an high performance fighter jet on the treadmill, its capable of an 1g acceleration, have fun trying to combat this rotating the wheels, yes all of the 1g acceleration of an 20 ton plane now goes to accelerating the wheels.   \n\nYou now have an engineering challenge ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"mrfox","CreatedById":69277,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T13:58:00Z","Content":"![4f6251871c224.image.jpg](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/ee/aee9632d-1787-5ae3-bd9e-f5479938c216/4f6251871c224.image.jpg)\n\nThe effect would have been even better had they had some sort of speed indication for the turntable, plane and car wheels, and forward ground/airspeeds for the vehicles, but nevertheless a fun museum exhibit (photo lifted from newspaper article)"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T14:24:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Hyperant said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only thing that determines if a plane will take off is **AIRSPEED**, something that is not determined by whether it is a regular surface or a treadmill, or whether the wheels are powered or not.\n\u003E \n\nWhether the wheels are powered or not is important. If the wheels are geared to something that is RPM-limited, then the plane will not be able to take off.\n\nOf course, no plane actually has wheels geared to anything...or, if they do, they are in neutral during the takeoff roll.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E In the original thread, where this whole story starts, it is said that \u0022in a way that would keep car stationary.\u0022 Which leads to a second popular interpretation of this constraint.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2) Surface of the belt matches speed of rotation of the wheel.

The vehicle remains stationary. And it doesn\u0027t matter at all what kind of propulsion we\u0027re dealing with. The very statement of the problem demands that the vehicle is stationary. If the vehicle moves, we have not satisfied the conditions of the problem. Is it possible to move the belt in such a way? Well, I\u0027ll get back to that in a moment.\n\u003E \n\nIn the earliest formulation I\u0027ve found, the phrasing is, \u0022designed to match the speed\u0022. So even if you\u0027re interpreting the speed as the rotation of the wheels, as above, you are left with a treadmill which will attempt to keep the vehicle (plane or car) stationary, but its ability to do so is not a given.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Since T, r, and I are finite numbers, there is definitely the right amount of acceleration with which the surface of the belt can be moving, such that due to \u0022drag\u0022 generated by the pull of the belt as it tries to spin up the wheels of the plane, the thrust completely cancels out, keeping the airplane put. For a real airplane, that works out to something in the broad neighborhood of 100g. There are two things I can say about that number. First, it\u0027s doable. You could construct a treadmill that will provide you with ~100g of acceleration at a sustained force matching thrust of the airplane. \uFEFF\n\u003E \n\nI would question this.\n\nIn order to match the interpretation above, the belt must be programmed thus: \n\nFOR GetSpeed(Wheels);  \n\nIF (GetSpeed(Wheels) \u003E GetSpeed(Belt)), IncreaseSpeed(Belt);  \n\nELSE IF (GetSpeed(Wheels) \u003C GetSpeed(Belt)), DecreaseSpeed(Belt);  \n\nRETURN;\n\nWe can suppose that the belt runs this subroutine an arbitrary number of times each second.\n\nNow, with the above programming, the belt cannot turn at all until it receives a signal that the plane has begun moving forward. Once the plane has begun moving forward, the belt will immediately detect GetSpeed(Wheels) \u003E GetSpeed(Belt) and will run IncreaseSpeed(Belt); as a result. However, this will cause the result of GetSpeed(Wheels) to increase in response, because the wheels are held to an axle which is not force-coupled to the treadmill; increasing belt speed directly increases wheel speed. So the only way to satisfy the programming is for the speed of the belt to increase to infinity, instantly.\n\nIt\u0027s like running IF (GetSpeed(Belt) = GetSpeed(Belt)), IncreaseSpeed(Belt)."},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T16:34:17Z","Content":"Aircraft tires are not generally designed for perfect friction at high speeds, so even if you had a magical treadmill that could somehow increase rolling-friction by increasing speed, the aircraft tires would still have some slip, especially at such high speeds as the treadmill would need to be spinning at(with the air being drug along by the surface of the treadmill adding an additional cushion, and if the treadmill is smooth enough not to drag air, then it is smooth enough for the tire to drag more easily).\n\nAny dragging that the tire does on the treadmill equals forward movement of the aircraft, so even if the rotational speed of the surface of the tires matches the linear speed of the tread-mill, it still could not prevent the aircraft from moving forward due to friction between the wheel and the treadmill not being perfect.\n\nWithout the coefficients of friction and the actual speed of the wheel/treadmill being provided, we cannot say if this slippage is sufficient for the aircraft to take off, but with enough friction between the tires and the treadmill, the tires will eventually melt/burn, causing the treadmill to stop(when the entire tire is stuck to the treadmill, the treadmill must come to a stop to prevent the melted tire material sticking to the treadmill from moving), at which point the aircraft can take off."},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T18:47:31Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So the only way to satisfy the programming is for the speed of the belt to increase to infinity, instantly.\n\u003E \n\nDemagoguery.

I believe this can help to narrow down the exact source of the confusion, as everyone can agree that most planes can take off in reasonable tailwinds.\n\nIt seems like part of it is confusion over acceleration and speed, and how the belt exerts backwards force on the plane both as a constant, tiny friction due to speed, and a greater backwards impulse that only occurs when the belt accelerates (I think). However, the thrust from the engines is always a constant acceleration, meaning that the belt must continuously and rapidly accelerate if it wants to overcome the acceleration of the engines.\n\nPersonally I think it depends on how plausible the conveyor, wheels, and plane are."}]}
