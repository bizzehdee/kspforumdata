I\u0027ve been self- enforcing my rule of building realistic LV\u0027s, and so far it\u0027s worked out great (the fairings in particular make designing ships a novel yet fun challenge, so I have to make them fit into certain spaces to launch successfully).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis 170-ton station was constructed using my launch vehicles, and proved that they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3yLpvEV.png\u0022 alt=\u00223yLpvEV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch of the first component- a fairly simple 25 ton command pod, strut section with solar panels, RCS, and battery, and two hab sections. That cylinder sticking out the top is the Launch Escape Tower, it\u0027s a relatively short payload so the fairing fitting is awkward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9Dr1ah6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229Dr1ah6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second component docking. It has two lateral docking ports for payloads, two hab sections, and a long central truss structure to allow attachment of large payloads along with over 4000 units of RCS. This was my first time using multiple docking ports- I didn\u0027t use subassembly loader, so it took some kajiggering in the VAB to get working, but it connected without much difficulty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FWhGs3H.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FWhGs3H.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the launch of the third and heaviest component, weighing in at 57 tons. 40 tons of fuel and a 10 ton NERVA make up most of the mass, along with one extra hab space for engineering, requiring me to use my heaviest launch vehicle with 39,000 units of liquid fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vYZNoGJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022vYZNoGJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t want to add to the mass by fitting RCS tanks or ports, so I actually just docked the two previously docked components with RCS and tankage to the propulsion section.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B0wwkor.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B0wwkor.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fully assembled vessel, ready to receive a Duna colony module and additional external fuel tankage as ballast. With 3000 units of dV, I should be able to get to Duna. Since it\u0027s modular, I can ditch sections as needed, so if it\u0027s looking iffy I\u0027ll just lose the middle section as there\u0027s enough hab space without colonists on board and enough attachment space without a payload to not be required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6Vkr9Be.png\u0022 alt=\u00226Vkr9Be.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt weighs 105 tons and is probably 70-80m long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as any modules use the three docking port arrangement, I can arrange the ship however I want- If, for example, I were to want to bring it to Jool and back, I\u0027d dock two more fuel tanks sans engines on the center axis and another fuel tank/ engine arrangement. Preliminary estimates (screwing around in the VAB) give it 8,000 dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestions, comments, and criticisms are all appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shuttle","CreatedById":5225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-21T05:38:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the way you installed triple docking ports A LOT, they look awesome!

Not sure how much delta-v I had but I have still a few thousand units of fuel to return home.

I haven\u0027t been to Jool since .17 and I feel like it is time. Unlike my normal process of sending a probe first, I am going going mun rocks to the wall and just launching a Station there. I\u0027ll send a lander later (other than Laythe, I\u0027ve never landed on any of Jool\u0027s moons). I have the Jool station on a 300-\u0026gt;580km orbit waiting to kick in the main stage NERVAs. I had boosted it up with the remaining fuel in the fuel tanks and Atlas engine that was the final stage of the station after assembling everything in orbit. I should have more than enough dV to get to Jool. I used a similar arrangement to get to Moho with a slightly heavier arrangement (smaller station, but rover and manned lander were included in that mission) and had maybe 10-15% fuel remaining in the final tank, so I suspect I should be able to get there with 20-30% fuel remaining in the last tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts 3 rockomax jumbos with a 2.5m NERVA on the end. Central tank/engine and two side tank/engines. At 33% fuel remaining, I cut out the engines, transfer all fuel from the side tanks to the central and jettison the side tanks. This time around I have the central tank setup so I can jettison the engine once I get a good orbit around Jool/Laythe and leave the tank attached to refuel future missions (for landers and/or Eyloo missions).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPictures to come.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T18:27:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 06:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by azazel1024\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T18:19:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Wait, Was That Important?\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Wait, Was That Important?\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ship has very little wobble under full thrust- 400 kN with that 2.5m NERVA on the back there.
