If you attach an engine, which conceivably should be able to lift a large 747-like SSTO, to nothing but a fuel tank and single seat cockbit with landing gear, what happens is about what I expect to happen. This is just weighing in. I have done zero math on this to find the real world comparison. Also, IIRC, the only reason why fighter style aircraft can fly is because they are micromanaged by computers. If the developers are trying to find a stabile aerodynamic model to support such crafts, it is entirely possible it may not even exist. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince KSP is going mainstream, I find it odd that a player who chose easy difficulty in career mode and has chosen stock rockets/aircraft to be available, will be unable to find any crafts that are only based on early techs. What is the point of having that option if it does not help the player over the starting hump or at least use as templates/starting points? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen going through the tutorial, the first time I did \u0022go to mun 1\u0022 (sp?), the craft did not load and my camera started with the sun in the center.
