Without changing too much the mission control, could we make a special flight for\u00A0von Kerman who needs to go to the Mun for research purpose (giving us more science points or unlocking new parts), or fly (the so hated) Mortimer to a site on Kerbin for business reasons? All of this could be accomplished as the tourists travel mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-21T20:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it\u0027s not that bad of an idea, but the problem is there\u0027s nowhere else to fly to other than \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E when we talk about jet planes.
