Don\\\u0027t even ask about landing though. Go talk to Winter Owl about how to land this thing. With an average cruising speed of 100 m/s (360 km/h) this sucker can go pretty fast and if you\\\u0027re good on the throttle it\\\u0027ll last you around 30 minutes before you burn out. The reason there isn\\\u0027t a photo of it burning out is because it didn\\\u0027t.
