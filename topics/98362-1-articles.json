All stock parts shall still be senseful usable, but your rockets shall look realistic and the distances of the planets shall look believable, it should have a semi-realistic sense of challenge, the surface shall look good, but also a low orbit shall look good.

No, I found a sweet spot where at least I am quite happy with the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAll Planets where scaled up with a factor of 4.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EAll Distances where scaled up with a factor of 7. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 is a good balance, where the PQS still looks pretty good ( even little better than stock in some places) and where making orbit is also quite a challenge.

Since Ike and Pol haven\u0027t had an atmo, they have no visible atmo-color. I\u0027d like to change this with adding clouds and cloud textures. I seem to make something wrong, I can get thick volumetrics to work as intended on Pol, but cloud-textures always appear thousands of Km above the surface. No idea why. If someone feels like experimenting, and creates a Titan-like Atmosphere for Pol, I will happily include that config in this. \u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPlanned things:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol and Syterion will get EVE clouds at some point. especially volumetrics, to cover up the missing atmo-color.

Bop and Gilly were moved too. eeloo orbits retrograde(Combining an Analouge of Enceladus and Triton) Especially that change looks really AWESOME in movement, but it\u0027s challenging to get to if not already planned when entering Syterions SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould make a Syterion-4 Challenge extremly Challenging... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol is extremly eas to land on, but ridicously hard to start from (as real Titan is too) due to the thick Atmo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly is has an extremly small SOI, because its so close to Syterion (Ring Distance), making intercept more rendevous-like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe choice for Phobos-analouge was Bop. It has the proper size and even an huge impact ( as real Phobos has too) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill undecided about the destiny of Minmus...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRex94","CreatedById":114868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-02T18:09:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, dev update:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus looks good as a Comet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you\u0027d have only one moon left at Kerbin, which could make Career more difficult, since you definitley need to go Interplanetary to finish the Tech.
