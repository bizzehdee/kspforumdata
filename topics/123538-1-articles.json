Do you need to be more precise in reaching the correct orbit as the game progresses?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask as, early on, I noticed that a couple of contracts completed (after the 10 second delay to show the orbit is stable) whilst I was setting up a maneuvere node to refine the orbit. There was enough difference between the current and desired orbits that I could see a space between the orbital indicators. But today I spent over an hour making tiny burns to tweak an orbit without success. It was only by zooming in that the slight error became visible (which usually seems to put the \u0022handles\u0022 of the maneuvere node out of view!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, is it simply that the larger orbits of later contracts exaggerate any slight deviations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally any hints or tips to share about matching orbits for these contracts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T15:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most likely culprit is you\u0027re orbiting the wrong direction. The orbit visual in the map view has little dots moving along that show the direction you need to orbit in. You should also be able to see the orbital inclination required in the details of the contract. For example a normal equatorial orbit would have an inclination of 0 degrees, but if the orbit goes the other direction, then the inclination is 180 degrees instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T15:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^This, or: did you accept this contract before launch, or after?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T19:35:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey do get more exacting to a certain degree. Later contracts are more apt to specify exact coordinates of apoapsis or periapsis, or different inclinations; and as you visit more moons and planets, you get contracts for those as well. So, there is a bit of a progression of difficulty, but it\u0027s not an even one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You also have to watch when they throw something extra into the mix, like having a thermometer or materials bay on board; if you glance past it, you won\u0027t complete the contract without that/those items...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T09:32:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers.

For example, a one-star contract may ask you to establish an orbit with \u0022reasonable deviation\u0022 from the supplied parameters. More difficult contracts --- which also pay more --- will ask for \u0022minimal deviation\u0022 or something similar. (I forget the exact wording.) The latter require you to match the orbit more precisely before the contract is considered fulfilled.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
