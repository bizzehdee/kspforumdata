Its way more important how much a CPU gets done during a cycle, and Intel is way, way better in this than AMD.

All recent AMD CPUs use \u0022modules\u0022, which hold some stuff twice and only one instance of other units.

Besides, they are not hidden at all. There are many wonderful benchmarks sites out there that do all the ground work for you. You just need to look them up and compare the things that can be compared. Just make sure you pick sites that actually measure things - there are a couple of them out there that predict performance based on specifications.

Real world tests are, when appropriate, always superior to any synthetic test. Partly because synthetic tests do not cover real world scenarios all that well, and partly because people and companies have been known to manipulate artificial benchmark results, skewing the picture painted.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nGetting real world, actually measured and situation appropriate benchmark results, preferably over a larger sample group (ie. multiple reviewer or review sites) are superior to anything else. If that fails and is not available, you slowly descent into less ideal options. The long story short is that no number of score can tell you in any detail about the suitability of certain hardware for a specific purpose or set of purposes. A quick example would be a 8 core processor at a lower clock speed and a short pipeline versus a 4 core processor at a much higher clock speed with a long pipeline, both yielding the same final score. I can absolutely guarantee that one chip will vastly outperform the other in some situations, and vice versa. Real world performance is not linear, so having a number that suggests it is is, well, somewhat dangerous.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scribbleheli","CreatedById":97627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T21:35:24Z","Content":"\nMy bad\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt was like...7am :P\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd as far as I know.

The issue is, I don\u0026#39;t know how to pick out a motherboard and RAM; what makes one model better than another? Also, how do I figure out the correct PSU for my components (I know the PSU should be using about 50%- 75% of its capacity for greatest efficiency, but how do I find the total wattage of my system in the first place?)? Lastly, I am not too adept at all the numbers after part names (such as socket type), so if someone could tell me if my parts will even WORK together at all, that would be nice. :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy selected components so far:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Case: Corsair Carbide Series 200R Compact ATX Case ($83.61CDN)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.amazon.ca/Corsair-Carbide-200R-Compact-CC-9011023-WW/dp/B009GXZ8MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1448498788\u0026sr=8-1\u0026keywords=corsair\u002B200r\u0022]http://www.amazon.ca/Corsair-Carbide-200R-Compact-CC-9011023-WW/dp/B009GXZ8MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1448498788\u0026sr=8-1\u0026keywords=corsair\u002B200r[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-CPU: Intel Core i5-4690K Devil\u0026#39;s Canyon Quad-Core 3.5 GHz LGA 1150 88W ($314.99CDN)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117372\u0026cm_re=core_i5_4690k-_-19-117-372-_-Product\u0022]http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117372\u0026cm_re=core_i5_4690k-_-19-117-372-_-Product[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 960 ($264.99CDN)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487091\u0026ignorebbr=1\u0022]http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487091\u0026ignorebbr=1[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-SSD: SAMSUNG 850 EVO 2.5\u0022 250GB SATA III ($99.99CDN X2)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147372\u0026cm_re=samsung_850_evo-_-20-147-372-_-Product\u0022]http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820147372\u0026cm_re=samsung_850_evo-_-20-147-372-_-Product[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-HDD: Western Digital 1 TB 3.5-Inch 7200 RPM SATA III Desktop Hard Drive ($68.12CDN)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB\u0026pf_rd_s=desktop-1\u0026pf_rd_r=1WX5ZBFH2V8N9ED734H8\u0026pf_rd_t=36701\u0026pf_rd_p=2055621862\u0026pf_rd_i=desktop\u0022]http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0088PUEPK/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB\u0026pf_rd_s=desktop-1\u0026pf_rd_r=1WX5ZBFH2V8N9ED734H8\u0026pf_rd_t=36701\u0026pf_rd_p=2055621862\u0026pf_rd_i=desktop[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n-(POTENTIAL)PSU:CORSAIR CX series CX500M 500W ($84.99CDN)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[URL=\u0022http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139050\u0026leaderboard=1\u0022]http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139050\u0026leaderboard=1[/URL]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFeel free to scrutinize any choices I make.
