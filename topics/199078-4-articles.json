Something like booting the game off a USB 2.0 Thumb Drive. Ridiculous yes, but I have heard of people storing their game libraries on Thumb Drives. Then you have portable HDDs and SSDs that use USB 2.0/3.0 interfaces. You have PCIe SSDs, PCIe M.2s, SATA SSD, SATA M.2, USB thumb sticks, USB external drives (Both HDD and SSD), etc. There\u0027s no way to account for all of them in development in a realistic manner, so really, HDD is the best way to test performance.

This is about the processes within an actual studio. It\u0027s about how we make games in the real world. In a perfect world, there are constant tests on the entire spectrum of target hardware, both done by humans and automated, any issues are promptly recorded, reported, and are scheduled to work on by both the engineering and content teams to rectify.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality, I have not seen this happen in a single studio I\u0027ve worked at, nor have I heard this perfect world scenario from any co-workers. And I\u0027ve worked on everything from start-ups to decades old gaming giants, having shipped games with budgets well into 9 figures. The reality of what we do in the industry is that the game is tested on the hardware that sits on the developers\u0027 desks. This is why having everyone work with a console dev kit is a huge deal, even if you do expect the game to ship on PC first. I don\u0027t know if Intercept has a PS5 and/or XBSX on every dev\u0027s desk, but regardless, since the PS4/XB1 are out of the picture, the slowest drive the developers will have to deal with is going to be in their work desktop. And we\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0want to have the fastest SSDs available. Dev studios started switching to NVMe M.2 drives on dev machines basically as soon as they became reasonably priced for 512MB\u002B. The reason is that we sometimes have to reload fifty times in a day. If the game takes a minute longer to load from a slower SSD, that\u0027s an hour of your work day\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewasted\u003C/em\u003E. A $1000 M.2 drive and compatible mobo is still cheaper than the engineering time lost in a year with a fast SATA SSD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this an ideal situation from perspective of reaching your markets? No, not at all. But if we were simply targeting the hardware people have, we\u0027d still be making PS2 games. The reality of gaming business is that it\u0027s not just flashy tech sells. There is a vicious feedback loop where the engineers have to work on much better hardware than min spec, and because of that, the games end up running like garbage on min spec most of the time. No matter how much QA complains, there are usually higher priority problems, like performance hitches or outright crashes, and these have to be solved before we can work on optimizing performance for the min spec. So with every release, the plank for what\u0027s acceptable gets pushed further out, even if there was no hype from the gamers themselves to buy flashy new hardware. This cycle is a big part of why gaming hardware becomes obsolete, and right now is the time for mechanical drives to die.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn truth, even the SATA SSD should have killed the mechanical HDD, but the part in all of this that might not be obvious is the relationship between game developers and console companies. If we want to ship on MS and Sony systems, we have to follow their license. And the license says that we have to support all of the \u0022current gen\u0022 hardware. The exact SKUs change over time, and until recently it included at least all versions of PS4 Pro and XB1X. These still had mechanical HDDs on some SKUs, meaning we still had to support these. With gen 9 finally here, this requirement is dead. Game developers are no longer required to support HDDs. At all. There\u0027s going to be push-back from marketing, but it\u0027s going to be overwhelmed fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, if you\u0027re wondering, it\u0027s the same reason why ray tracing is gaining so much traction. The visual quality is not that much better, if at all, compared to a good light probes implementation. But the light probes can take hours to build. And you have to rebuild them any time you change level geometry. I can wait for that to go through the builder, or I can just disable the probes and run with ray tracing, which is instant. So any game that has RT support is getting more love and polish on RT than on probes, and this is only going to get worse. Yeah, it\u0027s expensive having all of these extra RT cores, but it saves us a ton of money making the game, so we\u0027re going to keep pushing this tech until everyone agrees that RT is just a standard requirement now and you have to have RT capable graphics card to play games.

Most modern games are developed with consoles as a primary platform, as they tend to be the cause of performance bottlenecks, and gen 9 consoles are absolute monsters as far as streaming data from SSD to RAM goes. On top of that, most studios will have very fast SSDs on dev machines to speed up the workflows, so with gen 9 development, even if somebody is testing their builds on PC, there is no longer a point in the development cycle where you\u0027re going to be streaming from a slow HDD. There\u0027s a bit of a time lag until these kinds of studio changes start impacting the actual games, but we should be just about entering a generation of games that are developed entirely with the, \u0022Oops, we forgot to test the streaming performance with HDD before going into beta.

The PS4 and XB1 are still listed as targets, but with the release having been delayed as much as it was, and with these consoles having such major CPU bottlenecks, I am not fully confident that Intercept has been doing a lot of tests on these. My honest expectation is that we\u0027ll probably see at least the planets shifted to streaming. There\u0027s so much more data for the terrain in KSP2 compared to KSP, that I\u0027m having hard time believing that the team would opt to keep this in memory. On top of that, they seem to be using a lot of techniques common to open world games, which are heavily relying on streaming. So planets should be covered. But that does still leave ships with custom parts, and that might still have to be resident in RAM, and part mods might still have just as much RAM impact as they do to day.

Problem is, memory sharing had to be enabled (I don\u0027t know why this wasn\u0027t standard,) and so we\u0027d CONSTANTLY get bugs where someone finally runs the code with shared memory enabled and everything crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t get it, servers in an MMO does not care about graphic at all outside of catching people trying to cheat by to passing trough obstacles.

But, of course, the real question is \u0022Is it possible with the time and resources?\u0022 And that\u0027s, of course, a much more relative question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have not analyzed how the KSP loading works in a while. I\u0027m mostly going off the fact that the current loading is still CPU-bound, not IO-bound, so I don\u0027t expect much changed from the early days. One thing that used to take up a lot of loading time was the part config parsing. This is absolutely something you can fix in Unity if you\u0027re prepared to make some sacrifices. The standard C# way is to make sure that your classes holding your configs are public POD classes marked as serializable, and you can then dump their contents to the file, or read these contents back. The sacrifice is having to build assets for every platform and every version from scratch and if there\u0027s a major change from version to version, like a new field in one of your configs, you may end up with an offset change that will result in a large patch size. Still, even if some patches have to contain the entire binary dump of the configs, it\u0027s not the worst thing in the world, and you\u0027re probably doing clean builds of your project for every platform and version anyways. At least, you really ought to be doing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilar techniques can be applied to loading things like geometry and textures. Unity allows you to lock off relevant buffers for read/write operations, meaning you can go as far as grab the mesh you have in GPU RAM, dump it into a binary, and save it to disk. (You can also compile these yourself, which is a better option, but that\u0027s a tangent.) Then read just these binary blobs into memory when the game starts, and build the mesh for the scene when it becomes relevant by doing exactly the same operation in reverse: construct a blank mesh object in Unity, lock its buffers, copy relevant data from RAM, and unlock the buffers. I\u0027ve done something similar to load 3rd party assets in 3rd party format that Unity doesn\u0027t know how to parse without needing a converter. It\u0027s not the most pleasant code and API to work with, but it\u0027s there, it works, and it is stable and performant if you write your loaders right. There might also be shortcuts in modern Unity that make this a little cleaner and require less engineering work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there\u0027s the question of time it takes to switch between different game screens, and I\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebelieve\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it\u0027s because they are actually different Unity scenes, and switching between scenes takes a while. If that\u0027s the reason, the standard solution is to not switch scenes. It shifts a lot of responsibility for managing the resources from Unity onto the developer, but this is precisely how most open world games used to solve this problem. You don\u0027t rely on Unity, and you do your own loading or streaming as necessary. Maybe recent versions of Unity provide for a better way to do this, but at least the option is on the table either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much of this can we reasonably expect in KSP2? I think serializable configs should have been on everyone\u0027s mind, because you kind of use similar techniques for networking. You have to turn your classes holding the ship states and turn them into something you can send across the wire. There are different ways of doing it, but some kind of serialization is going to be a part of it anyways, and you might as well recycle the tech for resource loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at the planet tech, I can also say with certainty that Intercept has people that know how to make fast resource loading a thing. So the capability is definitely there, and we\u0027re just looking at whether they had the time to do it. My guess would be that delays on some other game systems and multiplayer will hit gameplay and multiplayer engineers a lot harder, giving some slack for the engine tech people to do some additional improvements. So hopefully, this is one of the things that made the cut. If they can stream planets, they ought to be able to stream ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, scene switching is probably the most painful part. It\u0027s not so bad if you designed the game that way from the start, but if Intercept already had the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/Hangar as its own scene separate from the rest of the game, it might be too time consuming to fix it once the game became big enough to start causing loading delays. It\u0027s very hard for me to say if it\u0027s something they\u0027d be willing to spend time to optimize given the development timeline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd again, since I kind of expect the feature work during early access to fall on gameplay and multiplayer engineers, I fully expect additional engine work being targeted at performance, both runtime and loading. So what we get day one and what we get when the game gets its full release might be very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazalassa","CreatedById":217956,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-03T11:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224205071\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670004455\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145774\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alexoff\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 hours ago, Alexoff said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nonly Windows loads quickly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWindows: \u003Cstrong\u003E*updates*\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexoff","CreatedById":145774,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-03T20:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224205155\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199078\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221670018336\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what we get day one and what we get when the game gets its full release might be very different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the release version will be much larger than the early access version.

These things should be close to final in KSP2 early access. The only part that\u0027s going to be big, new, and add a lot of additional resources will probably be colonies and space stations. I\u0027m a bit concerned about these too. The part that makes me somewhat optimistic is that this shouldn\u0027t be a surprise for anyone, so hopefully, it\u0027s something the team thought about a lot and has a plan to make sure there is no (significant) performance impact. Colonies can probably be folded into the terrain tech, for example. I\u0027ve never had to make an engine support a full planet with player ability to build a base anywhere they want, but I have had to support an engine that supports dozens of square kilometers of complex terrain with various environments and a team of artists who might decide to add some buildings anywhere they want. And in my experience, treating terrain, buildings, and randomly placed objects (trees, bushes, rocks...) as part of the whole at the high level, assigning them to LoD tiles, etc, and then taking specific low level optimizations where you can (like terrain being a height map gives you some neat shortcuts) only once you have the high level taken care of. If that\u0027s the approach taken, I don\u0027t think colonies should present any overwhelming obstacles to keeping the load times down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStations are a bit trickier. In a lot of ways they\u0027re like colonies, but you\u0027re much more likely to be zipping past one at 5km/s. And while that\u0027s obviously a problem with KSP stations already, these have always been small enough to where you can gloss over that. (E.g., collision usually doesn\u0027t even work, as it\u0027s only checked once per frame in KSP) With KSP2, stations can get much larger, so you can\u0027t just pretend they\u0027re not there if they haven\u0027t had time to load yet... So I don\u0027t really know what the plan is. One way to address it is to expand the LoD approach to space as well, with the space divided into some form of sectors. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E are a good starting point, but you\u0027d need to further subdivide these, and then start loading things in advance as you\u0027re sort of moving from sector to sector... *shrug* Hopefully, people who have been thinking about it for a few years, rather than five minutes, have better solutions.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, right, almost forgot: Interstellar.
