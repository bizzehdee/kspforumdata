I have tried at least 4 times to model the LEM, and failed miserably every time.  Mostly due to lack of... proper engineering oriented schematics (i.e. milimeter precision measurements, with angles, curve parameters, etc).  Which I\u0027m not likely going to find available for public access.  The shape of the thing is just so...ugh..not a real shape ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nHowever, I might consider either A: \u0027borrowing\u0027 the Nasa public-domain 3-d model (free to use, for any purpose!) and cleaning it up for game use, with custom textures, or B: Merely creating a smaller lander-can.  I kind of want to rework the landing pods a bit anyway for other unrelated reasons, so can probably work that in when I get to it.\n\nKeep in mind though, reworking Lander-Core stuff is currently scheduled for 0.9.x; so... many months away.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Nice white is fine, but I do love the FASA apollo CM/LEM though with the shiny texture and detailing. I just uninstalled them as I was getting tons of errors with that mod (15-20 lines per second). Too bad it\u0027s so buggy, I really loved a lot of his parts like the capsules and the launch clamps (hint, hint).\n\u003E \n\nI -might- consider doing a silver/shiny texture given the new found ability to generate properly shaded meshes.  Can\u0027t stress how big of a deal this is to me... I\u0027ve been trying for 6-months to find a way to fix normal shading;  just happens that it is a brand new feature in blender, and I just had to wait for them to make it usable. \n\nI\u0027ll at least mock up a couple of samples with silver/shiny texture and see how it looks.  No promises though, as I\u0027m still not a huge fan of large patches of super-shiny without proper reflection support.\n\nLaunch clamps - not really planned, or of interest to me.  The stock ones work acceptably for my purposes.  Might consider it as a bonus feature after everything else is completed, but that will be a long ways out."},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T00:28:16Z","Content":"Cool!!!"},{"CreatedByName":"VenomousRequiem","CreatedById":137373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T01:31:23Z","Content":"You know what, buddy?

The more it is facing the air-stream, the more effective it is.  (will have a slight \u0027grace\u0027 area where you can be slightly off-vector without too much bad effect).  This means the heat shield will only protect a part if oriented properly  -- no more heat shields losing their ablator during launch.\n\u003E - minEffectiveDot - minimum dot product between wind and heat-shield direction where heat shield will still be effective (dot product is basically the angle between two vectors, expressed as a range of 1 to -1)\n\u003E - maxEffectiveDot - the dot product at which the heat shield is most effective (at higher dot products than this, it will be 100% effective; it is this that provides some small off-perfect \u0027grace\u0027 area).\n\u003E - ablationStartTemp - temperature at which ablation will start; below this temp and the heatshield is just dead weight\n\u003E - ablationMaxTemp - temperature at which ablation peaks -- beyond this temperature effective ablation rate will peak at 100% of maximal.\n\u003E - Node/occlusion checking - even if facing the airstream, if the specified attach node has a part attached the shield will be considered \u0027occluded\u0027 and not function.  Can be used to \u0027stack\u0027 heat-shields for sequential use.  Undecided if this will use drag-cube occlusion checks such as the stock heatshield, or if it will be purely node based.\n\u003E - ablation heat reduction is based on the material used for ablation -- using specific heat capacity/density of the material.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Would-be-nice:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Allow for other types of heat-shield -- passive thermal soak, ejectable, active thermal soak, others?\n\u003E - Allow for variance in the ablator material? (e.g. in-editor switching)  More dense = higher start temp, but more effective (use for super-high-speed re-entries, such as direct-return-from other planets)\n\u003E - For non-ablating types of heat-shield, allow variance in shield materials; higher density = more soak potential, ??\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Any ideas/input on that list of requirements?

Finally, proper texture workflow/re-use.  I just read about the ability to use 4 separate UV maps -per mesh-.  So, one for Diffuse/specular/etc (shared texture), one for AO bakes, one for detail texture (e.g. decals, hand-made normal maps, other detail stuff; not all faces might even need detail textures), and a fourth for ? (lightmap, second detail texture set?).  Really, this should cut down a lot of time out of my texturing, as I can re-use the base textures/materials (e.g. silver metal, orange foam, white paint) and only need to create the separate detail textures for each part, instead of remaking the full texture for every part.\n\nSadly, the geometry for the CM is finalized.  Even a tiny change in it will require redoing 8-12 hours worth of work (just redoing the AO bake is 2-3 hours of redoing the model into bakable form, and an hour or more of waiting for it to bake, not to mention the many hours worth of texturing I have already done that would be wasted because of a new uv layout).  Also, there is not really any room for additional polys in those windows without changing the # of sides on the base cone; and as I want to maintain compatibility with stock parts, I\u0027m stuck at a 24-sided cone.  For future reference, the last stage at which I will make geometry changes (without -very- good cause) is the AO bake stage -- after AO has been done initially any kind of geometry change requires redoing far too much work.  So, in the future, speak up earlier and I will likely accommodate your request.\n\nI\u0027ll revisit the geometry after the 1.1 update, as I\u0027ll need to completely redo all the textures for everything anyhow, will be close to no extra time lost for updating the geometry a bit.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, lynwoodm said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Works for me.

Each rescale would require its own part config file, as the setup for stuff like parachutes/etc would be so vastly different (and I do not intend on adding dynamic rescaling to the parachute/etc modules).  Sounds like a ton of extra work for no real added utility.  And as others mentioned, it would require a custom IVA for every part-rescale, and you hopefully know by now how I feel about doing IVAs.\n\nNothing stopping you from doing it yourself though.

Finally, proper texture workflow/re-use.  I just read about the ability to use 4 separate UV maps -per mesh-.  So, one for Diffuse/specular/etc (shared texture), one for AO bakes, one for detail texture (e.g. decals, hand-made normal maps, other detail stuff; not all faces might even need detail textures), and a fourth for ? (lightmap, second detail texture set?).  Really, this should cut down a lot of time out of my texturing, as I can re-use the base textures/materials (e.g. silver metal, orange foam, white paint) and only need to create the separate detail textures for each part, instead of remaking the full texture for every part.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly, the geometry for the CM is finalized.  Even a tiny change in it will require redoing 8-12 hours worth of work (just redoing the AO bake is 2-3 hours of redoing the model into bakable form, and an hour or more of waiting for it to bake, not to mention the many hours worth of texturing I have already done that would be wasted because of a new uv layout).  Also, there is not really any room for additional polys in those windows without changing the # of sides on the base cone; and as I want to maintain compatibility with stock parts, I\u0027m stuck at a 24-sided cone.  For future reference, the last stage at which I will make geometry changes (without -very- good cause) is the AO bake stage -- after AO has been done initially any kind of geometry change requires redoing far too much work.
