And it\u0027s true, KSP doesn\u0027t warn you about a flameout, which is why my plugin has a reading that you can use in one of the GUIs; I\u0027ve been annoyed by this and thought of it already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYeah, I know; I\u0027m looking at ways to make the jets flameout more gracefully and evenly. There\u0027s no reason that the air from one side of the plane should be feeding the engine on the other side. That said, vertical stabilizers aren\u0027t as effective at high supersonic speeds; perhaps you need larger ones.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWell, it\u0027s implemented is actually correct. The air intake and fuel consumption values point to it being the ratio for complete burning of Jet-A. When you\u0027re trying to run at full throttle with not enough air you\u0027re pouring too rich a mixture into the engine, interrupting combustion. Realistically, the engine control system should handle that for you, but this is KSP, where everything is done manually.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe stock engines are tweaked to make less thrust with FAR; the air intakes provide the same amount of air and the same amount of drag. I don\u0027t see what you\u0027re complaining about, since you can fly much higher with FAR than in the stock game. I don\u0027t know about not getting to orbit easily; the stock Aeris 4A is easily capable of it with FAR.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy are you climbing until you reach 30km?
