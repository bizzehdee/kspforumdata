Unmodded version of the game. 100% stock. Was steadily building a space station, had trusty old Jeb keeping an eye on things. Set the warp factor to swing things around to a more favorable launch window. And I hear an explosion, (while viewing from the orbit and node planning mode ) the station no longer appears on the tracker. I tell it to show debris. and There is scattered parts in the former orbit but some of the fuel tanks are racing out of the system at 72% the speed of light. Jeb meanwhile strolls into the space center and reports for duty. No idea what happened, and Jeb\u0027s more tight lipped than The Stig."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T02:34:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yeah.
