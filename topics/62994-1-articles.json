In KSP, the fuel (both components) has a density of 5kg/U. The mass flow rate you calculate includes both the fuel and oxidizer by the way. Thrust is given as kN in KSP so watch your units when you calculate. As an example calculation, your mass flow rate is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edm/dt=F/Isp*g=1,500,000/(280*9.81)=546.1kg/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV/dt=dm/dt /density=546.1/5=109.2U/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou said your rocket has 3600U of fuel, so the total volume of fuel and oxidizer is 3600*2/.9=8000U.
