My plan for the mission was to take a plane design I knew worked from my previous builds and then try and convert it into a space plane. The goal was to hopefully get it into space and hopefully into an orbit. Here is the video of the mission, hope you all enjoy and of course I would love any hints/tips on how I could improve my space plane design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFvtxoWPcsY?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T17:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply based on the fact you have plenty of liquid fuel left I am confident you could have made it to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn your next attempt you might want to level off your ascent between 15 and 20 km and gain more speed.
