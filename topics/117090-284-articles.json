About the only option for a probe-carrier is to add decouplers with 0 force.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you did want to model such a part, please keep in mind that the PartModule that runs the system expects the models to be constructed in a specific fashion.  Each \u0027length\u0027 of the modular part needs to be its own distinct model / mesh, and the plugin switches between these prebuilt models at run-time.  So from a modeling perspective it is best to build the base model in a modular fashion -- one end piece that is mirrored for the other end, and one central piece that can be duplicated to extend the length (that is all you would need to model/texture; from there I would do the duplication/etc to create the unique lengths).  This is the setup I use as it allows the end-pieces to have a different AO setup from the repeated middle section, while still allowing for re-use of both the end and middle sections, all while keeping texture size down to a minimum.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A 1x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - End  \n\u003E \n\u003E A 2x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - End  \n\u003E \n\u003E A 3x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - Middle - End\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Really though anything will work as long as each \u0027length\u0027 of the part has its own model.  Technically you could even export just the \u0027pieces\u0027 and recomposite them through config (e.g. you export just the end and middle, and put them together to form the finished model through the equivalent of MODEL nodes); might actually be easier from a modeling program/Unity perspective as there are fewer models to deal with.  Hmm... could actually reduce memory use (both distro size and RAM use) a tiny bit by doing that as well...\n\u003E \n\nThanks. That\u0027s how I was anticipating building it based upon looking at what your tanks/parts do. Clearly it has a conception of zones that have independent meshes and logic that tells it what order to put the zones into for each length. I assume the length of each slice/zone whatever we call them is arbitrary but recommended to be no shorter than .5m? I\u0027m thinking at least 1m should be standard here and maybe 2m, since we want to put attach nodes along the truss to make it an intermodal cargo carrier too, the lengths of the middle slices have to be equal to the length of the smallest cargo section and I don\u0027t think we want 1m cargo sections but I\u0027ll look at it."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-24T14:14:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 6 hours ago, vossiewulf said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks.

Should also add that I model all of the modular parts (tanks/trusses/adapters/etc) at a 5m model scale and as close to 128pixels-per-meter linear texture scale as possible.  The actual model scale is personal preference, as long as the texture scale is kept to the same scaling (e.g. if modeled at 2.5m, the texture needs to be ~256px/meter; at 1m the texture would need to be ~640px/meter).  This is all done to keep the textures reasonably detailed on the large parts, and not overly detailed when they are scaled down in size.\n\nAt 5m scale, I would imagine that you would want segments of either 2.5m or 5m length.  Shorter than that and it ends up being too many models to export, much longer than that and the sizing isn\u0027t granular enough.  Might be that you have a 1m end-cap mesh on both ends, but make the repeatable segment 2.5m or 5m in length, so the final part ends up being in 2.5m increments with a \u002B2m offset -- 4.5m, 7m, 9.5m, etc.  Trying to figure out the way to keep the geometry modular is part of the fun of modeling these parts (I often spend more time thinking on how to put the models together than actually modeling the stuff....)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-24T14:37:14Z","Content":"Hi [@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)   \n\nIn my last play trough couple weeks ago, I noticed a bug when using your tank (any kind).  \n\nWhen stacked right next to a in line cargo bay, it prevent it to shield stuff when closed.

It can also be \u0022burned\u0022 into the texture map to provide excellent basic shadows.\n\n\u0022Baking\u0022 is creating various types of model maps that will be used for various purposes - curvature maps, materialID maps, ambient occlusion, etc. - each one creates a new 2d view of the model with each point being assessed values based on the parameters the map is looking at, like material ID checks to see which material (texture) is assigned to each point. Most important is the Normal map, which refers to vectors, not how weird it is. Each triangular face in a model is defined by four data points - the x,y location of each point of the triangle plus a vector normal showing which direction that face is well, facing.\n\nWhat we do now in modeling, particularly for high end effects in movies and games, is to create two versions of each model. One is extremely detailed with a zillion polygons, much more geometry than you\u0027d ever be able to render in real time, and a low-poly version which is limited to how much you can render and which has much simplified geometry.\n\nA normal map baker will compare those two models and then create a normal map that tells a renderer how to cheat and make the low-poly version look almost exactly like the high-poly version by having the renderer itself use the vector normal data to alter the rendering so it looks like it has all the details that were eliminated in the low poly model.

Any other shade says the underlying geometry is facing in a given direction even though the low-poly model has nothing there.\n\n[![WTTSsOPl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WTTSsOPl.jpg)](https://imgur.com/WTTSsOP)\n\nThis is a material ID map that just shows what material is assigned where.\n\n[![RGRrtD6l.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/RGRrtD6l.jpg)](https://imgur.com/RGRrtD6)\n\nAnd this is it wearing the normal map (details still there) \u002B the ambient occlusion map, so now it looks like it has basic shadows and the details are even clearer.\n\n[![5xpsLcdl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5xpsLcdl.jpg)](https://imgur.com/5xpsLcd)\n\nThis is a curvature map. Gray is flat, white is convex curve, black is concave curve. Since this object is a machine so most of the edges are 90 degrees. It\u0027s mostly used by procedural materials that add edge-wear effects like faded paint and chips on edges.\n\n[![ww1JVDCl.png](http://i.imgur.com/ww1JVDCl.png)](https://imgur.com/ww1JVDC)\n\nAnd this is what it looks like when you combine your texture painting with all of the other maps.\n\n[![mFIkr4sl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mFIkr4sl.jpg)](https://imgur.com/mFIkr4s)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-25T20:29:03Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2017 08:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by vossiewulf**"},{"CreatedByName":"T-10a","CreatedById":176203,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T22:52:36Z","Content":"How would I patch the parachute modules for the command pods/docking ports in ModuleManager to use RealChute chutes instead of the stock parachute module?"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-25T23:16:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 23 minutes ago, T-10a said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E How would I patch the parachute modules for the command pods/docking ports in ModuleManager to use RealChute chutes instead of the stock parachute module?\n\u003E \n\nAFAIK you cannot.  The best you can do is remove the SSTU parachute module from the parts and provide your own solution through adding more stand-alone parachute parts to the craft.\n\n- SSTU\u0027s parachutes models are added to the part at runtime by plugin code.  SSTU uses runtime-defined animations in order to drive the deployment/inflation (model has no animations).\n- RealChute parachute models are a built-in part of the part\u0027s model (often a stand-alone part).  RealChute uses pre-compiled animations to drive the deployment/inflation (animation baked into the model).\n\nSomeone else with more experience with RealChute might be able to provide more insight or alternative solutions.  I\u0027ve never personally used it, and the above statements are based on reading through the source-code.  Your best bet might be to ask in the RealChutes thread with a question such as \u0027How do I add RealChute parachutes to an existing part?\u0027.\n\nEdit:  You might also take a look at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E configs to see how they handled it.

This would be driven by config files to setup each mesh-\u003Eshader-\u003Etexture assignment.\n- Part-Icon shader handling.  Use the list of models that have the standard shader applied to them, and apply the icon shader to the part-icons that use those models.  Will require a special StandardIcon shader variant to support the screen-space clipping functionality and adjust the lighting parameters.\n- Include functionality of the ReflectionManager -- update per-vessel (or per-scene for editors) reflection probes.\n- Would **not** include texture-switching support -- that should be provided by external mod plugin code --  SSTU already has its own texture switch, as do many other mods.  They might need to be adapted to support arbitrary texture names as the texture names used in the Standard shader differ from some of the KSP shaders, and might need to be adapted to support loading the Standard shader from the GameDatabase.loadedShaders list.  Very minor adjustments that should be simple to integrate into existing texture-switch solutions.  (see below the comments on recoloring support -- if it were included, some form of texture-switch PartModule would also be included)\n\nPlease keep in mind that this would be a \u0027Modding API\u0027 type release.  It is not intended to do... well... anything... by itself.  Textures and configs must be provided by the external mod that uses the API -- all it does is load the shader and apply shaders/materials/textures to models as defined in config files.  Mods that didn\u0027t need texture-switch support would not need any external plugins beyond the PBR shader API.  Mods that did want texture-switching can still implement whatever form of switching they desire in their own plugin code (or use one of the existing solutions, such as FS or B9, etc).\n\nOne thing that I\u0027m a bit uncertain on is if I should include \u0027recoloring\u0027 support in the stand-alone shader/API.  As the recoloring setup requires quite a bit more plugin support (for the GUI at least), and requires at least some form of PartModule to manage persistence, I don\u0027t think it would be prudent to include it.  Also unsure as to how it could be supported in a completely stand-alone fashion -- SSTU\u0027s recoloring setup is so deeply integrated into the PartModules themselves that it couldn\u0027t be moved to an external solution very easily (and not at all in some cases).  I suppose I could release the equivalent of the SSTUTextureSwitch module -- includes only basic texture-switching and recoloring support, with no external PartModule interaction;  SSTU would still need its own built-in solution, but this would allow for others to take advantage of the recoloring setup if they desired.\n\nI\u0027m not even particularly sure that the shader would gain any support or use by other mods.  There have been a few very minor inquiries, but not much past that.  However I do know it won\u0027t get used much/at all unless I make it available as a stand-alone, and as that doesn\u0027t hurt its use in SSTU at all, seems like a reasonable thing to do.  Would really -love- to see some of the other mods adopt the Standard shader/PBR setup even if it is just on optional expansion packs/etc.\n\nIn development news:\n\nNot much.  Spent the last couple days/nights assembling the geometry for the LC tanks.  So. Many. Models.  23 unique models so far (.mu files), and haven\u0027t even started on the paneled variants (\u002B11 more models for paneled variants).  That is the development cost of these \u0027modular\u0027 parts -- lot and lots of setup time on the modeling and configs.  Still far quicker than doing each part individually, and certainly more optimal from a memory/texture use perspective (imagine if it were \u003E140 new stand-alone models \u002B textures for each one...).\n\nLast count was that this single \u0027part\u0027 would add 145 unique part variants (unique nose-body-mount combinations), all for \u003C10mb in textures and another mb or two in model files.  Each additional texture set will add 6mb of additional textures for the diff/nrm/metallic maps (possibly less if some bits can share textures between sets, such as the external paneling).   I intend on offering a few initial texture sets -- at least one legacy \u0027recolorable\u0027 set (possibly 2-3 of them), and a couple/few stand-alone non-recolorable PBR sets.  These will stick around until I can get recoloring support in the new shaders, I imagine only a couple of weeks  (who knows, I might not actually get the parts finished until the recoloring stuff is ready...).\n\nEdit:  Quick render of all of the tank models that will be exported.  Still need to setup colliders for a few of them, but most are ready to be ran through part-tools and added to config files.\n\n![DFqWzJP.png](https://i.imgur.com/DFqWzJP.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-26T18:06:38Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2017 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T17:01:50Z","Content":"Would be awesome too see other mods use the PBR functionality as well!

The full SSTU system, with its the tank content and scaling system, engines, model switch, texture switch...
