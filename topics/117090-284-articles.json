from there I would do the duplication/etc to create the unique lengths).\u00A0 This is the setup I use as it allows the end-pieces to have a different AO setup from the repeated middle section, while still allowing for re-use of both the end and middle sections, all while keeping texture size down to a minimum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 1x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - End\u003Cbr\u003E\nA 2x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - End\u003Cbr\u003E\nA 3x length part would be setup like: End - Middle - Middle - Middle - End\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally though anything will work as long as each \u0027length\u0027 of the part has its own model.\u00A0 Technically you could even export just the \u0027pieces\u0027 and recomposite them through config (e.g. you export just the end and middle, and put them together to form the finished model through the equivalent of MODEL nodes); might actually be easier from a modeling program/Unity perspective as there are fewer models to deal with.\u00A0 Hmm... could actually reduce memory use (both distro size and RAM use) a tiny bit by doing that as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.

A point in a recessed corner is simply going to receive much less light than a point on the outside corner of a cube that can \u0022see\u0022 almost the whole world around it. It is a grayscale map where white can see everything and progressive shades of darker gray are used to indicate reduced access to light. It\u0027s used by procedural texturing systems like Substance Painter to know where certain effects go, like dust should accumulate in recesses and none should be on high points, and SP can tell from the AO map which is which.

Most important is the Normal map, which refers to vectors, not how weird it is. Each triangular face in a model is defined by four data points - the x,y location of each point of the triangle plus a vector normal showing which direction that face is well, facing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat we do now in modeling, particularly for high end effects in movies and games, is to create two versions of each model. One is extremely detailed with a zillion polygons, much more geometry than you\u0027d ever be able to render in real time, and a low-poly version which is limited to how much you can render and which has much simplified geometry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA normal map baker will compare those two models and then create a normal map that tells a renderer how to cheat and make the low-poly version look almost exactly like the high-poly version by having the renderer itself use the vector\u00A0normal data\u00A0to alter the rendering so it looks like it has all the details that were eliminated in the low poly model.
