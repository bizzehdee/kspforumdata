It just adds a layer of tedium having to grind easy missions to get back money due to a simple slip-up, and at the early stages of your space program the losses can be quite severe.

The way real one works is - you develop LV on your own dime, and then you\u0027re getting money back for flying successful missions. So this forces you to think about functionality over \u0022prettiness\u0022, also you _need_ to do test launches with mock payloads or without payload at all. But since test launches involves flying hardware and spending fuel, you _have to_ pay for it.\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the way I do it - I do test launches with as cheap payloads as I can come up with, and only after I\u0027m satisfied that LV works I take a mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe its a question of balance, I find my LV is almost all the cost of the mission with the payload being a very small amount.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nobody44","CreatedById":66369,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T15:07:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asmi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022asmi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are very good reason why I\u0027m offering it the way I offer it.\u003Cp\u003EThis is a position of a chicken - \u0022What if I screw it up?\u0022 - well you\u0027ve gotta pay for your screw ups.

Apollo style missions (orbit around kerbin, orbit around mun, land, dock, land on kerbin) are currently not possible, because of the way KSP handles dockings and undockings. Technically speaking an undocking creates a new vessel, that has a new ID. And you can\u0027t finish the landing on mun with this vessel because you did not finish the other goals before the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Try not to dictate *how* to do something. Try to set a target, not the *way* the user should accomplish the target. Like: \u0022Land on that spot on the Mun\u0022 and *NOT* \u0022land on that spot using two ships, one stays in orbit and one lands.\u0022. Of course you can and should specify parts that the vessel needs, but don\u0027t try to dictate *how* to finish a mission. Only challange missions should do that...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlazingAngel665","CreatedById":30182,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T15:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snillum101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snillum101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMaybe its a question of balance, I find my LV is almost all the cost of the mission with the payload being a very small amount.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is an issue with KSP balancing. Usually the LV\u0027s IRL cost about 150-200 million if you are talking ULA 50 million if you are talking SpaceX. The satellites can cost hundreds of millions more. In KSP however the satellites are usually made of the same parts used in the launch vehicle instead of special highly expensive gold foil, glass optics, sensors and what not. This is a balancing issue that is probably not going to be solved anytime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"itsme86","CreatedById":59895,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-15T16:18:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis mod has definitely add a little sizzle back to the game for me!
