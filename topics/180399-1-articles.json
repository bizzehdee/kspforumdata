But there is one big issue. After that I had played for a while, and made and saved a lot of ships, I went into the\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cabbr style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;border-bottom:none;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022 title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Eand built a ship. I saved it and then launched it, and it got my payload into orbit. I wanted to make a few changes to the design and do a new mission with the old ship, but when I went to open the ship, it stopped loading the ships. I could not move down or up or press on any ship, so I exited out of the menu. I tried again and it did\u0027t work. I frustratingly rebuilt the old ship completely. There is no way I can delete old ships to get it to load faster because I can\u0027t do anything in the menu. I was wondering if there is a way to fix this, and if not, I would like to suggest that it would be patched. Also, there should be a way to select multiple quicksaves at a time and delete them all at once. It is quite frustrating to delete one, and it reloads, and delete another one, and it reloads. I love this game and if this was patched it would be even better.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
