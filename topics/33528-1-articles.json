Slap eight radial chutes on that. Use an RC-L01 RGU for the command module on top. Put an FL-R1 RCS Tank below it and eight blocks, and that\u0027s all you really need. Eight tonnes on the nose. If you absolutely have to have liquid fuel (which, admittedly, is helpful for getting to a rendezvous faster), put an X200-8 tank and a Poodle engine on it - that\u0027ll add another 7 tonnes to it.
