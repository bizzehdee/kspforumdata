Do you mean that the part shows up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E rotated incorrectly? As far as the highlighting - can you attach the part and then remove it from the vehicle? If not it may be because you don\u0027t have colliders - otherwise I\u0027m at a loss as to why the highlighting doesn\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T07:14:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere th image for highligning\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ibb.co/RjGPx3C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ibb.co/RjGPx3C\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
