When an engine attempts to draw intake air from the pool and not enough is there it will automatically throttle back to compensate. The problem arises when one engine is receiving more air than another, the engine with less air will be throttling back while the other isn\u0027t.\n\nAssuming your intakes/engines are laid out \u0022properly\u0022, you can gain some time on air-breathing mode if you switch the RAPIERs to closed cycle, but IME it is hardly worth it as the thrust produced by the jets will be minimal compared to the rockets (and at that point you should probably be climbing and raising apoapsis anyway)."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:31:01Z","Content":"Okay, thanks. Does the air-meter need to be full in order for all engines to produce maximum thrust? If the intake air is limiting, I might as well have only the turbojet engines and a couple of dedicated rocket engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T18:35:31Z","Content":"The intake air meter is borderline useless, it only displays how much intake air is in the pool at the end of each frame. As an experiment, try mounting a fuel tank to a launch clamp. Place intake, then jet engine, and ignite the engine, observe the meter reading. Then do the same but place the engine first, then the intake, and repeat, you\u0027ll see a very different reading."},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:19:17Z","Content":"Do you mean to say that the Intake Air bug is still in the game?
