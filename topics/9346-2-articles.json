The external pressure may be created by the gravitational field of Earth pulling its atmosphere together, but gravity itself does not counteract internal pressure. When there is no atmosphere due to no planet\\\u0027s gravity pulling in gas, we put on a suit with its own gas inside of it, and make sure that the pressure in the suit is regulated to prevent harm. The fabrics of the suit are built tough enough to withstand the pressure difference of the vacuum and inner suit, of course. And no, the suits would not blow up like balloons.
