There could be different variations of the blast texture depending on the velocity or size of the object which then right after it explodes, the texture and ground around it could glow for a few seconds and then cool down leaving only the blast texture. Definitely wouldn\u2019t be a crater, (which only could be truly possible in KSP 10 alongside with an Intel i30 and a RTX 9090) but it is as possible as tire tracks or Kerbal footprints, and the tracks and footprints have been done already in the Kopernicus Extras mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-09T02:15:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2023 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CytauriKerbal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAbaddon","CreatedById":192494,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-09T10:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree that something like rover ruts easily can be done, e.g. by Shaders, especially if they are not persistent. Making it persistent would be more difficult but still possible, but you would probably get some weird results if you stack too many crossing and overlapping ruts. I am not sure I really want them to affect physics though (which is possible, see e.g. what the parallax mod does). Wheel physics was buggy enough in KSP 1 without it. And I think it is still Unity handling it, so while it is likely much improved I would not be surprised if it is not still weird in places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarge scale deformation is computationally feasible (hell Magic Carpet did it back in 95, to just give a random example. But it\u0027s the kind of feature you need to pretty much built the rest of the engine around, so highly doubt we are going to get it - that\u0027s the kind of feature you brag about and also the kind of feature you can\u0027t really easily add at a later stage.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
