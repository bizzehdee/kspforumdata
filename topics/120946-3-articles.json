The Duna mission was supposed to also land on Ike, but due to a staging issue during Duna ascent and a tight dV budget, I had only barely enough fuel to reach Ike, land, and make it home, so I erred on the side of caution and skipped the Ike landing. I\u0027ve also got a pair of poor schmucks out in orbit around Pol aboard a space station; their space programs abandoned them in dangerously low orbits and hired me to go get them. I\u0027ve got a Jool-5 capable ship that will be heading out to get a crazy amount of science (aka money, thanks Administration) from Tylo and Vall, which will also shuffle some crew around to get my mining operation on Pol going, with the intent of establishing a Laythe colony.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA list of where I\u0027ve been so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho - Unmanned only (Landed, did suborbital hops, and deployed a cubesat in orbit for science contracts)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve - Unmanned only (Landed, deployed a rover, put a cubesat in orbit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGilly - Unmanned only (Landed, did lots of suborbital hops; gravity/seismic scan contracts on Gilly are easy money)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun - Been there and back lots of times, both manned and unmanned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMinmus - I do a LOT of work here, lots of crew going back and forth from Kerbin orbit and Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna - Manned and unmanned (Manned landing and return, also put down an unmanned rover and a outpost for a contract)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke - Manned flyby, unmanned landing (Also dropped off a rover, did a two-for-one with Duna in the same mission)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres - Unmanned only?
