Now I have a craft that is supposed to take 4 of them up to orbit via a HubMax Multi-Point connector (obviously with 4 docking ports on it). But my problem is that all 4 of the crafts have their thrusters and such in the 0 stage and I don\u0027t want them there. I also have a problem with assuming control of the decoupled craft: I tried using \u0022control from here\u0022 on the docking port and on the actual MkI Lander Can (with a kerbal inside) but it doesent give me control of the craft. It still leaves me with the main ship (which is controlled by a stayputnik, the main ship is unmanned). I\u0027m sorry if I typed a lot, I just wanted to give as much info as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrihanOs","CreatedById":98121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-30T15:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can move engines between stages by clicking on them and the dragging them to the stage you want. You can also create new stages with the little \u0022\u002B\u0022 button between the stage boxes, and delete empty stages with the \u0022-\u0022 button, and rearrange existing stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second question, you can cycle close vessels with the \u0022[\u0022 and \u0022]\u0022 keys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yume","CreatedById":99121,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T01:57:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you so much that worked like a charm!
