I\u0027m thinking of going for the small solar sat design with the 1650DV tank and engine setup with full tank 8.xTWR for the sat itself. Can\u0027t remember the name of the parts but the tank is a fenram 1200 something tank or something I\u0027m waiting for the game to boot since it crashed again but its super small and compact folded and comes with a telemetry unit as well as 8 relay dishes and 16 solar panels and 800 EC. Did I mention I intend these to be almost all purpose for any local planetary system and be designed to be shipped out in bundles of 8-16 to a rocket so I can populate a planetary body with only one or two payloads and have a fully functioning local relay station when the colony ships arrive.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOh I shall call them swarm sats.\u00A0Pro tip when transferring to duna if you haven\u0027t sent your comsats the last cycle make sure your comsats are sent to duna at the closest time to the transfer window time itself than the rest of the fleet. This should ensure they show up first even if they are the last to make the transfer and give you a few days to put the payloads where they need to be before the fleet shows up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOk game loaded I\u0027m going to document it and prep for the the upcoming transfer windows.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222807929\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002264224\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476646952\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to figure out why this thread suddenly resurfaced, and trying to decide whether it should be merged with \u0022What did you do today?\u0022 or vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that really you?
