This way you can use vernors only for propulsion to encounter debris/whatever you want to bring back home and deorbit, and maneuver jets for fine control to catch up the debris or stabilize the craft. When toggled off, vernors should not consume any monoprop for stabilization. Also, they are a bit too powerful for stabilizing such a small craft, so they most likely \u0022overshoot\u0022, tilting the ship too much, which mean that vernors on the opposite side have to counter that, again with inappropriate force...thus waste of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
