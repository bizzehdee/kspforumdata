We can give you some rules of thumb that would help most of the time, but there will always be issues that require additional analysis and thought.\u00A0I have two pieces of advice:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTo resolve a crash, look towards the end of the file to see what was happening right before the crash.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSearch for \u0022exc\u0022 to find exceptions.

The first log you should really examine is the standard written every time KSP.log which can be found in your KSP root folder.\u00A0 Also get yourself a decent text editor, notepad\u002B\u002B is used be many, with line numbers search options syntax highlighting etc. This will make the whole process of reading your log a lot clearer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your game is locking up crashing on load, especially if you\u0027ve just installed mods. then there\u0027s a good chance the cause of the crash will be among the last items in that same KSP.log.\u00A0 Using a good text editor you can search for the installed mod, check the paths, check the textures etc. There\u0027s a tonne more info in the KSP.log for non dev types than in any of the other logs, output logs and minidumps are the preserve of the devs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally there are very few problems that can\u0027t be identified by viewing the KSP.log and as a third party troubleshooting tool, should you not be able to work it out, a zipped copy of your KSP.log will allow experienced mod users or makers to identify your issue fairly quickly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nostagar","CreatedById":175384,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-16T23:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223147876\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164398\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502686734\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165004\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheRagingIrishman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/13/2017 at 9:58 PM, TheRagingIrishman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can guarantee you that MKS is updated to 1.3 so you definitely didn\u0027t install the latest version/you installed it incorrectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I read through a log file, I look for different things based on what the problem was and how well I know the mod.
