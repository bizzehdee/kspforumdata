If a Kerbal is with another Kerbal with bad social skills, he will slowly become insane. Same if a Social Kerbal is alone, and even to a unsocial kerbal if alone long enough.

I feel like this needs to be way more simple. Like maybe each Kerbal has 3 stats, Courage, Intelligence, and Happiness. When you recruit them they could have some low, slightly random allotment, and you would have to build each by sending them on missions. Courage could be enhanced by flight-time and completing missions and contracts, and perhaps a Kerbal with higher courage would give more money when the mission was completed. Intelligence likewise could be enhanced by doing experiments, and the higher intelligence the higher the science yield. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappiness is trickier to me. Id love there to be some advantage to sending more Kerbals on long missions, and maybe its increasing their happiness. For instance a Kerbal could start at the Launchpad with 100% happiness, and if on a solo-mission that happiness would deplete in a few weeks. 2 Kerbals would take a few months to deplete, 3 Kerbals a year, up to say 6 Kerbals who could stay happy for a round trip Jool mission. I don\u0027t know what that should get you though. Maybe its the ability to complete crew tasks? It should be really simple--maybe a kerbal with less than 50% happiness could be considered \u0027depressed\u0027 and wont take surface samples, make eva reports or repair things etc. A Kerbal with 0% happiness would become \u0027despondent\u0027 and refuse to leave the crew-capsule?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know.
