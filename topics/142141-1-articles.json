Has there ever been a mod that adds custom ground scatter to planets? Is the ground scatter system even available to modders? Essentially I want to add a custom type of terrain scatter to Kerbin and control where it appears on the map, density, size of models, etc.\u00A0 So I guess my real question is: can anyone tell me everything there is to know about ground scatter?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
