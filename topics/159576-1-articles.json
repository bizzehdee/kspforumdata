But, when i finaly realized that Thrust per percentage or whatever changed the fuel comsumtion too. so i went to the actual engine in the squad folder and edited it so it had more thrust, less fuel being used. but when i tried to get to the file that i needed to edit, it had to be open with something else (acording to youtube) but i messed that up and made all the files i was trying to edit open with notepad then messed with the thrust. but now my 2nd favorite engine is gone. :-(\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-22T03:43:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Steam, verify the cache.
