Is that a reasonable thing to expect from them, especially when for a new player those probably sound like fun things to try?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think as a community we\u0027re habituated to knowing this kind of stuff and taking it for granted. We\u0027re used to using stuff like you mentioned about sepatrons for radial decouplers to work around bugs. We\u0027re used to rotating our viewpoint ad nauseum to place a maneuver node that\u0027s just refusing to show up on a trajectory for no apparent reason. We\u0027re used to continually hitting \u0022F5\u0022 to back up our saves in case our ships decide to spontaneously disassemble and to avoid playing \u0022hardcore mode\u0022 with no reverts because we know things could go haywire at any moment. We\u0027re used to our trajectories suddenly shifting onto a collision course instead of the intercept we painstakingly plotted with maneuver node tools that are at best clunky and at worst infuriating when we change SOI\u0027s, swearing a bit, and then just moving on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew players do not expect these things, and particularly not ones that just bought a \u0022released\u0022 title that is basically putting itself forth as a complete game.

It has contributed to a resurgence in the popularity of space exploration. It gave a few NASA eggheads some neat ideas and it means we can\u0027t use the phrase \u0027It\u0027s not rocket science\u0027 - because thanks to KSP I can do rocket science and its really not that hard. However it takes more than physics and some lovable aliens to woo a critic. Take for instance Rock Paper Shotgun. They have a (good IMO) habit of distancing how they feel about a game from how good it actually is. For example most of RPS loves Elite: Dangerous. But their review of it was one of \u0027yeah this is still in beta wait bit before buying\u0027 because of bugs, lack of meaningful success and general lack of polish. The exact same criticisms apply to the proposed KSP at 1.0 - it lacks victory, it has a great many bugs (including the entire x64 version of the game) and has about as much polish as sandpaper. Take a look at its review of the Beta: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/23/kerbal-space-program-beta-review/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/12/23/kerbal-space-program-beta-review/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew of the issues raised have been fixed. They will not be kind. They will want to be, but they won\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The product itself\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP lacks victory. There is only so much achievement to be had. Once you\u0027ve gone to the Jool system and back you are basically done. The contracts quickly become mindless busy work necessary to keep your progress afloat. The game lacks the parts for me to say \u0027look at my Laythe colony! Isn\u0027t it magnaflorious!?\u0027 because I can\u0027t really do that. I can\u0027t say \u0027look at my glorious space station\u0027 because it serves no function. It is an ornament. A 2 million funds ornament - and I cannot recommend that to a friend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also lacks many of the physics required to call itself a physics based game about flinging kerbals. Water is either pastry or concrete (There is a great mod that fixes that btw). We will get atmospheric stuff so that will be fine. It lacks re-entry physics. I should have to think about the craft design just a little. If I am going to be punished for an out of place control surface I should be punished for sending my crew at 8000m/s vertically at Eve. It is illogical to include some features in great detail and ignore others completely. It breaks progression and it breaks immersion for any space enthusiast as much as flying through the pre-1.0 soup that constituted the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game isn\u0027t ready from a gameplay point of view IMHO. There is too little to keep me thinking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The bugs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay. So they will probably fix some of them. They will probably introduce as many as is often the way with any update of any software. However as much as I trust SQUAD to fix some bugs, others I think they simply don\u0027t know how. Case in point: memory leaks. Since the Big Bang the great civilisations of the galaxy have gone \u0027Wow, itsn\u0027t it great, the planets are so... hang on, I have to restart - the telescope is starting to tank\u0027. Memory leaks are a serious problem affecting the game that SQUAD simply has not been able to crush. On the basis that the problem has never been fully resolved, just made slower, I do not think they will fix it on release. Then the x64 version. I could write a small book on why a working x64 version of any PC title is important. It needs to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the decoupler bug, something that can be worked around but still should not be there. A minor quibble, but it suggests SQUAD is not inclined to fix bugs with the urgency and efficiency that may be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) \u0027Placeholder\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are too many assets, textures and some sounds that are just placeholders. The interior of the MK1 inline cockpit - \u0027placeholder\u0027 from the part\u0027s introduction to now. The outer planets of the Kerbol System... do not exist yet. And remain some forum posts on what the devs want to do before launch but because 1.0 needs to be out the door, that will not happen. What the devs themselves want won\u0027t happen in their game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody in their right mind would tolerate placeholder assets and textures in a finished product. From what I have read, I will not be able to tolerate 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall: I want to love 1.0 - I want to celebrate. But I cannot, the critics will be divided, the game will be buggy, the game will be unfinished, the x64 version will not work, the gameplay will get old quickly. Those are not the hallmarks of a product ready for release and that is why the game is not ready under the proposed 1.0, to be released as the finished product that we will judge it for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T22:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Bugfixing always comes last.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to return to this post for a second I want to point out that development strategy is actually a recipe for disaster. I\u0027ve been through this process many times, and reserving bug fixing for the end of a project instead of fixing as you go is a good way to create a living nightmare for your development team.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, a certain period of intense bugfixing will ultimately be required, but IMO, that\u0027s a result of the failures of a development process, not something that should be expected or encouraged. Unless developers take a certain amount of time to self-test and fix their code as they go, bugs stockpile and exasperate each other until you end up with a horrendous tangled mess that can drive you to madness on large projects, where your attempts to fix one thing will often wind up breaking another, and the actual origin of a particular bug can be obscured by the magnitude of the code base you are now working with. Bugs are usually easiest and least time consuming to fix immediately after writing the code in question, as whomever is working on it is still intimately familiar with the way the logic works, and where the bug actually resides is easier to identify since you just put it there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd really, I think that\u0027s part of why I lack confidence here. When something as readily apparent as the radial decoupler bug goes unresolved version after version I question the development principles at play here and how it will all play out when people are crunching like crazy trying to get the game out the door.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T22:54:40Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T23:05:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs long as Squad takes their sweet time and makes sure they get it all right.

I do not count the hours I spent with this, suffice to say, I am still playing it and having a blast with it. For me, it was the contract system and economy that was needed to push me over the edge in terms of wanting to play this, as it gives just the right amount of framework to your space exploration. With the amount of mods available, virtually all the flaws of the game can be amended and eliminated and the few remaining are more than outweighed by the sheer greatness of KSP. With that said, if squad want this game to success out of the box, they really need to look to the modding community (I know they do it already, and thats also awesome) and with their help, cobble together a package of mods endorsed by them that can fill the gaps between their 1.0 features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, because:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of a proper 64 bit version in 2015 is hardly excusable and it is severely limiting the extensibility of the game due to memory constraints, also the game is a little bland in itself and has to rely on mods to make it a complete experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome stuff that I think should really be part of the game that I did not see in the 1.0 list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Constructions taking time, limited use of revert functionality and instead the reliance on testing and simulations (aka. Kerbal Construction Time)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probes that make sense and antennas that are meaningful (aka. Remote Tech)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- An autopilot that allows you to get from A to B without having to eyeball and guesstimate your burns (mechjeb)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Procedural / scaleable parts, as it reduces clutter a lot\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crew ribbons and achievements (Final Frontier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Proper (at least some) re-entry heat simulation and handling (Deadly Reentry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Life support (make your pick, I prefer TACLS, but snacks might be more in line with the KSP theme)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is really just the things I think is still missing from the BASE game. The actual version I play has 71 mods - 14 part mods, mostly procedural, plane and USI parts, 3 science mods and 54 mods that enhance the way you play (mostly the editor tools, but some in flight tools as well) Not writing this to brag about it as I am sure there are many using way more mods than I do.. Just to illustrate, that most of the mods I use actually are intended to fill in for missing game features or to further enhance the user experience (either in editor or in flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my only concern with the game going to 1.0. Its not THAT awesome out of the box and 90% of the players will not go the extra mile to make it great by adding all these mods, especially as making these work needs a bit of technical know-how, looking through the log to figure out which ones you need to remove to make your game stable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
