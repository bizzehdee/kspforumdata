They are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Crossfeed must exist (no getting fuel magically after six steel plates, you have to actually run a fuel line there). The problems with KSP\u0027s lack of bidirectional crossfeed are mostly solved by CrossFeedEnabler, and it could be extended to make bi-directional fuel lines I\u0027m sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Non-STACK modes have a hard clamp of 1e-5 units per physics tick. If you request less than 1e-5 units, whether you are sending or receiving, your request is summarily refused. This means that if you twitch a reaction wheel only slightly, it will not produce anything because it doesn\u0027t request enough EC and thus gets a \u0022no EC left\u0022 response. If your antenna requests less than 0.0005 units of EC per tick, well, it thinks it\u0027s out of power because that\u0027s refused.
