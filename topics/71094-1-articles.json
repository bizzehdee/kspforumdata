When I finalized it I had done a full forum sweep (details in the talk page) so information on the wiki page (excluding KSP TOT as of now) was updated last on that day (17 Apr), so obviously anything that has changed since isn\u0027t included (nor are new tools after that date). If I do another forum sweep I\u0027ll add the date in the talk page or somewhere on the page itself to indicate when the latest forum sweep was done. In fact I\u0027ve just added a section on the talk page for just this reason, so if anyone does such a sweep, please update that section as well (it\u0027ll be obvious how).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, these external tools and calculators, unlike addons, don\u0027t really get the attention they deserve I feel (which is part of why I made the page) and judging from the little attention this part of the forum gets, including this thread, I fear that by the time people are aware that such a \u0022registry\u0022 of sorts exists, it will have already fallen into disrepair and will be so out of date it will be useless. A wiki without people using it and editing it is a dead wiki and it\u0027s also a shame that people now have to dig through the forums or search google to find all this stuff. Thus, I\u0027d ask players that use these tools and authors that develop them, to spread the word a bit wider so that at least people know that it\u0027s there. In the interest ofcourse of not replacing this forum section, I\u0027ve added a link at the top of the page that points to this Tools subsection of the forum, to maintain it as the bleeding edge source of tools and updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T12:54:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 12:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowstar","CreatedById":2521,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T14:22:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool, thanks.

This is a side-effect of having less offline tools, so when I made the first entries I didn\u0027t add categories there so that we wouldn\u0027t have a section split into 3-4 tables with 1-2 entries each - categories are only needed for clarity anyway. I \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E think of splitting the offline tools into subsections eventually, but I didn\u0027t get around to it then and the only reason to do it really would be so that it doesn\u0027t look from the toc like there\u0027s only deprecated offline tools - but as it is clearly unlikely someone will just jump to that conclusion without even taking a look and casual inspection proves otherwise (not to mention that it would take some planning to decide how to split them up - it isn\u0027t as clear as with the online tools), so I left it as it was. I would be surprised if someone only clicked on \u0022Deprecated\u0022 instead of \u0022Offline Tools\u0022 if offline tools is what they\u0027re looking for. I\u0027d advise against creating subsections for the offline tools as there aren\u0027t that many, but if you want to do the work go ahead.
