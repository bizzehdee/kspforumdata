(in sandbox you could search any mod and just use it including hit the run test button at random times just for fun)\n\nMods could have a reputation score, as they pass tests they get a higher reputation the higher the rep the more players get offered the test contract for the mod.\n\nTo me as a player these contract them have a purpose not just to me but to the community. Which take out a lot of the grind. \n\nAlso it opens up a vast amount of game scope meaning mod parts might need to introduce new contract types with new challanges to replicate certain bugs.\n\nJust something that keeps coming to mind wondering what others think now we are getting close to release."}]}
