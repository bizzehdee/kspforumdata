However, when using a fairing to make certain parts like engines it must be both heavily clipped and smaller than the size of the rocket itself (usually about two size classes. Necessitating rockets that use this technique to be massive, smaller fairings fix that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncreased size limits on fairings:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I understand why there in place, often it is advantageous to hide the fairing base in a rocket, necessitating a smaller fairing size. This makes the size limit on fairing a serious problem, particularly with aeroshells. A possible better improvement would be to remove the size limit, but make cost and weight increase exponentially to justify using a heavier more expensive fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural aeroshells/baseless fairings:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese would be like normal fairings, but without a base. They would be closeable at at the top and bottom and could be switched from building above the \u0022base\u0022 to building below it. The base is an attachment node for attaching the fairing to the craft. This would make building aerosols a simple preocess, rather than clipping fairings in a complicated and heavy way that looks awful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOption to make interstage nodes truss disappear, provided that the part in the nose is touching the fairing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly as described above, upon jettisoning the fairing the parts attached would be jettisoned automatically. Useful because the truss is ugly, would make mounting parachutes on aeroshells a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd most importantly, make each section of fairing resizable with a tweakable, rather than being forced to use the inaccurate mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-08T03:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one improvement that I wanted for fairings is to let us type the number of fairing height like how some advanced tweakables can be configured by typing numbers instead of slider.
