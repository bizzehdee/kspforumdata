However, from what I\u0027ve seen since .21, there seem to be a lot of pretty serious game design issues with career. Now, this is not (necessarily) a crisis--KSP is still an alpha--the Devs\u0027 apparent unwillingness to change even very simple things up (and a general lack of development time/resources to make said changes) these problems are more concerning. In other words, things need to be done right the first time through or they\u0027ll fall by the wayside. I would also add that the general development philosophy for career is \u003Cem\u003Edead on\u003C/em\u003E. The devs are (IMO) correct in focusing on new types of gameplay rather than, say, more planets insofar as that expands the game a whole lot more in the long run. But again, the devil is in the details. These problems rankle even more than usual since the mod community is generally doing a better job of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to go into it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIllogical Tech Tree Progression and Value:\u003C/strong\u003E Putting parts in the tech tree roughly in the order that they were introduced to the game is incredibly lazy. To do career mode correctly minimal playtesting of actual gameplay needs to happen. The most egregious example of this would be starting with small tanks and service module engines. Larger tanks are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E an upgrade. Rather, smaller tanks provide more flexibility since you can control the size of your stages more easily. You should start with a long 1.25m tank. not a quarter-sized one. Putting landing gear and wings in a separate node is another. And docking ports come too late. Being stuck with 1.25m parts is the perfect motivation for people to practice docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBad Part Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E Namely SAS. RCS and control surfaces are utterly worthless in stock except for the very last phases of docking. Also, reaction wheels, far and away the best control method are available much too early. And it\u0027s been 2 updates without a fix for the inline Rockomax 48. And the poodle is still useless compared to a 909 cluster after how many updates? This stuff has to be done iteratively or it\u0027ll never happen. And right now it\u0027s not being done. Electricity is currently a barely-resource that becomes very trivial, and with no reason to transmit faster, the later antennae are actually downgrades since they use more power. This is another example of a worrying lack of thought on the implementation of what is otherwise a good idea. And the science lab is only minimally useful at present. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1 and Only 1 Type of Optimal Mission:\u003C/strong\u003E Currently, one mission profile is rewarded above and beyond any other because of the transmission penalty: manned landing returning a capsule. This is stupid. There should be some mechanical aspects that encourage more than one mission type (especially with probes). It\u0027s silly to force people to do repeated landings-and-returns every time they unlock more science equipment. Currently there is no conceivable reason to use probes and no reason to try early 1-way unmanned missions. Furthermore, the progression of the tree is such that direct ascent missions to the Mun (and maybe Minmus) are almost nonnegotiable. Players should at least have a meaningful choice here. And it\u0027s a great opportunity to reward new players for mastering docking since that\u0027s the biggest challenge for most of us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience Part Bloat:\u003C/strong\u003E This is a result of the above issue. All-in-one missions are forced down our throats, and as a result landers are built to carry every possible piece of equipment imaginable. Rather than creating an opportunity to encourage multiple play styles there\u0027s one \u0027best\u0027 way that\u0027s fairly strongly enforced. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELack of Appropriate (and interesting) Early Challenges:\u003C/strong\u003E Look, getting into orbit is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E so hard that you should spoon feed people with soil samples on Kerbin. Instead of doing that why not reward suborbital and orbital flights? BTSM\u0027s atmosphere scanner and gravioli detector rework nails this approach FWW for planes and rockets respectively. If a player really can\u0027t get into orbit after doing the tutorials and applying some basic common sense they shouldn\u0027t be playing. KSP has to be accessible to people of all ages and skills, but there is a limit here. At a certain point it becomes too easy to the point of trivializing peoples\u0027 achievements. I got to orbit on my first try after doing the tutorials, and I imagine many of you did as well (and if not, it was probably for want of DV or because you didn\u0027t have enough information on TWR rather than from a fundamental technique issue). For what it\u0027s worth, I would have enjoyed KSP a lot more as a new player if there were more memorable challenges than just docking. The other stuff isn\u0027t especially difficult with sufficient brute-force/blindly fiddling with maneuver nodes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArbitrary Science (and Probably Contracts):\u003C/strong\u003E Science parts don\u0027t really do much to distinguish themselves from each other in how they play. It\u0027s excessively clicky. Also, stuff like goo should really be a once per planet deal rather than something repeated for every biome. And I\u0027m not encouraged by the stated plans for contracts. Build a ship with an arbitrary part and put it on a planet? That adds nothing whatsoever to the challenge or depth of game-play. I\u0027ll just tack on a hubmax (or whatever) and make a slightly larger and much uglier lander. Where is the challenge here exactly? Hopefully SQUAD does something a bit more complex than this (I still have hope) but I\u0027m not so sure how they \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA General Unwillingness to Make Iterative Changes to Game Balance:\u003C/strong\u003E Yes, I realize that SQUAD has other stuff to work on, but actually polishing the gameplay isn\u0027t something that can be done in one fell swoop once the game is \u0027feature complete.\u0027 A bit more polish and careful thought on small-scale game-play issues is probably in order between releases. Right now there\u0027s a lot of thought being but into large scale gameplay \u0027philosophy.\u0027 This is essential, and I support it (yes, even the ditching resources), but I\u0027m worried that it\u0027s coming at the expense of other things that aren\u0027t getting done. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime I\u0027m going to go off and play my career save now that my complaining is wrapped up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-01T05:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that the reason for the tech tree is you do 2 missions and unlock half the tech tree therefore the order tends to be irrelevent.

This is not to say they are pacifist, simply that their warlike days are probably far behind them. If their goal truly is curiosity about space and other worlds, it may make sense for them to want to go and see for themselves, leaving probes for those tasks that are too dangerous for Kerbals (like going to the planets for the Very First Time).

This does take some extra work, but that\u0027s part of what it takes to do game design right. I\u0027m not suggesting large changes every release cycle. Small changes each cycle (to the 48s, the old ASAS) are trivial time-wise and there\u0027s no excuse not to make them. Larger changes aren\u0027t going to happen every release (and I don\u0027t expect them to) but they do need to happen or too much winds up being built around bad mechanics, and can\u0027t be untangled from those bad mechanics because there are too many connected bits.

Just as an example (made up on the spot whilst i sit here at work at 7:00am after getting in at 4am last night after alot of booze) packing onto the side of your ship 3 seismic detectors which you have to setup in a triangle of a certain size with each point being 1km apart and then detonating some sort of explosive in the middle for the sensors to detect and then getting an actual reading so we can learn actual physical properties about a planets surface. This would add a whole new layer to things. Think about it, more EVA interaction, a use for rovers, a purpose to exploring the surface, the decision to take a rover with you or just huff it on foot. Again, I refer to Take on:Mars as whn you finish a contract on that you get a little insight to some of mars\u0027s properties.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-01T08:49:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2014 08:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by vetrox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
