However, when it released, performance was less than optimal. So terrible, that I asked for a refund. However, they have made FIVE patches in FOUR days! They even made a sincere apology for the game. Now, I believe in PlayWay, that they will make the game better. Moving on, what do YOU think of the game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
