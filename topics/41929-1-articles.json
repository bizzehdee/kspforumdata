I have no trouble getting the parts there, but I can\u0027t seem to get them close together. The closest I got two parts from each other was 35 km. At the same time I see youtube videos of people so easily getting all of their parts to land within 50 meters. How do you guys get your parts to land close to each other on the Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T18:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta be real precise with it. Make sure you target the thing you\u0027re landing near and burn accordingly. If you\u0027re about to pass over it just kill off all of your horizontal velocity and try to maneuver closer to it as you descend. Your descent profile should essentially be the exact same as the first one that landed the thing there, so it\u0027s all about consistency really.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T18:34:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a thread discussing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30527-Pinpoint-Landings!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epinpoint landings\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t need the exact same descent profile each time, especially if you\u0027re landing in vacuum. You just need to keep an eye on your trajectory and keep it so that you\u0027d be touching down beyond your intended target, then kill your horizontal velocity above it and land straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T18:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEveryting that Johnno just said \u002B use your navball. When you have something on the ground targeted you will have a marker on your nav ball. As that marker approaches the center of the ball start bleeding off your horizontal velocity. When it hits center go into full thrust until your horizontal velocity is gone and come straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T21:33:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will have to account for the Mun\u0027s rotation, but if you place your periapsis at 5 km over the target, and cut your speed and watch in map view, you should be able to land relatively close (under 500m if you\u0027re good). If you aren\u0027t close enough but low, burn at a 45 degree angle towards the target (set as target and use the purple circle), then burn directly up to keep your horizontal velocity but stopping you from hitting the ground. I\u0027d say it just takes practice to figure out exactly what you want to do, and this applies for almost everything in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
