A very common issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose either an external program, or a plugin that enables you to delete parts from the game itself (now, I know literal application of this might not work because they\u0027re loaded, but it could at least mark them or hide them from the part list.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, something could be done to facilitate pruning which is essential when you mod your game and don\u0027t want to end up with enormous GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame should work for stock parts. Some of them I never ever use and they just clog up the working area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe someone proposed this earlier, I don\u0027t really know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T20:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a little unsure of whether or not you\u0027re aware that this exists, since you pretty much used the exact wording it is named for, but here goes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/91365-script-autopruner-v11\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s an external tool, works independent of KSP version, is completely content agnostic (as it works by renaming file extensions), and its effects are 100% reversible if you accidentally break something while experimenting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vgamble","CreatedById":159872,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-17T22:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u00A0may wanna try out\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/96245-nablabla/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002296245\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/96245-nablabla/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@nablabla\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u0027s wonderfull tool, and also talk to him about your idea.\u00A0He had the skill to create such a program, that is, he knows how it all works under the hood. Perhaps he will think how to do what you suggest. Mod that allows you to mark unwanted parts right in the game, and save paths of parts as prnls is\u00A0great idea, but its too obvious also, I think if it was\u00A0be not very difficult,\u00A0then someone would have already created it. But again, if it possible, such a tool would be super usefull.
