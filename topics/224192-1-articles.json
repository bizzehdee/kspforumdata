While 2\u0027s effects look much higher quality, with more polish, the way you can see the vessel through the plasma makes it look much less intense. On the other hand, 1\u0027s effects like much more rough and janky, but they convey the intensity of re entry better. I think the transparency through the plasma really takes away from the effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
