Mostly because i noticed the introduction of new music that perfectly suited the KSP theme. i know from 5 years of experience from this game that music while playing brings a whole new level of magic to the spaceflight experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now I\u0027m left with two questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. where can i download that new music? XD\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Are\u00A0there any plans that the developers of KSP would produce a full soundtrack to the game, instead of the royalty free music we have now? In addition, are there any players that are also interested in seeing this become a reality?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrailer (listen to the music!):\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPCMmqA0RUE?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-24T23:01:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/24/2016 11:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by justspace103\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-24T23:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main theme is a custom composition, the rest of the in game tunes are Kevin MacLeod cc music.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince this song contains phrases if the main theme, I\u0027d conclude the music is original. \u00A0Hence, not likely available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaytheDragon","CreatedById":149656,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-24T23:46:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222863507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022152563\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221480028388\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264088\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022justspace103\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, justspace103 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, are there any players that are also interested in seeing this become a reality?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am interested in seeing this become a reality.
