I\u0027m a Korean speaking KSP user in Australia and I\u0027ve had this idea of squad releasing a korean KSP. I mean....... there are at least 12,000 koeran-speaking users, and it\u0027ll be good of squad to release a korean version of KSP. And the transalting? Probably I can take part in it, partly because it\u0027ll be fun and partly because I know it\u0027s a nice thing to do in my freetime ^ . ^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo Squad, please consider this.
