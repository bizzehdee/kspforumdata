During this localization process, some of our devs had to learn in depth the insides of the KSPedia to come up with a solution for its localization. We still can\u2019t announce which languages we will include, though, but \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewe would definitely love to hear your opinion\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ENotice the last part I marked bold. There has not been much response to this in the thread itself, and I have not seen any formal/official inquiry from Squad anywhere in the forum. I don\u0027t want Squad to get the incorrect impression that there is no need for KSP to support other languages.

The above does not specify if they mean a translation of the texts in KSP, support for other characters sets, or support for other keyboard layouts - localization normally means all of those, so let\u0027s talk about all of them.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-26T17:29:10Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2016 05:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by swjr-swis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-26T18:13:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a Latin non-English keyboard is not hard.
