Unfortunately, merging together threads opened on different subjects is never a good solution (would completely spoil every discussion), I\u0027m not doing any of that.

There is nothing really definitive yet, apart the decision from Squad (not moderators) to close those language sections. At the moment, there\u0027s a lot of confusion due to all those threads out of the proper place where they stayed. To reduce confusion, threads no more current have to be let down. You may have noted however, not all were closed yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther languages had nothing more than a single thread with the old forum. For general discussion, that is certainly what will develop with any language (but those on their own subsections). But it\u0027s true there are specific subjects of interest deserving their own thread. One such, IMHO, is about translating KSP to other languages. Such threads however should not \u0022belong\u0022 to any specific language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe General discussion threads will not be killed, there won\u0027t be any other \u0022best thread\u0022 to make them go. Currently, opening new threads is allowed for any forum member, and I hope it could stay that way. But should the subject of any new thread not warrant a separate one, a decision will have to be made if its contents are to be merged in the \u0022General Discussion\u0022 one, or the thread closed after it served its purpose. On the contrary, if a \u0022General Discussion thread\u0022 brings an interesting subject, it may be evaluated to allow that subject to be the theme of one specific thread. Probably best with some suggestions from the international community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut one thing, certainly, to avoid even more confusion than is currently on this section, we can\u0027t let complete freedom to open threads on whatever as it was previously. I\u0027m already having trouble to find the worthy threads in the mass, would like if users could still find where to post something in their own language.
