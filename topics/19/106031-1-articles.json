So if you\u0027re young: go to school. If you\u0027re already older, even adult perhaps I can only give you the same advice: go to school. Many schools offer adult education during the evening hours. And if they don\u0027t I am certain they can tell you where you can.\n\nDon\u0027t be ashamed, just ask. The only dumb question is the one you do not ask."},{"CreatedByName":"LN400","CreatedById":140595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:48:20Z","Content":"Look on Youtube for language lessons. There are a great number of videos that will give you a good start in learning to read, write and speak English.\n\nStart with the easy things, like basic words and phrases. Read and always ask yourself \u0022why do they write it like that?\u0022. If you find words you have not learned, ask us here or use a translating dictionary.\n\nLast tip: Use small cards to write down words and phrases. In English on one side and your own language on the other. Have the cards with you all the time and read them until you know the words by heart."},{"CreatedByName":"sam mon","CreatedById":142048,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:50:30Z","Content":"thanks\n\nlike idea the cards .[i will!\\[arrow-10x10.png\\](http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png)](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) do it ."},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:28:24Z","Content":"Except school (which is the best idea), you can also get some private classes. There are also numerous free online classes you can take, as well as YouTube channels dedicated to learning English.\n\nBuying an English phrase book (usually available in tourist shops) is a good idea, but that won\u0027t teach you the grammar. You really need tutoring to get the grammar which is really not that hard. English is one of the easiest languages to learn. It lacks many things other languages have so people can learn it a lot faster."},{"CreatedByName":"Mehak50","CreatedById":130744,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T15:49:14Z","Content":"You should go to whatever method you prefer to use while learning.

Also try [www.wordrefrence.com](www.wordrefrence.com) . I recommend practice. It is a fact that you will learn it by just being around it. Remember that you will understand it before you can speak it well."}]}
