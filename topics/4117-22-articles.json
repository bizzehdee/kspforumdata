Perhaps lifting-only ones, as to approximate lifting body with stock aerodynamics, but that\u0027s it. And why would you want full cargo on return anyway? You could probably adjust wing COL a bit, but otherwise, canards should no longer be needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the airlock, what do you mean by \u0022features needed to make it work authentically\u0022? The real thing doesn\u0027t even have an extending port. If you mean internal crew transfer, it\u0027d probably come someday, right now, it can be done with Crew Mainfest.

Both of those mods punted on the aerodynamics and just make the wings extremely overpowered so that the shuttle basically floats. They do not fly or glide in any traditional sense. Its very tempting to do that, and these shuttles exhibit infini-glide fairly severely anyway, but they still at least behave like a spaceplane for the most part. Take the canards off and you\u0027ll see there is no pitch control, you can ramp up the strength of the elevators as much as you want, but they just don\u0027t function well enough because they\u0027re close to the CoM on a tail-heavy shuttle. I spent 2 days adjusting the Center\u0027s of Lift and Mass when I redid the wings in 3.2 to have separate elevators again, and I definitely tried to eliminate the canards - it won\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a. Both shuttles are functional out of the SPH in traditional take-offs. The Odyssey only has fuel for a short demo flight, but the intrepid has air-breathing engines with enough juice to get an unloaded shuttle up to about 18k and 1200m/s, which is more than enough to let the OMS engines boost it into orbit. It also gives it good range on re-entry, so being able to control pitch is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Yes, I was talking about crew transfer and management, and being able to make multiple airlocks per part. I can probably tweak the bay model to make the airlock a separate thing you can snap in, though I am not sure the real shuttles ever removed theirs, since it was the \u003Cem\u003Eairlock\u003C/em\u003E and the only way to do emergency EVAs. I have tons of other stuff to do though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The real shuttle absolutely had an extended docking port sleeve it used to attach to the ISS, they\u0027re called Pressurized Mating Adapters, and they were attached to the nodes on the iSS by the shuttle or station arms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t assume that a player\u0027s station will have a docking adapter that could reach a docking port inside the shuttle bay, and the robot arms are not reliable enough to consider setting them up manually, so the only choice left is an extending port. It\u0027s entirely optional and people can make their own solution out of stock or other modded parts, but I certainly don\u0027t have a better solution in mind\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T08:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUploaded some new screens and made a new album;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/FkSYQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
