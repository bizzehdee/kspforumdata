Those scores are decent enough to play KSP. The fact that you had no stuttering on cloud gate but stuttering in KSP sort of implies that the fault is more with KSP than your computer.

Mine is about 4600 on a Core i5 Ivy Bridge (4 cores compared to your 16) and it plays KSP extremely smoothly, but I have a newer graphics card (GTX 950) that puts my graphics score in the 15,000\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s still not exactly clear what the problem is. If it were me, I\u0027d start experimenting with removing components. What happens if you take out all but 1 RAM DIMM? (8GB is enough to run KSP -- honestly 128 GB is complete overkill) What if you restrict KSP to only 4 threads on one of your CPUs by setting its process affinity?
