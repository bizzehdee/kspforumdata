From a list of approx. 21 sites (almost 30 if you include some additions), scientists selected 8 sites:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Jezero Crater; 2. Columbia Hills; 3. NE Syrtis Major Planum; 4. Eberswalde Crater; 5. SW Melas Chasma; 6. Nili Fossae Trough; 7. Nili Fossae Carbonate; 8.

Also, from what I understood Jezero Crater is kinda rough for navigation. Also, only Eberswalde and the two Nili Fossae sites don\u0027t require the Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) system, a new EDL technology which hasn\u0027t been approved yet. Also, Mawrth Vallis is an ExoMars rover landing site candidate too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some fast facts on the mission: final 4 landing sites selected in Jan 2017 and final landing site (\u002B backup) in Jul 2018. Launch in Jul/Aug 2020, arrival and landing in Feb 2021. EDL same as Curiosity (powered descent, skycrane). Then, in 1.5 years it will traverse up to 20 km and acquire a minimum of 20 samples to be returned to Earth on a future, yet to be approved mission.
