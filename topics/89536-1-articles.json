I know that you need programs like OpenTrackIR and Tridef 3D but I can\u0027t seem to figure out how to use those and get it to work. My rift works fine in the demos but doesn\u0027t at all in the games. I know that DayZ Standalone doesn\u0027t support the DK2 but I\u0027ve seen some videos of people using it with those programs. Any of you guys know how to get the rift to work with other games like DayZ? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
