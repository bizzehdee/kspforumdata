IMO the mass of the part should be not just the antenna itself but also the transmitting and receiving equipment, the wiring, circuitry, etc., and the structure involved if the antenna is deployable and/or trainable. Thus the antenna itself might make up only a small portion of the mass. A similar thing operates with RCS: we have to abstract the mass of an RCS pod as including also the fuel piping, RCS wiring and control systems, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The ranges seem rather high to me, especially if using the \u0022root\u0022 rangemodel (imperfect, but closer than classic). In particular, IRL spacecraft can get away with tiny antennae because of the DSN (as mentioned above); to model that I think you should rather decrease the ranges for those antennae but have the mission control omni have a much longer range. Under the root model the max range between KSC and a node will be rNode \u002B sqrt(rNode * rKSC), to a max of 1000 * rNode (or 100 * rNode if Node is an omni). For example do you really think one Syncom could actually have talked to another, rather than requiring those massive ground stations?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Might make sense to upscale the parts, given the general bent of RO. For example, it\u0027d make sense that the Voyager HGA would be one of the medium size ones, say, rather than the huge one. A decent 1.6x so that the GX-128 would be 2m at the base would work here, I think. (Also, why give the 3.5m dish a longer range than the 5m one?) This would allow some level of space-based comms infrastructure, more than used in real life--heck, TDRS, for near-Earth manned missions, uses 4-5m dishes!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Again, we\u0027re bit by the problem that KSP/RT2 cares about range at a uniform bit-rate, whereas TDRSS needs a much higher bitrate than Voyager and so has larger HGAs and more powerful transmitters despite being in GEO!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Building off 2 and 3 I\u0027d suggest rejiggering electricity usage at the high end. (Also, do the DF-RD and DP-10 really use 0 watts!?) TDRSS-K has a rated ~1700W, IIRC; some of that is bus, obviously, but I\u0027d say we should abstract an antenna\u0027s power cost as the cost of the entire communication system, so it would be reasonable to claim, say, 750W per dish (leaving 200W for the bus itself). For a high-end-medium (or low-end large?) dish, I think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T22:37:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Believe it or not, those masses are actually higher than in real life. The 5m TDRS dishes come in at only 20kg. I more than quadrupled that to get the mass of the whole comm assembly. I also figured a small percentage of the mass (wiring, controllers..etc) would be allocated to the bus, but I may change that. All of the masses are based on real life numbers (I did some serious digging for those).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I did a little testing in game, and these are still a work in progress. I want two things to happen. 1: I want to reduce the range of omnis so that they are basically useless beyond MEO. and 2: group antennas into range categories more or less like this : LEO, anything up to GEO, anything up to the Moon, anywhere in the Earth-Moon SOI, all of the inner planets, and then finally, all of the solar system. What I can\u0027t do is make omni\u0027s in range NOT communicate with each other, so I think reducing their ranges and increasing KSP range makes sense. (I\u0027m a little unclear about how MultipleAntennaMultiplier works, but it doesn\u0027t seem to make much sense to me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I don\u0027t really think any size rescaling is needed. Based on my research 3.5-4m is pretty much the largest size for interplanetary probes, (the exception being Galileo\u0027s 4.8m folding dish) and the TDRSS use the massive 5m dishes (the GX-128), which are really the largest that you\u0027d need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. They do as of now, but obviously I\u0027m going to fix that. I\u0027m going to do some in-game experiments to figure out how much power is reasonable for each class of antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-07T23:11:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Hah, wow. I stand corrected, and kudos\u002Bthanks for all that research. I know how time-consuming (and hard) it can be! (Do you have data on transmitter mass? I could find antenna mass, but not that.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Which rangemodel are you using in RT2 settings? If you\u0027re not using Root that could be part of the issue. As for the multiple antennas thing, it works like this. For a given node N, compute its max omni range as follows: range = (single longest-ranged antenna\u0027s range) \u002B MultipleAntennaMultiplier * SUM(all other omni antennas\u0027 ranges).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to suggest 0.25 for that, but recently I\u0027ve been converted to just using 1.0...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I\u0027m aware craft don\u0027t use dishes larger than that in real life; what I\u0027m suggesting is that it might be worth allowing the player the option of, instead of RL\u0027s approach of giant groundstation network \u002B small spacecraft HGA, put more of the infrastructure in space. Further, one might want to use those large dishes *on physical groundstations*, rather than just setting up groundstations in the cfg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Ah, ok. I\u0027d suggest something like 1W for the smallest whip omni, scaling to about 150-200W for the largest omni; then 100-1000W for dishes? (Or if point 3 is acted upon, 2-3kW max). Particularly given antenna mass, as in RL it makes sense that the bottleneck early on would be power use, not mass--you can put a giant transmitter on a satellite, but how do you power it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-08T00:02:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1.

I couldn\u0027t care less about how other KSP pilots fly theirs, this is RSS/RO afterall, so automation it is. I do understand that MechJeb is simple and when free time allows KOS is planned, but until that point, the answer is still NO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am with Nathan though. The KM_Gimbal/MechJeb issue should be looked at as KM_Gimbal gives a user much more control than one has otherwise. Maybe even have the ability to have different \u002Byaw/-yaw (and pitch) values. Would come in handy for the Atlas Vernier Engines. so that it doesn\u0027t appear to burn through the fuel tank!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T17:56:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou keep saying this.

Or you can use the \u0027%\u0027 symbol, which will edit the line if it exists, or add if it doesn\u0027t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERT2 comes with a cfg for AIES antennas, so it should still be \u0022@\u0022, no?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-12T04:53:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDragon01:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour profile will depend on the kind of launcher you\u0027re using.

Change range multiplier to 10 and consumption multiplier to 0.05. Also change multiple antenna line to, well, something between 0.25 and 1.0, depending on taste (taste being, how much extra do you want to get out of using multiple omni antennae on the same craft?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebrooklyn666: My motto is always, release what you got. Cilph, as he freely admits, is *always* rewriting RT2... :]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Looks cool. I wonder at the Comlar 1 though, compared to the other Terameter-class dishes it seems a bit too good? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. First of all, AFAIK RT2 doesn\u0027t come out-of-the-box supporting AIES antennae; a user has posted configs for that. RT2 does have its own copies of AIES parts with RT2 names; those have out-of-the-box configs. Second, the MM patch you posted has some syntax issues. If you\u0027re trying to modify a MODULE node of a particular name, the format is @MODULE[ModuleRTAntenna] {, not the way you have it. What will actually happen for the code you have, is that @MODULE tells MM to modify the first module it finds, and @name = ModuleRTAntenna will tell it to change the name line of whatever module it found first to name = ModuleRTAntenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, for each @PART[] line you should do @PART[blah]:Final so your changes get applied *after* everything else.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darshiki","CreatedById":104828,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T23:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I have been playing the realism overhaul with the RFTS engines and pretty much everything on the list.
