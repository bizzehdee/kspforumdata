And the fact that I don\u0026#39;t read about this significant drop of performance anywhere else lets me assume that this is not a general problem with the addon but something locally on my system or install. But to be sure, and before i invest a lot of time investigating the problem I wanted to quickly hear what you guys have to say about it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI started using RSS and RO a couple of weeks ago (installed via CKAN) and initially I enjoyed it very much. That was until I hit crafts with a part count around 75-80 parts. then the framerate dropped dramatically and an in-game second now takes several realtime seconds to simulate. An 8-9 minute flight to orbit easily takes 25-30 realtime minutes now. And as you can guess, it\u0026#39;s not fun anymore :-)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPartly because of this performance issue I upgraded my system last weekend to a brand new Core i7 6700K overclocked to run at 4.7Ghz with a Geforce GTX 680 (i kept the graphics card from the previous PC for now). this helped with the problem but the difference between \u0022stock KSP\u0022 and \u0022KSP with RSS/RO\u0022 is still night and day. Without RSS/RO I can easily launch crafts with 75-80 parts with no problem (even larger craft with 100\u002B parts are no problem). It\u0026#39;s 60 fps all the way to orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbut with RSS/RO installed the 75-80 parts craft is down to around 30fps and the time indicator on the top left corner is going yellow.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nso now i\u0026#39;m wondering if this performance drop is just something that comes with the increased complexity of RO and needs to be accepted (and has been accepted and is therefore not discussed on the forums, therefore i couldn\u0026#39;t find any information about it?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nor is there something fishy with my install? Is it unusual to experience this significant performance drop off and is it therefore worth my time investigating this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nthanks in advance!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nbest regards\u003Cbr\u003E\nMax\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T13:05:26Z","Content":"\nCan one land on the MKS \u0026#39;carrier\u0026#39; deck with RSS/RO...
