Why? Becouse it doesn\u0027t matter how you get the science points (doing expiriments, writing EVA reports, etc) to be able to advance the techonology. What only matters is how much science points you get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I suggest spliting the whole science into multiple areas (examples below) where different expiriments or activities will generate different amount of science points for different areas. And finally for unlocking acces to certain parts you will require certain amount of research points gathered in certain science fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suggest including some expiriments which actually generate science points based on expiriment duration. I\u0027m aware of SQUAD opinion about timed expiriments and how they could be spiled by time acceleration. But for some I think this is still suitable. Look for some examples below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let me give you some exapmles of science fields along with their description and which expiriments should generate science points in theese fields:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Aerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics coveres the development of aerodynamical parts like wings, controll surfaces, nose cones, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor generating science points in this area player must spend their time flying their crafts in planets atmosphere. There could be certain condition for science points in this area to be generating to avoid cheating like minimal speed, science points generation starts only after certain time, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Thermodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermodynamics is a field which covers development of parts which can survive and work under different temperature conditions (highl\u00C3\u201E\u00C2y heated parts during reentry, extreme cold of space, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo generate points in this area you need to expose your parts to extreme temperatures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Land transportation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand transportation area coveres things about creating land vehicles like rovers and their parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo generate points in this area you need to use your land based units to travel great distances over land\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Naval transportation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaval transportation coveres development of naval vesels - if they get included in game eventualy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar as land transportation you need to travel gread distances over water to generate science points in this area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Air propultion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir propultion coveres development of atmospheric engines like prop engines and jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou generate points in this area over time by using the air propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocketry coveres development of rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs in air propultion the more time you spend on using rocket engines more science points you earn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Electronics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectronics coveres everything from basic lights to electromotrs, to electricity generation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou earn science points in this are by using electronics devices over time\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Computer science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComputer science coveres computer development and all systems that rely on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou earn points in this area by using computerized devices over time or preforming certain actions with computerized devices.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Robotry - if it gets implemented into game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERobotry coveres development of robotic arms, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitialy you earn points in this are by doing developments in electronics area but later with the usage of robotics components.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Comunication\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComunication coveres development of various comunication arays and data transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou gain science points in this are by preforming various data transferes etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Science analasys \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience analasys coveres development of various scientific instruments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou gain science points in this area by preforming expiriments or observations with existing science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure we could include even more fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywhay spliting the current research into multiple fields will give reserch more greater depth and will actually require players to do specific expiriments to be able to progress in specific science fields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now a word about the expiriments (with tihs I mean things like expose goo to space, take temperature measurments, etc.):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that expirments should have to be repeated several times. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach time you will get some science points in apropriate fields. The amount of gathered points should depend on where you preform such expiriments (enviroment afecting expiriment) and it should still be a bit random at the same time (you can get betwen Min-Max amount of science points per expiriment so you are actually simulating sucessfull or unsucsessfull expiriment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course after some time when you learn everything that can be lerned from certain expiriment repeating it is no longer usefull asn it no longer generates any science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I understand that implementing something like this is far from easy but I think it would greatly improve the game in comparison to now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stijnovic","CreatedById":57858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T11:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes! I like this idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think there should be a science tree similar to the tech tree. This gives much more meaning to the science. In stead of going to Mun and do as much science on the way as possible, you would would go to Mun for a specific reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a science tree gives a very good overview of the science you have already done. Because right now, you have to remember for each science instrument on which location you have used it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing: Right now, for science it only matters WHERE you do it, but not at which speed, time of day (light or dark), what type of ship and what size this ship is. Also do you get points for special manoeuvers like staging, docking, landing, EVA-ing (and I don\u0027t mean just on the ladder for a second and then return to your capsule), etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nobody","CreatedById":64303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T15:50:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that specific types of science would be a much better system.
