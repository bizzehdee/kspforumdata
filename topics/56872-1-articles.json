For Mao, he had a great contribution on liberating China (KMT used to have chance, but, uhh, they led up to their own failure), but also made lots of mistake(including ignoring the scientific truth of population and causing the burst of it) and held some dark political struggle to ensure his rule. And, the disaster GCR was caused by his political attack on Liu Shaoqi and misjudgement(although most of the disorder was made by \u0022Gang of Four\u0022 but Mao was also to be blamed). Historians today think that he has 70 percent of credit and 30 percent of fault. As for Deng, he survived the GCR and led the \u0022reform and opening-up\u0022 and directly led to the China\u0027s place in the world today. But he also bring the chances of corruption. Then is the burst of anger mainly from students(students are always the vanguards of the time, from the 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B74 movement to 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B74... Don\u0027t know how to comment on it.) then is the 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B74.

It\u0027s partially because, well, China has been following Deng from then on and never get rid of corruption problem. Though, the current leader, Xi Jinping has been actively tackling these problems. For the era of Hu, China is speeding up to develop in the \u0022Golden Ten Years\u0022 while US is focusing on the Middle East so I guess the anti-corruption seemed to be like the secondary task then... Well, just a guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother problem is the advancing of Internet and the drop of public trust because of some bad incidents.

Each generation is supposed to learn from the past and improve. That\u0027s why as a human race we\u0027re closer than ever to coming together. There are still major issues to tackle though. One of China\u0027s is human rights. Not 200 years ago, or even 30 years ago, but today. Frank Wolf wasn\u0027t making things up, even if his way of fighting it was probably misguided. And today\u0027s modern world is vastly different than when Apollo-Soyuz happened.

However I seriously doubt that anyone in USA government really cares about it seeing what is the foreign policy of the USA for decades - the real reason, as you said, is fear that China will steal even more American know-how and technology. It\u0027s completely understandable, though using humar rights argument seems to be just hypocrisy and (IMHO) is just a tool in a diplomacy, nothing more. And yes, the cold war is no more but close cooperation between two nations with nuclear warheads targeted at their cities did happen. It was just a political stunt and it didn\u0027t last long but it did happened and helped to ease the tension. I don\u0027t see any reason for which it can\u0027t happen again, for example with American astronauts going to Tiangong for a few days or with Shenzhou-Orion/Dragon/other spacecraft rendez-vous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s not about disliking the Chinese, its about disliking the policies of their government and how they treat their people.

That is great. The day when China is a part of the free world 100% will be amazing. What we can all do now is to befriend and encourage the Chinese people we do know and let them know we\u0027re thinking of them. But we absolutely want the governments of the free world to keep putting pressure on their government to reform too..[/quote\u0027]\u003Cp\u003EI agree completely that everyone would be probably better off if China westernizes more - everyone in the West, that is.

There are a lot of examples of such behaviour when we talk about superpowers - for instance, USA didn\u0027t ratify International Criminal Court, American Convention on Human Right, Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and other treaties, not to mention killing people perceived as a threat by drones completely ignoring the sovereignty of a local government.

GPS is used by the military primarily and there is no accident in this that China is building its own GPS system. Space exploration was always fueled by fear of war and crazy military ideas.

But the problems happend at where we begin to build the basic part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHighschool education is where the flaws appear. For example, doing laboratory and experiment is one of the most basic fractions of learning high school physics, but under test-orientated system, kids have almost no chance to do labs and are never required to write welldone lab reports and data analysis, which they would only be able to learn after they enter universities. It would be already too late for students beginning to learn the basic method of discovering science in university, because then not everyone would be educated to have the thought of cherishing the significance of valid experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is only one facet of the many flaws.
