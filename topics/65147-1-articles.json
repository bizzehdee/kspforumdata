They seem to have lost their magnetism and will to connect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a post a while back about going into the save file and resetting the status of the dock port, which had mixed results for me. It didn\u0027t seem to help most of the ships I had in orbit, except 2 that ended up attached, but not docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnybody have any thoughts on how I can get them to work correctly again? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditional info - version .23 KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddins: MechJeb, Kethane and external launch pad, all for .23 of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
