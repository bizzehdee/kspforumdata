I\u0027m honestly surprised to hear you say that. We used special super powerful RCS ports just for MTV docking, and actually I thought it was pretty easy to dock considering the mass of the pieces. It\u0027s quite a heavy thing after all, and even a soyuz capsule takes hours to dock in real life. \n\u003E \n\u003E I suppose if you are looking for an even faster MTV docking experience, feel free to turn up the power on CMES/Pod/Control\\_RCS\\_Blocks/Port\\_R1 - copy.cfg ... otherwise known as \u0022High Power R1 Linear RCS Port (x2)\u0022. You should be able to go up to thruster power 20 before it becomes a problem for anything else. Those pieces are rather well balanced for RCS.\n\u003E \n\u003E In fact the 75% scale of the pack was chosen in part to place a real world VAB limit on the size of Chaka rockets.\n\nHi YANFRET\n\nChecking back on the RCS matter. Just the other night i tried altering the cfg as you suggested, and the result was great. I dont remember the exact values now but i can tell i got em right on the first try and docking with Mechjeb autopilot went buttery smooth in a matter of less than 3 minutes. I tried docking the MTV B and C vehicles in a 165 km orbit and it was great. As soon as im on my pc I\u0027ll write the values i used. \n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"YANFRET","CreatedById":90547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T16:15:00Z","Content":"Cool!
