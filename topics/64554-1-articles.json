This Congressional hearing, in which several highly influential lawmakers expressed their support for a NASA crew to flyby Mars in 2021, was held on Thursday with an full committee (Instead of a usual subcommittee, full committee hearing aren\u0027t that common and usually reserved for projects/bills of immediate interest, ex. Obamacare) listening to people testify, among whom was a former top NASA offical, who highlighted the benifits of a Mars flyby mission in 2021 and the feasibility. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA quote from USA today...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022USAToday\u0022 data-cite=\u0022USAToday\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESmith, chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which oversees NASA programs, said flying two astronauts around Mars without putting them on the surface would have several advantages.\u003Cp\u003EIt would provide an important test of the ambitious Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion multi-purpose crew vehicle that NASA is building for its Mars mission scheduled for the 2030s.

Also, in the hearing, a majority of repsentatives proclaimed their support for it, wanting the USA to overtake the Chinese in space leadership. Although many of the government officals a the meeting were in support of the manned Mars flyby plan, several Congressmen voiced their doubts, calling it \u0022too ambitous\u0022, \u0022too risky\u0022, and \u0022we should spend money elsewhere\u0022. However, with an majority of House Representatives supporting such an proposal, it stands a nice chance of it becoming reality. Political party rivalry was not brought up at this debate (Hey, atleast NASA is something that both the Republicans and Democrats support).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce Congress has voted in support of a mission to flyby Mars, it will likely not be cancelled. The average US Senator serves around 13-15 years in office, while the average Representative serves around 10-11 years in office, and incoming \u0022Freshman\u0022 politicans (Those serving their first term) often have very similar views or are highly influenced by the outgoing politicans of the same party.. NASA will fly past Mars in 2021, or in 7 years. For once, American political boondoggery, corruption, and broken elections may actually be a good thing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if this bill is improved, I can see alot of ambitous NASA projects being tossed out the window. For one, the NASA EML-2 spacestation around the Moon will likely be launched earlier, as the agency (And Boeing and Lockheed, it\u0027s two greatest partners, or, atleast, the most known ones) has already stated previously that it wants this spacestation to test life support technologies for deep space voyages to Mars and to act as a precursor mission-I mean, spacestation to Mars, a role originally intended to be filled by the ISS. This manned deep space outpost could provide us with a plethora of data on human spaceflight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in another light, like the novel \u003Cem\u003EVoyage\u003C/em\u003E (By Stephen Baxter), I can see Planetary Science being strapped of funds along with Earth science. We may have to phase out Cassini, perhaps limit our role in the JWST telescope, cancel most of the Discovery Program, cut funding for research into the ATLAST telescope around a Earth-Sun lagrange point, cut funding for a Uranus orbiter (Already under concept reviews), and god forbid, cut the \u003Cem\u003EEuropa Mission\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful what you wish for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUNRELATED\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Hypothetical Timeline\u003Cp\u003E2014 - EFT-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2017 - SLS test launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2018 - Manned Launch?
