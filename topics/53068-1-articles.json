I bought this game back in april after seeing a youtube video of it. I have loved space exploration since I was a kid and have been having a blast. I am an electrical engineer and used to be a navy nuke....so I love math. Up to now I have been just trial and error in sandbox mode and have only ever got one rocket into orbit without enough fuel to do anything but de-orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy methodology has been to build a rocket that looks like it might make it and tweak until i get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now that i recently discovered career mode I have shied away from zany contraptions to mathematically working out the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been trying to figure out how to design a craft out of a given set of parts based on the numbers...I don\u0027t want to be given a craft....the fun to me is coming up with it(even though others may already have the answer) and it seems like most tutorials have example designs to derive future designs from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESO. If I know the DV I need to achieve my goal I have a starting point. I can calculate my TWR. I can calculate the DV the craft is capable of. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs design simply a TWR high enough and a capable DV? At the beginning of the career I have no staging option so my first attempt was a surprisingly stable pencil shaped craft with a TWR of 1.15 and a DV of 4800 I think it would have made orbit if I had cut the engines once the peak was out of the atmosphere and waited until I got out of the atmosphere to try to burn to expand my orbit....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway...any guidance? am I on the right track or am I missing something? I feel like I am missing something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any guidance and thanks to the Dev\u0027s for a great game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T06:25:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027ve got the right idea, 4800m/s should be enough to achieve orbit around Kerbin. And for a simple rocket, yep. Just TWR, and delta V. You\u0027ll need electricity of coarse, and bigger things need reaction wheels to turn about in space with any speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETip: use the map view to tell when your rocket has a trajectory that will clear the atmosphere. Then, when you\u0027re near the top of that curve, it\u0027s a very good time to start burning to orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the kerbal forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the start of the career, do your science with sub orbital flights, eventually you\u0027ll unlock the parts that allow easy orbitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027d suggest a mod to calculate those numbers for you. Makes your life alot easier.

Good information. Tonight I figure it how electricity works in game. By sub orbital do you just mean the rockets that don\u0027t make it to orbit? Or planes...? I have never built a plane.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr8monkey","CreatedById":76199,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T22:01:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-14T22:17:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/14/2013 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fr8monkey\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
