TOPERs while they were in a good position for it.\u00A0 These 2 ships have very good encounters and should be able to capture without much of a burn.\u00A0 Which is good because, despite being launched several days apart, they\u0027re predicted now to arrive at Sarnus at exactly the same time.\u00A0 Hopefully, floating point errors over the coming couple of years will spread them out somewhat :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/CnXom4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002205-01 Tweaked Slate Encounters\u0022

mid-course tweaks over the next 100 days but none of them could get a pre-Sarnus encounter with Slate to save their souls.\u00A0 But that turns out to be OK because capturing by thrust alone at Sarnus is in the range of 800-1000m/s, not as hard as Jool, and the ships were all built with this in mind.\u00A0 Using Slate was always considered langiappe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly

a bit of housecleaning.\u00A0 They had scads of stuff in space they really didn\u0027t need---some tracked asteroids in interesting orbits but not interesting enough to actually visit, some ancient probes launched in the 1st few months of the OPTC\u0027s operations, and 8 too many flags on Minmus.\u00A0 The probes had been maintained in hopes of getting easy money on repositioning them but only 1 such contract had ever happened.\u00A0 Meanwhile, the universe was getting a bit wobbly.\u00A0 Something had to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/BqyPw8\u0022

time, all went well.\u00A0 The 2.5m section of the transfer stage has a bunch of experiments to use in orbit, and then it will deorbit the lander.\u00A0 The lander is a 2.5m heatshield with 1.25m

was going on, the OPTC was making money in its sleep by reusing probes alreadly in position.\u00A0 Both MagSat Minmus and SENTINEL Kerbin kept sucking in the cash.\u00A0 So by this point in time, the

Neidon.\u00A0\u00A0UE-1 and NE-1 will soon be doing their mid-course tweaks, after which the Jool\u00A0relays will ariive.\u00A0 After that, it will be just a short 1-year wait until SE-1 starts arriving and things should start getting interesting.\u00A0\u00A0And with so much money on-hand, the OPTC\u00A0has enough to do some\u00A0ambitious stuff at Sarnus and Urlum after\u00A0their 1st

mid-course tweak of the NE-1 Thatmo SCANsat, the very 1st interplanetary ship launched by the OPTC something like 4 years ago.\u00A0 It\u0027s target, Neidon\u0027s major moon Thatmo (an analog of Triton) is in a highly inclined and RETROGRADE orbit so the Boffins aimed the probe to capture into a retrograde orbit itself.\u00A0 Not daring to touch the atmosphere, the probe had been built with plenty of dV but as it turned out, the burn would only need about 450m/s.\u00A0 Even better, it just so happened that the Ap of the resulting orbit aligned with Thatmo\u0027s descending node around Neidon.\u00A0 The Boffins immediately ran some fiendish experiments on a penal battalion as an offering of thanks to the Kraken, and hoped It would still be in a good mood 19 years hence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/BXKMGL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002206-01 NE-1 SCANsat Setting Up\u0022

bound for a polar orbit at Sarnus itself.\u00A0 They crossed into Sarnus space about 30 minutes apart, not bad formation flying considering the length of the trip :D.\u00A0 Shortly before they got

carrier ship to crash into Sarnus to study the effects of its atmosphere.\u00A0 The results were entertaining but sobering.\u00A0 The Sarnian atmosphere extends to 305km, 50% taller than Jool\u0027s.\u00A0 And it gets hot pretty fast.\u00A0 The Poodle engine and fuel tank exploded very quickly, but the service bay containing the probe core and RTGs survived all the flames.\u00A0

Scientists were only able to get high orbit data from Hale\u00A0 due to low orbit being closer than the Sarnus Science Probe got (although it got DAMNED close) and the instruments still trying to

noted varied between 2-6%, which is sufficient to support a small base, but the terrain is brutal, more veritcal than horizontal.\u00A0 In any case, the Boffins put some grad students on the job of

the Boffins decided they needed a change of pace.\u00A0 To this end, they began the long, arduous R\u0026amp;D process for the 2nd Sarnus Expedition, now that they knew the basic design parameters.\u00A0 It had been years since they\u0027d designed any rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it had also been about 6 years since any Kerbals had been in space.\u00A0 In that interval, the Scientists and Boffins had worked together to overcome the long-vexing problem of being able to tell Kerbals apart and remembering which one did what job.\u00A0 So the Boffins rigged up some IVA Icons and the Scientists developed new Ceteras spacesuits color-coded and symbolically matched to the IVA Icons.\u00A0 Here is all that being modeled by elite testkerbs at the top secret R\u0026amp;D labs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/BJbtmW\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002209-01 New Suits\u0022

Tekto component of SE-2.\u00A0 Already having exporation jets in position, they next priority was to develop a means of getting Kerbals between the surface and orbit.\u00A0 Simulations indicated that a conventional lander just wasn\u0027t going to work---Tekto\u0027s atmosphere made accurate landings virtually impossible, even using the Trajectories technology.\u00A0 Therefore, the Boffins decided that a spaceplane would be necessary and, after some tinkering, developed the TRASHCAN (Tekto Reentry Aircraft Specially Honed to Carry Astronauts and NOMs).\u00A0 This can carry up to 6 Kerbals and some emergency supplies should they be necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/CFGkPH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002209-02

TRASHCAN\u0027 has the same nuclear thermal jet as already used on the TOPERs.\u00A0 Simulations show this will get the TRASHCAN to about 200m/s at 13km altitude.\u00A0 At this point, the LANTERN nuclear engines take over, and they have a TWR over 1.3 in Tekto\u0027s weak gravity.\u00A0 These are more than capable, even with the atmosphere, of achieving orbit (orbital velocity is only about 750m/s) with plenty of fuel both for docking and landing again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the TRASHCAN can\u0027t fly at all on Kerbin---WAY insufficient thrust.\u00A0 At best, it can stretch its descent from the end of the runway to about a klick offshore \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

their usual strategy of building a bass-ackwards SSTO rocket using the TRASHCANs as tail feathers.\u00A0 2 TRASHCANs to have some redundancy and self-rescue ability on the mission.\u00A0 With both spaceplanes, 2x Nuclear Lightbuld\u00A0transfer engines, and their 1.75x worth of orange tanks in the transfer stage, the payload for the SSTO rocket was a bit over 167 tons.\u00A0 This necessitated using the Space-Y 5m rocket parts.\u00A0 The whole rig on the pad will cost about $921K.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/CeyXqu\u0022 rel=\u0022external

forms the necessary link between the TOPERs and the TRASHCANs.\u00A0 A precision landing was absolutely necessary to hit the small patch of half-way decent Ore found by TOPER 1, and once again simulations showed that a convention lander didn\u0027t have a chance.\u00A0 What was needed, therefore, was a base that could land like an aircraft and then drive itself on the ground.\u00A0 Plus, it needed to provide unlimited life support to its crew AND be able to refuel the TRASHCANs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was quite a challenge but eventually the Boffins came up with the BATHMAT (Base, Airborne, To House and Mine At Tekto).\u00A0 It was built around the new Karibou Rover.\u00A0 Around this the Boffins built a glider with all the flight parts mounted on hardpoints so they could be detached on the ground, and an engineer aboard could scrap them so that maybe, someday, their component RocketParts could be used to build a ship on Tekto.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/Cw94vA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002209-05 BATHMAT Overall\u0022

component of the mission.\u00A0 There, the Travelling Circus plans to establish the main deepspace port for the Sarnus system.\u00A0 As such, this would be were the Kerbals of SE-2 would first drop anchor before dispersing to the various moons.\u00A0 But they needed a ship to get them there and back, and thus was born the CRACKHEAD (Cryogenic Refrigerator About Carrying Kerbals Heading to Extremely Arduous Destinations).\u00A0 This thing is, as the name implies, built around a 10-seat DeepFreeze unit and the necessary plumbing and electrical systems needed to run it.\u00A0 It also has a service bay with a fuel cell for rapid recharge of the batteries should that prove necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/C76YTP\u0022 rel=\u0022external

each end.\u00A0 Launched on the nose of this\u00A0was the COPROLITE (Crew Orbit Position Relocator of Long Inhabitation for Tekto and Eeloo).\u00A0 This is a self-propelled Hitchhiker can to move Kerbals between Eeloo and Tekto.\u00A0 This has a 2.5m port on the\u00A0stern and a 1.25m port on the\u00A0bow for flexibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll this required the equivalent of 2 orange tanks of liquid fuel plus all the fixed mass, and this\u00A0in turn made for a big lifter\u00A0using all the biggest 5m parts.\u00A0 And because this is carrying 10 Kerbals, the 1st to go to the Outer Planets, and the 1st Kerbals going anywhere in many years, the Emperor and the Travelling Circus wanted that lifter to be special.\u00A0 So they did it as an SSTO using all the biggest 5m Space-Y parts..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, to make the fuel and get the science from Eeloo, the Travelling Circus decided another mobile base was necessary.\u00A0 By using many of the Karibou components developed for the Tekto BATHMAT but differently arranged and\u00A0addubg special stuff of its own, the result was the STEAMINGPILE (Self-contained Temporary Environment Allowing Mining In New Glory for Poor \u003Cs\u003EIdiots\u003C/s\u003E \u003Cs\u003EIndigents\u003C/s\u003E Immigrants Landing on Eeloo).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

orbit as a tug for shoving heavy stuff around later and perhaps to serve as a backup ticket home for at least a few of the crew.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe job of humping fuel up to orbit and eventually bringing the Kerbals back up, too, required a big lander.\u00A0 To limit the trips needed to refuel CRACKHEAD for the trip home, it needed to lift at least 1 orange tank\u0027s worth of fuel and, of course, have room for 4 Kerbals.\u00A0 This resulted in the FLAKEE (Fuel Lander and Kerbal Extricator for Eeloo).\u00A0 Even with the cargo fuel tanks empty for the trip out, it still was a ridiculously heavy payload at about 250 tons including the transfer stage.\u00A0 This required the same huge\u00A0LFO lifter as\u00A0CRACKHEAD-COPROLITE, but with the addition of 4x 3.5m SRBs.\u00A0 The whole thing weighs over 1400 tons on the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/D2btA5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u002210-03

package, there was need for some sort of station with at least minimal fuel tankage.\u00A0 This led to the TOEJAM (Tankage Orbiting Eeloo Just to Administer Missions).\u00A0 It has 2 of each side docking port and tanks for every type of fuel, although mostly for LF due to that being what the other ships of SE-2 use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca

main elements of SE-2 (the Tekto and Eeloo components) done.\u00A0 This brought up the question of what to do about Hale, which the Scientists were so keen on visiting.\u00A0 In fact,\u00A0they wanted to build a base there.\u00A0 But looking at all that was in SE-2 already, everybody finally decided that a base would have to wait until SE-3.\u00A0 But CRACKHEAD had room for a 3rd crew so it was decided to send a long-ranged lander to visit both Hale and Orvok.\u00A0 This became known as HOPELESS (Hale and Orvok Planetoid-Exploring Lander for Extremely Serious Science).\u00A0 It will do these 2 little moons somewhat Apollo-style, using its transfer stage as a tug to move it around within the Sarnus system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://flic.kr/p/D2bttG\u0022

least, Mission Control remembered that the only income lined up for SE-2 so far was a single contracdt for science from the surface of Slate.\u00A0 To do this, the Boffins whipped up a small, \u0022relatively\u0022 cheap probe lander for a 1-way trip.\u00A0 This is rather easier to do than make a reuseable lander.\u00A0 That\u0027s another task deferred to until

question existing condiitions, let alone existence itself.\u00A0 This is because to them, the answers are intuitively obvious to the casual observer.\u00A0 As biological entities, they have to eat.\u00A0 To get food, they have\u00A0work, either growing it themselves or doing some paying job.\u00A0\u00A0The harder they work, they more food they can acquire, but the less time they have to eat it, let alone satisfy their\u00A0less-vital but still necessary\u00A0biological needs for drink and watching TV, unless they get paid enough to have other Kerbals work for them.\u00A0 And even if they\u0027re still very\u00A0busy then, they can at least afford tastier snacks, stronger drink, and mobile devices that stream their TV shows on the go, to get more enjoyment out of their limited\u00A0leisure time.\u00A0 Achieving this\u00A0state is the only aspiration of most Kerbals and they can\u0027t have others because this is, patently,how the universe works and there\u0027s no changing that.\u00A0 At least as they see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there are, of course, exceptions.\u00A0 There are some Kerbals who are unable or unwilling to earn an honest living.\u00A0 There aren\u0027t many of either,\u00A0thanks to millennia of selective breeding---they either quickly starve to death or are hanged as thieves.\u00A0 Those that escape these fates are usually swept up by the pressgangs to serve the Empire.\u00A0\u00A0 Now, there\u0027s plenty of graft and rackets amongst the working kerbs, but mostly this is viewed a second job, a suppliment to their main source of income, all part of the same harsh survival game they all play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s the Imperial Government.\u00A0 This is a rather philkerbalist organization, really, its primary goal being to improve the lot of the average kerb, but just in detail, not fundamentally.\u00A0 After all, it\u0027s Kerbal nature to work in a quest for more and better leisure time.\u00A0 It\u0027s just that some kerbals have been so successful at thtis that they no longer have to work at all, but still have too much ingrained work ethic to become complete hedonists, so feel compelled to be doing SOMETHING productive.\u00A0 Thus, they use their abilities as the last remaining literati to develop\u00A0new technology for daily use, and this ultimately led them to space, a great source of spin-off consumer goods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut\u00A0making the governmet function requires more bodies than the peerage\u00A0can muster by itself.\u00A0\u00A0And there is no pool of \u0022best and brightest\u0022 amongst the general population to draw on because the general population is illiterate.\u00A0 Besides, the average kerb doesn\u0027t see government jobs as honest work so nobody applies for them.\u00A0 Therefore, the Imperial Government uses something rather like the historical Ottoman ghulam system to fill its ranks.\u00A0 Non-productive kerbs are captured by pressgangs, evaluated for aptitude, trained and indoctrinated as necessary for their assigned task, put to use, and promoted on merit.\u00A0 This is where all the Scientists, Boffins, and astronauts come from.\u00A0 Those who lack the competence for any of these roles become reality TV stars, which is the only form of true welfare system on Kerbin.\u00A0 After all, they can\u0027t do honest work, they can\u0027t even do government work, so what else can they do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway,if one of your ships met one of my
