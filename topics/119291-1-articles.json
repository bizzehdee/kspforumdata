Unless you\u0027re on some kind of self-imposed speedrum no problem. Later on when you\u0027re going interplanetary you might think nothing of warping a year or more since your tech tree will be unlocked, you\u0027ll have 30 million kerbucks in the bank and be sick of contracts, and you just want the craft you\u0027re focusing on to get where it\u0027s going before you have to go to bed IRL \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neufusion","CreatedById":147373,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T03:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool.

There\u0027s a bunch of travel and rescue contracts available but I\u0027m not experienced enough to do multiple stops and have no idea how to synchronize an orbit with something (someone) that\u0027s already in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, it was probably the luckiest Mun/Minimus flyby ever. Two tourists wanted mun and minimus flybys. Direct launch brought me right by the mun that slingshot me past minimus with no fuel and then the return was aided by minimus gravity that brought me right back to kerbin with an easy entry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rare White Ape","CreatedById":150155,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T03:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good idea to use the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod, this allows you to run multiple long-duration missions while you do smaller stuff in the mean time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I have two interplanetary (300\u002B day) missions on the go and I set the alarm to tell me when a maneuver or transfer window is approaching, as well as a few month-long Kerbin-Mun-Minmus things going on. If it takes five days to fly to Minmus, I can do a bunch of LKO contracts while I wait.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
