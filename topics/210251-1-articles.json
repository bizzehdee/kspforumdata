I might be wrong but I think we can see a nuclear reactor in one of the new clips, so there may be other high-output options for power generation, but for much of the inner Kerbolar system solar panels may well be the lighter option over chemical or nuclear sources. The obvious application are low-mass orbital probes, but you could also use larger electric propulsion engines for crewed interplanetary shuttles. Ive personally found it a really interesting puzzle to skip big banks of batteries and just plan all my burns in daylight outside of planetary shadows. The trick is mass is always a huge factor, and since they built procedural radiators maybe procedural solar panels would allow us to more finely tune mass and geometry and make this kind of puzzle more enticing? You usually want just two big tracking arrays so that you can rotate your vessel about the z axis and always keep your panels unblocked and broad to the star, so having tight control over their size would be a huge boon.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the EA video they showed a couple of clips of someone modeling what might be solar panels--they look a bit different from the procedural radiators we saw in the show and tell.

The panels they have do that just fine. Colonies are also their own animal because you have the flexibility to spread out if you need to (although I\u0027ll say understanding latitude and its effect on ideal inclination for fixed or single axis panels would be a nice lesson). The problem is different for PV panels designed to feed engines. For that putting 20 smaller panels wont cut it. You don\u0027t want them lined up or pointing out in different angles because depending on your burn orientation the panels will block each other or not be able to face Kerbol. You want exactly two rotating panels that produce exactly the right amount of power to keep things running, because you can rotate your vessel with the panels pointing either N/S or Radial in/radial out and have the panels max their exposure no matter where you\u0027re burning.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022

parts. I personally don\u2019t see the need to exactly balance power input and consumption since it fluctuates anyways and the only additional gameplay you gain is moving a slider. As such, I\u2019m fine with a few solar panel options going up to a very large size. But the question arises- what if someone wants a panel of 7000 units by 1 unit? And if the developers make that model, what about 7000 units by 5 units? It would be better for complete customization to make it procedural; there\u2019s a limit that a lot of people reach when working with a set selection of sizes and shapes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-28T21:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be honest, I think procedural solar panels are almost a shoe-in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me explain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already know we\u0027re going to have procedural radiators right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s a solar panel but a radiator with the energy going in instead of out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume they\u0027ll be simulating solar heating on the procedural radiators, and from that it\u0027s only a short (coding) leap to procedural solar panels, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I don\u0027t know if we\u0027ll get procedural PIVOTING or procedural DEPLOYING solar panels, since I haven\u0027t seen those kinds of radiators as procedural parts yet.
