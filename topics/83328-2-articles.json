I use it now for ascents, circularizing and IP burns, and information. The display of aerobraking node is probably the best thing about it, followed by the landing calculator. Not the landing autopilot, but the calculator. There\u0027s no reason the stock game shouldn\u0027t have those two things. I basically use it now because I\u0027ve done everything manually. After a couple thousand ascents and IP burns doing them over and over is just wasteful. Climb to 6k, pitch slightly, pitch more at 10, be almost horizontal at 50, repeat ad infinitum. On Eve it\u0027s the same thing just with different altitudes. Zzzzzzzzzzz. I\u0027ve manually landed on every body in the system within 1km of where I was aiming for. Doing those things again and again, doesn\u0027t prove anything. I still create my dV nodes manually, and then turn the burn over to MJ.
