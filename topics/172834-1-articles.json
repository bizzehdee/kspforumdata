Several players have reported it. However, none of the testers has ever seen the bug happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat this has to mean is that you are doing your launch differently from how we do ours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of the players who have reported the bug have been able to make it happen more than once. You say you\u0027ve experienced it with multiple craft? That\u0027s astonishing. I hope you are using a stock game with no mods added to it yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe think we\u0027ve fixed the bug, but we really need more info in order to verify that the bug is completely fixed. The fact that you are a newbie will make it a little harder for me to ask you for the things we need to see.

Then put one of your\u00A0ships on the launchpad and make another savegame. There is a little button in the top right on that window that shows you all your messages -- hover your mouse over that button, and take a screenshot. Then launch it into orbit however you normally do it, and make it fail. Please make a note of any step that you do that does not simply involve flying the ship to orbit. Then go to the main menu and close the game. Then send me\u00A0a copy of savegame#1, savegame#2, the screenshot on the launchpad, your special launch steps, and the log files. Your KSP.log file is in your main game directory.
