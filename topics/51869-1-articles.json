It floats just fine, and now it\u0027s time for the Kerbals to return home. The top blasts off, reaches orbit and...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...and I can\u0027t switch ships so my return craft can rendezvous and dock to take them home. It says I\u0027m \u0022moving over terrain.\u0022 Mechjeb reads an orbit at 63 km by 59 km, just barely above the atmosphere. In orbit, I switched to map mode, and noticed that it still lists my flying ship as \u0022splashed down,\u0022 and won\u0027t give me the blue orbit line either. I had juuuuuust enough delta V even with using all RCS fuel, so using this ship to meet the other is pretty much out of the question. I need to be able to leave the ship to either save or switch to the recovery ship for orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to overcome this (I assume) bug, where the craft is permanently \u0022splashed down\u0022 despite returning to orbit? It would be a shame to leave all four of the crew behind on a technicality, when the craft apparently functions well enough. Redesigning the ship is out of the question, since they\u0027re already at Laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T17:51:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d try renaming the vessel and changing it\u0027s type, that\u0027s all I can think of\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nadreck","CreatedById":89087,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T18:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just did an amphibious landing/takeoff off from Laythe and did not have that problem.

I\u0027ll see if I can reach some of them, but it can be a tricky EVA to get to a few.

The problem persists even through numerous restarts. Maybe part of the problem is that there\u0027s a probe core on the bottom half (and two Kerbals on board), which is also functioning as a separate ship? I\u0027ve also tried renaming it and designating it as a base, but still no luck. In \u0022product testing\u0022 on the ocean on Kerbin, I was able to exit and save from the base, but I never could test the ascent portion separately since it wasn\u0027t powerful enough to reach Kerbin orbit. I always took off and crashed it into the water. This leads me to think that the problem is with the ascent module and independent of the base- as I could always save from the \u0022splashed down\u0022 floating portion or when they were combined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of the ship in early testing on Kerbin- you can see the parachute placement here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KcvJxWc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KcvJxWc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of separation is just two gray lines above the wide struts- there\u0027s a hitchhiker module with a fuel tank and a separator on top.
