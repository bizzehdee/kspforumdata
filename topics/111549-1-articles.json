After briefly experimenting with the settings and making some entertaining explosions, I went back to my career game and discovered that it is now messed up with the nonsense settings.\n\nI would like to reset them to their normal defaults so I can play properly. Can anyone tell me what the unmodified settings should be for v1.0.2.842 (a reset to default button would have been very useful; I don\u0027t trust the limited information I can find with a web search)\n\nThank you for the help,\n\nRichard\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T12:58:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 12:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RidiculousRichard**"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:54:17Z","Content":"As long as you didn\u0027t go to the Physics-\u003EDatabase tab and choose save, they\u0027ll be back to defaults when you next launch KSP (or when you go to Physics-\u003EDatabase, and choose Load)."},{"CreatedByName":"quietghost","CreatedById":117566,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T22:55:24Z","Content":"And even if you did save those settings, deleting the physics.cfg file will have KSP generate a new one with the default values."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T00:41:25Z","Content":"quietghost: Well, the default values \\_in code\\_, not the values *as shipped in 1.0.2.* Which is why I did not recommend that approahc. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"RidiculousRichard","CreatedById":144734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T10:36:25Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies; I\u0027ll check on Sunday when I get home what is happening. \n\nIs there a copy of the 1.0.2 physics.cfg that people can download to repair an installation (without nuking it and reinstalling?)"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T12:43:56Z","Content":"If you are using steam, just delete physics.cfg and let it check the game cache, if not, redownload KSP, copy then entire downloaded data into your current KSP directory and choose don\u0027t copy when asked to replace things.
