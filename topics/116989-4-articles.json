In VAB it seems if you set the thrust limiter to 0% the SRBs actually burn with half of their full power capacity.  Maybe this is intentional, maybe not, I do not know.  Back in 0.23.5 when I last used KW this was not the case however.  I am unsure in terms of more recent updates.\n\nThat isn\u0027t really a big problem for me though (but it would be nice to have the full 0 thrust -\u003E 100% thrust in the same way as the stock SRBs (compared to the current 50% -\u003E 100%)).  The real issue is again related to visuals I think.  It seems that the yellow exhaust flame\u0027s size depends on the thrust limiter setting and not the real thrust of the booster, to where when the thrust limiter is set to 0% there will be no exhaust flame, despite the booster actually providing some thrust.\n\nI set up a demonstration.  Here are some Globe VI SRBs.  You can see that booster #1 has no exhaust flame, while booster #2 has a not very intense flame, and boosters #3 and #4 have brighter flames.  According to the thrust limiter value this is correct, but according to the amount of thrust they are in reality producing it doesn\u0027t make much sense.  For the stock boosters, a thrust limiter of 0% will make no exhaust flame and no thrust etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Spoiler\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E ![6004216674ae1a0c4182c75e8e98b0a0.png](https://i.gyazo.com/6004216674ae1a0c4182c75e8e98b0a0.png)\n\u003E \n\nEDIT also of note, is the SRB part descriptions.  Some contain burn times for running at 100% and 0%, while others say 100% and 50%.  So to me it seems that the minimum thrust value being set to half power is intended.  But the exhaust flames are still wrong.\n\nEDIT 2 actually maybe it is supposed to be like this.

I haven\u0027t tested it, but it should work (if not, let me know and I\u0027ll poke at it). And I also explained an alternative method of getting the same result in the comments (and how to install it, etc).\n\nFor the sake of history, if people are curious as to what this does, it just targets every SRB (I separated the Ullage motors out into their own section if you need to remove them for whatever reason) by name and sets their minimum thrust setting to 0. Why is this useful? Currently, it would seem a number of KW Rocketry SRBs (maybe all of them, I didn\u0027t pay attention) have a minimum thrust \u0022floor\u0022 that even with Tweakables and thrust limiters, can\u0027t be broken through.
