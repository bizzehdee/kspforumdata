I\u0027m in need of a way to \u003Cstrong\u003Ebypass a contract\u003C/strong\u003E in career mode. Why is that? \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBefore you call me a cheater\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E, let me explain. I got a contract to build a Station housing 8 kerbals and with 4000 units of fuel in it. As you may guess, my early career mode parts couldn\u0027t support such a station in one launch, so I designed the parts separately (Housing, Main docking hub, Fuel depots and Science lab) and then went on to dock them in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was afraid that this might happen, but \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe contract doesn\u0027t recognize the station as valid \u003C/strong\u003Esince it wasn\u0027t launched all at once. Knowing all of this, is there a way to bypass the contract, and to earn myself the money I was pormised? I\u0027m using the Contracts window \u002B and the CapCom mod. (they may or may not have a way to bypass contracts)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance for any replies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T18:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can complete a contract by using the Alt \u002B F12 menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T18:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223500086\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022180364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221544119900\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130955\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022p14082003\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n44 minutes ago, p14082003 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Ethe contract doesn\u0027t recognize the station as valid \u003C/strong\u003Esince it wasn\u0027t lau\u003Cspan\u003E\uFEFF\u003C/span\u003Enched all at once\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s not the reason. It\u0027s perfectly fine not to launch a contract vessel in one piece. It\u0027s more likely to be a problem with how you put it together. Did you use a space tug that was already in orbit to maneuver the pieces together, perhaps? Are you sure it has an antenna and can generate power?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
