Additionally, not marked on that table but something to consider is that metal hydride storage can be used to carry hydrogen at an efficiency somewhat worse than the basic hydrogen compressed storage, but with significantly lower odds of leakage and still far superior performance to regular batteries. As all of these are functionally identical systems of storing an energy supply for the vehicle\u0027s independent use, and because batteries are not, as seems to be commonly believed here, 100% efficient storage, the result is that while batteries are simpler and require less tech, they very obviously do not perform as well as a hydrogen system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost good batteries have about 80% charging efficiency, which is the kind of ballpark you\u0027ll be looking at with graphene-based fuel cell, especially if an additional heat engine is used on wastage.

Charge retainment is something to consider, but considering most batteries do drain rather quickly in relative terms, that may not be particularly different either.

However, as with any form a energy storage, one must be aware of dangers associated with each one. We have hydrogen storage tanks and vent stacks at my work. One of those dangers that has come up from time-to-time is that hydrogen burns with an invisible flame (this has unintentionally occurred at the top of the vent stacks outside). We have many sensors and safety equipment to detect leaks to avoid any accidents. However you can imagine a scenario in a car accident where you have a leak that catches fire with a flame you can\u0027t see.

The doping compound used was similar in composition to thermite, and it was flammable, but it was not thermite. Additionally, the doping compound used was not unique to the Hindenburg. It was first used on the LZ 126, which was given to the US as part of Germany\u0027s war reparations following World War 1. LZ 126 served a rather uneventful career with the US Navy as the USS Los Angeles from 1924 to 1933. The Graf Zeppelin also used the same compound as the Hindenburg for its doping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe doping did not cause the fire (although it probably contributed to it). The cause of the fire was almost certainly a static discharge igniting hydrogen leaking from a punctured gas cell. The Hindenburg had been flying through rather rough weather, and would have built up a large amount of static electricity in its skin and frame. When the mooring ropes that were in contact with the ground became wet, they grounded the frame, but not the skin. The resulting difference in potential would have caused a spark. The leaking hydrogen came from a gas cell that had been punctured when one the airship\u0027s duraluminum ribs broke during a sharp turn as it was coming into Lakehurst.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your claim that the Hindenburg was the first airship to be lost in a fire, this is patently and absurdly false. Most of the airships lost during World War 1 were lost due to hydrogen fires. And before you argue that this was because they were being shot, many other airships have been lost due to fire outside of warzones. LZ 4, one of the very first Zeppelins, caught fire after it broke loose from its moorings. Fire is, in fact, one of the more common ways that hydrogen airships are lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Surprisingly, when you fill something with a flammable gas, it will burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T18:31:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VirtualCLD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VirtualCLD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree that hydrogen dangers tend to be exaggerated. A common phrase/analogy is \u0022it\u0027s like driving around miniature Hindenburgs!\u0022 which I disagree with. I have never heard a hydrogen fuel tank likened to a hydrogen bomb, which is a (parse the next part carefully before jumping to conclusions) nuclear fission energy-triggered, nuclear fusion energy-explosive device. However, as with any form a energy storage, one must be aware of dangers associated with each one. We have hydrogen storage tanks and vent stacks at my work. One of those dangers that has come up from time-to-time is that hydrogen burns with an invisible flame (this has unintentionally occurred at the top of the vent stacks outside). We have many sensors and safety equipment to detect leaks to avoid any accidents. However you can imagine a scenario in a car accident where you have a leak that catches fire with a flame you can\u0027t see. In practice, it would quickly heat up and ignite surrounding objects so you\u0027ll know it\u0027s there, but you could see how it would be a potential hazard to consider.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying this is a show stopper, I\u0027m just saying it\u0027s something to be taken into consideration when designing a car (or any system) around hydrogen. Just like you need to consider the safety and hazards of gasoline or Li-Ion batteries when designing a system that uses them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the topic, if given the choice between hydrogen and battery powered vehicles, I predict that electric cars will win out, even though I don\u0027t think it is necessarily the best choice. We have more infrastructure and mass production built-up around batteries than we do hydrogen so I see the market adopting electric. That being said, I prefer synthetic hydrocarbon fuels as the future since we already have an entire industry and infrastructure built-up around hydrocarbons (more so than high-density batteries). Why tear down everything to switch? If you\u0027re worried about the release of pollution carbon into the environment, synthetic fuels would keep it a closed cycle, taking carbon in from the environment before putting it back out (similar to the hydrogen-water cycle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t matter though since I still predict battery powered vehicles becoming the dominant trend in the long run (decades).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, the fire risk is overrated, any leak would be below the car or in the engine compartment and you would not see it for a long time if hydrogen or petrol. Hydrogen probably have benefits as its an gas who would blow away or float up, petrol will drip down and might generate pools who then ignites because of sparks or hot parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMain issue is the pressure container, if you get an fire from other reasons who get plastic in the car burning you can easy get into an situation where the hydrogen tank becomes overheated, the result is an fuel air explosion who is many time more powerful than the same weight in TNT. Solution might be to have an blow out panel venting downward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that batteries have some of the same issues, with an downside, blocking out air will not save you, how better batteries become how more explosive will an critical fail become.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFound it funny that Sci-fi predicted this, in the Man-kzin wars, the Kzin did not allow humans to have electrical cars only the old IC engine type as it was too easy to convert the battery to an bomb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T19:52:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGreemWolf:\u003C/strong\u003E Thanks to your clarification on thermite and the cause of fire in the hinderburg, I never said that thermite cause the flame, I just said that it was the main cause of the disaster/fatalities. I am 100% agree with your review of the accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- If you have a not flamable envelope, even if you have a leak (which always will be from inside to the outside) and this ignite, you get a flame depending the size of the hole and the pressure difference (in airships the pressure difference is very low), but the hole will not grow in size, in fact the flame will help to avoid any danger oxygen-hydrogen mixture to develope in any closed ambient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have cheap hydrogen sensors which detect even as 0.1% in mixture. Today materials not flamable and heat insulators are those which are most lightest than all.

If some get fire after crash, was due the crash (they carry fuel too), and they was very very few and there is not fatalities (even with flamable envelope).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHydrogen is not more danger than gasoline or batteries.

I voted hydrogen for various reasons though. I enjoy driving my car, I especially enjoy the engine noise. I like being able to hear how fast I\u0027m going and hear when to change gear which simply won\u0027t work with an electric car. The vast, VAST majority of the electricity we use is still created in fossil fueled power plants, I have also almost been knocked off my bike by 3 *insert profanity* people who drive electric cars around my old home town.
