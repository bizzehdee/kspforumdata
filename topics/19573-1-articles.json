That is, it has properties that wouldn\u0027t conform to normal physics (such as having negative mass). We don\u0027t know if it exists yet, and if I remember correctly, said exotic matter would also have to be tachyonic because it would \u0022ride\u0022 the ridge of the expanding/contracting spacetime, or something.
