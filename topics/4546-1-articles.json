Six SRBs give the ship a boost off the pad (Not necessary, but definitely a help and does not hurt stability) along with 7 Liquid fuel engines (no gimbals), and are jettisoned when they run out. Then the 7 LFEs run out (They have 3 tanks of fuel to use each), the tiny 4 booster stage gets us into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel lines allow all four boosters to feed off the outer 3 stacks BEFORE moving on to the inner tank. When the outer tanks run out, the outer engines go out and the 3 outer stacks are jettisoned, then the central stack still has 2 full tanks of fuel for the LFE to use. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce orbit is achieved, there\\\u0027s still a bit of fuel left in the outer tanks usually. This is best used for giving the Trans-munar insertion a kickstart. Then the outer tanks are jettisoned and the middle engine is now switched over to the inner tanks. This will finish the transfer orbit with PLENTY of fuel. When you get to the Mun, the fuel you have is enough to get you into orbit and land. Not a really nice orbit, but an orbit that won\\\u0027t go back into Kerbin\\\u0027s SOI. From here you can use all remaining fuel in the two middle tanks to scrub horizontal velocity over where you want to land, and slow your descent a bit. Now just detach and finish up your landing with the next stage. When you feel like leaving, take off like any Mun mission, then press space ONCE to jettison the lander legs, so you don\\\u0027t have unnecessary weight with you. Then just get into orbit, go trans-Kerbin and then de-orbit and land back home. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFun fact: If you want to, the ship has enough fuel to get you into a keosynchronous orbit AFTER leaving the Mun. If you know how high your orbit must be to do so, then you\\\u0027ll still have enough fuel to de-orbit yourself and get home after getting into keosynchronous orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: It\\\u0027s vanilla, no mods needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Hmm, it seems that, judging by the Experimental thread, SRBs are broken for now. I don\\\u0027t doubt the ship\\\u0027s capability of getting to the Mun without them, but could be a bit of a nuisance. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"belak99","CreatedById":21503,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T04:01:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUMMMM DOWNLOAD LINK?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iamwearingpants","CreatedById":27,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-07T04:33:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you look at the date on the post above, it\\\u0027s from December. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there are legitimate reasons to necro a thread, asking for a download link in all caps doesn\\\u0027t cut it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink before you post, kids.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
