I\u0027m attempting my first space station. In fact, I\u0027ve launched a nice orbit, set up a module with docking ports, and solar panels, and what I thought was a succesful self-contained orbiting platform. However, when I run my lights, I can see my electricity going down, but I never see where the solar panels are recharging them. What am I missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do the solar panels deploy? Mine aren\u0027t. I\u0027m thinking this is the problem, but I can\u0027t figure out how to deploy the solar panels.
