So I hopped into Notepad\u002B\u002B and started noodling around with altitude and FOV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I tried (very) moderate alterations and the results seemed promising, but unfortunately they then plateaued at a certain point. Bumping up the FOV to even ridiculous numbers (288) doesn\u0027t appear to make a difference; I\u0027m assuming I\u0027m doing something wrong? I thought an altitude of 1.5Mm would be more than adequate... should I go even higher?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BDfaO0y.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BDfaO0y.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeally, I\u0027d like to scan one hemisphere of the map in a single pass.
