Now to the challenge, the challenge is to land a non VTOL vehicle on top of one of the KSC buildings. You will get points awarded based on which building you land on:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10, points for landing on the SPH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15, points for landing on the VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20, points for landing of the Mission control building and astronaut complex. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25, points for landing on the bridge along its length\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E35, points for landing of the bridge along its width\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50, points for landing on the Control or water tower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to use any engines so long as you are not using VTOL engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou are allowed to use any mod parts as long as they are not overpowered, I would recommend using firespitter parts as the propellers have a reverse thrust option. Also parachutes are not allowed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIF people want to use FAR I will provide a separate leaderboard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my entry. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/w41mYl6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022w41mYl6.png\u0022\u003E which means I get 15 points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou must post a picture or video for verification.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I will award 10 points for a unique and cleaver design.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-14T10:22:39Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2014 10:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by mrmcp1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T18:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou may want to consider not allowing the use of parachutes?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-13T18:43:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EControl tower does not count as a very long runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UbBTbQ7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022UbBTbQ7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Castille7","CreatedById":101668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T02:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaha! awesome!
