Much simpler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Use the map and manoeuvre nodes as much as possible. The idea is to flight exactly above your target, at low altitude. So the point where your trajectory disappear in the planet should be just \u0022after\u0022 your target. Don\u0027t aim exactly your target or it will be too \u0022short\u0022 when you do the final break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When getting closer check that you go in the right direction with your marker. Prograde marker should be in the same vertical plan than target marker. It prooves that you are in the right direction. You can also use external view and see whether your target \u0022slides\u0022 on the left or the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Even close to your target, check the map often. Your displayed trajectory is helpful with a precision under a kilometer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- When you are almost vertical (depending of your engine power) to your target at low altitude, thrust retrograd to kill your horizontal speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal approach, if you wish to land less than a hundred meter of your target, is the most tricky part, especially because of the lack of satisfying view for the job. Honestly, the best advice is to quicksave and train.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt helps a lot to have Advanced SAS. Stay perfectly vertical most of the time and control your vertical speed. To change your horizontal direction, release ASAS, lean a bit, burn quickly, go back vertical and lock ASAS again. Some people use RCS to translate, I guess it is convenient, but never tried it. Extensively use your prograde marker, and speed indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flaglore","CreatedById":66036,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T08:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother method is to construct a large rover capable of picking up and moving base buildings into specific locations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"entaran","CreatedById":67823,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T09:11:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWay overcomplicating things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Align your orbit (I\u0027m assuming you\u0027re on the mun here) so it passes MORE OR LESS directly over the target. You want to be at 10km or slightly less if you can manage it, ie very very close to the surface. I usually come in at 6km but you need to be wary of mountains and when you come down that low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Using a manoevre node purely for TIMING (1 minute 6 seconds from now!) etc, burn DIRECTLY retrograde approx 90 seconds or so from your target so it breaks your orbit and is \u0022 a little bit \u0022 to the side of your target, you want (by eye) to be about 900 metres above the target and the rest of the vector beside it. Any of the flight computer mods can really help maintain retrograde, otehrwise ASAS it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Time accelerate to the point where you\u0027re about a kilometre or two to the side of your target, maintaining retrograde (you will stay retrograde the whole time btw), burn full power until your \u0022surface\u0022 speed drops to almost zero.
