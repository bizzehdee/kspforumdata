I ended up doing the next best thing and made a large handwritten table comparing the altitudes of various levels of atmospheric pressure across different planets. Because it was handwritten, this took several hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToday I \u003Cem\u003Efinally\u003C/em\u003E figured out how to set up a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that could do all of the number-crunching in about fifteen minutes.

The index altitudes are marked by having their cells filled, as are those that are either in vacuum or \u0022lithobraking\u0022 range. Someone with better skills than mine could probably have taken this and turned it into a nice, eye-pleasing graph, but I figured I\u0027d put the info out there in case someone finds it useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-25T03:54:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2013 03:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Specialist290\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ENew graph with additional info.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firerider521","CreatedById":60860,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T04:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELithobraking....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes...
