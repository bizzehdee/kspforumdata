The logfile itself was extremely large, and I found out why; something was spamming \u0022Ignore collision failed. Both colliders need to be activated when calling this IgnoreCollision\u0022 every millisecond or half-millisecond. I\u0027m not sure if it relates to my plane\u0027s exploding issues (as it was being caused by a part colliding into another part, it may.) I have no idea which addon could be causing this, as of course if I remove one, the plane will not be spawnable.
