I want buy a Macbook Air 2020 i7, 16gb. I am playing KSP for a 2 months.. but not on\u00A0my own PC. So can I with this hardware\u00A0for example build\u00A0colony on\u00A0the mun, solar orbit\u00A0or etc. with thousends of single parts? I don\u2019t think I will start single ship with more then 500 parts... just will putting this space ships together, via assembly using.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMacbook is my dream, also for work\u00A0but if it is not good for KSP (or run KSP 2 in near future) like\u00A0building monster colony or iss...

The chassis is designed to be lightweight, so you\u0027ll run into thermal throttling rapidly. That said, due to the nature of KSP\u0027s code, a ship with that many parts won\u0027t run well on most any system, thermal throttling or not. In any case, if your heart is set on a Mac, I\u0027d recommend the 16\u0022 Macbook Pro, though this of course is likely to run twice your budget.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T10:23:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf running KSP well is important enough to you to drop the Macbook requirement, I would recommend looking for a non-Apple product. What you save on the brand can be spent on better specifications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatch also for the trap called \u0027gaming laptop\u0027. Just naming it that way tends to add several $100 to the price of a laptop, for what often amounts to just some visual enhancements instead of actual performance (special case with \u0027beefy\u0027 appearance, glowing logos, etc). If you\u0027re ok with a more run of the mill duller look, you can often find the same specs in a regular laptop for considerably less money, or better specs for a similar price than a \u0027gaming\u0027 version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecs-wise, at least make sure there\u0027s a discrete graphics card in the laptop. KSP is not the type of game that taxes graphics much, but letting a dedicated chip handle the graphics still gives the main CPU some extra margin to deal with the intensive calculations that KSP does use, and some of the physics code can even be offloaded to it. Look for the mention of either NVIDIA or AMD graphics chip - with their current performance levels, almost any of them will do for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the main CPU, Intel pretty much wins at the moment performance-wise, while AMD is cheaper. An i7 of almost any current type will offer a good base, but your budget is somewhat limited, so you may need to consider a compromise. A higher end i5 with good clock speed should still perform well with high part loads in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16GB of ram is a good target, I would not go below that if you can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn SSD can speed up the initial load of KSP considerably, which should only really bother you if you run your game heavily modded. Once within a game session its influence is negligible. So consider the trade off, since SSDs tend to add a good bit to the price. That said, for all other use of the laptop, the SSD will of course also speed up load times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is very generic advice and doesn\u0027t really give you a specific recommendation, but if you\u0027re willing to let go of specific brand or model requirements and focus on the components, you can get very nice performance out of a \u0027regular\u0027 laptop. With a limited budget, some compromising is probably going to be required, so you\u0027ll have to consider what aspects are more important to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-23T10:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might want to ask here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002251498\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1153454793\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/187327-ksp-unofficial-official-computer-buildingbuying-megathread-all-questions-acceptable/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr possibly here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002255562\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4252994238\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/60620-custom-hardware-simpit-repository-for-people-who-take-ksp-a-little-too-far/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
