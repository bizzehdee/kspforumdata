I\u0027ve spent almost three days gnawing at this problem and beating my brains out over it to no avail. Is it -actually- possible to get the three-man pod to the Mun? Every time I\u0027ve tried I\u0027ve either not been able to get enough thrust to get the dang thing into orbit around Kerbin (The weight of the fuel tanks kills it) or I use all the fuel in the \u0027lander\u0027 getting aligned to orbit the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it -actually- possible to use the \u0027stock\u0027 parts and get three Kerbals on the Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T02:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very possible.

You\u0027re on the right track. You need a central rocket, surrounded by similar-sized strap-on boosters to get you most of the way to orbit.....personally I prefer using a smaller injection stage rather than a big second stage in orbit....but that\u0027s just a \u0022save on RCS fuel\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Remember: The big-big engines on your first and second stages are VERY powerful, but are VERY fuel-hungry. While I can\u0027t see much of your rocket, it may not have enough fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The fuel line system you need to use is based on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Efirst stage of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy\u003C/a\u003E. Set up lines feeding from the outer boosters into the central stack, and set the staging to fire the central engine as well when you fire up the boosters to take-off. This does three vital things: Firstly, it means that you get rid of that extra mass faster. Second, because you\u0027ve got more thrust in the lower atmosphere, you get out of it faster and thus get a far more efficient launch. Finally, it can help with preventing the old \u0022lower half of rocket accelerates faster than the top, clipping through it and blowing it up\u0022 issue because that extra fuel saps acceleration until you\u0027re safely in orbit and able to handle it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal favourite rocket uses a central 2-tank core, with about 18 boosters (I use smaller 1.25m parts for them) strapped on with fuel-cross-feed letting me eject boosters in sets as I go up... That gets a payload *almost* into orbit, where the inject stage takes over and stabilises it before heading off to the Mun. The effects of good fuel cross-feed are VERY noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with it, and keep working on it....took me a while to get the 3-kerbal pod over there, but it\u0027s a great machine when you do get it there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-25T09:42:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso that\u0027s how they work!
