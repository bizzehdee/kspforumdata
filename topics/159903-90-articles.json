in to make a buck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a serious problem in corporations where people don\u0027t care about the company or the future - they want to meet short term goals (regardless of long term cost), look good, get promoted and do it again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis shows up in government as well, often more often.\u00A0 The most obvious case is the dreaded \u0022bungee boss\u0022, someone who comes in knowing that they will have a short time to show improvement, so makes plenty of changes (to show what they are doing) to optimize some specific metric they can then show off.\u00A0 Since the appointing office (president, governor, county executive, whatever) tends to churn every few years, the \u0022bungee bosses\u0022 know that they have little time to make a splash and are only driven by short term goals, often hoping to leapfrog from one position to the next (changing everything to match short term goals as they go) before their patron is no longer in office.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn corporations this happens when either the chain of command is so long that you \u0022can\u0027t see the forest for the trees\u0022 and middle managers are judged entirely by how they manage their budgets, and also happens across the entire corporation when the founder leaves and the new CEO understands that he is only as good as his last quarter (according to Wall Street), while the old founder typically had some sort of ego tie to the corporation and thus cared about long term prosperity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that \u0022founder\u0022 is more about how the founder (and sometimes the public) view the situation.\u00A0 Elon Musk technically didn\u0027t found Tesla, but for all intents and purposes he can be considered the founder.\u00A0 Thomas Watson didn\u0027t found IBM (I think it was Hollerith), but once he became \u0022Mr. Big Blue\u0022 he might\u00A0 as well have been.\u00A0 And\u00A0 then Thomas Watson Jr. became \u0022Mr. Big Blue jr\u0022 when he ran the show.\u00A0 Bill Ford has similar ties to Ford, but doesn\u0027t really have the deep understanding of how the company runs that a founder would.\u00A0 To be even slightly on topic I\u0027d point out that Bezos more or less acts as a \u0022board of directors\u0022 to Blue Origin and has pretty much exactly the corporate culture inherited from old space, even if they started as an\u00A0entrepreneurial startup before he bought them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile this does happen to business all the time, I\u0027m not sure that this is the big difference between Apollo and the Shuttle program.\u00A0 I strongly suspect that many engineers from the Apollo program would become managers and try to limit newer approaches to \u0022the way we\u0027ve always done it\u0022 short of the extreme deadlines of the Apollo era.\u00A0 Also if you look at the Shuttle design vs. the requirements, I was astonished at how well it managed to meet such divergent targets and still manage to get into orbit \u0026gt;100 times.\u00A0 Most of the issues with NASA seem to come from Congressional meddling, although you could argue that Spacex and Orbital\u00A0 succeeded in the commercial carrier business by a more \u0022hands off\u0022 approach by NASA (and I suspect Orbital did as well) while\u00A0Rocketplane Kistler didn\u0027t (entreprenueurial means a certain expectation of failure, and Kistler couldn\u0027t make ends meet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA better example of how chasing budgets ossified an organisation would be the effects of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elaunching\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the Shuttle flights as opposed to building the Shuttle.\u00A0 Launching Shuttle flights made sure NASA had a full \u0022crewed operations\u0022 budget, and they only had to keep doing the same thing over and over for roughly 30 years.\u00A0 There simply wasn\u0027t any room for innovation (at least for crewed flight, probes could innovate all they wanted without Congressional meddling) as their missions were constrained to the LEO paths Shuttle could go and cutting costs would merely cut the overall NASA budget.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA corporate example would have to be Seymour Cray\u0027s continual goal to make the \u0022fastest computer in the world\u0022.\u00A0 So when some executives broke off from Univac to for CDC, they obviously needed to poach him.\u00A0 Thus began the CDC6600 and an improved (mostly compatible) version called the CDC7600.\u00A0 CDC wanted later machines to be compatible with the first, but that would limit the options and slow down \u0022absolute fastest\u0022 progress, so Cray left and formed the \u0022Cray Inc\u0022 (I think there was a failed computer start at CDC as well).\u00A0 He thus began the Cray 1 and Cray 2 (incompatible with each other), before leaving to found \u0022Cray Computer Corporation\u0022.\u00A0 Unfortunately, by that time it was increasingly hard to beat machines built from parallel microprocessors, and he resorted to using GaAs* (\u0022the technology of the future and always will be\u0022) and both the Cray 3 and Cray 4 failed (some employees insist the Cray 4 prototype worked, but they couldn\u0027t get someone to buy enough computers to cover the debts).\u00A0 Seymour Cray died in a car crash before making significant progress on anything more.\u00A0 But it was always clear that building the \u0022most powerful computer\u0022 was rarely the profitable way to build a computer, even in the \u0022money is no object\u0022 world of 1960s-80s supercomputing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* I suspect that Cray wasn\u0027t happy about GaAs and that was one of the reasons he left.\u00A0 Also, there are mutterings of commercial use for the stuff (finally) in RF and maybe even computing.\u00A0 Supposedly nanosheet transistors are more compatible with weird technology than previous transistor designs (and Si is running out of umph), so perhaps time will tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-10-10T17:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving flight to Wednesday due to winds.
