But many people feel it should be included in stock. To those people I would ask: how would YOU add and balance \u0022flight engineer\u0022 to the game? Consider such a tool from the perspective of .90 career mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent of this thread is not to discuss whether or not such a tool \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be added, but rather how it should be balanced \u003Cem\u003Eif\u003C/em\u003E it was added. The former topic has been discussed many times and the viewpoints of both sides are rather clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll throw out a few ideas to get things started:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Thrust to Weight ratios should only be displayed for planets that you\u0027ve visited. Eg if you want to know the TWR of your lander on Duna, if you hadn\u0027t been there yet, you might send a probe to the surface to unlock TWR readouts for Duna. Perhaps make TWRs only available once gravioli readings have been taken from a planet\u0027s surface, as a more difficult/realistic option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Delta-v readouts should be available as soon as you unlock the device.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rather than being a part, having access to the engineer could be available via an upgrade to the R\u0026amp;D department. Or, going the part route, it could be available on the third tech level (including the starting tech as level 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EMODS: Not entirely sure if this should go in general discussion or suggestions and development discussion.

For launch pad and vehicle information during flight it could be a combination of the R\u0026amp;D building, astronaut complex, and the Kerbals level. R\u0026amp;D building is obvious to unlock the ability to have access to information, however probe cores limited to what ever stage they are placed on for the most basic and more as you get higher in the tech tree. The astronaut complex and Kerbal level are need for the Kerbal to read and understand the information and their career would give them access to different things faster than others; basically pilots would get ap and pe reading earlier than TWR or delta v readings, where as scientist would get TWR early and engineers would know how much delta v a craft could have early on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to make it even more difficult, say when using hard mode, you lock the careers so they can only ever see a portion of the information, and if you want to have it all you would have to bring one of each.
