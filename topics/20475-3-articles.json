Something where I don\u0027t have to test a rocket several times to get it to where I wanna go. I know some people like playing that way, but I\u0027d rather be able to focus on the payload and mission than trial and error. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I propose. It would be a simulation of the galaxy, from a moment that you would chose to launch your rocket. When you click the launch button from the VAB or the launch pad from the space center you have the option to plan your flight or just launch. Your launch can either be right away, or you can set it for a later time. (Useful for setting up your launch so you don\u0027t spend a lot of time in a parking orbit waiting for the right angle. Possibly give a view of the galaxy with a slider to speed up time to the point that you want so you can see the planets positions.) You set a parking orbit that you wanna start from around Kerbin. Several mods are already able to predict the phase angle and ejection angle with the required Delta-V to reach the desired destination. Looking at what Harv has already started with the patched conics update it could be possible to hover over where you wanna go or even select a celestial body or vessel, so it will display the information you need to rendezvous with it. So you can click where you wanna go, and it will make a mark as a event in the flight plan. This event will list the angles required to reach your destination, along with the delta-V. There can even be a count down to the event, so you know exactly when you have to be lined up and when to start your burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne small thing that would be amazing is to mark on which ejection angle you need to start your burn based on the engine you have. Since the nuclear engine has such low thrust the burn has to be pretty long, which throws off the final trajectory. So knowing how early to start the burn so you get the right angle would be a life saver. Though that would require direct information about the rocket, which could be possible because there is an engineer mod somewhere that does the same kind of thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have where you\u0027ll enter the SOI, you can move the mission planning up and start again from that point. Your path will be estimated like it is now, but you can add burns in at certain intervals to adjust your trajectory to either move into an orbit or enter the atmosphere and land. You could do this by selecting certain points on your path and list how much Delta-V you want and at what angle. These will be marked down as another event in the fight plan, with required Delta-V and any other information you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna get back to Kerbin, you start again from a parking orbit over the body your taking off from. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t wanna stop at that celestial body, you can let your craft pass through it\u0027s SOI. At the next SOI change you can start the mission planner again like before and continue for as long as you want. You can set as many events in the flight plan as you want, allowing for gravity assist trajectories to minimize the fuel required. So as you overlook the galaxy you will have a diagram of your trajectory\u0027s and your flight plan. More importantly, you will have a list of burns that you have to make in order to follow that path. Each one has the angles and Delta-V required. As you fly you can have a countdown to each event. So you do your transfer burn, warp to the next event, do your burn, and warp to the next event. So on and so forth. There are mods to estimate the Delta-V of your different stages, so it\u0027s just a matter of arranging your stages to get the proper Delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this will require cleaning up of the current game. Seems like the precision of the orbital mechanics still isn\u0027t where it needs to be for this kind of precise planning. There also needs to be some better navigational tools outside of mods, because of the requirement to burn at certain angles for certain times. There also needs to be a way to account for error the the calculations. So it might have to be a dynamics flight plan as well. But for the next update a bare bones version would still be amazing. Even having the option to trigger certain stages and certain time or positions in the flight could be cool. But that would also probably require a overhaul of the staging interface in the VAB to makes it easier to organize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApologies for the wall of text, just wanted to explain my idea thoroughly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RageCookie","CreatedById":9552,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T10:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really would like to see an improvement of our \u0027\u0027stock\u0027\u0027 navigational systems except one Gyrocompass.
