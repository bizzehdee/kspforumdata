The bigger this is, the faster the intake accumulates the IntakeAir resource, so it collects more IntakeAir out of thinner atmospheres in a given amount of time. Thus, intake area affects how high you can fly before flameout.\n\nThe amount of IntakeAir resource per intake isn\u0027t really important. In effect, intakes are like fuel tanks that grow their own contents. Because jet engines consume IntakeAir just the same as they do LF, you need a \u0022tank\u0022 of IntakeAir somewhere in the plane for them to draw from. So this number just shows how big the intake\u0027s \u0022tank\u0022 is. But it really doesn\u0027t matter because the engine is consuming it while the intake is adding more to the \u0022tank\u0022, and it\u0027s the relative rate of production vs. consumption that determines if the engine will keep running.\n\nThe other important stat for intakes is drag, which you can\u0027t see unless you look at its cfg file. Drag is now an important thing and IMHO makes it a wash between the slightly bigger area of the ram intake vs. the lower drag of the shock cone. In my experience, both work equally well on the same spaceplane so it\u0027s more aesthetics than anything else.\n\nThe circular intake doesn\u0027t have much area so isn\u0027t suited to high-altitude flight. It goes with the similarly low-altitude Basic Jet engine. If you\u0027re making a spaceplane or high-altitude jet with Turborams or RAPIERS, use the shock cone or the ram.\n\nThe radial intakes and fuselage pieces with intakes just add a little more intake area at the expense of drag. Most of them are only useful these days on low, slow planes, perhaps as their only intakes. For spaceplanes, they\u0027re not desirable anymore because high-altitude engines run out of power these days before they run out of air, so no need to spam intakes on them. All you really get from them now is unnecessary drag. The only exception to this general rule is the new \u0022precooler\u0022 part, which really does no cooling and is just another fuel tank with an intake on it. Pairing one of these with each shock cone or ram intake on a spaceplane gets you more altitude before flameout than you get without, and they don\u0027t seem as draggy as the radial \u0022structural\u0022 intake."},{"CreatedByName":"Slam_Jones","CreatedById":125101,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T21:21:33Z","Content":"I think the main variables at play are:\n\nIntake Amount (how much air it can take in)\n\nDrag produced (some produce more drag than others)\n\nMass (how much it weighs)\n\nCost ($$$)\n\n[The wiki has a comparison chart](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Air_intake), but I can\u0027t say 100% if it\u0027s updated for 1.x (I noticed the pictures for the circular and RAM intakes are using the old 0.90 models)\n\nEdit: Ninja\u0027d\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T21:23:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**\n  \nGrammar, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:22:13Z","Content":"thanks, that answers it."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T19:34:32Z","Content":"Shock cone intake also has lower heat increase from convection, per its cfg."}]}
