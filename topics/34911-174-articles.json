Built to serve as the USN\u0027s first true multirole fighter, the Legacy Hornet was designed to shoot off US aircraft carriers and provide air superiority, as well as striking targets on the ground. The Super Hornet further modified the Hornet by increasing its weapon load, giving it new radar, modified displays, and a better airframe. One of the easiest changes to spot between the Legacy and Super Hornets are the oval intakes (Legacy) being changed to rectangular intakes (Super). The recent Block III Super Hornet brings even more changes, with a better engine, new stealthy weapons pods, better radar and antennas, new advanced cockpit screens, and conformal fuel tanks (unfortunately currently shelved until further notice).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Legacy Hornet entered service in 1985, with its first large-scale deployment being in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. During the invasion, Marine F/A-18Cs shot down two MiG-21s, scoring their first air to air kills. Throughout the conflict, Hornets continued to be deployed, mainly to SEAD missions. Legacy Hornets and Super Hornets have continued to be deployed to Iraq since in the ongoing Operation Inherent Resolve. An F/A-18E managed to score the first air to air kill in almost two decades when the pilot shot down a Syrian Su-22. Only a couple months ago, two Super Hornets scored another undisclosed number of air-to-air kills in the form of enemy attack drones and cruise missiles. This makes it two Super Hornet air to air kills in a row, excluding the F-22\u0027s ballon popping mission in \u002723.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Super Hornet has served the Navy for almost 30 years now, and while its production is set to end in 2025, the Super Hornet\u0027s service has no end in sight. It will serve to be the workhorse of the USN until F-35 program can take flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimera Industries","CreatedById":216952,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T23:25:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFloor 4436: \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/228871-twocalories/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022228871\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/228871-twocalories/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TwoCalories\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0reading his essay to a group of plane lovers.
