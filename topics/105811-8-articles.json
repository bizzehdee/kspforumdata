I didn\u0027t realize the limitation before I recently landed a very nice science bus on the Mun that has two labs. Was that a complete waste? When the first lab is finished with the data, can I then load the same experiments into the second lab? Does the first lab make the second lab totally invisible and thereby useless?

As someone mentioned, with labs you can complete the tech tree without leaving the Kerbin system. The labs need to be better integrated into the career mode\u0027s pacing.

So, 2 labs with 4 scientists should be double the daily rate of 1 lab with 2 scientists. It\u0027s just the 500 cap and the hidden internal no-repeats log that is per-craft and not per-lab. As for preventing it, it should only be a warning, as some may wish double rate, or have aesthetic reasons for choosing to have multiple labs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompleting the tree without leaving Kerbin SoI is nothing new, and that\u0027s something that is actually a good thing.

I\u0027m not interested in exploring the solar system with one hand tied behind my back. The career game is absolutely not about ongoing unlocking of the tech tree, that would be a terrible game. That has never been what the game is about, and I sincerely hope it never will be. It is about unlocking the tech tree as a start of game activity only, with mid to late and end game being all about exploration and managing funds. I always get the tech tree out of the way as first priority, before any interplanetary missions. The game is an open ended exploration and building sandbox, with the tech tree strictly as an early game \u0022getting started\u0022 activity only. You can choose to venture out of the Kerbin SoI early if you prefer to do that, but you should never be forced into that just to get the full set of parts.

Personally, as a player on my first run-through, I find that science comes a little too easily and the MPL as it currently exists gives too much science when you start time accelerating, even for legitimate reasons. When I can do a mission and unlock 5 techs at once, I get a little overwhelmed with all the new parts. And it makes the success of gaining science and unlocking techs somehow seem a little less rewarding than I\u0027d like it to be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps I\u0027ll change my perspective after multiple run-throughs, but even if so, every game should have a really good first run-through. I\u0027d like to see them do away with 2/3 of the KSP biomes for a start. And maybe add some end-game techs that do nothing except let players who want to unlock future techs unlock them. The Squad team is pretty clever at writing stupid stuff that makes you smile, and future techs that do nothing would be an opportunity to expand on that a bit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to see the MPLs chew through data quicker. Not to generate science faster, but to require more attention from the player. Once you get it full of data, you need to wait forever before you plug in the rest of the reports you have waiting to be processed. It leaves me feeling like all those surface samples from Minmus were a waste of time, and thus reduce that satisfaction for having been so incredibly clever as to pull off the amazing feat of getting them in the first place. (Now I know that getting surface samples from Minmus is no big deal, but still, first-time players want to feel like they are incredibly clever for figuring stuff out). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever tweaks come down the line, I hope they keep in mind a large number of play styles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T17:25:24Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 05:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DarkGravity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T18:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Murph\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Murph\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I\u0027m not interested in exploring the solar system with one hand tied behind my back. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareful there, games in general are all about doing things with one hand tied behind your back.
