The Kerbals will die and respawn, or perma-die if you have that difficulty setting on.  \n\nIf you have Background Processing mod installed, this could occur even if the vessel is not loaded/active vessel in flight.  \n\nIf you don\u0027t have this mod, DeepFreeze will do a catchup the next time you switch to that vessel, and then they will die.\n\nIn timewarp - it does not do EC processing above timewarp x 5. This is due to stock issues when processing resources at this high a time warp. Though it does give a warning. But at high warp you can miss it."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-29T05:48:30Z","Content":"v 0.26 published for KSP 1.7.x.\n\nBiggest change is the addition of my Background Resource processing module.

Other than being really cool and adding some neat parts and technologies, it\u0027s really handy when one uses a life support mod and wants to travel further than Minmus.  \n\nToday I encountered a peculiar bug. Sent three space ships of the same type (and the same name) to places, and each ship had three kerbals on board that I froze. Now I was trying to unfreeze them, but the freezing modules pretend they were empty. When I open the in-flight deep freeze menu, all those kerbals are there, but they\u0027re not assigned to a vessel - the vessel name field is empty for them (as opposed to some other kerbals on a totally different ship - unique in name - that are thawable). The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E deep freeze menu gives me the option to actually thaw the kerbals in question, but all it seems to do is withdraw 10k from my account with the kerbals still in limbo.\n\nI do not use and have never used the EC requirement to run the freezers, nor have I ever activated the max temperature limitations in the settings, so I know for a fact the frozen kerbals have not died. \n\nHas anybody encountered a similar issue? Is there a way out of it? Does it only happen when you use multiple vessels of the identical name and type? Thank you!\n\nEDIT: Correction! I have just now tried freezing and thawing in a different save and it turns out that duplicate vessels are completely irrelevant. The unthawable kerbals just appear to be a thing no matter what. I think I actually updated the mod to 1.7.2 since the last time DeepFreeze worked correctly. I have been playing on the game version 1.7.3 and all the freezing / thawing have been fine with the older mod version. Now I am even more intrigued! \n\nSpoiler\n\n![VndnE8p.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/VndnE8p.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-09T17:17:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2019 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aelipse**"},{"CreatedByName":"Arthur6938","CreatedById":199293,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-10T14:37:10Z","Content":"I ask me about the results .
