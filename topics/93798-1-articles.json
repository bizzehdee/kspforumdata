Because they have the highest density of any real-world fuel choice (and stock LF/O is already too dense- so this would require the smallest adjustment), their ISP is *inferior* to the current LF/O mixture (which is essential to nerfing the fuel mix so that getting to orbit still remains a challenge at only 3.5 km/s), and in real life they don\u0027t experience any boil-off (so it would put to rest any cries from realists that the fuels should have boil-off). By matching a real world fuel, the game would also have known values to work off (which, for hypergolics, already just *happen* to be well-balanced for KSP), and would even be able to re-name LF/O to real fuel names to make realists a bit happier...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would emphasize that the fuels should also be re-named, because that would open the door to including other fuel mixtures down the line. Such as Kero/LOX (which have better ISP but lower density than hypergolics) and LH2/LOx (which have incredible ISP, but *very low* fuel-density). Which could be eventually (or immediately, if Squad wanted to be particularly proactive) implemented as alternative fuels that force players to trade-off reduced fuel-density for higher ISP, and could even simulate boil-off (hypergolics should be the \u0022default\u0022 fuel, though, so new players don\u0027t have to deal with boil-off unless/until they ever feel ready...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that everybody doesn\u0027t necessarily agree with me. Which is why I am trying to get people to discuss this- and this thread was started so as to facilitate such discussion. \u003Cstrong\u003EPlease keep in mind that the main point is that ISP should be reduced, not that I think hypergolics would be the best fuel mixture to model the new (lower) ISP values off of.\u003C/strong\u003E The bit about hypergolics is in some ways entirely separate from the need to nerf ISP when aerodynamics are improved- it just happens to be a convenient time to bring it up...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E On second thought, maybe the devs should include Kero/LOX at the same time. Basically, go with 2 different directions on nerfing the fuels. Players could choose either to take a smaller hit to their fuel-density but lose ISP (by using hypergolics), or keep current ISP but lose even more fuel-density (Kero/LOX). It also feels rather weird having jet engines burn UDMH, so it might be better to have all the jet and RAPIER engines (RAPIER is for more advanced players anyways) use Kerosene, for a number of realism and balance reasons (stock jet engines are already EXTREMELY OP\u0027d due to their not losing thrust with altitude and a quirk of how IntakeAir figures into ISP calculations- having them burn with a less dense fuel would do more to nerf them than reducing the ISP a small amount without fixing the IntakeAir issue...)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-20T02:34:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/20/2014 02:34  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carmoldu","CreatedById":109336,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T02:40:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the ISP nerfing, well, it will depend on what they really do to aerodynamics, we can\u0027t say they need to nerf it if we don\u0027t even know if adquiring an orbit will be easier.
