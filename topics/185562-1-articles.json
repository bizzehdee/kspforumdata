I need to do a rescue mission, but the orbit is inclined (around 11\u00A0degrees from equatorial orbit), with apoapsis of ~14,000km and periapsis of ~12,000km. I\u0027m trying the following sequence of events:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Launch into a matching include orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Burn at periapsis to extend apo to ~13,900km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Circularize at apo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Catch-up to the target in my slightly lower orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Slight prograde burn to rendezvous\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Switch to target-mode approach...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t seem to get the right orbit inclination at launch, and just not enough fuel to correct the inclination... What would you do?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T04:22:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198208-charleskerbin/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022198208\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/198208-charleskerbin/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CharlesKerbin\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would get into a high orbit first because you will have less velocity (the faster your velocity, the more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E needed to change inclination), then match orbit at the An or Dn. After that you can set up a high speed rendezvous with an elliptical orbit or burn down to a circular orbit for a gentler RV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T04:30:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, and welcome aboard!\u00A0 Sounds like you\u0027re doing everything pretty much right.\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t worry about trying to get the launch angle exact... just take your best shot, and aim to reduce the difference, knowing\u00A0it can always be fixed later.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you launching right when \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E passes under the target\u0027s orbit?\u00A0 That\u0027s the ideal time to launch if you want to match the orbit.*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know about ascending and descending nodes?\u00A0 They\u0027re the places in your orbit where you intersect the target\u0027s orbit.\u00A0 This means they\u0027re the ideal place to match angles with a normal/antinormal burn. In fact they\u0027re the only places where you can match planes perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne important property\u00A0of orbital mechanics is that the slower your speed, the less delta-v it costs to change planes.\u00A0 This means that if you\u0027re going out to a high orbit anyway, you\u0027re better off waiting to do the plane change until you get there.**\u00A0 So I would add between your steps 3 and 4: after reaching the \u0022slightly lower than target\u0022 orbit, do a plane change burn at the ascending or descending node.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as running out of fuel - you may just need to make your ship bigger or more efficient.\u00A0 We\u0027d need to know more to see if that\u0027s the case, and what improvements would work best.\u00A0 Screenshots always help a great deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*It is, in fact, the ascending or descending node.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n**Caveat: technically you may be able to do the plane change even cheater if you do at least some of it at the same time you raise your apoapsis, but the difference isn\u0027t going to be huge so I\u0027d work on the basic approach first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-17T08:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with everything\u00A0 \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/165625-aegolius13/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022165625\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/165625-aegolius13/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Aegolius13\u003C/a\u003E said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re still having trouble, I suggest you post a pic of your ship in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E with Vacuum \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E stats expanded, and maybe a pic of map mode, you in space compared to the target.
