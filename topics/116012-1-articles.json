I first thought it was the fact the mods version had to be updated to the latest version of KSP (Steam edition if that makes a difference), so I updated the mod and everything else works perfectly fine except that Rendezvous Autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I doing wrong here people?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T00:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to use Docking Autopilot.
