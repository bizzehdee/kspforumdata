This causes an error whenever an addon tries to use those methods. Sometimes it\u0027s just a one-time error that doesn\u0027t really affect anything else. Other times it\u0027s something more serious, errors during the loading process can interrupt the entire loading sequence, breaking many things.\n\nFor instance, the latest update changed how the maximum atmospheric height was calculated. The old method was removed, so whenever something tried to access that method it failed."}]}
