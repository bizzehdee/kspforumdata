This causes an error whenever an addon tries to use those methods. Sometimes it\u0027s just a one-time error that doesn\u0027t really affect anything else. Other times it\u0027s something more serious, errors during the loading process can interrupt the entire loading sequence, breaking many things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, the latest update changed how the maximum atmospheric height was calculated.
