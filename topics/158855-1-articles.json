As a long time Kerbal Space Program user, I have loved the Scatterer mod, and have used it quite often. I just got back into KSP, and I am a big fan of visual enhancements in any way. I tried downloading this mod. This version is 1.13 by the way, since all of my mods I already had were still downloaded, and I didn\u0027t have the time to download the other mods on another version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI load up the game, and it appears as if Scatterer didn\u0027t work. I then exit out of the game, trying to find any other visual enhancement mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the bottom right corner, I see my anti virus (Norton) attempting to scan Scatterer.dll\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt then tells me that is is removed as W.S (I\u0027m guessing windows) W.S reputation 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome further research shows me this is what Norton uses to name a broad region of potentially unwanted programs with a bad reputation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI downloaded it from the KSP forum Scatterer page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help? I have a free version of malwarebytes if that helps anyone to see if it is just a false flag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zerxal","CreatedById":175528,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-07T23:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have Norton myself as well, and it doesn\u0027t delete the dll. But, I\u0027ll tell you what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, you need to temporarily turn off your antivirus by on the home page clicking security, and advanced. Once your there, temporarily turn off autoprotect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen,\u00A0thing you\u0027ll want to do is click on settings in the upper right hand corner, and then click antivirus. Then, you click scans and risks, and click items to exclude from scans. Click add items, and add\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#272a34;\u0022\u003EScatterer.dll.
