When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach 1 (340 m/s). So you should stay pointed as prograde as possible at speeds around 280-400 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a rocket control fins should be as low and outside as possible. If you are using control fins on more than one stage, the CoL needs to stay below the CoM at all times, even as the tanks empty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T22:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are tons of threads addressing this \u0022issue\u0022 (Really it\u0027s just people not wanting to learn something new)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t feel like searching for the forum threads for you, but I assure you they are out there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn order to stabilize your rocket you need to \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea.
