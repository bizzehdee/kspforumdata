About an hour ago it started wobbling in a circle as I neared orbit, but not doing complete circles. Then I got annoyed and went to the SPH. My planes were flying ok then. Didn\u0027t try that SSTO this time. But as time went on and on they started flipping through the air again. Its like the longer I play this game the more issues (specifically this one) arise. If I shut it down and start it back up they all go on the back burner for at least an hour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow when I closed out the game like 2 seconds ago, I went back to the space center where you can see all the buildings and I could not get a single building to highlight and become selectable. The only thing I could click was the quit option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen when I was back at the main log in scree, again nothing would highlight. The only thing I could select was \u0022check for updates.\u0022 I had to force quit the game. I am using a MAC OSX. I\u0027ll go post up the SSTO on my spaceport profile and link it here in a few moments so you guys can see if the thing works on your game. If there is interest I\u0027ll also post the refueling tanker I had the flipping issue with as well. Its a solid design, I just keep running into this software issue.

Perhaps a screenshot would be better, but I did have some concerns. In order for your plane to maintain its altitude how pitched up is the nose? If the prograde marker is more than maybe 5 degrees below your orientation you might want to re-think how much wing is on the plane. I\u0027ve also had good luck with pitching a bit of the wing surface up to counteract a little of the CoM being in front of the CoL and so that when I\u0027m pointed at the horizon I can maintain level flight. If the separation there is too high you\u0027re basically climbing on engines with some pretty wings tacked on for decoration. Also, wings generally don\u0027t perform well when there is little to no air. Did you include a SAS module in the build? I found that they help a ton to keep my plane pointed the right direction once the air is too thin to be of much help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Saberus","CreatedById":56124,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-10T09:32:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hodo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hodo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk if your CoM and CoT and the CoL are all on top of each other you will end up with an aircraft that is riding on the head of a pin.

Even in KSP\u0027s default drag system, if your nose lifts too high and the angle of attack on the wings is too great, the CoL changes, the amount of lift generated changes or drops off completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehaving not seen your plane I would recommend adding reaction wheels to the rear of the craft to give you a more centered \u0022magic torque\u0022 that will help you pitch the plane even if you go into a stall. If your craft is nose heavy and all the torque is in the front, its hard to lever the rest of the craft.
