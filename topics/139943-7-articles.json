One of the beautiful things about KSP is it appeals to my 70-year-old dad AND my 4-year-old nephew. My old man has been playing flight simulators at least as long as I have (early 90s and before), and before he retired he was an engineer for Rolls Royce, so this game appeals to him from an engineering-process and flight-simulator standpoint before it even gets to orbit. Meanwhile, my nephew is more interested in crashing rockets into the moon and blowing things up.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had a serious point in there about how KSP isn\u0027t just a space sim, but I guess the TL:DR is, strokes for folks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to thread-jack, but I\u0027ve also played a lot of flight simulators.

The advantage that KSP brings to the table is that you can build a spaceplane (or a rocket)\u00A0and fly it to orbit, and then move on to other planets.
