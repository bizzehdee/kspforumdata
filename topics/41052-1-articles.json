However after coming back to .21 I can no longer seem to follow Manley\u0027s guide for transfer. Whenever I setup Minmus at a 90 degree angle from my transfer vector, I always end up hitting Mun\u0027s sphere of influence before I can get my target position at closest approach points to line up. This always throws me off and makes setting up a transfer impossible. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat am I missing? Do I need to wait a few in-game months for their orbit timings to diverge? Is it some thrust property of my ship?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T07:32:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 07:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by cowbs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAnswered!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"miketheveeg","CreatedById":59572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T22:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewait a few days of game time and the Mun should be outta the way or\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei remember seeing that Mun in the way often and i usually set the transfer so it just misses the Mun and do a mid-course correction burn once I am past the Mun to get into Minmus orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T22:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust do another orbit and the Mun should have moved on..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krenshala","CreatedById":76062,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T00:13:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe use the Mun for a slingshot to Minmus?

If Mun is totally in the way, do a complete orbit and try again. You could do a Mun boost but setting up that maneuver is very delicate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T00:44:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can make earlier or postpone you burn a minute or two to avoid the mun and then course correct when you passed Mun (if your fuel allows it... the course correction should take no more than a hundred or two meters per second)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T10:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found that doing the inclination burn first helped a great deal with missing the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cowbs","CreatedById":74638,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T06:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup!
