It would have resembled an evergreen or palm of some type that would periodically lose all it\u0027s fronds or branch-like needle clusters becoming at times no more than an upright spike. Native to hotter climates, this tree would\u0027ve drawn up large amounts of water in spring, to use during the summer, and also create nutrition internally, because the tree\u0027s inner chemistry mixed it\u0027s sap with the water and ground minerals to produce a nutrient broth. Interestingly.....in the right combination of soil conditions, liquid concentration, tensile strength of the individual tree\u0027s bark and the volatile properties of the trees own natural sap....a stray lightning strike would produce a rather spectacular natural missile, and a forest fire result in a fusillade to rival the most ambitious Terran fireworks displays.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nCombine this with the Kerbals\u0027 love of fiery explosions...(their eye structure suggests a nocturnal creature in their ancestry, contributing to a tendency towards heliotropism) ...their natural durability....(tendency to survive falls, crashes, explosions, which probably also explains their natural optimism)...and one could easily imagine early Kerbalkind adulthood rituals involving riding these natural rockets into the sky. (Maybe \u0027Kerman\u0027 is not actually a family name, but a title given to any Kerbals who have launched themselves in this manner....or by more modern methods...and lived to tell about it.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s been theorized that man invented the wheel by watching trees fall over and rolling downhill. With trees doing far more exciting things on Kerbin....is it any wonder the wheel came much later? And with much more glorious ways to reach high places....wouldn\u0027t the ladder also be a late development?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Crystal Mace, BS (Durned right it\u0027s BS..)
