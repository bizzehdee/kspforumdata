I am using the poodle because my main engine runs dry just seconds before I reach a stable orbit and I want it to burn up and not trash up my space. This launcher is the same thing I used before but I believe the payload this time is a couple of tons more. The other flights had almost a third of a fuel tank left after I had reached the ISS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am launching for a 150km orbit with my ISS being at 200km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have added a third tank to the boosters but it lowers my TWR.....Didnt launch it to see if it worked or not. I am under the assumption that I need about 2.5 TWR or greater on my launch vehicles to be viable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuggestions? Comments?

Not very stable......I think that the booster mainsails were gimbaling too much and causing the wobble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also added four fins to the lower stage cuz a rocket without fins is like a woman without a bra, they are going to be all floppy. lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T12:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe orange tank \u002B mainsail ought to work, but yeah, it\u0027s gonna flex. Strut the crap out of the side tanks, And put some sepotrons on them. Also, assign the outside engine gimbals to an action group and shut them off before you launch (leaving the center gimbal on should help). Then just launch it and watch it wobble.

Last time I tried that, I had four Atlases in a square, and they eventually started fighting each others\u0027 corrections as the rocket got more top heavy with burning fuel. It gyrated out of control and ripped apart from the g-forces. Gimbaling engines always work best when in the center of non-gimbaling engines, or alone. Try using an action group to disabling the outer gimbals at launch without having to do it manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T12:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emy contribution would be to remember that mechjeb calculates deltaV for in atomosphere and out seperately. so your ship has 4400 m/s in vaccum only. when i was using mechjeb for stats i tried to make the first 2500 m/s from the atmosphere number, and then 2500 m/s from the vaccum number. you are running out of fuel and you have the tools to detect it before you get off the launchpad \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother then that theres some nice info in the other posts about how to GET that extra fuel, i wont repeat it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T13:15:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIdeal TWR is 2, but since your TWR climbs during a stage turn you want to lift off with a TWR of 1.7. Lift off with 2.5 TWR is far too high and you\u0027re wasting fuel early on fighting air drag. This goes for each stage higher up as well, though later stages have even lower requirement in terms of TWR after gravity turn as it\u0027s no longer fighting much air and the fact that the stage is flying nearly horizontal means it\u0027s no longer fighting against gravity much as well so you can take your time. For example have a look at TWR for each stage in this rocket of mine:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.tinypic.com/svs0fl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022svs0fl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally you cannot scale up rocket to greater payload by just adding more fuel. However in your case since you have such a high TWR at lift off you can actually afford to load a second stage on top. But still, a new upper stage is not a very efficient way to increase payload as the upper stage engine is dead weight during the early part of ascent. Much better to just build a larger asparagus.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T13:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4.46km/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV can get you into orbit, provided you fly your ascent really well.

Look to add fuel, no more engines. 1.5 T:W should be your target. In fact I have a 250t\u002B rocket that has 5.5-6km/s of \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV with a T:W of about 1.8, with a 25t payload. in fact I can add more fuel if I wanted/needed any more \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV.
