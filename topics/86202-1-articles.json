First of all, I\u0027m no expert (and the experts here will be exceedingly frustrated by support requests that post partial info, see quoted link above) but I gather that your \u003Cem\u003Esystem\u003C/em\u003E is running low on memory. Whatever your total system memory is, know that a large chunk of it is used by the operating system itself, plus any antimalware you run and other background processes. Add to THAT the fact that KSP is a very memory-hungry application on its own merits, let alone adding to that footprint with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods, bear in mind, weigh very heavily on KSP\u0027s memory footprint. Generally, know that part-heavy mods (specifically, the texture files within them) are peculiarly consumptive of memory, though plugins (non-part, \u0022behavior\u0022-heavy mods, such as Blizzy\u0027s Toolbar, or MechJeb) are not memory-free. Worse, plugins can be very bursty in their memory consumption, and how much they use (or need, or forcefully take) can vary dramatically, particularly at gamescene transitions, I find. You list not only B9, arguably one of the part-heaviest (and by extension, memory-heaviest) mod on the forums, let alone EVE and Better Atmospheres (which, while part-empty mods, are literally NOTHING but textures -- large, high resolution textures, at that -- which is the problem-causing component of part-mods anyway).

I don\u0027t care if you have a thousand gigs of memory, a 32-bit application is physically incapable of using any more than 4 gigs at a time, period. 64-bit programs are capable of using more than that (they have their own limit, but it\u0027s hundreds of times higher than just 4gb), but of course, the 64-bit program has to be well-designed to \u003Cem\u003Euse\u003C/em\u003E that extra memory (and Unity-64, the programming environment that KSP is designed in, is very poorly designed to do this right now) hence your x64 issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, running ATM and EVE/BA is possible, but takes some tweaking.
