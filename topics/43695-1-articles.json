They showed off this amazing flow chart once, but have since determined that it\u0027s a little too complex(it wasn\u0027t, honestly) and people have said said they wanted to make it a bit simpler. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve seen any official announcements or information about that, just rumors mostly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is(had to do some digging to find it! ):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/lGlWdyn.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, look how amazing that is. That would\u0027ve applied to planets mostly, but it would undoubtedly extend to asteroids as well. They could\u0027ve added one or two \u003Cem\u003Efluff\u003C/em\u003E resources just for generating some money back home. Like...dig out some rare minerals or something or get them from processing your excess dirt then ship them back to kerbin and if you land them successfully near KSC, you\u0027d get a big pile of money when you recovered that part \u0027cause it contains x amount of rare minerals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope they look back to that flow chart and go for the gusto. I\u0027ve said it before and I\u0027ll say it again: It\u0027s not even that difficult to grasp so long as they introduce just one or two resources at a time...or like you start the game using the processed resources like liquid fuel and so on but then later on, you unlock one or two parts to start collecting and/or processing propellium and oxium and refining it into liquid fuel and oxidizer. There could be a short mission arc about it, to introduce the mining and prospecting mechanics without being too monotonous(for people who start new games multiple times for whatever reason). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen later on in the tech tree, say you unlock a part to start collecting and purifying water along with unlocking the other life support related mechanics(if they had any(hopefully they would )). Then just after that, you unlock zeonium, hexagen and blutonium stuff. But the very first resource you use would be electricity, of course \u0027cause that one\u0027s just kind of passive in the background, almost always present on every craft you ever make FOREVER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they could even go \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E complex than that flow chart...and even the slowest of us(myself included) would have an easy time diving into it because you only learn one or two things at a time then experiment with them before having to learn about more resources piled onto your brain-stem. I really hope they don\u0027t stray far from that flow chart there. It\u0027s just too perfect T_T\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, even if SQUAD didn\u0027t extend resource collection to asteroids(what other purpose would asteroids serve, honestly?), a mod undoubtedly would as soon as both resources and asteroids are implemented. So...yay~\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to the camera suggestion...it\u0027s definitely been suggested before. People really want things like orbital telescopes and just cameras you can mount onto your ships for screenshots and things or recording video from interesting angles, like the different cameras they mounted in the Saturn V or the shuttle. Just good stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarvester even mentioned something...well, he wasn\u0027t necessarily hinting at anything, probably just talking off of the top of his thought pile but he mentioned something to do with camera arrays. I think it had to do with the new science/research mechanics they\u0027ve got going on, I don\u0027t really remember. I just remember harvester saying the words \u0022camera arrays\u0022. So perhaps we\u0027ll have official camera parts..or even just science-related cameras you place on the ground or something. I really hope we can build orbital telescopes to make it easier detecting distant celestial bodies like moons and things orbiting giants like jool(and other solar system when that becomes a thing). They can act as an upgrade to our observatory and help us fill out our knowledgebase before sending probes, landers and even kerbonauts to those smaller moons and things. They don\u0027t even need to be things that we assemble ourselves, I\u0027d be totally okay with there just being like a premade kubble telescope that we drop into orbit and use it to discover the cosmos. Ooh, there could even be a \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E orbital telescope that you have to launch into solar orbit like Kepler and use \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E one to discover the distant solar systems \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also probably use them(as many people have suggested) to look around yourself, zoom in on distant bodies or ships and take interesting screenshots of stuff. All that stuff would just be fantastical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
