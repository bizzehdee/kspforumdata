I just wanted to express my admiration for this game, it\u0027s developers and the entire community.

There is still room to improve and always will be (hence the alpha), but you guys are soo on the right path it makes me want to apply for a job there. I really hope this game continues ahead full-steam with development and realizes it potential, and I\u0027ll do whatever I can to support that goal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the community and modders, you guys are awesome - not only making incredibly fun enhancements to the current game but (in my opinion) you\u0027re also helping the developers a lot by testing out potential features with the public and adding momentum to the entire process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and kudos, to all!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKris\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyotor Gagarin","CreatedById":36567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T17:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe drawing board\u003C/a\u003E has lots of great info, if you haven\u0027t been there already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T17:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
