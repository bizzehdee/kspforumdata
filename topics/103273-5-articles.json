I can load up Activity monitor and watch KSP grab ever increasing amounts of memory until at about 2.4Gb, the whole thing just beachballs. All worked fine up til the current BETA. I even transferred everything onto a new iMac.\n\nUnless this gets sorted I\u0027m outta here. I can\u0027t cope with the mess that is 0.9. To be honest, no bug fix release before we go to 1.0 is looking more and more like they\u0027ve given up and just want to get it released rather than crafting a quality product. \n\nI\u0027ve enjoyed KSP since 0.17 or 0.18 but the last couple of releases have been way below par as far as improving existing problems, more a case of adding new features to paper over the cracks.

I\u0027d love to see the day out of days for each feature to see if Squad\u0027s predictions were even close to actual production times... maybe Maxmaps and Jesus (if he\u0027s still there) could do a postmortem squadcast for those of us interested in Squad\u0027s process.\n\nAs for QA, I think Ted has done a good job laying out the process for us, and the fact that Squad has allocated additional time for the expressed purpose of bug killing and testing would suggest that Squad is aware of our concerns and have taken appropriate measures to address them. Further speculation regarding QA strikes me as being both unproductive and, quite frankly, unwarranted.\n\nIMHO, we should put our torches in a dry place and wait until 1.0 has been released to see whether or not we need to form an angry mob to storm Squad Castle and poke Ted with our pitchforks.![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n\\* to my trained PC/PM eye, this is actually an alarming sign that indicates serious project mismanagement, but considering Squad\u0027s consistent PR blunders despite their clever marketing skills, it doesn\u0027t surprise me that there is systemic dysfunction throughout the organization that they\u0027ll need to address at some point"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T22:41:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E All I ask is that before we get to 1.0 Squad fix the memory leak in OSX ...\n\n*Maybe they can\u0027t.* Maybe none of them know what it causing it, and therefore how to fix it. In which case, the only way to fix it would be to revert to before 0.9 for ever -- and how popular would *that* be?\n\n* * *\n\nI am perfectly certain that they will be working on it.\n\nOne technique used by devteams is to allocate such an issue to a subset of the test-team and get them to test the hell out of the problem, using specially-crafted builds that report extra data. It takes time and careful effort, not least because Special Test Builds quite often *don\u0027t* show the weird bug that is being tested for.\n\n(Adding any extra code can interfere with buggy code causing it to appear to work. Not that this in itself ever helps to identify the root cause of the bug. The programmer can usually explain it *once he has tracked down the bug*, never before.)\n\nAt least this sort of testing can go on in parallel to other development and testing, so the game progresses while the hard work of testing the bug goes on.\n\nThat\u0027s what debugging amounts to sometimes. It\u0027s a tough job, and it\u0027s not made easier by impatient clients who never understand this. This situation won\u0027t change until somebody creates an AI that can debug code automagically -- at which point somebody (probably Google) will invest in a billion worth of servers programmed with this AI and every other programmer will be out of a job.

I\u0027ve been suspecting the same thing for some time, that Squad is being driven by behind the scenes contracts with deadlines that were likely poorly chosen either due to overconfidence on the part of the devs, pressure from management, or likely a combination of both. A large part of the reason for so much of the community being up in arms about this whole thing comes from those PR blunders you mentioned, starting with the Curse thing Squad has basically sidelined the community for important decisions that affect everyone (especially the game\u0027s community) and the decision to go for 1.0 (even if it was based on earlier deadlines) is more of the same. It was a decision that was made behind closed doors and Squad still hasn\u0027t really done anything to clear up the FUD around this whole issue, and their relative silence on this whole thing is what keeps feeding the speculation.\n\nI\u0027m sure that the QA team is doing the absolute best they can, that was never really the issue. I agree that sometimes the criticism of Squad has gotten a little out of hand, but many times it still is valid criticism. Stopping the criticism won\u0027t change anything, Squad will continue exactly what they\u0027re doing. If we keep the criticism at an appropriate level and to the point, focusing on specific issues instead of just a generic hate on Squad (and encourage Squad where appropriate, like their decision to hold off on Unity 5 until it\u0027s more stable), we may still be able to encourage them to change their course, even just a little, like the recent announcement that they\u0027ve dedicated extra time to testing (which is a very good decision).\n\nAt this point, I think the best thing Squad can do is to release a post on all relevant channels (the forums, reddit, twitter, etc) on the state of the game. They need to be honest with the community and provide details, if there are retail commitments behind the deadlines, say so. An apology to the community for not being upfront on the state of everything (the devnotes are nice, but don\u0027t really give a lot of insight into the actual state of the game) is probably also warranted, and would go a long ways to calming everyone down.\n\nOf course, I wouldn\u0027t complain if Squad announced that the deadlines have been lifted and that there will be another few alphas with more features (like more planets and a meaningful career mode), followed by several proper beta releases and then finally a solid 1.0 that puts other developers to shame.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T23:32:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 11:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T23:14:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Squad still hasn\u0027t really done anything to clear up the FUD around this whole issue, and their relative silence on this issue is what keeps feeding the speculation.\n\nThat\u0027s par for the course with Squad, though; they\u0027ve never been very good at communicating outside of PR and marketing material, and they\u0027re a bit gun-shy after the DLC incident.

Keeping former buyers happy is a good thing for any company, but let\u0027s be real here, it doesn\u0027t beat the cha-ching of new customers which should come when the game stops being early access or beta. And as for bugs, sadly, it\u0027s becoming common place for games to be launched bugged and getting fixed later on. It\u0027s not a good thing, but it happens and customers keep rewarding that business model.\n\nAnd ultimately, a company doesn\u0027t have to share it\u0027s financial records with their customers, at least not when you\u0027re a private company selling to the general public.
