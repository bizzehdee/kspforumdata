As previously mentioned, that is a 1.25m engine and a 2.5m decoupler. Use a Skipper or Poodle engine and it will be bigger. Then again, that does cause some problems. Larger engines are more fuel hungry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devilstar","CreatedById":78349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T04:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, I will try that. thanks for the help guys!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-10T09:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust add struts outboard of the engine, but inboard of the fuel tank edges.
