During a build, the node system seems to change suddenly. When attaching a new part, it will seem appear to angle itself to the centre of receiving part. It\u0027s a little difficult to describe, so I created short video. It starts with a new build, in which the parts attach \u0022normally\u0022. I then load an existing file, which exhibits the issue. The same wing parts do not attach properly to a fuselage I\u0027ve tried fiddling with symmetry and angle snap settings to little avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVUWsUdq0ng?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do use a few mods, although I don\u0027t expect them to be an issue. These include better atmospheres, Environmental visual Enhancements, Prortactor, Toolbar, Infernal Rootics SelectRoot and Infernal Engineer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis issues occurs infrequently, but is extremely frustrating when it does. I consider myself to be an experienced player, but this leaves me stumped every time. Sometimes reloading the save or restarting the game seems to fix it.
