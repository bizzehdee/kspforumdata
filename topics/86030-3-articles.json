Nice! There is a bug, though, in v0.6 with the Monolith. Though you\u0027ve converted the texture to .dds, the .mu is still looking for the .tga and so the Monolith comes out pure white.

So a rescale factor of 1.85 (without importing it into Blender to get an exact number; I just tweaked it until the VAB size values matched what I wanted) and a very low mass. \u003Cem\u003E2010\u003C/em\u003E (Chapter 25) mentions that the mass of TMA-2 (the giant monolith in orbit of Jupiter) puts its density at about that of air; the mass of air in a volume the size of TMA-1 would be 0.0022 tons, assuming a density that is the same as TMA-2. I added top and bottom attachment nodes, made it a command module, gave it a little SAS so it could orient itself, and set the vessel type of the part to SpaceObject, well, just because. I know, I know, all this is wildly unnecessary in a game like KSP, but it\u0027s what I wanted \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for the nice part pack.

The novel of 2010 says it should be 950,000 ton, so I did that, too. Way too big to use except with HyperEdit (it crushes the launchpad immediately). Since this is alien technology, I decided to just get rid of the battery entirely and make the whole thing not use power at all. To make TMA-2 able to reorient at a reasonable rate, I had to keep moving the reaction wheel torque up... and up... and UP.
