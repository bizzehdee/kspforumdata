I then wait until precisely the phase angle, ejection angle, and burn within 1m/s ejection velocity. Still no encounter. With Jool, It ended up being under ejection velocity and I came kind of back around and encountered after apoapsis.

You also need to stop the burn lower than the ejection velocity (so just use map view instead for this). Getting your ejection angle right will involve some trial and error. It depends on the craft. Using an onscreen protractor can help here to measure the offset degree for your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MET?\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MET?\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe way I correct is I burn at the center of the brown or blue so that my intersection moves forward or backward]\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s easier to just do pro-grade burns to change you arrival time, instead of the radial change you have done. This will not help if your Ap is below the target orbit, which is why it\u0027s best to bias your ejection to be a bit ahead/early of your target when going outward (eg. Duna), and a bit behind/late going inward (eg. Eve).

Think of it this way, imagine a line between your craft and the opposite side of the orbit. Normal/anti-normal burns will rotate the orbit around that line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial and anti-radial burns.. i *think* these are best done halfway between Pe and Ap. However I would avoid using them except for very minor corrections once you have an SOI capture.

Post-Ap captures taka a bit longer but arn\u0027t really less or more efficient. Most of my captures are post-Ap. The neat thing about post-Ap captures is that you can fine tune inclination there, and the capture in general. It\u0027s a lot easier to see what\u0027s happening with the capture from map view when your close to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T04:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bsalis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bsalis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo you aim between the green navball markers... or do the sane thing and just use MechJeb.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsidering that normal and anti-normal change as you continue your burn, \u0027tis the sane thing indeed.

Radial burns will move your apoapsis forward or backwards along the target orbit for interceptions better than prograde/retrograde in most (not all) cases for correction. Additional prograde velocity will require more retroburning and/or correction for aerobraking at the target.
