I still remember the old white-walled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, from which my first rockets rolled out, most of them\u00A0asparaguslike monstrosities which needed to be lashed together with dozens of struts in order to\u00A0hold together. Since then, I have\u00A0played the game quite frequently,\u00A0and improved my skills to\u00A0a point where replicating some of mankind\u2019s greatest space flights, such as the Apollo program, feels entirely natural and routine. I have been active on these forums for the last few years, and many people have praised my creations here, from my World War II submarines to my lunar space station. While in many ways I have learned to harness and mold\u00A0the game and the laws of physics which are represented within it\u00A0to do my bidding, Kerbal Space Program itself has also molded and shaped me as well, and the impact it has\u00A0left on my life is quite significant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0When\u00A0I bought this game I was in eight\u00A0grade, still practically a child, with\u00A0no real idea what I wanted to do with my life. Sometimes I thought I would study history, a longtime passion of mine. At other\u00A0times I told myself I would join the army and become a helicopter pilot, like my father before me. Other times still, I thought I would try and become a writer, although my attention span soon proved to be much too short to produce any kind of significant written works. However, after\u00A0a year or two\u00A0\u00A0of playing this game, experiencing the thrill of designing\u00A0my own spacecraft, and then actually launching them to the stars, I knew for certain\u00A0exactly what I wanted to do with my life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Spaceflight has been an interest of mine for a very long time, ever since I saw the news coverage of the twin Mars Exploration Rovers bouncing their way to the surface of Mars, or\u00A0the occasional footage of a space shuttle blasting\u00A0it\u2019s way to orbit, but for most of my life it had simply been yet another interest of mine, something that I enjoyed, yet did not have enough knowledge about to fully appreciate. Really, it was just a candle, burning alongside many others, neither brighter nor dimmer than any other one. However, as I played the game more and more, I realized I\u00A0wanted to learn even more about the world of spaceflight. I wanted to learn how NASA did things, so that maybe I could replicate their achievements in the game. After that, I wanted to learn about the science behind spaceflight itself, so that maybe I could start building more original designs, rather than imitations of real spacecraft.\u00A0Kerbal Space Program poured gallons of rocket fuel on that candle that was my curiosity for spaceflight\u00A0and helped it grow into a burning passion for the exploration of the vast world beyond our own thin atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Due\u00A0to\u00A0the game\u2019s impact, I am preparing\u00A0to devote my entire life to the study and exploration of space. Tomorrow, I leave home to study aerospace engineering at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. I am fully convinced that this is the right choice for me, and I believe that without the hands-on exposure to space that Kerbal Space Program has offered me, I doubt I would have ever reached this conclusion. I am looking forward to my studies with great anticipation, and am also exhilarated at the fact that I will be living and learning just a few short miles from where the mighty Saturn V moon rocket was designed, at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Having said that, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Kerbal Space Program developers, as well as to Squad, it\u2019s parent company, and especially to Mr Felipe Falanghe (@HarvesteR),\u00A0the original creator of this remarkable game. It is because of you all that I am about to take this next step.\u00A0The inspiration you have given me will stay with me forever, and I hope that I will continue to enjoy Kerbal Space Program for many more years.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0When\u00A0it comes to the internet,\u00A0I am typically a very private person. However,\u00A0would like to share a photograph of myself at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor\u2019s Complex. I recently took this trip as a final vacation before leaving for school, and while there I suddenly realized that the reason I was there in the first place was due to one game about a\u00A0group of little green creatures with a collection of rocket parts and a launch pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith sincere gratefulness,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Trevor P. , Aspiring Aerospace Engineer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-18T22:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2022 10:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by pTrevTrevs\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EThread of the month!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T14:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe money shot, the most significant thing to ever be posted on this forum, will be a photo, by someone who as a kid was influenced by KSP, of\u00A0a Jeb Kerman plushie floating in a spaceship, looking out the window at Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Servo","CreatedById":149419,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-10T14:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery well written, and a very true sentiment.
