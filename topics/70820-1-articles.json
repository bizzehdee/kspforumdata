The only real advantage of this was that it would have been able to use a much smaller booster (probably a Saturn IB with Centaur or Transtage upper stage for the trans-lunar and trans-earth transfer burns), since it would have required an EVA to board the lander, an EVA to reboard the command module, and had very limited sample-return capability, plus it would have required re-engineering the long-duration Gemini spacecraft to allow for EVAs and docking to carry the lander to the Moon. Given that Apollo and Saturn V were both well-advanced in design at the time this was proposed, it never really had much of a chance except as a possible backup option in case it became clear that Apollo wouldn\u0027t be ready in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why a two-man lander, it was partly to maximize the amount of science that could be done on the surface, but there was a much bigger reason for it. Simply put, the LMP *was* basically a flight engineer on the lunar missions. Yes, he could take control of the vehicle if necessary, and, in fact, Pete Conrad let Al Bean have control over Apollo 12\u0027s LM for a few minutes while on the far side of the Moon, but the LMP\u0027s primary role during the landing was to monitor the computer and annunciator panel to keep track of, diagnose, and fix any problems (with the help of mission control) while the CDR handled the actual flying of the landing. Remember, test pilots *are* engineers; they usually have engineering degrees, and are expected to do a lot of engineering analysis of anomalies during flight to be able to work around them and bring the aircraft back in one piece. The whole thing about the \u0022pilot\u0022 designation was that the majority of them came from single-pilot flight test environments (fighters, trainers, pure experimental aircraft, etc., where you don\u0027t work as part of a crew) and their egos didn\u0027t want to admit to being the \u0022lesser\u0022 light in the spacecraft on a mission; the \u0022commander\u0022 and \u0022pilot\u0022 designation got around this by having the implication that both were equal in flying ability, but the commander was the senior officer and thus the one in charge should there be a disagreement. (Yes, this was influenced by their military backgrounds--there\u0027s always a commander, a senior officer present at whose feet the buck stops.) Indeed, on the Skylab missions, the Pilot was usually a scientist, too, with the Commander being the only \u0022stick and rudder man\u0022 who primarily was a pilot/engineer amongst the three, but the designations were retained because NASA did require even their scientist-astronauts to become pilots who were rated in high-performance jet aircraft (in the form of the T-38). It wasn\u0027t until the Shuttle program opened the door to non-pilot astronauts that the more accurate \u0022Mission Specialist\u0022 and \u0022Payload Specialist\u0022 designations came into being.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a side note, the single most ridiculous position designation that NASA ever had was on the Apollo-Soyuz mission. For that, the three Apollo crew positions were designated as Commander, Command Module Pilot, and Docking Module Pilot. The Docking Module was not at all a spacecraft requiring a pilot; it was essentially just a docking adapter to mount the androgynous docking system that NASA and the Soviets had developed on an Apollo with minimal work, plus act as an airlock between the Soyuz\u0027s 14.7 psi natural air on-orbit atmosphere and the Apollo\u0027s 5 psi pure oxygen atmosphere. Really, the designation as DMP was probably a sop to keep \u0022Original Seven\u0022 alumnus Deke Slayton (finally making his first spaceflight after it was proven that his atrial fibrillation wasn\u0027t a flight-disqualifying issue) happy as to his official role in the mission, as opposed to being designated \u0022third pilot\u0022 or \u0022additional crewmember\u0022 or something like that...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T15:37:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice post Rdfox, very informative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a good level of redundancy with 2 LM pilots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, they could have had 2-man crew that abandoned the CSM in orbit, leaving it automated, but I don\u0027t think the technology at the time allowed this yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing back to KSP, I still bring 3 kerbals even if only 1 lands because there\u0027s quite a bit of science in the orbits between launch and landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T15:49:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deadshot462\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deadshot462\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, they could have had 2-man crew that abandoned the CSM in orbit, leaving it automated, but I don\u0027t think the technology at the time allowed this yet.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the technology just wasn\u0027t there to reliably keep the CSM safely unmanned in orbit and dock with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T15:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022deadshot462\u0022 data-cite=\u0022deadshot462\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, they could have had 2-man crew that abandoned the CSM in orbit, leaving it automated, but I don\u0027t think the technology at the time allowed this yet.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an inherent problem with that approach.
