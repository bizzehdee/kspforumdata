On another game forum I guy I know (online) lost both parents\u2014one was 102, the other 98-99 I think\u2014they were in a nursing home, already fragile by definition (healthy people are not in nursing homes, those facilities are elder-hospice).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLiterally every human I personally know from kids to my 86 year old dad, and 92 year old father in law and their family friend who is 94 have had COVID.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone worse than a cold or seasonal flu. Many in 2020 before vaccines. More vaccinated than unvaccinated at this point (most worse than my unvaccinated case in 2021, and I\u0027m in my mid-50s (was a cold, plus anosmia\u2014wrecked my wine palate for months, still sorta meh, so bourbon \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ). 85% of my wife\u0027s always-masked (still), eating in their offices alone, 100% vaccinated office staff at the cancer center got COVID in October in the span of 2 weeks. From a vaccinated doc, who got it from another vaccinated doc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been completely clear since pretty early in 2020 (check the threads here) that risk for initial COVID-19 (alpha) was 2-4X seasonal flu (and 2X as infectious). Delta was less deadly, and about twice as infectious as alpha, and omicron is even less deadly (flu like) and about twice as infectious (or more) than delta. Anyone more than 4X more worried than have been every other year of their life from seasonal flu was being irrational. That was my take in early 2020, and 4X is in the omicron era an overestimate of risk (assuming you\u0027re one of the few who has not had a cold in the last 2 years). Personally I now have ~zero concern, since I had it already. Course I assessed my covid risk before as 4X flu, and my flu concern was ~0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I get old enough I am worried about death from a cold, I\u0027ll reevaluate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the vaccines, if they were meaningfully effective, mortality should have certainly been grossly lower in the first world where nearly all elderly people were vaccinated (the bulk of people at high risk). It was \u003Cem\u003Ehigher\u003C/em\u003E in 2021 most places. Sweden did pretty well, and was highly vaccinated for people at risk (older people). My guess is that being \u0022open\u0022 normally made sense for people vaccinated since the efficacy falls off a cliff after a brief period. get vaccinated\u2014then actually get infected while under some protection, gaining broader immunity (since infection immunity will ALWAYS be better than vaccination could be for a vaccine that is part of a single protein, vs ALL the proteins in the virus).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-06-02T18:43:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2022 06:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-03T18:11:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might be a weird question to ask because of survivor bias.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone lost their lives to COVID, or really lost their life to anything, odds of getting information and knowing of that would be very very low unless there was a secondary \u0022offline\u0022 connection made\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0that connection knew about such events\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eand\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0that connection comes here and provides that information.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo withholding that scenario where there is some sort of offline/external connection, the only people here would of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0lost their lives to COVID.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point in the pandemic odds are you have been affected directly or immediately in connection with someone who has had COVID in some capacity. I personally haven\u0027t even been sick of any kind in the last few years.\u00A0 The first year and a half I was much more cautious due to underlying health conditions related to my lungs, which didn\u0027t seem to bode well for a sickness that could affect the lungs. However I\u0027ve healed and more or less went about my business as usual to this day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday I\u0027m not exactly careful, but I also don\u0027t do known high risk activities often, not out of fear, but that\u0027s just how my life is structured. Something like eating out, going to the movie theater, family functions and going into the office are all activities I don\u0027t do too often but still do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of a number of people who have gotten COVID multiple times, a few of them serious enough to end up in the hospital, but no fatalities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the US, the pandemic has moved into the final phase, where things start moving back to normal and the actual danger of the virus itself is stuffed into the other endemics of society. So yes it will still be around, yes it will kill people, yes it is dangerous, yes it will present risk to you and your loved ones, but so do all the other endemics of a multitude of kinds. The risk factors in regards to fatalities today stand a little worse than the flu, which\u00A0 will still fluctuate based on a huge number of factors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUltimately the biggest impact will be the psychological one. It\u0027s not exactly \u0022easy\u0022 to get over a few years of non-stop coverage of some global event, but that is what society will need to do to truly move on. Depending on your personal network, you could have already gotten over this long ago, or still feel like it\u0027s a serious thing. Generally the risk factors haven\u0027t changed much beyond getting lower over time due to general heard immunity. So if you\u0027re just as worried now as you were in the past, don\u0027t be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to get out of the mindset of some form of \u0022fear\u0022 is to understand you and your families risks as clearly as possible, and assess it with pre-existing risks. Just because COVID has been a big deal the last few years doesn\u0027t directly make it more risky than if you heard nothing about it. The risk is there, just because you hear about the risks (or don\u0027t hear about the risks) doesn\u0027t actually change it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
