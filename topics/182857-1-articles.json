It is also extremely slow - you should count on about 8-10 days transit time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn fact, it\u0027s very much like a small-scale version of what you\u0027d do to go from Kerbin to Duna, Dres or Jool. You need to leave the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E going prograde, while the Mun is about a quarter orbit or so behind Minmus.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou eject from the Mun into a broad orbit and catch Minmus on the other side of Kerbin. You\u0027ll almost certainly have to drag the manouvre node around the orbit a bit to get the right ejection angle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way to do it is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCheck that Minmus is ahead of the Mun. About a quarter turn should be fine, maybe a bit less, but you can compensate for error by accepting a less efficient trajectory. In any event you are unlikely to get the exact angle, since the Mun moves so much each time you complete an orbit around it, so both your ejection angle and the difference in positions between the Mun and Minmus will vary enormously from one orbit to the next.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSet Minmus as target.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop a node and set it up for a prograde ejection from the Mun to give a resulting orbit remaining within Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (assuming a standard prograde low orbit, that probably means a node on the far side of the Mun, with roughly a 350m/s burn (pure guess for that number, don\u0027t count on it!)).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrop a second node about halfway to Minmus so that you get intercept \u0022close approach\u0022 markers. If you need a plane-change correction (and you probably will), add a bit of normal or antinormal to that second node to get a better approach, but don\u0027t try to do too much yet. You need to improve the ejection burn first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo back to your first node, add or subtract prograde and drag it around your orbit until you get a very close approach.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your closest approach has Minmus relatively far ahead of you, you need to either wait an orbit or two around the Mun (since the Mun will be catching up) or you need to head more towards Kerbin so that you dip down and then rise back up to meet Minmus. In the latter case, your ejection burn and your capture burn at Minmus will be higher.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your closest approach has Minmus relatively far behind you, you\u0027ve left it a bit too late and you\u0027ll need to head out away from Kerbin (i.e. you need to drag the node back along the orbit around the Mun) with a significantly harder burn, and a significantly higher capture burn at Minmus. The only advantage is that it\u0027ll be a much quicker transfer.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo back to your second node and fine-tune your intercept.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-14T04:00:48Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2019 04:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-14T06:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I think it\u0027s easier to do it in the other order (Minmus first then the Mun on the way back) , for several reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, getting to the Mun from Minmus is pretty trivial.
