I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d trust it to give accurate modeling of actual model rocket launches. Everything from aerodynamics to engine thrust are balanced for game play, not to simulate real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat all said, I\u0027d be really interested in hearing how accurate you can get the modeling.

Good old fashioned config editing can get you the thrust of a model rocket motor, and realism overhaul can get you your aerodynamics and realistically sized earth. Thats what I would go with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-20T07:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have it on my old laptop, not this one, but there is an open source model rocket simulator out there.\u00A0 It is just graphs and math, but imagine building your KSP rocket completely in a spread sheet, with each part\u0027s dimensions and mass accounted for, and then adding a commercially available model rocket motor.\u00A0\u00A0 It will simulate the flight trajectories for you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is:\u00A0 \u003Ca href=\u0022http://openrocket.info/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://openrocket.info/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve played with it a bunch, and it\u0027s pretty neat, will fit your needs far greater than KSP will.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
