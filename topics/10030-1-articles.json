Welcome to the club. As you can tell, I\\\u0027m probably more fond of planes than spacecraft in this game. Crazy, considering it\\\u0027s Kerbal SPACE Program. One suggestion, though... a vertical stabiliser of some sort is definitely a good idea on any plane, especially as they get bigger. Not sure why, haven\\\u0027t forgotten to put one on for a long time, but it\\\u0027s just a good plan."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-29T22:35:42Z","Content":"Yes, a vertical stabilizer is a good idea. It helps keep the tail aligned with the nose, so you don\\\u0027t slip and skid sideways through turns. Also helps prevent unwanted roll.\n\nStill, nice job.
