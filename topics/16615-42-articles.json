The longer times involved with interplanetary flight would make this method tedious, though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few tricks that should be fairly easy to eyeball, though. For instance resonant encounters (where you hit the same planet multiple times in a row, ala the vidoes that LukeTim posted) should be fairly straight forward. Just eject into an orbit who\u0027s period is a nice multiple of the planets--2x, 1.5x, 2/3x, etc--coast out the the opposite apsis, and adjust your orbit to make sure you\u0027re at another nice multiple for the next time around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-30T13:28:19Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2012 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by silent_prtoagonist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pleborian","CreatedById":27820,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T14:12:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022 data-cite=\u0022royalkingofgames\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThats Scott Manleys idea\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit was no ones idea... if anything im laying claim to it right now seeing as I havent seen anyone else do this yet on youtube... apart from me in my latest systems test video \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(this is all in jest btw dont have a heart attack, the first people to suggest it was the apollo guys)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-30T14:17:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/30/2012 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 30, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Pleborian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
