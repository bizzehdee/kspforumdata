Anyway, this baking process requires quite a lot of energy - just over 1/4 of the energy required to perform the electrolysis, which means the process will be a little slower on Duna but still very achievable. I\u0027ve also upped the amount of power that the science lab can make use of while electrolysing, which should speed up the process if you have the extra power available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works the same way as normal - producing about 8x the amount of oxidiser as it does liquid fuel just a little slower than in other locations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/beieud5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022beieud5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-12T01:38:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2013 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fractal_UK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T01:36:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOut of curiousity, why does electrolyzing water produce more oxygen than hydrogen?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T01:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOut of curiousity, why does electrolyzing water produce more oxygen than hydrogen?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a by mass measure so although water has two Hydrogens, the Oxygens are 16 times as heavy as one Hydrogen.
