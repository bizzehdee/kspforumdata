For example if you want to build a lander (which you will reuse as a subassembly) composed of a Mk1 pod, T400 fuel tank and LV-909 engine which will mount onto various rockets with a decoupler then start with a dummy probe core. Place a decoupler on top of the probe core, then the engine the fuel tank and pod.
