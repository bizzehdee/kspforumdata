There\u0027s actually a substantial link between SSRI use and suicidal ideation, particularly in teenagers [1].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Robin Williams\u0027 case, there\u0027s also the issue of several decades worth of excessive cocaine use. This is known to cause substantial amounts of neurotoxicity, focussed chiefly on serotonergic systems (the thing that SSRIs target).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lajoswinkler\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnfortunatelly for me, I know what your\u0027re talking about.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou ain\u0027t the only one; my knowledge of this field is not just professional.

There are a few theories as to why [2], but nobody has a proven answer yet. Chasing this question was the thesis topic of one of my close colleagues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[2] It\u0027s possible that SSRIs may in some cases reduce depressive apathy/demotivation without actually improving mood; in lay terms, the patient still feels horrible, but now has the energy to do something about it. There\u0027s also some preliminary evidence that the impact of SSRIs on brain function differs markedly between teenagers and adults. Teenage brains aren\u0027t just younger versions of adult brains; they are a substantially different thing in terms of neurochemistry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DauntingFlyer","CreatedById":66471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T11:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/vader.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vader.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-12T13:11:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery, very sad.
