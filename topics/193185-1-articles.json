No sphere of influence, small target, but the closest approach nodes help greatly. Over time I developed my own way to catch one of these as they pass.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EMy way of rendevousing with an asteroid, there are other ways but I am familiar with this one the most, if you would like to discuss different techniques of capturing an asteroid that would be cool. Here is my way of doing it: First you launch from kerbin in a prograde orbit and change your inclination later to match the asteroid. Usually I launch a rocket and it at an orbit of 6000 km above kerbin before I track an asteroid. That way I have it readily available and can change the orbit later on when the asteroid\u0027s orbit is determined. 99% of the time it will be on an escape trajectory out of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. The key to doing this would be to match your inclination with the orbit and then put your apoapsis near it\u0027s perapsis. Or even on the same altitude. Now it\u0027s time to wait, the encounter can range between 50 days up to 200 days, but once it is reached Kerbin, time warp until it\u0027s right at the beginning of passing Kerbin, right after it entered kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Depending on how high the orbit is the orbital period can range from less than an hour to several days, if its in a high orbit, then do the rendevous burn earlier if burning prograde or burn retrograde when making an orbit and meeting up with it in less time. I usually burn prograde because with a retrograde burn, speeding up your orbital period to encounter the asteroid at the right time can sometimes not work out, with the orbit needed going into kerbins atmosphere at perapsis. When burning prograde, hover your mouse over asteroid perapsis to find out when it will reach there, then burn prograde to match that time when you make one orbit to meet up with it. It\u0027s not always perfect so fine tune it if you have to. At this point the closest approach should be under 100 KM and you can do the relative velocity burns, cancelling out the velocity you already have and then burning towards it. Don\u0027t make the velocity too slow, because it can make both your craft and the asteroid drift away from kerbin before you can do the capture burn to prevent the asteroid from escaping. I recommend 50 m/s a second for more powerful engines or 20 m/s for ions.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp dir=\u0022ltr\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ECongratulations you have docked with the asteroid and are able to do further research and maybe set up a mining base (although the returns in fuel aren\u0027t that good for anything under class E) .Good for science in career mode and you can bring these in orbit just for fun in sandbox.
