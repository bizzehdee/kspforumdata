I am not a skilled pilot though, so that doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s incapable, I just didn\u0027t seem to get very far before I ran out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liquid","CreatedById":36242,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T08:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*snip* You sir, just lost your posting privileges. -DR\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-22T09:55:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2012 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Damion Rayne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RayneCloud","CreatedById":11227,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T09:56:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease post pics from now on.
