A tip(s) for you, you NEED ASAS to go ANYWHERE (unless you are that cool) you want to stay straight 90 degrees into the sky, wait until about 10km (10,000) meters, then bank towards the ocean nearest the KSC at about 45 degrees until you get an apoapsis of about 80 km from there burn pro-grade till you have a complete orbit. add a maneuver node and play with it until you get a intercept from the mun or minmus. close the gap go to the intercept point and then burn retro grade until orbit. (I would quicksave F5) then burn retro grade again until it is lower, or onto the object, keep a good control of your speed and you should land just fine! If you are unable to even get into orbit, either keep trying, or you need to redesign it, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T01:22:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t this be on the \u0022how to\u0022 section?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"austin4050","CreatedById":66368,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T01:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell I think so, but I made it for the newcomers... crap well thank you for the suggestion!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T01:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, your article\u0027s title says it\u0027s a guide to orbiting, but you ended up teaching people how to land on Mun, and you text isn\u0027t that clear either.

Exit the 45 degree turn and turn to the horizon and cut the engine when the desired altitude is reached.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
