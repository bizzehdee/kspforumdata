I started up the game hoping to make the hop over to Laythe to discover the ship shooting back out to almost double Pol\u0027s distance...w...t...f...happened? My fuel is untouched. I have been playing with a detached probe landing on another moon since so an SoI change couldn\u0027t have affected it. This concerns me. I think im getting bugged out here because I swear I entered Jool\u0027s system prograde. I cant remember exactly, but that was a wtf moment for me too. And this tells me that it all could\u0027ve been from a glitch. Its not all bad.. I guess. Im going to try and correct the orbit at periapsis and see if I can enter the system in the right direction this time.
