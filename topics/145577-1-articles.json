The deserts of Yeflana shimmered tranquilly below, baked by the sun. An ideal day for flying. Far below his port wing, a metallic glint raced along, leaving a slowly expanding contrail in its wake. A People\u0027s Self-Defence Interceptor on patrol, maybe. Or a Tespen fighter, probing for weaknesses. Such intrusions were becoming a lot more common recently. In either case, Matrick didn\u0027t worry. He was too high for any ordinary jet to reach, and obviously flying a sportsplane besides. No threat to anybody, until it came to a competition. Nobody had flown higher or faster than Matrick Otreised. Only a few in the world had the skill and knowledge to even come close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe glanced quickly down at his instruments, registering airspeed, temperature and pressure, before looking out of his cockpit\u0027s floor window at the sparse cumulus clouds below. Potentially some good updraughts, high atmospheric pressure... Promising record breaking conditions. With a small adjustment to the trim tabs and a slight opening of the throttle, the aircraft began to rise. 14,900m...\u00A015,000... 15,100... As the aircraft rose through the record altitude and the engine began to wheeze, Matrick felt a slight kick from the rudder pedals, before all hell broke loose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGround crews would later reconstruct those few moments from on-board telemetry. Matrick\u0027s aircraft had risen into a strong crosswind, causing the vertical stabiliser to stall. The sudden loss of yaw control caused the nose to snap sharply to the right. The port wing was yanked forward at the same time as the starboard wing was thrown back. The drop in airspeed over the wing caused the tip to stall, and the increased drag threw the plane into a spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll Matrick knew was that suddenly the horizon wasn\u0027t where he expected it to be and his ears were ringing with a jarring symphony of alarms and klaxons. He swallowed back the rising panic and tried to take stock of the situation. Upright spin. Nothing too earth-shattering there. Standard procedure. Drop power, neutralise ailerons, counteract the spin with the rudder, drop the nose to pick up speed. Counteract the stall. Change underwear. Easy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe pressed down hard on the rudder pedal with his left foot. No reaction. Craning his neck to look around, he was just in time to see the last drops of hydraulic fluid drain from the ruined rudder assembly. He pushed the stick forward, even as he realised it would have no effect. The control surfaces all ran from the same hydraulic system. Design flaw. Stupid, stupid, stupid.\u00A012,000 metres to figure out a way to recover a spinning aircraft with no control surfaces.

In essence, it was a giant, awkwardly-shaped frisbee. A lawn dart doesn\u0027t spin. An arrow doesn\u0027t spin. All he had to do was turn his plane into a lawn dart, and fuel was the key to doing that. His aircraft had four fuel tanks, one forward, one aft, on each side of the fuselage. Fuel could be pumped forwards and aft between them to control aircraft trim at high altitudes when the aerodynamic surfaces weren\u0027t up to the job. Each of the aft tanks also had a fuel dump system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatrick flicked the isolator switches for port and starboard fuel pumps, set them both to \u0022forward\u0022, and watched the needles on the gauges start to move.

Matrick had stopped the spin, but at the expense of turning his aircraft into a nose-heavy dart intent on burying itself in the desert, cockpit first. He took a quick look at the altimeter and calculated there was about 45 seconds separating him from becoming the centrepiece of a terribly avant-garde and thought-provoking piece of modern art smouldering on the sand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst things first. Full flaps. As the trailing edge of the wings hinged downwards into the airflow, digging into it, acting as an airbrake, Matrick could feel the deceleration dragging him towards his aircraft\u0027s nose. As the speed began to drop, his gloved hand returned once more to the fuel pump controls, this time setting both sides to \u0022aft\u0022. Shifting the centre of mass further towards the tail. Being gentle. If he started to spin again, he wasn\u0027t going to be recovering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the crippled aircraft began to lift its nose, Matrick allowed himself a smile. Flying a plane with no control surfaces was like sailing a boat with no rudder. Not exactly easy, but a decent pilot could manage. It was just a question of anticipating what was going to disturb the fragile balance and counteracting it early. Early and gently, because it was all too easy to overcompensate. With that in mind, he eased open the throttle slightly, as the nose of the aircraft slowly rose past the horizon line. The dorsally-mounted engine whined slightly as its compressor spun up to speed, the asymmetric thrust balancing the plane, and putting it into a controlled flight. 130 knots, 900 metres altitude, sink rate zero.

His contact had told him not to hurry, not to attract attention, but he found that almost impossible to do. Walking too quickly, holding his briefcase too tightly, he was sure he stood out like a sore thumb among the regular citizens of the sleepy capital of Eflen\u0027s smallest republic. Knowing that made him even more nervous, and made him clutch his briefcase tighter still. From the university to the meeting place was barely a ten minute walk. To Tombart it seemed like it took hours, and when he finally reached his destination, he was drenched in sweat, in spite of the frigid morning mountain air. His contact was waiting for him.

At the bottom of a shallow depression lay the remains of a shattered Elbas-19. The wings had been torn off by the force of the impact. Unidentifiable debris was scattered in a trail, ending in the broken remains of the cockpit. There was no sign of the pilot.

The crater from the mortar smoking close by to her left. Putting a hand up to avoid a fall onto her neck, she unclipped the buckle on her seatbelt and dropped to the floor. No broken bones, and apart from a painful\u00A0ringing in her eardrums, she seemed uninjured. Looking back towards where her squadmates should have been, she could only see Angrid\u0027s arm sticking out from under the jeep, elbow bent at a horrible angle, with the weight of the vehicle resting firmly on it. There was no sign of Desbald.\u00A0Jadra was trained as a driver and combat mechanic. There wasn\u0027t much she could do for the Corporal. Not without a lever and a lot more time than she probably had, with a Yeflanan mortar crew probably reloading at that very moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe ran a few steps uphill, towards the north, and freedom, then stopped to look downhill. Setting her jaw, she turned and ran back down towards the wreckage of the aircraft, the reason she\u0027d been sent over the border. Patches of burning vegetation and jet fuel grew denser and denser as she approached the cockpit, and the heat was almost unbearable. Jadra could see the paint blistering on the fuselage near some of the more intense fires. Still no second mortar. She reached into the cockpit through the smashed canopy, desperately fumbling with the catches on the instrument panel as she felt her skin beginning to burn. Half-blinded by the choking smoke, she finally managed to prise the panel free, and reach in behind it. She found what she was looking for by feel and wrenched it out, before sprinting away from the smoke and the heat. She paused for a few seconds to examine her prize.

Too early for a beer, and nobody ever wants to do a shakedown. Just promise not to break her this time. Those lovely PEB guys would have to redirect the car. You\u0027d miss that breakfast.

His flight plan called for a gentle series of manoeuvres over the desert to the north of the airfield. He looked back at the duffel bag wedged into the cockpit behind his head, and then pushed the stick gently to the right. The aircraft\u00A0banked to starboard, and kept climbing, out over the sea, to an altitude no fighter could hope to reach, drop tanks hanging from its belly like some sort of strange fruit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd in the\u00A0Embassy in Amblia, Tombart lay on a spartan bunk and looked at the ceiling.

It had started out life as a small fortress on a hillock, one of the few dry spots in a marsh that stretched all the way to the horizon. From this nigh-impregnable position, its influence had spread through trade and conquest, until the Atlavandian Empire covered a quarter of the globe, almost completely surrounding the ocean that shared its name.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the city had spread too, from the hill which was now covered in elaborate plazas and the well-appointed villas of rich merchants, to the warren of streets, bridges and canals surrounding it, thronged with boats, rickshaws and Kerbals. And at the peak of the hill stood the Imperial Palace, grand spires and steeply-sloping roofs soaring over the columns of the breathtaking facade. In the Imperial bedchamber, the Glorious and Serene Rightful Emperor of the Atlavandian People and Their Vassals, a middle-aged Kerbal in his 92nd year,\u00A0was awoken by the ringing of the Imperial Telephone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Emperor Kermor speaking.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis sister\u0027s voice grated in his ear from a no doubt tacky and unimpressive palace in East Atlavand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kermor, how\u0027s life in the swamp?

It made the verbal sparring between the two siblings much easier. When the succession war had first broken out 70 years previously, they had had to send their insults and threats via courier. This \u0022hotline\u0022 made things much simpler, especially now the novelty of ringing the Empress at 3AM simply to wake her up had worn off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022As appealing as that sounds, I have a more... cooperative proposition\u0022 said Empress Kerlness. \u0022There has been too much fighting.

That usurper dared to hang up on him? He should assemble the army and invade the Saggow Marsh. That would show her. He stomped off down the corridor to toward the war room\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn East Atlavand, Kerlness looked up her next phone call. Perhaps the Tespens would be more reasonable, if only to spite her brother.

Matrick had been in the air for almost eight hours, and could now see the mountains of Amblia poking above the horizon. Behind them was the Eslen alliance, and freedom. Even if his engine failed him, he was now within gliding range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe had picked his destination almost without thinking. Yeflanan propaganda was pervasive:\u00A0Tespens were elitist snobs who mercilessly\u00A0exploited their brainwashed and coerced serfs to make life better for the rich and noble.

The list went on and on\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the Eslen Alliance were an undisciplined, individualistic rabble. Spoiled and petulant because of the accident of nature that had given them a fertile maritime plain surrounded by mountains, instead of a barren desert surrounded by enemies. They would never be a great nation like Yeflana, so the school textbooks said, because they refused to work towards the common good, the member republics only looking out for their own needs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatrick liked the sound of it.

Tombart was not sure where he was going to be taken, his contact hadn\u0027t told him, and remained silent as he sat in the back seat. Over the mountains via treacherous and twisting back roads, staying just one step ahead of the chasing police cars? Or maybe to a sleepy port where they would board a vessel registered in Bableina, but actually run by Zeswurgian pirates? He felt like he was in one of the melodramatic films he used to enjoy so much when he was a kerblet, and was almost disappointed when the car turned onto a perfectly normal road, leading the the airport. A plane was still exciting, but it was no Zeswurgian pirate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe car pulled into the airport and stopped beside a low building. The Yeflanan wordlessly stood up and entered, emerging a few seconds later with two heavyset Kerbals. Tombart couldn\u0027t quite dispel the feeling that something was very wrong. One of the new arrivals motioned for him to wind down his window, which he did only reluctantly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Dr. Tombart?\u0022 he said \u0022Agent Timford, Amblian Security. We\u0027re going to have to ask you to step inside. You are under arrest for the illegal sale of classified aerospace information to Yeflana.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTombart\u0027s contact waited on the fringes of the group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sorry Comrade Tombart. It would appear somebody made an offer that was worth more to our leaders than you were. I hope my prediction regarding your execution doesn\u0027t prove to be too inaccurate. Now if you will excuse me, I have other business to attend to\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd he strode off towards the terminal building, Tombart staring balefully after him as handcuffs were snapped onto his wrists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------------------------------------------------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatrick guided his aircraft in gently towards Runway 3 of Amblia International Airport, the mountains rising to port, and to starboard, across a grassy plain, lay the sea. He would no doubt have been missed in Yeflana by now. The car to pick him up would surely have arrived to find his room empty. He hoped Samly would\u0027t take any of the blame for his escape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA gust of wind brought him back to the moment. His aircraft was designed for altitude and endurance. It weighed barely anything, had a huge amount of lift, and really didn\u0027t enjoy pilots who tried to make it be on the ground. And with those enormous wings, it was very easy for a stiff breeze to blow the aircraft into all sorts of strange configurations, as he had discovered on his last flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plane floated down towards the runway, flaps fully extended, Matrick making small adjustments to the controls to keep the trim just how he wanted, pulling back on the stick to flare the craft just before the rear wheels touched down. No bounce, no weaving, a perfect landing to impress his new hosts. As Matrick slowed down and began to roll slowly towards the taxiway, a small fleet of cars and small trucks filled with soldiers screeched over. A welcoming committee!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatrick popped the canopy and let himself down the ladder before walking towards the assembled Kerbals, keeping his hands visible so they would see he was no threat to them. A broad smile coming unbidden to his face as he got his first breaths of freedom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd suddenly parted, and Matrick\u0027s stomach knotted. Through the gap marched a tall Kerbal wearing an overcoat and a hat with a five-pointed red star.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENo!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHow?!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Comrade Matrick.

His troops had taken the Imperial Causeway, and his sister was trapped inside the city. Plumes of smoke rose from multiple fires caused by his army\u0027s shelling.

The thesis is due in February, so I\u0027m just slogging through the literature review now. Reading about one reference for every two sentences really makes the whole process drag! Hopefully things will speed up once I get onto writing up the results, as most of them are already written in some form from journal articles and conference papers. At least, that\u0027s what I\u0027m telling myself!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interlude was an idea I had on the back burner for when I didn\u0027t have time to worry about taking the story forwards. So now I\u0027ve used that one up! I have got a rough idea for the next instalment in my head though. Hopefully I\u0027ll find some time over the next few weeks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
