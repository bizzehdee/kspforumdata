The Apollo and other space missions in real life all transmissions were and are important, the most insignificant thing added to our understanding of humans traveling in space or enabling future manned and unmanned missions to be succesful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead of diminishing returns there could be a random percentage of failed transmission if the object is to reduce science gained. But if a transmission is succesful it should be 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine if the MSL Curiosity could only send one transmission for each experiment? That would be considered a waste and no one in their right mind would back the expenditure for such a mission. The temperature recordings are ALL useful and it can drill and send results more than once. Magnetics, moister, CO2, and other gases, etc. etc., each and every transmission is useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the way science is gained has to be rethought in order to make the game more realistic in terms of science gathering, the changes made in version .23 were a step back in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is your opinion on this issue?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T06:13:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot all data can be transmitted.

I\u0027m not much of a rocket scientist, but I think they\u0027d agree that it\u0027s better to have physical first-hand access to the information than have to transmit it across the solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaia","CreatedById":95282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T07:16:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think only data based experiments should be 100% transmittable i.e. temperatue scan or something.

Things like spectrometers and sample analysis are much MUCH more accurate when they\u0027re done here on earth. So surface samples, goo samples and material bay samples shouldn\u0027t have 100% transmission values. I would agree for the small experiments though. Maybe make it so the lab boosts them to 100%, it doesn\u0027t make much sense that you have to bring them back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, realism does not equal fun. In reality you have to waste hundreds of man hours to simulate trajectories, this isn\u0027t much fun. KSP is first and foremost a game and a space sim a distant second. If you make every science transmission viable you\u0027re just going to end up with transmission spam again, which wasn\u0027t a whole lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xnorb","CreatedById":99549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-10T08:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbsolutely no to random failrate ...
