For much better performance in the long run, consider getting a Nvidia card; their PhysX software is built into Unity 5 and so this will offer a nice performance boost compared to nowadays. I\u0027m not sure what sort of multithreading improvements Unity 5 will bring, so I can\u0027t advise you there, but if someone knows more about that sort of thing, feel free to improve on this answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy computer has the following specifications (I\u0027ve omitted parts which don\u0027t have much of an impact on performance, e.g. the motherboard, hard drives, etc.):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECPU:\u003C/strong\u003E Intel 4670K (3.4 GHz)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGPU:\u003C/strong\u003E Nvidia GeForce GTX760\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERAM:\u003C/strong\u003E 8 GB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also run the game on an SSD, which makes loading the game up \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, go for a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM and a reasonable graphics card.

So, each processor can have it\u0027s own cache but with integrated graphics, the GPU shares the same cache as the CPU (in your case you have a 1024 killobytes L2 Cache and no L3 Cache).

However, the CPU may become the bottleneck which would cap the amount of improvement you actually get. The bigger concerns lie elsewhere. Video cards can be large, so you may not have room in the chasis. So take measurements where it would go to find your clearanc. Caution: Either shut your PC down or use a measuring tape (sewing), not a tape measure (construction) which is metal and can cause damage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have to be concerned about power supply, as bigger video cards need more power. See if you can find any information printed on the power supply unit that might indicate it\u0027s capability. You need to know the wattage and ideally the Amperage on the 12 volt rail. Sometimes they don\u0027t publish all of that unfortunately and wattage alone can be misleading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for which card specifically, I will have to defer that question to others. My card is as old as your computer (which isn\u0027t easy to find for sale anymore) and that is the last time I did any research.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T23:06:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 11:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T23:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had it running on max settings on a gt210 its about the same performance as on my gtx640 on the sak machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eother games are a different story, but KSP is just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T23:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pipcard\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pipcard\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...on the highest graphics settings, with fancy visual enhancement mods, at 60 fps (30 fps at least)?
