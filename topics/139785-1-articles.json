The big hurdle is that each world is an altitude map made from virtual splines sticking straight out from the center of the world, and its center of mass is the same as the center of the splines. They are also procedurally generated using fractal seeds to generate the majority of the terrain including the general style of the terrain. For example Minmus\u0027 flats are probably created by having the terrain generator pop the lowlands up to a specific altitude, then another factor smooths out the edge of the flats so there isn\u0027t a sharp corner there. Only specific features such as the obelisks or the Kraken corpse were actually constructed entirely by hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA person could easily make a rough 3D sketch of the lopsided world they want, and then determine the position of its center of mass using volume calculations on the computer.

I can\u0027t tag people ATM, but if someone brought over NathanKell, I\u0027m sure he could accurately explain something.
