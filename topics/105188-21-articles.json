Version 0.90 should have been 0.26, and version 1.0 should have been 0.27.\n\nFor most games, being in Alpha for four years would be considered \u0022development hell\u0022. However, KSP is different. Squad allowed us to buy in during Alpha, like Tom Sawyer whitewashing a fence. It is a strategy that worked amazingly well, and I hope it makes HarvesteR a billionaire.\n\nFor some reason, however, this year things have been rushed through Beta and release. Except they really aren\u0027t beta and release versions. The game mechanics are still changing. That\u0027s Alpha. Beta is when the game mechanics do NOT change, you\u0027re just looking for and vanquishing bugs. The release version is the Beta version with as many bugs killed as is cost-effective, and again with NO changes to the basic game mechanics.\n\nWith the changes to Ore and the new flight model, both major changes, a whole host of new possible bugs have been introduced. This is always the case when one makes major (and in this case, saved-game breaking) changes.\n\nI can understand wanting to give long-time players something new with the release version. IIRC Eeloo was introduced merely as a placeholder for what would eventually become the second gas giant planet in the system. \n\nI propose that Squad take a step backwards. Admit the game is still in Alpha, and give yourselves a few more months. Bring in a few more of the top modders like Ferram and r4m0n, and in the final stages of Alpha modify the game mechanics for the final time. Then go back to Beta, no changes to game mechanics, just ferreting out bugs and balancing values. And then for the re-release, put in Gas Giant 2."},{"CreatedByName":"diegzumillo","CreatedById":4869,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T05:13:05Z","Content":"I agree that releasing a final version with so many new things was not very smart. But they wanted the release to make a big splash, and you can\u0027t do that if the release version is identical to the game I was playing a week ago.

Not the most elegant way to release a game but I\u0027m totally ok with it, the release version is more than a fully working game, it\u0027s probably my favorite game of all time. The only sin they committed, in my humble opinion, is the lack of a decent information panel.

Older, in fact, than any version of KSP I had ever played. (I started in Oct 2013). So...back to the drawing board again! \n\nWe will be purchasing a few copies of KSP for contest winners.
