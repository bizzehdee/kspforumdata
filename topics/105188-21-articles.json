Except they really aren\u0027t beta and release versions. The game mechanics are still changing. That\u0027s Alpha. Beta is when the game mechanics do NOT change, you\u0027re just looking for and vanquishing bugs.

IIRC Eeloo was introduced merely as a placeholder for what would eventually become the second gas giant planet in the system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose that Squad take a step backwards. Admit the game is still in Alpha, and give yourselves a few more months. Bring in a few more of the top modders like Ferram and r4m0n, and in the final stages of Alpha modify the game mechanics for the final time. Then go back to Beta, no changes to game mechanics, just ferreting out bugs and balancing values.

If Squad wasn\u0027t financially solvent they would have either: 1) sold KSP to a publisher; 2) formed a strategic alliance with another developer; or, 3) opened Squad up to investors. Since none of those scenarios has appeared, it is safe to assume that when Squad says they have enough capital to finish KSP - along with financing a film (allegedly) and whatever other projects they have going at the moment - that they mean it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELikewise it is amusing that the assumption is that Squad initiated the partnerships, whereas it is just as likely that Squad was the one approached. The fact that those speculating that generating multiple revenue streams and/or embracing cobranding efforts (fancy term for \u0022makin\u0027 swag\u0022) is an indication of financial instability must then be convinced that the partnership between Thrustmaster and Ferrari on their steering wheels is a sign that one of those companies has \u0022run out of money\u0022 and is making \u0022crazy decisions\u0022 because if a business \u0022doesn\u0027t need the money\u0022 then they wouldn\u0027t be trying to \u0022make money\u0022 because \u0022making money\u0022 is \u0022bad business sense.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about we leave the speculation and second-guessing about Squad\u0027s financial and marketing decisions to someone that is not a gamer and who understands how to grow a business properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey don\u0027t even charge for them now.
