Either the deletion of a file, or a strange bug is causing this. Just in case, I\u0027d like a copy of the stock GameData files if possible. If not, i would like to know how to go about fixing this.

The missing textures are still there. I bet there\u0027s a mod that\u0027s goofing all this up.\n\nEdit: Nope. Not a mod that\u0027s causing all this mayhem. I\u0027ll need some sort of access to the actual GameData files. Nothing has worked as of yet. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T03:06:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Silverfishstix**\n  \nAdded Info"},{"CreatedByName":"fangflight","CreatedById":118144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:52:49Z","Content":"I have this exact same issue on the unmodified game."}]}
