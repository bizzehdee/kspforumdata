My KSP install seems to crash at random times (often when switching back to KSC from either VAB or from flying a craft). The error log is in the link.

Instead of using ATM to manage your textures, as your logs suggest, try using the method I posted here - [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115069-0-90-Possible-Windows-Memory-Wall-Crash-Workaround](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115069-0-90-Possible-Windows-Memory-Wall-Crash-Workaround) \n\nI too was using ATM, but with all the mods I had installed, ATM was not able to manage all the textures and still keep them high enough quality to look good. After much trial and error, I came up with the workaround I posted in the link above."},{"CreatedByName":"G2V","CreatedById":140657,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T11:58:19Z","Content":"Did the workaround, works a treat!
