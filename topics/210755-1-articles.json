If you know everything about Duna (rough orbit, atmosphere, temperature, etc) but still need to have the Kerbals discover it in-game than that is alot less fun than knowing nothing about Duna and learning those things when it gets discovered in game. It might even feel like a chore if you do it for the n-th time, unless the discovery gameplay is very compelling. Observatories probably wouldn\u0027t be, satellites might work since they tie in the core gameplay loop.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we ever get in a place where KSP X can generate interesting systems and planets procedurally then discovery could become a central part of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd discussing this I wonder if it would be a good idea for me to stay away from info about the new systems as much as possible...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"\u673A\u68B0\u4E3B\u655971\u53F7","CreatedById":208023,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-28T02:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninfact, all the planets in\u00A0solar system were discovered before the first rocket. so...no more planet to be discovered in kerbal system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-28T02:30:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2022 02:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by \u673A\u68B0\u4E3B\u655971\u53F7\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-28T15:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight be as simple as having them as low-res 2D images in the tracking station/encyclopedia until you actually visit, then they show up mapped. So you get blurry/low-res map data until you visit, and it incentivizes a polar orbiter to un-blur the whole planet. But would also have to be pretty easy to un-blur the whole plant because frequently having partially-blurred planets would be maddening.

It would incentivize setting up a first colony and building a special Radio Astronomy building, that would identify all DebDeb celestial bodies in one go, albeit at that low-res level, so you can start planning your visits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tstein","CreatedById":223854,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-07T11:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224203505\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669602596\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208023\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022\u673A\u68B0\u4E3B\u655971\u53F7\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/27/2022 at 11:29 PM, \u673A\u68B0\u4E3B\u655971\u53F7 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninfact, all the planets in\u00A0solar system were discovered before the first rocket. so...no more planet to be discovered in kerbal system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut in the OTHER systems...\u00A0 it is a different story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nirgal","CreatedById":211448,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T18:21:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember the devs/Nate saying this is a feature they will be included in KSP2 (using space telescopes to find new systems/planets)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really want the exploration of new star systems to be an iterative process, first you develop telescope data, then ascertain there may be a celestial body with x mass and x atmospheric composition, but not much else, then send a probe etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLater in the game you\u0027d of course have the tech to just launch a colony ship regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-12-11T18:22:06Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2022 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Nirgal\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-12-11T23:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224202028\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022210755\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221669276144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208489\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jastrone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/24/2022 at 6:49 PM, jastrone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni have heard this before on the forum and it seems like a pretty\u00A0 popular idea but the main issue is that tou would have to do one boring mission where you just send an exploration sattelite to a new place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy boring?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose missions in real lift have been pretty inspiring voyages of discovery.
