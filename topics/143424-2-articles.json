You could have funding play a part as well: Company A will give you a science boost if you establish a radio communication relay in orbit/on the surface.

This way, players would have to send probes as well as crewed missions, and there are good reasons in career saves to return to a place even when you\u0027ve already planted a flag there. It would also bring more importance to science probes, with perhaps a few adjustments to transmission values of experiments: some science equipment could be used primarily\u00A0for probes and autonomous landers (the thermometer and barometer, for example) whilst others (mystery goo, science jr, and anything else which realistically would require physical sample returns) would need a crewed mission to get a good amount of science data from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl;dr\u003Cbr\u003E\nBasically I feel like a slight overhaul of \u0022explore [celestial body]\u0022 contracts could do more to improve interest in the current Kerbol system than changes to the actual planets could, because it would give players more reasons to send new missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe already have that in the \u0022perform x experiment in y\u0022.

Ideally, bases that are useful for something. Maybe caves, maybe some stock version of off-world construction. What I\u0027d really like is a good game play reason to use rovers, other than earning credits (which I often have more than needed) and better driving. Wheels are pretty much broken now, but even if they are made to work, driving rovers across long distances means driving across dull graphics for 10\u002B real time minutes hoping you won\u0027t tip over and have to rever to ten minutes ago. So, maybe something other than \u0022parts explode\u0022, so you can actually fix an stranded rover, being able to save while moving over the surface, better grip (maybe wheels designed for each body/gravity) and (since rovers are complicated to deliver due their shape) the ability to put together rovers in site -
