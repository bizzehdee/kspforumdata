This features the use of skipper engines as the Vulcain, with a custom pipes on the side, as using a KR-2L is not only underpowered, but also in terms of size not as exact. \n\nThe SRB\u0027s feature thrust curves using the clipped SRBs, which burnout one by one to simulate the slow tapering of SRBs. This replica also applies as a Ariane 5G\u002B, but not exactly a Ariane 5ES (More SRB fuel/power, Bigger engine, slightly larger core.)\n\nThe 2nd stage is equipped with round fuel tanks, built using a combo of RCS spheres and Round-8 tanks clipped to make a ball. The Interstage between it and the core is structural panels to avoid faring bugs. \n\nThis replica features SYLDA, the 2 satellite adapter. It is a fairing, which allows for an accurate shape, but still confetti... \n\nThe Satellites are inspired by the Eurostar 2000 bus and the GEOStar-2. Below is the launch sequence pictures.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

This is where you are likely to stay at in pitch for most of the flight.\n\n-Dump farings, dump Cryogenic First stage. \n\n-Ignite 2nd stage and feel free to fly how you\u0027d like, but keep going vertical, and reach a height of 2868km, and you are in GTO.\n\n-Once you jettison the spacecrafts, warp to apoapsis, and burn till you are in GEO (KEO?). The upper spacecraft has more thrust, but less Delta-V, while the bottom has more, but only 1/9th the thrust.\n\nEnjoy! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:04:56Z","Content":"Cool!"},{"CreatedByName":"SaturnianBlue","CreatedById":141267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:05:43Z","Content":"Thank you! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T21:16:19Z","Content":"You have quite a hand for cool looking satellites.
