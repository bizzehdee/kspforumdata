I changed the fullscreen resolution to 1240xsomething and found that it was too big. The problem now is that because of the new oversized resolution, I can no longer find the \u0027Accept\u0027 or \u0027Apply\u0027 buttons necessary to change the resolution, or any other graphical settings. Is there another way of doing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T21:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP generally shouldn\u0027t let you change to a higher resolution than the operating system reports your display can accept, if you\u0027re using a TV then try having a look in it\u0027s menu to see if it\u0027s got an overscan setting - turning that off is a good ideal generally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut to change the resolution just open the settings.cfg file in your KSP directory and change the following lines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCREEN_RESOLUTION_WIDTH = 1920\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESCREEN_RESOLUTION_HEIGHT = 1200\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-11T21:13:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, deleting the settings.cfg will cause KSP to generate a new one with the default settings, just in case you mess up your file \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
