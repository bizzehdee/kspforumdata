Gene and Bobak seem especially restless. With the recent speech by USKR leader Aaron Kerman, many of us are starting to doubt that it will be us - the Kerbal States - sending the first satellite into orbit. The administrators told us to not focus too hard on it, and as a result the Spaceplane Hangar\u00A0teams have been a little more than busy over the past few months. In the tail end of 1955, we accomplished the first polar landing by plane, even though the crew was bound to the plane and didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back. The KS Navy thankfully had a patrol ship in the area loading up on supplies in a\u00A0village a bit further north. The plane was damaged beyond repair on the second landing in the local area, flipping on its roof. We\u0027ve even tried to send a flight out to the North Pole, but simulations showed the mountains on the way are a little too high for the Freedom 1 to pass over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAside from that, we\u0027ve already achieved suborbital flight. An engineer swung by earlier today and told us their readying\u00A0Voyager III for launch again. Some say the Voyager series was a ripoff of the USKR\u0027s\u00A0\u0022Grestin\u0022 series, or the USKR stole the design from us - I personally think it\u0027s a coincidence of designs, but it\u0027s a little controversial around the space center. Back on topic, the launch will probe the outer space region with a magnetometer - which none of us really know what it does, which is why we have a scientist on staff during missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the controllers are also being reassigned to a tracking facility in the East across the bay from the space center. They haven\u0027t released a list of names yet, but for some reason I heavily suspect I\u0027m going there instead of staying for the action here at the space center. Gene told me not to worry so much - the team there will still get a chance to control satellites once they\u00A0lose connection with the space center. It probably won\u0027t be the only tracking facility operating. To take my mind off of some of the stresses of working at a space center, I set up my telescope I got for Christmas last year. I haven\u0027t shared any discoveries with the science team, mainly due to the lack of anything they would find interesting up there that they haven\u0027t found first. Gene is encouraging me to keep a record of what I find in the sky and eventually report it to the science team. So far, I haven\u0027t found anything especially of interest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Out of the entry, OOC: This is my first fan work of literally any game, and I\u0027ve been inspired to start one after reading Ussari, Alien Skies, Kerbin Elcano Exploration Project, and now Kerny Kerman\u0027s Journal.

As Flight Director, you are now authorized to know \u003Ci\u003Eeverything \u003C/i\u003Eat the space center, including classified projects.\u201D The airman and sailor in the room didn\u2019t so much as flinch since I entered the room. Dr. Henry passed along two folders towards my end of the table.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the folders was marked \u201CClassified Projects\u201D in bold, red letters. The other was marked \u201CYour Responsibilities and Duties as a Flight Director\u201D in bold, but black letters. Dr. Henry instructed me to open whichever folder I pleased. I then opened the folder containing my responsibilities and duties. Reading the only booklet in the folder, I know learned my responsibilities included:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOverseeing flight operations\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaking sure my team is on task\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTaking responsibility for both my actions and my teams\u0027 actions\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd selecting a compatible team to ensure proper functionality.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI also learned that, excluding myself, the entire Mission Control Center was on leave until I get spare time to select members of my team. Upon asking Dr. Henry, he said to pick whenever you want. I elected to conduct the interviews on the 1\u003Csup\u003Est\u003C/sup\u003E of October.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final pages of the booklet contained names of potential team members and their most compatible positions within the control center. I elected to leave out the Public Affairs Officer that I would have for my team, as I felt it was not necessary at this stage of space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDr. Henry then instructed me to open the Classified Projects folder at my leisure, but strictly when I was alone, and with that, ended the meeting. The door was unlocked, and we all filed out of the room followed by the guards. I suspected this wasn\u2019t the last I would see of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReturning to my station with lunch, there was a very important looking kerbal standing at the entrance to my office. He had to be wearing at least 13 ribbons on his chest, one of which also happened to be the Marine Commendation ribbon. He introduced himself as Brigadier General Hayes. I unlocked my door and he followed me into my office \u2013 I took an educated guess that he might want the door locked and the blinds shut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral Hayes announced he was working for Project Sandcastle. He shared with me sensitive information that essentially dimmed down to the government\u2019s plans to put a kerbal on the Mun sometime in the future, and elaborated secondary goals that included putting the first kerbal in space, the first satellite in orbit around both Kerbin and the Mun, and then the first kerbal in orbit of both bodies as well. He said I was also considered the \u201Cflag officer of the space agency,\u201D and was hereby promoted to Air Kadet of the Kerbin Military Defense Force Space Forces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGeneral Hayes, finished with his briefing, asked for the door to be unlocked as he had to return to a classified site, obviously not knowing I was now part of Sector J. Like the guards, I assumed this would not be my last encounter with him, but merely my first. As I am writing this entry, it is now getting later and later by the minute and I should close this entry for the night. I have a sneaking suspicion It will be a busy day for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Unturned_Fighter","CreatedById":183292,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-13T10:39:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just wanted to let folks know that the thread is not dead - I am busy doing some play sessions for future chapters and writing the next said chapter - it should be ready in a day or two.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
