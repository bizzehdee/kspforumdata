More complicated task is to stabilize pitch and altitude; see the post by Iskierka and the following discussion that explains this stuff:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6341.msg85631#msg85631\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=6341.msg85631#msg85631\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, fins should have slightly negative incidence (-1\u00C2\u00B0 to -2\u00C2\u00B0 would suffice) to make the plane pitch up while it has enough speed, and pitch down if it hasn\\\u0027t. What prevents a plane from constantly pitching up and going to stratosphere (or tipping over) is the engine thrust; it must be \u003Cem\u003Ejust enough\u003C/em\u003E for the plane to stay aloft. And it seems that fins tuning just cannot be done with \u003Cem\u003Epure \u003C/em\u003EC7 (since the game provides no means to change wings incidence); you\\\u0027ll need to edit some .CFG files... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee my Drone pack (link in my signature) as an example of completely stable UAV flying straight for almost 1 hour \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
