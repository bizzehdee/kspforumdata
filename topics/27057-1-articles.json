I retried the takeoff about a dozen times, always the same thing, regardless of control input or SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I took her back to the hangar, doubled up on the landing gear and took her back to the runway.

Thing is, everything is in symmetry and well reinforced, I can\u0027t for the life of me figure out why I can\u0027t get it off the ground. Anyone else ever have this problem, or have some tips and tricks to solving it? thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S., it\u0027s a twin-fuselage plane, so only the front end is truly properly linked, despite all my bracing, and the back may be oscillating in and out enough to skew the gear.

In my case the plane wasn\u0027t bending enough to be a problem (it\u0027s extremely rigid and reinforced. The docking port is only for holding the payload), and the wheels were perfectly in alignment (using snap-to geometry and symmetry settings), HOWEVER, it turns out that if the front wheels are on \u0022backwards\u0022 (aka, they open down and forward instead of down and back), the front wheels will buckle and sway, causing the plane to tilt and veer to the side and crash. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt first I thought switching to the trusses from pylons had fixed it, but after rearranging the plane again the problem came back. Then I flipped the front wheels around and viola! problem solved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the flight instability, it turns out that kerbal engineers haven\u0027t figured out how to make fly-by-wire vectored-thrust systems work nicely together... the front engines were gimballing the wrong way and turning the nose the opposite direction from where I wanted it to go. Locking the gimbals fixed it, and I achieved SSTO in the first flight after fixing them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T00:42:15Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 12:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
