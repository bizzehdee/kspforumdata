Coincidentally, I then saw a video on Reddit of someone doing a \u0022suicide burn\u0022 and saw him switch to the Radial Out on the navball \u003Cstrong\u003Ein surface mode\u003C/strong\u003E, and used it exactly the way I imagined it should be used, and once it clicked for me, it\u0027s like the whole game opened up in a new way. Now I can maneuver precisely like I never could before, and things that seemed impossible or too challenging to do repeatedly can become routine. Such as... grounded docking. (as an aside, I had before some moderate success with using\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/Bky2PZ1MEHo\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Erobotics\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for grounded docking, but that success was short lived as I quickly\u00A0learned that robot parts are packed with napalm and kraken bait)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBehold - Station \u0022Yellowstone\u0022 on the surface of Mun!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uv09aBO.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.50\u0022 height=\u0022672\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uv09aBO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022p4Bwalr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.75\u0022 height=\u0022673\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/p4Bwalr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first part to hit the ground was the module to the rear in these images, with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and passenger cabins. I posted about that in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/27292-what-did-you-do-in-ksp-today/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=3896827\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Edaily update thread\u003C/a\u003E a few days ago. Yesterday I added the science module and docked the two halves on the surface of the Mun. The science unit was launched with the same strategy as the power\u00A0unit, except this one was assembled in kerbin orbit and flew itself to Munar orbit where it needed to be refueled, since it was significantly heavier. The little vehicle that is parked on top has every science experiment except crew report (didn\u0027t want to fit a crew module onto it) and four science storage units, it can hop to any biome on the Mun and collect four of every experiment, one for each of the MPLs. It was Supposed to be shipped in the cargo bay of the MPL module, however, the decoupler got stuck and it refused to disconnect, so there is still a full lander inside the cargo bay that has been de-activated permanently, and I had to send another one up to land itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe station is entirely gas-powered. There are a total of 8 fuel cell arrays (7 in the original body, 1 came with the science bays to pay for their own power). There is a single solar panel attached that was applied retroactively (thank you 1.11!!) since apparently the game doesn\u0027t consider fuel cell arrays as \u0022power sources\u0022 for the purpose of fulfilling contracts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe surface docking, both horizontal and vertical, would not have been possible for me had I not known about the Surface Radial Out option. The general idea is that by locking your ship vertical and manipulating the throttle so that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is approximately 1, you can then maneuver the ship with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in the same way that you would in zero gravity. In execution it\u0027s a little more difficult, since not only are you more time limited since you are constantly spending gas, but also the fact that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E fluctuates as you do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI captured videos of the process of docking the two modules together and landing the science jumper. They are not edited and there\u0027s a lot of bad piloting but I figured I\u0027d show what it looked like for anyone interested. I learned a lot from doing these, like for instance,\u00A0reach a safe altitude before doing any extreme maneuvering of station-sized craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the practice run at KSP where I was trying to do the vertical docking for the first time. I figured if I could do it on Kerbin then I would easily be able to do it on the Mun.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNb2d-8WqNk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNb2d-8WqNk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the docking of the two halves of the outpost on the surface. I accidentally pointed the \u0022rear end\u0022 (relative to the control point that I was using) at the target so I spent a lot of time confusing myself since my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E controls were backwards. You will notice that I\u0027m driving the power module to meet with the science module, I didn\u0027t feel as comfortable piloting the science module with precision since it was less balanced.\u00A0The target docking port was on the downhill side, this is important for getting the two ports to actually touch for the final push, which was done by feathering the throttle up and pushing forward with full \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e78Wl7ZWA5E\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e78Wl7ZWA5E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here is the docking of the science jumper on the Mun. Lot of time wasted with over corrections (and a quick google search on the second screen to find out how to move the nav ball), but I will get better over time.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHW6xbUHnpY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHW6xbUHnpY\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone has any feedback or questions I will be happy to discuss!
