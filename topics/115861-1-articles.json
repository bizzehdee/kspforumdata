Imagine a cruel and greedy alien race attacking KSC for resources or whatever. If all buildings are destroyed, you lose.\n\nFirst you meet their explorers, then their missionaries and the US (Space) Marines say hello:\n\n![avatar-quaritch.jpg](https://lajovencuba.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/avatar-quaritch.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"thomas81","CreatedById":120168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T02:33:12Z","Content":"well, not just ET intelligence.

The \u0022AI\u0022 basically flies the crafts itself generating random nodes where to go, however they have unlimited fuel and gravity does not affect them. Also due to my poor mod programming using many of them eats ALOT of performance. Since I updated to v1.0 I haven\u0027t worked on that mod nor released it because of it\u0027s poor performance.\n\nBut that\u0027s the closest I got in generating an \u0022alien ship\u0022\n\nHowever this was not done by legit \u0022mod ways\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-22T18:18:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/22/2016 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tjc\\_9**"}]}
