And is a lot of fun to control when we can translate the craft for all directions efficiently and in atmosphere.\n\nSo, I think this kind of mod could be easy for mod makers...\n\nThe mod would have tine powerful and omnidirectional RCS, that consumes huge amounts of electric charge or maybe another resource...

In fact, they don\u0027t even care where you pace them, even if it\u0027s upwards inside a closed cargo bay. They will still provide thrust in the \u0022forward\u0022 direction according to the ship.

But if it could very difficult to get, in resource and tech tree, I think it could be fun and expand our horizons to spacecraft and stations desing.
