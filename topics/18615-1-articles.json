There are some excellent examples of these in the Spacecraft exchange, but they are harder to build. Try getting up to about 20,000m on jet engines, then jettisoning the engines and empty fuel tanks. Then, use rocket engines to ascend as vertically as you can manage until you get to about 40km, and start to pitch over (did I mention have either RCS or vectoring engines? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, continue as with a normal rocket.

Don\u0027t try to start with SSTO. It\u0027s terribly annoying, and at best You will be on edge with fuel budget. SPLs are much easier.

The lifter technique is one of the better ones. What you want to do is build your spaceplace for your orbital and whichever space task you wish to perform. You want this light. For me it often consists of twin jet engines and four half tanks mounted close to the fuselage with the efficient engines. To get to space, I will make large lifting wings and put more jet engines on it as well as my orbital engines. The staging is as follows when I run this design. Use the jet engines and wings to get thrust up to the 15km usual max altitude. Jettison these engines and engage your orbital fuel assembly. You will want to get a steep upwards bank at this point and then fly it up and around just like any other rocket. SSTO with the new fuel changes tend to be a pain. They still can be done, but that is mostly for the challenge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere there is the way I love to do it. Currently, it does mean moving your ship file outside of the game, but it does make spaceplace builds alot more fun. First stage is design whatever space plane structure you wish in the space plane hangar. I do this so I can have my re-entry space plane and also set it up for VTOL on the muns. Test out your spaceplane, if you have the jettisonable VTOL engines, test your balance out. You want to do the testing lots because making changes after can result in the loss of alot of work. Now, what you can do at this point is rotate the plane so it points vertically and build your rocket setup to have it take off vertical from the runway. What I do is I minimize KSP, and copy the plane from the ship SPH folder to the VAB folder. You now have your spaceplane in your vertical assembly building. Just build up a vertical takeoff assembly and you are in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like doing the copy and paste myself since it allows for the increased symetry options. At this point in my KSP gaming, this is the way majority of my rockets are now built just because I like the style and looks of spaceplanes landed on mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-05T14:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to build a SSTO (single stage to orbit) I recommend building on this skeleton: 5 normal fuel tanks \u002B 1 areospike \u002B 2 Mk1 fuselage \u002B 2 turbojets.

An order of magnitude more difficult than a rocket or simple plane. You are juggling all sorts of balances and forces. Then you have to make it work in several modes of operation, from takeoff to ascent, to orbital operations to re-entry and flight again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion like others have said is just put a little plane on top of a big rocket to get a taste for it and an get an easy win under your belt. eg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8447/7843608658_39345daff3_c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00227843608658_39345daff3_c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen move onto the real fun with an SSTO. Note that there is something about an SSTO that I don\u0027t know why it took me so long to figure out, since I should have known better. Bigger SSTOs don\u0027t necessarily give you more Delta-V. This is critical to understand, since the normal reaction to having a craft not get to orbit is the feeling you need to go bigger. The only way to improve the Delta-V is to a) increase the full:dry mass ratio, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E use more efficient engines - always use airospikes, and c) reduce your gravity loss and drag loss through better design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo increase the full:dry mass ratio you need to be ruthless with weight. If you double the fluel and engine mass, but also double the weight of landing gear and wings, the Delta-V will be.... exactly the same!
