Only the probe and bateries was red.\n\n---\n\nsee now that the normal probes only manages 1200 degree, need the rc-0015 flat 1.25 meter probe also see that inline batteries manages heat better. \n\nSee also that docking ports is good thermal insulators. this can be used to generate an hot and cold side of an ship.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-06T05:01:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2015 05:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"bigjoe","CreatedById":145233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T09:49:16Z","Content":"This is due to how heat transfer works in 1.0. You\u0027re ship design is not insulating the probe and batteries at all. The entirety of that ship is not massive enough to dissipate the heat from a single nuke, much less 4 of them."}]}
