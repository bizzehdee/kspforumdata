Also don\u0027t forget the Community Tech Tree is an add-on for Tech Manager, so you need that as well or CTT will not work.

That is just off the top of my head, but I can\u0027t think of any others I use. For the sounding rocket I use the procedural tanks. Procedural Tanks are used for most things. There are also some texture packs running around you can find for more textures for those tanks that are very nice.\n"}]}
