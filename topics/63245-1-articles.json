I actually got the encounter, which went smoothly except for the fact that windows 8 started acting up which pretty much drained a good amount of fuel. Luckily, I got to Jool, and I think I will be able to get back. I have just under half a tank left of my main capsule and the last set of boosters. Now the hard part is getting back, getting into orbit and landing. I\u0027m not entirely sure that is possible with the fuel I have, but I am gonna try. So, the problem is, how can I get a Kerbin encounter without using too much fuel? All I am getting is Jool encounters, and it\u0027s pretty frustrating but somewhat amusing. My orbit entends slightly beyond Jool and the Periapsis is slightly under Kerbin. How am I supposed to get back without crashing into Jool again? Or should I just give up and add transmitters next time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I got within Kerbin. Now I just need to get into orbit. But how? I have 108 fuel left and the maneuver to get into orbit is 2945.5 m/s.
