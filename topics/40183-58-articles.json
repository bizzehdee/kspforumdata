But even circling around in orbit, it never turns green (unlike latitude). Perhaps there\u0027s a bug in the code related to longitude?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that handled with an \u0022and\u0022, and is the MCE code written to just treat it as a linear number ignoring the cyclical nature of angle measurements? That would make it impossible. Try to think of a number that is both larger than 170 and also smaller than -170. There isn\u0027t one. If your current position was 175, then it would be \u0026gt; 170 but not \u0026lt; -170. If your current position was -175, then it would be \u0026lt; -170 but not \u0026gt; 170.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the check is treating longitude like a raw number, then it doesn\u0027t realize that \u002B179 and -179 are actually only 2 degrees apart from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that the crater sits right on the boundary between positive and negative longitudes makes the check messier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile it\u0027s tempting to just say \u0022remove the longitude goal again\u0022 I think this actually highlights a bug in the check that should be dealt with so that other future longitude goals can work properly. We\u0027re just lucky that the first real longitude goal happened to be one that triggers the bug right away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe difficult part about fixing it is that if you take into account the cyclical nature of longitude, then that flips the problem to one in which technically ALL positions match a \u0022greater than\u0022 and \u0022less than\u0022 check. If that was fixed then the new problem would be this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Is 60 degrees longitude less than 50 degrees longitude? Yes. If you start from 50 degrees longitude and go 350 degrees east, you get to 60 degrees longitude, so 60 degrees is 350 degrees less that 50 degrees.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the problem is that that\u0027s technically not wrong. It\u0027s mathematically correct, but not what we want as it would make all checks return true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore because of the cyclical nature of degrees longitude, I think all longitude checks will have to be implemented as error bars instead:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You must be at this longitude, plus or minus this much.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you could have a goal of \u0022180 degrees, plus or minus 10 degrees\u0022 which can be made to work, instead of \u0022\u0026gt;170 and \u0026lt;-170\u0022, which cannot be made to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you did that, and then also made the check aware of the cyclical nature of degrees, (such that it realizes that -179 is \u002B2 degrees from \u002B179, for example) I think that\u0027s the only fix that\u0027s practical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn algorithm for finding the shortest angle difference between two arbitrary angles, taking into account the cyclical nature of degrees:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStart with A and B being the two angles (longitudes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet C, the difference between A and B, rotating B into a frame of reference using A as the origin angle, so we can work entirely with C, the relative difference, from now on.

If your having issues with the timer its possible that the timer is set up for another mission. If you check your .sp file this line should read like this. timeStarted = -1 (thats a Minus 1 its important) if not then set it to -1 to restart the timer. Its not important if you don\u0027t do this. Just that if the timer is set to an older time (other mission not finished) the timer will continue from that time, and either give you an instant finish, or possible longer countdown then what current mission is.

Not that it matters because landing has never really been broken. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if you have other mods in your game. There might be some sort of Bad interaction with it.. could be the case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECouple things I should mention.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make sure your throttle is a 0 or can\u0027t finish mission or objectives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make sure your out of Time warp to finish mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Make sure you select the mission first outside of flight, (sometimes it causes issues when you start it in flight, not sure why)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. In single missions only use 1 craft.. If you fail the first time MCE saves the vessel ID and is expecting that vessel to finish the mission.. Other vessel even the same type will not be able to finish on Do only once type missions. You have to either Option A. Select the Fly Mission with different vessel in the pop up that comes up if you explode... Or b. Go to settings and clear Mission Goals to clear any saved goals from older vessel that might be dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn your case (the mission does work for me) I think number 4 is the issue. You have previosly tried to do the mission and failed. MCE saved the vessel info and ID of that craft. Somehow you died, or reverted.. Now your vessel has different ID. You need to clear you Mission Goals in settings to get rid of this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will have a different fix for this at a later time, when I get more time to look into a better way of stopping this from happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-22T20:11:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2014 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by malkuth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
