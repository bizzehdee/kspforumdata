I increased the altitude of the low cloud layer to 4200 meters, which pretty much eliminated the problem for the clouds, but the issue still appears on the ocean and terrain. I also find the drastic difference between the land colour before and after the switch quite distracting. The temp solution I am working on is lowering the altitude at which the game switches to the beautiful Scaled Space version, as PQS rapidly drops in quallity as altitude increases. Re-entry is when I will mostly be seeing the switch over (it appears less ugly during ascent) so I think I will lower the switch to 65-80km.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-21T06:55:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/21/2015 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by stratochief66\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T15:45:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for testing, I\u0027ll have to look into this.
