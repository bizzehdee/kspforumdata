What about with CactEye? [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105660-0-90-CactEye-2-Orbital-Telescope-BETA-4](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105660-0-90-CactEye-2-Orbital-Telescope-BETA-4)\n\nAlso, with the Outer Planets Mod, there are a lot of individual planet-packs available, such that it would be very difficult to predict exactly which planets even exist in any given career start. In fact, the planet Kerbin even starts off as a moon of a new gas giant planet called Sonnah, and Sonnah has 3-4 other moons beyond Kerbin, I think. I see above that you envision difficulty presets with respect to what bodies are pre-discovered at career start. Since OPM takes advantage of recent (KSP v1.0.2, I believe, though I could be mistaken) changes in the stock game that allows for greater moddability for planets, my own suggestion is that you design some sort of logic in your own mod that allows the mod to \u0022scan\u0022 and detect what planets are defined in the career save. After that, I see two possible programming choices. First, I can imagine that your mod can try to \u0022intelligently determine\u0022 which bodies are likely to be pre-discovered (for example: the sun, Sonnah, and perhaps a randomly chosen other Sonnah-moon). Note that in this other mod I\u0027m describing, Minmus is an inner planet, Mun is another moon of Sonnah. Sonnah itself, of course, is at roughly the orbit of Jupiter / Jool, and with the planetpacks I\u0027m running I count at least half a dozen inner planets and 4-6 other outer planets, and most of those have at least one or two moons, some of them many more than that. A very lively system! (I\u0027m not entirely sure which planets come with which planetpack, as I just selected all available planetpacks on CKAN and installed from there. For the career save that I\u0027m preparing to start, I\u0027d actually prefer to go in blind and discover it through gameplay rather than through forum posts, hence my desire to use your mod here! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\nMy other idea for this scenario is that your mod simply provide some kind of career-start configuration panel that allows the player to manually select which bodies / worlds are pre-discovered. Perhaps allot a \u0022budget,\u0022 where selecting more costs more, or perhaps assigning different \u0022costs\u0022 to certain worlds based on how your mod detects the world as being a planet or a moon, or near / far from Kerbin. You might even be able to peg it against career difficulty settings, such as quickload / revert options, starting funds, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"Z3R0_0NL1N3","CreatedById":60881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T05:32:17Z","Content":"Is it possible to make planets invisible in the map view until they\u0027re discovered by using the telescope?"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T07:51:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Is it possible to make planets invisible in the map view until they\u0027re discovered by using the telescope?\n\nI\u0027ve already tried to find a way to do that, but I think it\u0027s a bit more complicated.

Alternatively, you can leave them visible in the map view, but with the question marks the asteroids have, and only visible when they\u0027re at a certain point in their orbits.
