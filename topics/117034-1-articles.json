I\u0027ve tested it like a thousand times in 1.0.4 and even with struts on every possible proper place they still don\u0027t work correctly. Many modders recommend using it still, and the stock strut system is still extremely buggy about placing struts. Idk some people might consider it cheating i guess, but if the stock strut mechanics dont work and cause more frustration than enjoyment... then why not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
