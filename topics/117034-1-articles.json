It\u0027s deployed with the ore tanks full and the monoprop tanks empty. An action group deploys all the gigantors and starts the ISRUs in monoprop production mode. Then \u0022Time x1000\u0022 warp until sundown and \u0022Recover Vessel\u0022 - the ore tanks are empty by then, and the monoprop tanks are full. \n\nSince 1 unit of ore costing 0.02![Fund_char.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/8/8a/Fund_char.png) converts to 2 units of monopropellant each worth 1.2![Fund_char.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/8/8a/Fund_char.png) and the vehicle is \u0022landed at KSC\u0022 the recovery rate is 100%, each unit of ore nets me 2.36![Fund_char.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/8/8a/Fund_char.png) at the end of the day, and a 100% return on the investment into the \u0022refinery\u0022. I don\u0027t remember exactly how many ore tanks and monoprop tanks each ISRU supports, something around 15 monoprop I\u0027d guess; I tuned the number attached to a single ISRU to last a full Kerbin day without actually counting them, and then copied the resulting \u0022tower\u0022 enough times to still fit on the launchpad and not exceed the 255 parts limit I was working under at the time. That was the 7-\u0022tower\u0022 refinery netting me some 30,000. (and the design had to be vertical, it just broke apart from internal stains when placed horizontally).\n\nLater, after upgrading SPH, VAB and the runway, I copied the 7-tower factory (a line) 4 times for a 4x7 tower grid, and... the runway exploded under its weight.\n\nIt\u0027s a cheap, cheaty way to produce funds, and it\u0027s tedious in the long run, but if you\u0027re in a pinch needing that extra 20,000 for completing the latest rocket, it\u0027s a good way to get it."},{"CreatedByName":"Occams","CreatedById":148416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T18:14:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That mod hasn\u0027t been necessary for a very long time.

I\u0027ve tested it like a thousand times in 1.0.4 and even with struts on every possible proper place they still don\u0027t work correctly. Many modders recommend using it still, and the stock strut system is still extremely buggy about placing struts. Idk some people might consider it cheating i guess, but if the stock strut mechanics dont work and cause more frustration than enjoyment... then why not."}]}
