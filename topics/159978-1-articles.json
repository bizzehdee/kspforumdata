KSP has taught me more about orbital mechanics and why space flights do what they do than any book or article on the internet. Which makes me think, how effective is it to use a reality based video game to help teach a concept? The best way to learn something is to force you to use that skill, you can read about orbital insertions all day long, but the average student will never use that knowledge, and will likely forget it. KSP allows you to learn orbital physics and rocket science (not so scary anymore) and to practice these skills without dying horribly in a fireball. Anyone else have KSP to thank for learning more about flight than years of book reading ever taught you?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T13:17:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is sure a good way to learn orbital mechanics, yet at least our school does not believe orbital mechanics will be usefull in our futures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairPhysicist","CreatedById":177181,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T13:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223039896\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493558249\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165635\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NSEP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 minutes ago, NSEP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is sure a good way to learn orbital mechanics, yet at least our school does not believe orbital mechanics will be usefull in our futures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever said I thought it would be useful, simply said that it\u0027s a good way to learn about space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T13:30:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223039910\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022159978\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221493558864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022177181\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArmchairPhysicist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, ArmchairPhysicist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever said I thought it would be useful, simply said that it\u0027s a good way to learn about space travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThats cool \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0it sure is great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T13:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimulation games tend to do that.
