Well 1 probe had a malfunction and would not decouple from the booster stage. It\u0027s stuck in Mun orbit. So I got the idea to try blasting the booster off by using the Whack-A-Mole tool in the Ctrl-F12 menu. Good thing I saved first. Accurately removing tank parts using Whack-A-Mole doesn\u0027t work very well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my next thought was to make a controlled crash landing on the surface to see it I could remove the offending tanks that way. Nope, well it did manage to explode 2 tanks off and land on it\u0027s side leaving the lander undamaged. Using the lander\u0027s legs to push off, I was able to start to cartwheel. Great! I can knock off some more tanks! 8-) Unfortunately it landed on the probe\u0027s head, destroying the only thing that controls the lander. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk looks like I need to send a team to collect the data that\u0027s stranded on Mun. Oh wait! I have \u0027The Claw\u0027! I\u0027ll build a salvage ship and bring what\u0027s left back home... for science! :thumbsup:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are pics of my salvage operation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/4bK9E#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7g1Q6L0h.png\u0022 alt=\u00227g1Q6L0h.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-16T23:35:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2014 11:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Landge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
