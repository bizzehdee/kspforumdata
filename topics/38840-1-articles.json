Here\u0027s an example I quickly threw together using your ship as a guide:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/FGAQC4H\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FGAQC4H.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FGAQC4H.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice how there are struts not only between the fuel tanks in all directions, but also between the stages at the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso a couple pointers from my experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. In this case, you\u0027re probably better off going with a 2.5m first stage with a Mainsail engine as opposed to a quad-coupler and four 1.25m\u0027s. The 1.25m engines may be more efficient, but you want to push your way out of the thick lower atmosphere as quickly as possible to minimize your dV losses to the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You would probably get more efficiency out of that first stage if instead of using solid boosters, you used liquid fuel rockets that crossfed fuel into the centre stack. Not to mention they have throttle control. Usually when I build rockets, I make a very stable design ment for lifting a certain mass. Only if I need to exceed that mass do I start adding solid boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I somehow completely missed the fact that there was a middle stage in there...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-25T22:58:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2013 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by espm400\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Koren","CreatedById":75549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks a lot for your answer,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI never tryied to add struct between 2 different stages because I through it would be keeping stages together but struts releases when a stage is separated !
