This requires Trajectories to work with kOS but I can\u0027t get it to. I found out that trajectories only works with kOS in the 1.7.x versions but those versions don\u0027t work with my KSP and I can\u0027t see my trajectory and impact position. I have the right kOS version and all but I can\u0027t get it to work with trajectories. Any idea on how to fix this?
