Fuel tanks will, if all goes as planned, be attatched to the nodes.

My plan is to eventually have these craft be used as resupply ferries between Kerbin and a permanent base on the mun. The idea behind using a NERVA-style NTR for propulsion is due to their relatively low fuel consumption for their power.
