I mostly use them in small launchers, with an LV-T45 in the lower stage and LV-T30s in the boosters. Their shape is a bit unwieldy for using them in space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Aerospike is the right engine for one-kerbal Eve landers. It could be useful as a vacuum engine, but because there is no attachment node in the bottom, you usually need at least two of them, and you rarely need that much thrust in vacuum.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The LV-N is the ultimate vacuum engine for large payloads and/or high delta-v requirements. Its much more efficient than any other engine using LF/O, and the TWR is high enough for landing on most bodies. The shape of the engine is very unwieldy, however, so you\u0027ll almost always need at least two of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Poodle is a good upper stage engine for a large range of common payloads. It\u0027s also useful as a transfer stage engine to Mun and Minmus, as well as for giving the initial boost for interplanetary transfers from low orbits. I don\u0027t use it in landers, because nuclear engines are almost always a better choice, if you need that much thrust.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Skipper is another general-purpose engine. I use it in the lower stages of small rockets, in the upper stages of larger rockets, and sometimes also for giving the initial boost for interplanetary transfers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The Mainsail has become a niche engine. I sometimes use it as a booster engine in medium rockets, where the higher thrust of the LFB is not as important as the higher Isp of the Mainsail. It might be a good engine for large Eve landers.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The LFB is obviously a booster engine for uses, where raw power is more important than efficiency. As the 3.75 m engines are all too weak, I often use LFBs to allow these big rockets lift off with a useful amount of fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The KR-2L is yet another general-purpose engine that can be used when the Skipper becomes too weak.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The KS-25x4 is the most powerful stock engine there is. It\u0027s useful for the lower stages and the boosters of large rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The two larger SRBs are obviously useful as boosters. In smaller rockets, I often adjust their thrust down to avoid the TWR dropping too low when the boosters burn out. In larger rockets, a bunch of SRBs can be useful for increasing the initial TWR a bit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E The PB-ION is hard to use properly. It\u0027s very efficient, and even the TWR is high enough for landing on the Mun.

Nice for the micro-craft/probe community, but for anyone who likes to have 20 tons of ship, stick to nukes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for LV-N shape, i fix that issue by clipping it inside a fuel tank or something, leaving only a small portion exposed.

There are far better circularization/transfer engines (nuke has better isp, and or circularizing/transfers the low thrust of nuke is meaningless).

It really boils down to personal preference, are you willing to sacrifice some or even alot of performance to make a rocket appear realistic or in a certain shape or whatever you feel looks better. The poodle is an engine that is not very useful for performance in the majority of cases. Yes its useful, but its primary use is right now either cutting down part counts by making a slightly less efficient setup then multiple smaller engines.

Same with say a stack of intakes, or whatever else i prefer to not be visible. Im also a fan of \u0022compact\u0022 designs, many of which are simply IMPOSSIBLE to create without minor clipping here and there. If the game ever goes MP and the game designers decide clipping is game breaking, then i guess ill retire my array of cool looking sci-fi/real life stuff, but even still, being a SANDBOX GAME, i see no reason why clipping should matter or be considered a cheat (as there is no advantages to be gained or lost with clipping aside from possibly ruining the appearance). Anyways, i have some friends who are against clipping, and others that use it alot especially with so called minimalist compact builds. I fall into the group that considers clipping a legit building style, and unless Squad OFFICIALLY says that clipping is against the game\u0027s design (and or adds procedural parts so we can make whatever shape wings we want without clipping 2 into each other to get desired shape), i dont think im gonna change my ways.

It\u0027s an opinion i have yet to see stated. My perspective comes from playing the game with custom/hard options (i personally run 50% rewards and 200% penalties). There are 2 problems i can see with the poodle right now and both are related to its position on the tech tree relative to other engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE: I\u0027m not going to argue about efficiency overall, just about the specific point you can obtain and use the poodle.

Normally, as you gentlemen have stated, the 909 is the clear early choice for small landers to get that early science going. However, most often after you unlock the 909 you are able to rocket (no pun intended) up to using the more advanced engines (aka nerva and to some degree the 48-7s but ill get to that later) and skip the poodles usable stage all at once. Ignoring that fact, at the time you unlock the poodle it is the best engine for its designated task (landing and orbital maneuvering) so I wouldn\u0027t say theres much to argue with that. But on the flip side you could argue that the 48-7s is in the same tech level, however i would not yet have access to cubic struts or the ability to make a decent stack using them(sometimes its easier and cheaper to just slap on 1 poodle instead of attaching 48\u0027s without cubics). In my careers the poodle has the ability to be the first engine i can use to go interplanetary and as an overall good vacuum engine with a decent isp and a good twr to keep the burns short. This leads up to my second problem i can see: it is placed on the same level as the 48-7s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ve already said that the poodle is good for it\u0027s position, but at the same time it has a serious competitor in the 48-7s. Don\u0027t worry I won\u0027t get too much into the tech tree or it\u0027s balance as I believe it is still very much a work in progress(I personally think some of the nodes are too crowded/too empty/too easy). As soon as the poodle is available you already have a better option available, so what is the point in getting it? As stated by many before me: the twr of the 48-7s is just too good to be passed up. Why waste the sci points on the poodle and co. when you can make much greater progress with the 48-7s(aka fuel systems), and then get heavy rocketry just to have the larger tanks for convenience?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would seem to me that the devs have a direction for where the poodle should be used, however it will only ever end up being used by those running the harder difficulties unless it is given greater time to function before it is beaten. The best buff you could give the poodle is to move the 48-7s and the nuke further up the tech tree to make the poodle more viable in the mid-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETL;DR~ The poodle is the best choice for a veeerrrry brief period of time before it is eclipsed, and with the 48-7s available on the same tech level why not get that instead?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E~~\u003C/strong\u003Eforgive and bad sentences and structure, its late:sticktongue:\u003Cstrong\u003E~~~\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-09T06:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2014 06:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cadaverific\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-09T12:22:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can replace the Poodle with 1-2 LV-909s, the ship is too small for the Poodle.
