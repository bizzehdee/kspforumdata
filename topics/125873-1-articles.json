I\u0026#39;m not sure why you want this. One part of the fun in this game is the feeling of success. Just give the game some time and you will understand it. Browse the forums and find some tutorials. Scott Manley has good tutorials on youtube. Hell, try the tutorials that KSP gives you if you must. I was right there with you a while ago, but I will guarantee you that having prebuilt bases and stations is not going to be fun. There would be hardly anything to do.

It is easy for us veterans to forget that KSP is pretty hard, especially at first when you haven\u0026#39;t figured anything out yet.

Lots of smart people have explained KSP\u0026#39;s concepts, both simple and complex, in text and video form. Focus on the basics: How to get to orbit, how to build a spacecraft, how to get to another celestial body and land on it, how to rendezvous and dock. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDraw inspiration from others.
