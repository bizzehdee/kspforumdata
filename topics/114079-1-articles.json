This mod is available on CKAN or on the releases page on Github ([https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/Extensive-Engineer-Report/releases/latest](https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/Extensive-Engineer-Report/releases/latest)).\n\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EIMPORTANT (NEW v0.5 INFO)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E  \nFile names have changed.

Why?\n\nA: That\u0027s from a combination of ShipSections and any mod that utilizes it (which is currently only this one).  When loading a ship that hasn\u0027t been loaded before, the modules haven\u0027t been initialized so there\u0027s some exception spam that is handled in the mod.  There are no issues with loading these ships and they work totally fine.  It just takes a second or two more than usual (depending on ship size).  I am looking at ways to fix this in ShipSections.\n\n**How To Report Bugs and Request Features**\n\nIf you find a bug or have a feature request, add an issue at [https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/Extensive-Engineer-Report/issues/new](https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/Extensive-Engineer-Report/issues/new) on GitHub. This will have the fastest turnaround. I\u0027ll also respond on the KSP forum or on Reddit, but it might take a little longer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-29T05:54:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2016 05:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by jkortech**\n  \nUpdate for v0.5"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:32:44Z","Content":"Neat.\n\nFor custom tests, [WerhnerChecker](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/63591) has an XML file that people can edit, though I believe it\u0027s limited to checking if a PartModule exists.
