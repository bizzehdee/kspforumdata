On a recent launch I had with a huge staging system. I had one light and a few instruments on one side of the top capsule, and it pulled hard to the side during launch.

I don\u0027t mean it to be offending or insulting, when u turned your ship, did u turn S.A.S off while u turned it? then turn it back on when u finish turning. If it is still on, then it will fight you while u try to turn. Something I didn\u0027t really notice at first myself. Many people here seem to work for N.A.S.A or something and talk in rocket language and miss the simple things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OptiSTR","CreatedById":58080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T19:37:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ek guys so i managed to land on Minimus, made quite a bit of science and got some useful new techs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea little problem i didnt found a solution for (even though i did googled it) \u0026gt; is there a guide to how to do science properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor example, i EVAd on my way back from Minimus, and tried to collect data and i had this message that i cant collect more data... and i had to trash it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alistone","CreatedById":60032,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T21:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OptiSTR\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OptiSTR\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ek guys so i managed to land on Minimus, made quite a bit of science and got some useful new techs.\u003Cp\u003Ea little problem i didnt found a solution for (even though i did googled it) \u0026gt; is there a guide to how to do science properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efor example, i EVAd on my way back from Minimus, and tried to collect data and i had this message that i cant collect more data... and i had to trash it\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe command pod can only store 1 EVA report (and 1 material sample).
