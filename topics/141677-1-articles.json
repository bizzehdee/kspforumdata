With multiple craft around a body it can become almost impossible, unless extremely close, to set a planet or moon as the target. Generally the issue is that it seems to favor a vessel rather than the body but I am curious to see how some others feel it works for them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-12T18:17:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2016 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Glaran K\u0026#039;erman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-12T21:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTargeting a vessel or a body that has inclination causes the intersect marker to rapidly flash on and off along different spots in the orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe intersect marker can indicate a 100 km separation and then just vanish when making small adjustments to the maneuver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing the new feature to pin the intersect marker is great until it disappears and then it needs to be re-pinned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-14T01:01:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a similar note, it gets annoying when tweaking a maneuver node to get your periapsis closer, and closer, to a body, then it vanishes.
