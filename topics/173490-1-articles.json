The landing is fine and looks like 5-10 deg slope. Everything is good and still. Then later I go check and it\u0027s rocking back and forth. It actually tipped onto the solar panel and I had to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to put it back on it\u0027s feet. Then it\u0027s good again but later it\u0027s moving again.
