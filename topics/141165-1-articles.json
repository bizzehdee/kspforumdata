I\u0027ve tried using stock planes as an example. Still though, I cannot figure out how to build a plane. The closest I\u0027ve ever got was an abomination of a plane that could fly but was incredibly hard to control and pretty much impossible to land. Either my planes explode on the runway or they take off then crash into the ground after flying for 5 meters. Can anyone please give me some advice?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-04T03:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, the most important part is to have your COL behind your COM. Not too far behind, otherwise it\u0027ll be uncontrollable, just touching it. Then you need to make sure it stays that way. Drain the fuel from your tanks and see how your COM moves. If it ever moves behind the COL you need to adjust so that it doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow to your specific issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022incredibly hard to control \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you already balanced your COL and COM as described above, you need more control surfaces. Also, make sure you use the right click menu on each control surface so that they only control the direction of movement they\u0027re supposed to. This means, for example, for your rudder deactivate pith and roll and only leave yaw, or for elevators deactivate roll and yaw and leave pitch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022pretty much impossible to land\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can also be due to not enough control surfaces, or due to not enough lift.
