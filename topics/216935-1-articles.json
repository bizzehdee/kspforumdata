How hard does this sound to make? Is it feasible to do in KSP? What would be the best place to start? Would anyone like to join me in developing it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an idea for a mod that is kicking around my head and stubbornly refusing to leave. I have a bit of experience with development in Unity, but none with making KSP mods,\u00A0 so I have no idea how feasible this is or where to begin on implementing it. I\u0027ve looked a bit at the source code for MechJeb and Kerbalism, as they both do things along similar lines and could well be components of this mod. I had first thought to develop this as a standalone game, but it occurred to me that a lot of the basic engine functionality is already implemented in KSP and various mods, so it might just be a matter of tying them together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStranded dares to ask that important question, \u0022what if Kerbal Space Program was a strategy game?\u0022\u00A0The basic thought for a start is to add a UI to KSP where you manage things on a higher level, ordering ships/kerbals to go from one place to another and them doing it automatically, adding colony building along the lines of Banished/Surviving Mars while still retaining the underlying mechanics and including some life support/resource management, but also having the ability to zoom in and directly fly a ship or walk a Kerbal through your Kolony if you want.\u00A0KSP\u0027s design and simulation system give us a chance to have a mechanic like Spore where you can design your own ships and buildings, but have those design choices actually mean something, and KSP already having the physics and building system implemented and optimized over many years of development saves a lot of time compared to making something from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see this as a single player city/base/Kolony-building game using parts we already have for building surface bases in KSP but with a gods-eye/Settlers/Rimworld type interface where a colony consists of many Kerbals who are AI controlled and follow player commands indirectly. I.e. the player designates something to be built and, assuming resources are available for it, Kerbals come out and build it. You would initially have to ship in resources for the colony to build with but would eventually be able to mine resources locally for continued sustenance and expansion. I would use the existing Kerbal world and assets to start with, but eventually could add customizations for different planets and even different star systems. A recent game that does something similar is Moons of Ardan, though I found its implementation a bit simplistic. Really what I want is to take the basic loop of KSP career mode and automate some of the more tedious parts of it, allowing multiple concurrent missions and building complex bases without requiring the player to manage each individual.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you guys think? Does this sound worth doing? How would I go about doing it? The very first proof of concept I had in mind was to implement an RTS-style point and click interface, where you would control a Kerbal walking along the ground from a birds-eye view and could click on the ground to get him to walk to that point. Next have multiple Kerbals controlled like this at once, click one to select it and tell it where to go, and have them all walking to different places at the same time. How would I do that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-01T05:50:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2023 05:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by TV4Fun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUnbury Github link\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TV4Fun","CreatedById":50943,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-03T22:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone is curious or would like to contribute, I have set up a rudimentary version of this at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/TV4Fun/Stranded\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/TV4Fun/Stranded\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(License: MIT).
