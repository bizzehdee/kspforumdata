Also I believed that some flying man in the sky created the world. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut since the MSL landed on Mars, I got interested in space. I started watching some NASA videos, and soon enough I knew a little about space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I read an article (this article actually) and it got me interested, so I searched for \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cgamers solve aids problem\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 because I wanted to see how that game works. Or whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled upon this video and in related videos I saw Kurt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s (kurtjmac) tutorial on KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was in May 2012.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP was in version 0.16 and they didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have docking, probes, space station cores, or even interplanetary travel. But for me it was the best thing in the world. I remember playing KSP straight for 8 hours, then going to sleep while watching tutorials on my tablet, and first thing in the morning I would sit on the computer and start KSP.exe \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I was pretty much addicted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I started playing it I posted some screenshots on my Facebook wall (before it was called Timeline) and Igor Nedeljkovi\u00C3\u201E\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1 saw it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe introduced me to Felipe, Squad, and KSP forums. I had no idea who made KSP, I just wanted to play it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I played KSP more and more, I got bored of my rockets exploding and I wanted to make scientific rockets. So I started watching NASA documentaries, on a excellent YouTube channel called EvolutionDocumentary that got deleted unfortunately. Soon I knew a lot about SRB\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s, MIR, ISS, Shuttle, MSL, MER etc. BUT I WANTED TO KNOW MORE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read a few books about space, and I really liked \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe Story of Space Station Mir\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. I then started learning Russian and since I now know some words, and understand the basic sentence making, I could understand some of the great old Soviet documentaries about Space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I read and watched more and more, I got interested in Space even more. I started reading texts on Phil Plait\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s blog, and I soon learnt many things about space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter all that I found a book called \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CSatellite Technology: Principles and Applications\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in which I learned a lot about orbital mechanics and how Satellites actually work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I watched BBC documentary \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CHow Satellites Rule Our World\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 in which I learned how satellites are manufactured and also something about how they work. A lot actually, since I had no idea how satellites handled multiple signals coming and going\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may see a pattern here: I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t learn nothing in school, and actually you can learn stuff by watching videos. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s how I learn the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, when I was younger I wanted to be a programmer, now I want to be a space engineer. No, not an astronaut, as I\u0027m much less likely to actually get a job, and also their job is much harder and more dangerous. But hey, I dream of visiting space. Maybe commercially, but at least a suborbital flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when I grow up I plan on going to Russia to live there a few years, as I want to practice my language and to visit many space museums there. But this about Russia is for another post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, thanks Squad for changing my life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote\u003C/strong\u003E: Links removed, copy-paste from my blog\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-22T18:40:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2013 06:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by milankragujevic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformatting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T17:15:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuess who\u0027s going to study aerospace engineering now! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E This game has changed my life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"milankragujevic","CreatedById":49179,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T19:56:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm...

Also I played a lot of video games. KSP is the best of both worlds. Seriously, I\u0027ve easily played more than a thousand games over the last three decades but KSP is different from all them. This game really makes an impact that is even greater than Rome Total War which used to be the number one in my top three best games ever list. Often I wondered if there ever would come a runner up and after so many disappointments (hyped generic games) KSP took be by surprise. To me, this is one of the BEST games ever (yet) and I\u0027m not saying this lightly... and thinking about the future possibilities (mining, colonizing etc.) makes my head spin. KSP redefined the word quality and game play imho.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Asheron04","CreatedById":60406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T23:40:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeenvogal took the words right out of my mouth. Except my favorite was Medieval Total War. I have been playing ksp since it only cost $5. I have always had a deep facination with space and this game helps to satisfy some childhood dreams that could never come to fruition. There is so much to do now since when ksp first came out that I cant make up my mind! I just landed my all stock mobile base on the mun (pictures to come) and I have to say it was one of the mosy satisfying accomplishments ive had in Ksp. After I have sufficiently satisfied my mun curiosity, its off to minmus and beyond! Happy launching my fellow kerbalnauts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
