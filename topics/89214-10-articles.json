Brightness values for bodies (at the time I took them for their positions at that exact point) in Stock, regardless of DOE version range between -3.689 and 4.909. The 4.99 clamp ensures all values will be negative for the resizefactor which is THE most important thing in being able to actually see a flare (aside from it being enabled or not!). I know this is tailored for stock, and I do love the mod- it is great. Might it be possible to add a variable that can be altered in the configuration files to adjust this based on the system specs? Currently the brightness is the aspect of a celestial body that impacts how large the flare is, it being clamped at 4.99 results in 34/35 bodies in New Horizons having 4.99 brightness and also in 34/35 bodies having a resizefactor of 9.6 (because .01 becomes a very tiny adjustment to another static value.

If so, that\u0027s a reasonable change that I\u0027d be willing to do / accept a pull request for. As for your previous comment about clamping the brightness variable - a negative resize value is a problem: Since all of the world flare impostors are at a distance of 750km from the camera, the absolute value of the resizeFactor tells you how large the flares are relative to one another (since backface culling isn\u0027t enabled with the material/shader being used - if it were, then negative-sized flares simply wouldn\u0027t be visible). I think the root problem is that the brightness of the object is being used to determine the flare size. What should happen is the angular size of the body should control the flare size, and the brightness should control ... the brightness. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tynrael","CreatedById":144990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-20T09:13:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MOARdV\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MOARdV\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat should happen is the angular size of the body should control the flare size, and the brightness should control ... the brightness. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was my thinking as well, I tried some calculations of my own but the reality is that even though I scratch my head when looking at the formula the way it is now, the results are pretty well tuned and look very reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin is indeed set at index 1 for New Horizons.
