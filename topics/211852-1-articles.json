Looked at about 500 YouTubes, read about 5000 subjects about Kerbal. \u00A0In a couple of weeks I landed on Minmus with 3 guys. \u00A0One got out and I couldn\u0027t get him back in. Tried the rocket pack and he knocked the space ship over so I had to do a restart there. \u00A0But I got them Home. \u00A0Found out that there are hundreds of cool mods, figured out - don\u0027t try to load them all. \u00A0Found out that some mods conflicted with others and uninstalled them. \u00A0Finally screwed stuff up so bad the rockets wouldn\u0027t ignite on the launch pad. \u00A0Found Kerbalx and downloaded some cool utility lifters. Nothing would ignite so decided to do a complete new install of 1.12.5. \u00A0 \u00A0Installed kerbalx mod and craft manager and many of the craft now say missing parts. \u00A0Tracked that down and they are from the original install of SQUAD\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only mods I have installed are kerbalx and craft manager so I wouldn\u0027t think they would have disappeared or inactivated parts. \u00A0did a complete new install again and am missing \u0022liquidEngine1-2\u0022 as one example. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a way to do a complete install of SQUAD parts from somewhere else? \u00A0Looked at the SQUAD subdirectory and no way can you go through that one item at a time and figure out what is missing. \u00A0did 1.12.5 drop something out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess maybe try to install 1.12.4 copy the SQUAD subdirectory save it off delete KSP directory, reinstall 1.12.5 and copy SQUAD over the top of that.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been doing \u0022computers\u0027 since 1969 \u00A0as a programer, systems design, software design, hardware and software install, DBA, \u00A0SANs, Virtual Machines, etc. etc. so can kind of fumble my way around but some times it pays to ask the Hive ,with 15 million man years of experience with Kerbal. \u00A0Love this program.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny Ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCold Wyoming\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cygnus008","CreatedById":224511,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-03T22:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell I installed 1.12.4 and the parts are missing there also.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWonder when they disappeared?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlooks like a bunch of the craft were build with 1.6\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-03T22:53:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2023 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by cygnus008\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded built version\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-03T23:06:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to tech support modded.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is not allowed to acquire the \u201CSquad Parts\u201D from any source other than an authorized distributor. \u00A0 \u00A0As in, illegal. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, the source you bought the game from should allow you to reinstall, or at least confirm the integrity of the original files. \u00A0That should fix any issues.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cygnus008","CreatedById":224511,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-04T03:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed it directly from the kerbal site. \u00A0I figured the parts were proprietary \u00A0to kerbal. \u00A0I haven\u0027t found anything that runs a integrity check on the install. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspect these parts got renamed somewhere between 1.6 and 1.12. \u00A0I can work around this or build my own craft as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLarry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
