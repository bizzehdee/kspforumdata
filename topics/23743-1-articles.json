I think they got rid of Moho\u0027s atmosphere, so you can\u0027t aerobrake there anymore, if you ever could, so if you\u0027re in a low TWR craft, starting the breaking burn early is your only efficient and practical option. If you hit Moho\u0027s SoI precisely enough, you\u0027ve probably got plenty of time to break while in it, so you might want to fine tune your intercept (which does sound faster than it\u0027s supposed to be).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine that a combination gravity slingshot/aerobrake maneuver at Eve would be possible, but waiting for the planets to align just right... Oh, wow, I have to try it now. A transfer orbit to Eve, swing around Eve so that I go from moving faster than eve to slower than eve, maybe even aerobraking at Eve to adjust my exit velocity to what I\u0027d need for a Moho transfer orbit. Oops, never mind the aerobraking, my exit velocity for an Eve-\u0026gt; Moho transfer orbit would have to be higher than my entrance velocity after a Kerbin-\u0026gt;Eve transfer. So the question becomes, can I use Eve\u0027s gravity to flip a U-turn without getting so close to Eve that I hit its atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmmm... it looks like that would only reduce the breaking delta-V required by about 800 delta-V and require some acceleration in Eve\u0027s SoI, so probably not enough to be worth it from a technical standpoint. On the other hand, I think it would still be the kind of \u0022I can\u0027t believe I pulled that off!\u0022 moment that really makes this game worth playing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amaroq","CreatedById":57607,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T21:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUhh .. keeping it a bit simpler:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure your intersection with Moho\u0027s orbit is a perfect tangent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, for example, you still have a difference in inclination, or if your periapsis is inside Moho\u0027s orbit but you have an intersect on the way \u0022in\u0022 or the way \u0022out\u0022, you\u0027re going to need too much delta-V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf, instead, you\u0027ve got an inclination difference of no more than 0.1 degrees, and the projected intercept is at your projected solar periapsis, and you make a little adjustment or two as you get close to ensure that your Moho periapsis is low to the surface (\u0026lt; 20km?), you should do just fine .. as \u003Cstrong\u003EEric S.\u003C/strong\u003E pointed out you could brake before entering Moho SOI if you have a really low TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose changes have literally made the difference between a braking burn requiring 5000 d-V and requiring about 2500 d-V for me -- they feel really \u0022slight\u0022 in terms of what your solar orbit looks like, but they make a big difference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-23T22:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight, I got derailed. I\u0027m good at that. For the normal method, you want to match orbits with Moho as close to parallel to Moho\u0027s orbit as possible to minimize radial velocity relative to the sun. You\u0027ll want to match Moho\u0027s inclination to minimize vertical distance and velocity, but this isn\u0027t as critical since changing your inclination in solar orbit, especially if your ascending/descending node is lower in your orbit, is very expensive. You should be fine-tuning your Moho intercept using small burns early on in the trip to achieve a minimal periapsis so that the oberth effect maximizes your breaking. Ideally, you\u0027ll center your breaking at your periapsis to maximize the oberth effect, but you may need to start the burn early. Don\u0027t burn too early though, as that will cost fuel, you\u0027ll want to have the burn as close to centered on the periapsis as you can but still achieve a capture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T00:30:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I worked out last night is Moho has an elliptical orbit, so you want to get your solar orbit apoapsis to be opposite Mohos\u0027 apoapsis, which means you need to escape Kerbins SOI prograde at that point. Then make sure your transfer burn happens at the apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I did just what you did, and ran out of fuel with about 400 delta V left to get a capture. I\u0027ll probably redesign the ship to get more fuel there so I can get a capture, but before I do that, I\u0027m going to have to try the tips here. One question I have about the oberth effect is how much it helps?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m already adjusting my encounter as far out as I can (which is hard without being able to zoom on it!), but aim for about 100km periapsis, since I have my station orbiting there.

It might not save you anything in the long run, since while it might save you braking delta-V, you\u0027d then have to use delta-V to raise your periapsis. I was mostly thinking of the intercepts I\u0027d get when I wasn\u0027t trying to be precise, and my capture periapsis would be well outside the orbit of any moons the planet had. THAT you want to avoid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, if you brake at a really tight periapsis until you\u0027ve got a high apoapsis, where you burn to raise your periapsis to where you want, then when back at periapsis you burn to put your apoapsis where you really want it, that could take delta-V than taking your apoapsis where you want then raising the periapsis.
