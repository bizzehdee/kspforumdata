So then the only issue that I can think of it to be, is me just not knowing how to use the controls to tilt my rocket when doing things such as gravity turns, or trying to do anything in space without spinning out of control. I\u0027ll be fine one minute,\u00A0pressing a button to tilt\u00A0one way, but when I try to tilt slightly in a perpendicular Direction,\u00A0I just start spinning in circles or loops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, for example, if I\u0027m trying to tilt in the y axis, but then I need to move in the x axis,\u00A0it causes issues and I start spinning.

After reading your question a couple of times, I\u0027m not certain that I fully grasp the problem. So please correct me if I\u0027m misunderstanding the difficulty you\u0027re having.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, a couple of basic points: The game shows you (1) a view of your ship from the outside, in the main part of the screen, and (2) a navball at the bottom.\u00A0 The effects of the WASDQE keys are best understood relative to the navball (2), rather than the main view.\u00A0 Put another way, you are not turning your ship around the \u003Cu\u003Emain screen\u003C/u\u003E x-, y-, or z-axes with the controls. Instead, you are controlling the pitch, yaw, and roll of the ship, which are relative to the orientation of your \u003Cu\u003Ecapsule\u003C/u\u003E and which correspond to directions on the navball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, using the WS controls will change your pitch (rotating the navball up and down) no matter how the craft is facing.\u00A0 However, the \u0022pitch\u0022 direction very much depends on which way your capsule is facing. And in the main view, the spin will look very different on the main view depending on how the camera is rotated --- W might pull the nose toward the camera (if the capsule is facing up and rotated with its top facing the camera) or to the left (same situation, but rolled 90 degrees counterclockwise) or any other direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could produce the sorts of problems you\u0027re experiencing if you don\u0027t know about it. Imagine that you press W and E together.\u00A0 Because the ship is rolling (from E), the direction of the \u0022pitch\u0022 control is constantly changing, so you\u0027ll get some odd movements from pressing W during the roll.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevertheless, the inputs will produce consistent results on the navball.\u00A0 Pressing D will always roll the navball in the same direction (rotating about the screen\u0027s y-axis), regardless of how the ship is pointing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy to go into more detail, if it helps. Or perhaps I\u0027m completely off the mark...in which case a couple of screenshots or a short video might help illustrate the moves you\u0027re trying to perform vs. what you\u0027re actually getting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDITED for typos.

The only time it really corresponds to the center of lift shown by the game is when the rocket is pointed within about 5 degrees of prograde and moving at less than mach 1.\u00A0 Any more than that and it can move around quite a bit, depending on your rocket design.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid problem number one, right click on your fuel tank(s) and empty them in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

There is an atmosphere above 40km - not a very thick one but enough to make it very difficult to angle your craft at right-angles to the airflow. In addition, once you get to this sort of altitude then the navball switches to the \u0022orbital\u0022 reference frame, and there is a difference between \u0022orbital\u0022 prograde and your path through the atmosphere (which is bound to the \u0022surface\u0022 reference frame).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor your last question, about orienting the ship with respect to the NavBall, the simple answer is not to worry about it and simply to use the navball to steer in the direction you want to go (which is east - 90\u00B0 - on the horizon).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever you really should adopt a more efficient way of getting to orbit... or at the very least make progressively better attempts at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGoing straight up then turning east is very inefficient and forces you to head at an angle to the airflow, which no rocket or aircraft can do except at very low speeds. If you watch an SU-27 or whatever doing its cobra maneuvre you will be impressed because it is effectively retaining control despite doing everything it shouldn\u0027t be doing as a plane.\u00A0 Your rocket is not an SU-27...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore you really must follow prograde as long as you are in the atmosphere. The idea is to make a very very slight turn to the east when you launch, and then follow prograde up from there.

You\u0027re chasing one of the contracts that require you to take a report or measurement while flying high in a particular spot on Kerbin. And your chosen strategy is a suborbital hop in a specific direction that would drop you down on the marker.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically, that works just fine. In practice, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E hard to get the suborbital hop right, so that you\u0027re in the atmosphere close enough to the marker and high enough to meet the contract.\u00A0 In my (admittedly limited) experience, it\u0027s a lot easier to\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003Eactually \u003Cem\u003Ego\u003C/em\u003E to orbit first.\u00A0 Specifically, to (a) insert into a polar orbit, (b) wait until the right spot rotates under your next orbital track, and (c) drop your periapsis just below 70k in the right spot so that you\u0027re in the atmosphere as you pass over, to meet the \u0022in flight\u0022 criterion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other way to tackle the \u0022while flying above 19600 m\u0022-type contracts is to build a plane with a small rocket motor.\u00A0 You fly to the right spot, pop up to to top end of your jet engines\u0027 envelope, stand on your tail, and light the rocket long enough to put your apoapsis above 20k.\u00A0 This works even with the smallest jet engines --- Junos can get you up above 10k, and a Terrier will do the rest. (EDIT: See, for example, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/141911-those-stupid-airborne-missions/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advantage to this second approach is twofold: you can do this at a very low tech level and it\u0027s quite easy to target the right spot on the globe.\u00A0 The disadvantage, as Gojira suggests, is that it takes a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, none of this discussion helps with the control problem you\u0027re experiencing.

You do not have to do your contracts in a particular order. If you upgrade your Mission Control building, you have 7 (or an infinite number of) slots for unfinished contracts. The contracts are good for a year or more. So I would strongly advise you to wait on this contract -- just leave it sitting in Mission Control and don\u0027t decline it -- until you have a panther engine. You often get panther engines to test with other contracts. Or, with some science and an R\u0026amp;D upgrade, you can buy the panther yourself.\u00A0But a panther engine on a jet can easily get you to the other side of Kerbin, at 20km altitude -- and it can get you there pretty quickly!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaps Lock is a little funny, actually. What you want is to turn your yaw/pitch/roll controls from orange to blue. You do this by\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etapping\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the CapsLock key once, and it only lasts until you switch focus. Your CapsLock keyboard light will still be on, but the next ship you switch to will have orange controls again. And you have to tap CapsLock\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eagain\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0-- which will make the controls blue for this ship (until you change focus), but will turn the keyboard light\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eoff\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeyond that, yes, the atmosphere from 20km to 40km is easily thick enough to flip some\u00A0rockets\u00A0if you try to maneuver them. Some rocket designs can handle it, some can\u0027t. The way I design my rockets, they can only take a small amount of steering below 40km, or mine go out of control just like yours. There are advantages and disadvantages to designing rockets this way -- and I think the advantages are greater. But I came to that decision after a lot of testing, and knowing exactly which choices I was making.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd If you have an electricity problem, you may need to add a couple batteries --\u00A0if you have researched them.
