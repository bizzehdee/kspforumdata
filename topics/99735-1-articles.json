View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith five docking attachment points, the wings will remain secure, even under time warp. The jets have enough fuel get into orbit with about a fifth of a tank left (on a good run). The main nuclear engine has plenty of delta V to make it to Duna, and I\u0027m 75% sure that a better pilot than I can pull off a Laythe round trip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor maximum efficiency, park a pair of wings at your destination, and then just pick them up when you need them - no reason to haul them around interplanetary like I did in the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 286 parts and 33.4 tons fully fueled, the Alaflux is no lightweight, but it is very well behaved. Either with wings on or off, fuel is positioned symmetrically around the center of mass, so the center of mass does not shift (and flight characteristics do not change) as fuel is burned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction groups are as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Jets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Nuke\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) -empty-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Undock 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Undock 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Landing legs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Front intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8) Rear intakes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Escape pod gear deploy / retract\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0) Emergency parachute\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort) Detach cockpit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E7FoCZO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E7FoCZO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite having a substantial number of intakes, the Alaflux has a ceiling of around 31,000 meters. A typical flight profile has a fast climb to 22,000 or so, leveling out at around 25,000 and then slowly following the apogee up to 30,000. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAir intakes are attached in the correct order to minimize asymmetrical flame-out, though docking and undocking the wings may well screw this up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo detach the wings, hit both 4 and 5 (in that order). You may still have to manually decouple the bottom rear ports for some reason. Redocking is hard to make look easy, but not actually so difficult. Thanks to precise tolerances and angled docking ports, you should get a solid connection on all the ports almost every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/a0EfA9d.png\u0022 alt=\u0022a0EfA9d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs demonstrated, the Alaflux has a comprehensive abort system, functional at zero-zero, with monoprop reserves and thrusters for limited airless maneuvering, as well as good gliding characteristics and redundant parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably my last release until 1.0, but I hope you enjoy it in the meantime.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft download available \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/o62bthjo2a2xkll/Alaflux_Alpha.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Drewscriver\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-15T23:08:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2015 11:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Validity","CreatedById":129380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T17:08:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is absolutely amazing! \u002Brep to you, love the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-15T17:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewow, some seriously thorough work on that SSTO.
