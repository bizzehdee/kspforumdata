However, authors may have affiliations to GM crop companies of other types, such as being members of advisory boards, consultants, or co-holders of patents [\u003Ca class=\u0022ref-tip\u0022 href=\u0022http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167777#pone.0167777.ref013\u0022 style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(60, 99, 175); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E13\u003C/a\u003E], and this could also have a significant impact on the outcomes of studies on GM crops. We did not consider these affiliations as they are not usually reported in articles (COI statements became obligatory in some journals only recently and, as revealed here, they remain very rare). The consideration of other types of affiliation would require a survey that would be difficult to perform given that more than 1,500 authors were considered in this study.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca class=\u0022link-target\u0022 id=\u0022article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p3\u0022 name=\u0022article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p3\u0022 style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(60, 99, 175); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 0.8125rem; padding: 0px; font-family: arial; font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8125rem; line-height: 1.125rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; word-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\u0022\u003E\nThird, we have considered only the links between authors and GM crop companies. Other stakeholders (e.g. Greenpeace, The Non-GMO Project, The Organic Consumers Association, The Network of European GMO-free Regions) oppose GM crop companies in being openly against the use of GM crops. An inverse relationship might therefore be expected between the outcomes of studies on GM crops and the presence of COIs relating to these stakeholders. We were unable to test this hypothesis because we identified no financial interests connected with anti-GMO stakeholders, in terms of the professional affiliation of the authors or their declared funding sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca class=\u0022link-target\u0022 id=\u0022article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p4\u0022 name=\u0022article1.body1.sec3.sec5.p4\u0022 style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(60, 99, 175); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 0.8125rem; padding: 0px; font-family: arial; font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8125rem; line-height: 1.125rem; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; word-wrap: break-word; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\u0022\u003E\nFinally, this study focused exclusively on financial COIs. Non-financial COIs, also known as intrinsic or intellectual COIs \u2014 due to personal, political, academic, ideological, or religious interests \u2014 might also have a significant impact on the outcomes of research studies [\u003Ca class=\u0022ref-tip\u0022 href=\u0022http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167777#pone.0167777.ref004\u0022 style=\u0022box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(60, 99, 175); text-decoration: none; line-height: inherit;\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E4\u003C/a\u003E].

first place we are instead wandering into unknown territory putting a bandaid on the problem. \u00A0And yes, corn syrup is a HUGE issue. \u00A0Corn is incredibly stupid to be growing anyways, as its nutritional value isn\u0027t that good. \u00A0Massive amounts of land are being used to produce corn syrup and fuel, basically, not food. \u00A0GMO is a bandaid to the issues of runaway population and unsustainable farming methods that negatively impact the environment. \u00A0THAT is my issue against GMO more than health concerns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on top of that, GMO has been used as a way to FORCE farmers to have to continue their relationships with the seed providers indefinitely. \u00A0This I am very concerned about. \u00A0This is just a few specific implementations of GMO I\u0027m talking about, but it illustrates that there are issues and some of the issues are political and economic. \u00A0Some are environmental, like Roundup resistant crops which create ecosystem problems because now fields are being sprayed with Roundup which kills all plants that aren\u0027t resistant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd \u0022protein\u0022 does not equal \u0022safe\u0022. \u00A0Prions are proteins too, and they will kill you. \u00A0Your cells and everything they do involves proteins, which can go awry and kill you. \u00A0There is no way you can say that just because something is only creating odd proteins that it can\u0027t be harmful. \u00A0That is scientifically absurd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I\u0027m not saying all GMO is bad. \u00A0In reality, just crossbreeding plants is actually a form of GMO. \u00A0My position is that each specific GMO implementation needs to be evaluated for health impacts, environmental impacts, genomic impacts, etc. \u00A0And if we rigorously did that, we would likely find that some GMO implementations are perfectly safe and others have negative impacts. \u00A0GMO is a pretty broad term.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way we farm industrially is actually quite unwise and GMO tends to be a way to just keep on doing unwise things. \u00A0That, I think is a huge downside. \u00A0Using GMO to stall impacts from other problems, like population, is simply kicking the can down the road so we have monstrously huge problems later to address, like population, ecosystem collapse, environmental damage, etc. \u00A0It doesn\u0027t HAVE to be that way, GMO could be part of solving issues, but the ways it tends to be implemented these days is more focused on making lots of money, being able to keep on engaging in unsustainable farming practices and keeping farmers tied to the companies that are making tons of money from them, rather than addressing root issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst any farmer can use legacy seeds, this give lower yield so it make more economical sense to buy high yield seed from providers.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd yes you will get perhaps 0.2% second year growth if you switch grain type, this is pretty easy to see in fields if the previous year plants was higher.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe safety part is vastly overblown, plants mutates all the time, people has used radiation on seeds to increase the mutation rate in hope on getting something useful, probably the origin of many of the superhero creation stories like spiderman. Now the old shotgun type GM would have an chance of adding weird stuff, it was basically an more targeted version of the radiation, you had to breed the plants true afterwards.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nModern GM eliminates this. In short its way more likely to get bad stuff out of plants because of random mutations who is an hanger on in the breeding stock than GM itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis has never been an serious problem as I know, yes you have the green spots on potatoes. Some plants are poisonous before cooking but they are not major crops.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAn real problem is if you get one version of an plant who is very popular and everybody uses its an huge single point failure if its weak to some disease.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbably the main danger of an very successful gm plant.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow you could GM an plant into providing useful chemicals. Here it would be very stupid to use common plants who give grain for food\u00A0then you just as well could use other plants where its no danger the product could get mixed up and breed with others.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the population issue, that part don\u0027t need GM, its also mostly solved. Now more efficient plants would probably increase the amount of wilderness as less farmland is needed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is an real effect in the west today, plenty of marginal farmland has returned to forests as its too labor intensive to use.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James Kerman","CreatedById":160462,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-17T17:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretend I\u0027m a farmer growing legacy canola on my farm.\u00A0 My neighbour decides to plan roundup ready canola on the paddock next to mine.\u00A0 Cross pollination and seed distribution mix GM stock (that includes a terminator gene) into my crop and sooner or later I have no choice but to buy my seeds yearly like everyone else.\u00A0 Compounding this the crops are\u00A0concentrated in the most fertile areas with suitable climate - given enough time everyone will have to use GM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want a for profit company to have that much power over world food stocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-17T18:02:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222891297\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153624\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221481996333\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160462\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022James Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, James Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretend I\u0027m a farmer growing legacy canola on my farm.\u00A0 My neighbour decides to plan roundup ready canola on the paddock next to mine.\u00A0 Cross pollination and seed distribution mix GM stock (that includes a terminator gene) into my crop and sooner or later I have no choice but to buy my seeds yearly like everyone else.\u00A0 Compounding this the crops are\u00A0concentrated in the most fertile areas with suitable climate - given enough time everyone will have to use GM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want a for profit company to have that much power over world food stocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeds with the terminator gene would not reproduce.\u00A0this has an downside in that you would have to use more seeds then planting to compensate for the defect seeds.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow after some generations you could try to spray an small patch with\u00A0roundup, some of the plants would survive, they have the\u00A0roundup ready gene but not the terminator one.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore breeding would be needed to keep the species stable but it should be possible to get an stable stock.
