These measurements will allow calculations of the depth in rock or soil to which this flux, when integrated over long timescales, provides a lethal dose for known terrestrial organisms. Through such measurements, scientists can learn how deep below the surface life would have to be, or have been in the past, to be protected.[44]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve me dude, I would love to believe that humans living on Mars, much less getting there, was something I might see in my lifetime.
