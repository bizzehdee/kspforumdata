Taking the LF to be Kerosene/RP-1, which makes sense for it being a common fuel for both rocket and jet engines, the fuel quantity when you use a LF\u002BO tank with no O for the LV-N is better than if you had the correct LH tank for the LV-N. In reality, the LV-N can\u0027t actually run on KSP\u0027s LF it has to use LH.
