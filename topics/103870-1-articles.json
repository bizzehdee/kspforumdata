I\u0027ve seen that term in the context of nuclear war scenarios - One of the big worries during the Cold War was a Soviet SSBN sitting a couple hundred miles off the eastern seaboard and peppering the coast with depressed-trajectory SLBM shots. From the mainland of the Soviet Union, we would have had about 30 minutes between launch and impact. A depressed-trajectory shot from close range would probably have dropped that to less than 5 minutes between launch detection and detonation.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T00:29:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe question is referencing XKCD What If? #107, which is about sending a letter from New Jersey to Chicago as fast as possible (BTW, buy the What If? book, its a great book and an awesome conversation piece if you are in an academic/science/engineering environment).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally, a surface-to-surface transatmospheric trajectory between two given points has an optimal arc which minimizes fuel consumption, the transit time of which is defined by the parameters of optimization. This is akin to how the most efficient route to orbit is a form of the gravity turn which we all know and love. However, it is possible to fly a fuel-inefficient surface-to-surface trajectory which gives a lower time in flight than the fuel-optimal arc. Since such a trajectory typically is both lower in altitude and exhibits a more platykurtic altitude distribution, it appears \u0022squashed\u0022, \u0022flattened\u0022, or possibly \u0022depressed\u0022 to an observer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T00:34:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thadisjones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thadisjones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe question is referencing XKCD What If? #107, which is about sending a letter from New Jersey to Chicago as fast as possible (BTW, buy the What If? book, its a great book and an awesome conversation piece if you are in an academic/science/engineering environment).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssential bathroom reading material.
