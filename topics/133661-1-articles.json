The problem is I have used the sub-assembly feature in the past to save sub-assemblies,\u00A0I took a break for a few patches, and now it\u0027s not in my game. It used to be under the other tabs in the construction category, was it moved? I noticed I can now merge saved crafts together, and I tried using that to save sub-assemblies, however saved crafts require everything to be properly attached to the first part and it\u0027s very unusable to save sub-assemblies for that reason. I thought it might be because I was in Career mode and I needed further upgrades to unlock it, but I couldn\u0027t find it after starting a Sandbox mode either. How can I use sub-assemblies again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SinBad","CreatedById":158888,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T03:12:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTop left of the building window in vab or sph is an arrow.
