This all sounds very encouraging with respect to some of the worst bugs affecting playability, and June 20th is not so long to wait, so I\u0027m pretty jazzed. Not having to spam struts all over my wings so they don\u0027t snap off will be a very welcome upgrade, as will not having my planes suddenly and irreversibly turn into hideous drag monsters in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for no apparent reason.\u00A0 One issue that I haven\u0027t seen specifically addressed that is really causing me a lot of problems is all kinds of weird stuff happening when I get two large craft within physics range of each other for docking. Often the focused or target craft will just blow up or disappear as soon as I hit the edge of the physics bubble, and even if that doesn\u0027t happen, often I\u0027m getting all kinds of weird camera behavior trying to switch back and forth between orbiting craft when they are in physics range. I also often seem to\u00A0 lose my target selection and then have no ability to properly re-select that target. In KSP1 that was as simple as double clicking on the target or target part in the flight view, but that doesn\u0027t seem to work at all in KSP2, and doing so in the map view with two closely spaced ships seems well nigh impossible. Hopefully that one\u0027s on the \u0022lesser known\u0022 list, because it would sure be great to have a fix for it soon!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SethM","CreatedById":229189,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-09T22:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t wait for patch three!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(actually I can \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jclovis3","CreatedById":188635,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-09T22:30:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bug I\u0027ve experienced so much it tops half of this top ten list IMHO is how landing gear can cause the craft to flip like crazy, even sometimes explode, upon extending if extended at too high an altitude. The workaround seems to be wait until you are close to the ground so I think there is a point of reference issue with this. I have since been avoiding use of landing legs all together as a result. Often, coming out of time warp with legs extended triggers the sudden toss and turn of the ship too.
