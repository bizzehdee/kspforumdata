The previous plane with 12 engines had about half that per engine but I kept it flatter while gaining speed and projected altitude. I believe it also held and I flew it to the apoapsis. So for optional added challenge also fly it the apoapsis and take a pic! 8p\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso include a pic of the plane itself. Preferably in flight.
