I always try to have the final contract be around, say, the Mun or Minmus. That way, a satellite that has reached the end of its lifetime becomes either an orbiting fuel tanker, or a space tug. With that in mind, I overfill them with lots of fuel, and I put a klaw on the nose (if I\u0027ve unlocked it at that point). So my ex-satellites permanently\u00A0remain semi-useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T18:53:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI notice you\u0027re hiding debris.\u00A0 The ship might be considered debris if it happens to be something that\u0027s not a cockpit.\u00A0 (Convenient sometimes.\u00A0 There\u0027s labs around I might use once my kerbals invent the Claw.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what level is your tracking station?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-14T18:56:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2016 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Corona688\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
