Being my first craft for 0.16, the actual rocket wasn\u0027t very good, as shown in the oversized picture below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1BgUp.jpg?1?9919\u0022 alt=\u00221BgUp.jpg?1?9919\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are all the pictures for this craft now. Anyway, Back then I had a bad habit of putting the rocket really high up, to make me need to go less distance. Yeah. Also, something notable about this craft is that it is in a very low orbit. Infact, I use it\u0027s orbit to tell when my orbit is out of the athnosphere. It used to be at almost spot on 70 kilometers, but the kraken kept reeling it in. so I did a couple orbital burns over the time, but now I have it in a 73 kilometer orbit. Safe from the kraken\u0027s grasp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sX9DV.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022sX9DV.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft has a big story to tell. And it begins back in 0.15. I deleted it now, so I have no screenshots of it. That\u0027s probably for the best. But anyway, I decided it was time to fulfill a goal I had for too long. It was time to design Voyager 1. It got into a Kerbol orbit, and I expanded the orbit for a while, waiting for the escape trajectory with a huge excitement. The orbit stopped expanding before getting close. Voyager 2 had a much wider orbit, I was very sure that I would make it this time, the apoapsis expanding like crazy, and then stopped short. It was a very big orbit, don\u0027t get me wrong, but it was not. Good. Enough. Voyager 3 was the one that made it. I was so happy for it, but then one day I accidently pressed \u0022End Flight\u0022 instead of \u0022Space Center\u0022. I never re-launched it. Over in 0.16, all that was behind me, and I launched another probe, not using the bigger parts that I didn\u0027t understand. It was called Voyager 1 (ADWTH). The ADWTH standing for \u0022A Disaster Waiting To Happen\u0022. It blew up on the launchpad. Voyager 2 (ADWTH) was it. my probe to the stars. It used to have jebediah in it, but I got him out to end his flight so he could be in other missions. But this wasn\u0027t any old Voyager. I used a clever tactic to reach escape velocity. SRBs. No wonder Jeb was in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yXCJv.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yXCJv.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J0AtR.jpg?1?3149\u0022 alt=\u0022J0AtR.jpg?1?3149\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the Polar Lander. It lands on the Poles. Need I say more? I basicly just do some onion staging, just like everything I build, and cancel out the movement I get from Kerbin\u0027s spin once I get into the higher athnosphere. I then go suborbital up to the pole, and do a powered landing there. Also, it is so tall it has 2 of the big ladders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-11T12:59:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2012 12:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by SNapple\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded Polar Lander\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
