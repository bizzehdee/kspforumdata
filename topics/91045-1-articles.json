It is a very small drone, powered by one Ant Engine. I made this in KSP .25, with NEAR (not sure if it works without) and TweakScale (to reduce the size of the landing gear and tail fin). To not waste all the fuel, use short bursts of power (by the way, Squad implemented a new feature - Z for full throttle) when speed gets too low. It is essentially a glider.
