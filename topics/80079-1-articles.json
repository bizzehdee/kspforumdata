Going without!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - Mun mission... I\u0027ll have a 30-percent delta-v buffer, so that means I\u0027ll have roughly 10,000m/s of total delta-v budget for the entire trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - this design is on the ragged edge of an ideal delta-v budget... and that\u0027s cuz I\u0027m broke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - I don\u0027t care if I will never need to use the gigantic solar arrays (short of ion probes), they look cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - OX-STATS are practically free! But I\u0027ll only use four, since I want to mimimize air drag on the ascent...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - Six antenna, because redundancy and Rule of Cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - What\u0027s an antenna? Are you implying I\u0027m not coming back to Kerbin? We don\u0027t need no stinking antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - I need no less than six crew to fly this mission to Jool and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECarer - Hey guys? I need ONE brave soul with nothing to do for the next five years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - 600-part ship on yet another routine trip to Duna and back. Framerate sucks, but it looks cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - 50-part ship on a first-ever trip to Eeloo and back. But hey, DAT FRAMERATE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - Those ARM Rocketdyne parts are great for shoving 300 ton monsters into LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - Those ARM part cost HOW MUCH? Nope, we\u0027lre doing this with Skippers and maaaaaybe Mainsails if I\u0027m feeling... generous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - 300 tons to LKO, goes nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - 20 tons leaving LKO, already moving out to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - MORE STRUTS!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - Gah, even struts cost money.. okay, here\u0027s just a few struts, but no more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - Welp, botched a landing, killed the crew... better luck next time, guys!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - *cries*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - Man, this game is super easy and fun!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - I am sweating bullets trying not to botch a Munar landing, because if I do, I\u0027m broke as hell and might as well wipe the save and start over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - MOAR BOOSTERS are for losers who can\u0027t set up fuel lines right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - I have never been so wrong in my entire life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - half of my ship is not fuel, but it looks cool!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - My ship is about 90-percent fuel tanks by weight, but I\u0027m still looking for any not-fuel weight I can shave off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESandbox - I\u0027ll just sort of half-bake my burns and hope it works out, since I have spare fuel I can correct it with, later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer - SILENCE!
