It\u0027s all about the marginal costs. If refurbishing a stage costs $10 million and a new stage costs $15 million, you\u0027re better off refurbishing. Production space that used to be used for building Falcon 9 stages can be put to other uses, such as Dragon2 construction, construction of the Raptors or the next lifter design. At the very worst, production space can be sold/subleased to another company, assuming SpaceX isn\u0027t able to use the space themselves for something else. The Hawthorn facility is 1,000,000 sqft or so, and the cost of the space, is probably no more than $40/sqft/year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming refurbishing saves SpaceX $5 million per F9 launch and only refurbishes two boosters per year...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the reusing customers probably get some discount, let\u0027s say $2 million/launch.

In the fictional example above, the customer is only better of by some figure, maybe $1.5 million (insurers will almost certainly demand a higher premium for using reused rockets). I have no idea the cost of a F9 launch, the CRS missions from a quick search are ~$200 million. So a customer of a reused F9 might see a savings of ~1% of the launch cost. Not exactly a revolution, but still a good start (any cost savings are a good start, even if it\u0027s free snacks for employees in lieu of $1,000 more in their paychecks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-09T22:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaking an orbital depot would increase demand, NASA would need orbital services and they could contract out certain launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the economies of scale would work for a reusable system, you would treat the service as the product.

Only SpaceX management can do the proper cost/benefit calculation for reusability, and they can only do that after they have some experience in actually recovering, refurbishing, and relaunching.
