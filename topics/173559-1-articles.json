to make anything free, and this entire discussion is completely pointless as they are now stuck with what is done, since making stuff free will seriously turn off those that bought the DLC, likely

division among the community, and puts people into a bad situation where those that bought the DLC cant upload a DLC part craft without potentially annoying some people that cant use it, and vice versa where people that dont have the DLC get annoyed with being unable to download a DLC craft (especially in situations where said craft has but 1 DLC part in it even if it can function without that part.\u00A0 Myself, i have no intention of buying the DLC anytime soon (until take 2 can prove to me they care about quality of KSP and not rushing it to meet investor meeting deadlines and other BS, then ofc release something super buggy, im not giving them a penny), and i honestly dont care (ive yet to find a craft i wanted to download with DLC only parts in it, but thats beside the

to see in future DLC is multiplayer (never been done thusfar in a method that isnt so buggy its pointless), optimized visual effects like clouds (doubtful devs can beat \u003Cabbr
