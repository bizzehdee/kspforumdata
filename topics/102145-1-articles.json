Reading the comments on that thread, I think most of us agree that bugfixing and such is the most important aspect of 1.0, with some concerns for balance and what not. \n\nI also think that\u0027s important for 1.0, but the dev\u0027s willingness to ask us if we want more features makes me wonder what I would still want being added to the stock game after release. \n\nI have not included Unity 5 in the poll because mostly everyone want\u0027s that anyway. Maxmaps\u0027 comment makes me think the devs will get to that when they get to that.\n\n**More planets should be counted as part of \u0022game mechanics\u0022, so if that\u0027s what you want, vote 4.**\n\n**Oh, and I forgot multiplayer... I guess, count that as 4 too.** \n\n(I think I made a spelling mistake in the poll. It should be \u0022parts\u0022, not \u0022part\u0027s\u0022, right?

One reason for English becoming such a universal *lingua franca*, besides colonization, is that learning English is actually quite easy: no endless verb inflections! But Spanish has very clear and unmistakable spelling rules, and graphical accents make it very easy to read a word and know how to say it.
