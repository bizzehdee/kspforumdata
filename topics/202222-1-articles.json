I wished we knew more about the mining and part production process. Depending on complexity, or type etc, it could lead to parts unable to be made at one colony that\u0027s needed for another. While I myself kind of like the thought, to inspire those pre-programmed??? flight paths they\u0027re talking about and encourage intercolonial trading, it seems this may be another one of those slippery slope situations to where it could be overdone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nirgal","CreatedById":211448,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-05T23:39:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgree 100%, supposing the \u0027standard\u0027 colony habitat module comes with full life support..

If my habitat dome is \u0022Eve grade\u0022, then it\u0027s good enough for Pol. However the player will most likely have to adapt and make choices regarding the environment he\u0027s building in: Should I go nuclear or solar on Eeloo? Should I bring more radiators on Moho? Should I build a vertical base on Tylo or go for a more \u0022grounded\u0022 design?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully the new base editing system will allow us to adapt in case of a bad design choice.
