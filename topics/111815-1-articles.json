Your agency as research goes on gains the ability to have civilians take part on your exploration, ultimately letting you recruit new crew members from the population (the motivation for taking civilians with you).

They require food to survive and have not been trained on how to eat a diet of snacks. The management of your civilian population relies on generating enough food for them. If you have enough food they\u0027ll live. If you don\u0027t they\u0027ll die off. It\u0027s that simple. \n\n*Space Tourism:*\n\nCivilians will flock to your space stations and bases which can support them. You can either transport them yourself or you can hire Civilian space agencies to transport them for you. The space agencies gave Netherdyne plans for a universal docking port which their transports will use. Attach the port to your station or base and you civilians will come. Space tourism is limited to the kerbin system (Kerbin, Mun, Minmus).\n\n*Civilian reproduction and long voyages:*\n\nIf your civilian population is big enough (20 or more) they\u0027ll start reproducing. This will produce a new recruitment able Kerbal every 3 kerbin months. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/ty0lO)\n\n**Understanding the stats on the Civilian Quarters parts:**\n\n- Food per pop: This is the minimum amount of food your ship\u0027s stores must have on hand to support the population. To get the required amount multiply this by the size of your civilian population. It\u0027s easy: 1:1. So 50 population requires a minimum of 50 food to support. Each farm module is scaled to support a 1:1 quarters to farm size. The large biospheres support the largest of population capacities. Each farm tells you how much population it can support.\n- Population Growth Rate: this is the time in seconds it takes for your population to grow through reproduction.\n- Population Decay Rate: this is the time in seconds it takes for your population to decay.\n- Growth and Decay timers: these show the current state of growth or decay. When these pass their respective rate the population will change by 1.\n- Reproduction rate: this is the minimum population your ship needs to start reproduction. The speed your population grows at scales based on how big it is beyond this. A population of 150 will reproduce 3 times faster than a population of 50.\n- Total consumption rate: this is how fast your population is consuming food\n- civilianDock: If you have a civilian contractor dock attached to your ship this indicates it.\n- civilianDockGrowthRate: this scales your ship\u0027s growth rate by the number indicated. Scale is 1000 for kerbin and kerbin orbit, 100 for Mun, 10 for Minmus.\n- GrowthRate: This is how fast your population is growing.\n- Recruit Kerbal: You can recruit a new crew member from the population onboard the module. Each Civilian module except the dock supports a number of Crew slots.\n\n*Population changes over time, even when you\u0027re not watching!*\n\nThe civilian population on your ship or base will change over time even when you\u0027re doing something else (flying another mission perhaps). How the population fares depends on how well you managed the food on your ship. Make sure your ship, station, or base has food and all the farms are operational before you leave it!\n\n**Managing your Civilian Population**\n\n**Basics:**\n\nCivilian Population requires food, water, and oxygen to survive. They will produce Carbon Dioxide, Waste Water, and Waste. Each civilian module (except the contractor dock) has space for 1 kerbin-day\u0027s worth of waste and 1 kerbin day-s worth of needs for the population that it supports.\n\nProduction of food requires biomass and water. Food is produced at a garden module or at the farm biodome.\n\nGarden modules and the farm biodome are equipped with recyclers which can convert the waste water and waste back into water and biomass. The plants inside also act as natural scrubbers, clearing out the CO2 and producing Oxygen. The farms do not come with biomass storage. These must be attached through way of the fertilizer pod. Use of the other resource pods is recommended for an extra buffer of resources. If a waste resource builds up to the cap the excess will be dumped out into space. It is thus imperative that you keep the recycler running. The recyclers will outpace the waste production for their intended population size. \n\nThe biodomes and civilian modules are paired together to make managing this simple. The civilian population will grow once it is larger than 20 members. This growth requires a kerbal\u0027s mass in food (about 380 food). They may also come to your base or station through way of the civilian contractor dock. When they immigrate to your station, ship, or base this way they don\u0027t consume 380 food per growth. Farm food stores can be quite massive, equating to roughly 120 days worth of food for one kerbal on the small garden. That is because the colony\u0027s population growth will need the food.\n\n![Y2eJxXT.png](http://i.imgur.com/Y2eJxXT.png)\n\nThe pictured land crawler shows everything you need to maintain your civilian population and to grow it. Left to right: mining container, garden, fertilizer for garden, Civilian pod, laser drill.\n\n**In-situ resource utilization:**\n\nWater and substrate must be present in some amount at the landing site for your colony (much like MKS) for you to get the resources to grow the civilian population. The laser drill can be used to grab these resources. If you have MKS then you can use those parts to get the resources as well. The laser drill has the same efficiency as those parts.\n\n**Recruiting specific job kerbals:**\n\nIf you wish to recruit kerbals with specific jobs (pilot, engineer, scientist) you can use the movie theater, university, and flight school.\n\nThe **Movie Theater** is the basic part required for this. Your kerbals need inspiration for them to decide that they want to do a specific job. To get that inspiration you play movies for them in the theater. Select a type of movie to get a bonus to recruitment for the job it matches:\n\n**- Racing movies:** Engineer kerbals are inspired by the act of tuning up a vehicle to win races. Playing these movies makes engineer recruitment 10% cheaper.\n\n**- Scifi movies:** Pilot kerbals are inspired by dogfights, things blowing up, basically what Jeb grew up on. Play these movies to get a 10% cost reduction on pilots.\n\n**-** **Documentaries:** Scientist kerbals love documentaries about the solar system, plants, animals, and space exploration. They especially love the ones they wrote ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Play documentaries to get a 10% cost reduction on scientist recruitment.\n\nNEW: **Romance Movies:** Inspire your kerbal civilians to find that special someone and continue out the kerbals race in all of your far flung colonies.\n\n\\*\\* All recruitment costs 50 inspiration, unless you\u0027re playing a matching movie type.\n\n**The University** comes in when you want an educated kerbal Scientist or Engineer. See the movie theater makes a kerbal think he knows what he\u0027s doing. A university makes sure he knows. The university has a science lab for the scientists to process research experiments.\n\nTo recruit a level 3 Scientist or Engineer requires 5000 education and 50 inspiration. Open Classes to start the education. Educating a new kerbal will take roughly 10 kerbin days.\n\n**The Flight School** comes in when you want a pilot who crashes less than Jeb.\n\nTo recruit a level 3 Pilot requires 5000 flight experience and 50 inspiration. Open classes to start the training. Training a new pilot takes roughly 10 kerbin days.\n\n**Robotic construction facilities:**\n\nThe laser drill now has an ore drill on it. The netherdyne smelters return as well. Combine the Cnc Mill, smelter, Construction drone, and laser drill to enable construction of bases or stations in situ without the need for a kerbal present (though you may want one or two to place survey stakes). You still need to find suitable ore deposits. In situ construction requires Extraplanetary Launchpads. \n\n**Rent****:**\n\nCivilians generate Rent now! Earn 200 funds per civilian per day as they live in your apartments on your station, ship or base.\n\n**Some FAQS**\n\n**Is a Life Support mod needed?**\n\n--Nope! Though it does take away a bit of the fun. Without a life support mod your kerbalnauts will not consume resources, but civilians still need resources to survive. All resources are defined by included community resources pack, so no additional mods are needed. And the included Hydrospheres will provide said resources. That noted, i high recommend running a life support mod.\n\n**What Life support mods are currently Supported?**\n\n-- Civilian Populations currently supports both TAC-LS and USI-LS. The system will adapt to whichever one you have installed. Just please don\u0027t install both. That\u0027s like dividing by 0, Oh the Kermanity! \n\n**Do I need MKS?**\n\n**--**No. It enhances the experience though, providing parts to expand your base or station with. MKS unfocused simulation is now compatible.\n\n**Other mods which I highly recommend to go with CivPop:**\n\n[Scansat](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80369) (for resources)\n\n[Extraplanetary launchpads](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545-1-0-x-Extraplanetary-Launchpads-v5-1-92-%28beta%29) (for building huge cities on a planet)\n\n[Hangar Extender](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65747-1-0-Hangar-Extender-v3-3): For building Generation ships with the new parts in 1.2\n\nChangelog:\n\n    1.7.5.1\n    -- Fixed animation on small reactor.\n    --small bug with craft in kerbin SOI without Civilian Docking Ports\n    --added tweakscale config\n\n    1.7.5 Update:\n\n    Fixes:\n\n    Refinements/Additions\n\n    1.7.4.1:Hotfix\n\n    1.7.4 Update:\n    \n    Fixes:\n\n    New Parts:\n\n    Version 1.7.3.2\n\n    Version 1.7.3.1-\u0022Dont Code and Upload\u0022\n\n    Version:1.7.3 - \u0022Land Lord Edition\u0022\n\n    1.7.2.1:\n    --\u003E Hotfixed small apartment with new model (new model was slightly smaller than the old one, scaled up to fix, and be the same size as the old one) Thanks for the update Cosmic_Farmer!\n    --\u003E Reduced mass of a couple parts (Landing legs were overweight, Large reactor just slightly, and Constrution Drone Part) \n    --\u003E Lowered Productivity of the Constructor (from 30 to 15) Was way overpowered, if you like the old way your welcome to adjust the cfg \n    --\u003ENew part by request, Smaller Reactor Module, for your compact bases/ships!

Revolt and attempted world Domination, Human oversite has been added to the Construction Drone. (A Kerbal with wire-snips) -------(I.E. at the current time, building unmanned with EPL does not work without a forking of the EPL code and some revisions). The Construction Vehicle still will provide over 30\u002B productivity since it will have A.I. assistance \n    \n    Fixed regular Core Girder model orientation. (Cosmetic issue, but would make folks who already have them on ships look weird)\n    Added CLS (Connected Living Spaces) config that should have shipped with last patch.\n    Doubled power production on Reactor Module increased weight to compensate.

Fixed this)\n    \n    Updated to the latest version of CRP (Community Resource Pack)\n    Fixed issue with 6x6 Core Girder, Core length is now proper.\n    USI-LS Integration: If you are using USI-LS as opposed to TAC. All the parts should now adapt to the new resources.\n    New Structural Parts!: Along with the original empty and Core Girder, there is now a T, X, and L junction. All the 6x6 girder parts were retextured, and new supports added in (thanks for the inspiration Cosmic_Farmer!)\n    New Structural Panels as well\n    \n    1.0.4 Compatibility\n    Added 3 new parts (Reactor, Command Module Saucer, X-Large SAS Module)\n    Even more model and texture touch ups/opitmizations (Courtasy of Cosmic_Farmer) Shaved about another MB off the download size\n    Updated to the 1.0.4 version of KSPAPIExtensions\n    \n    Removed some unneeded textures\n    Rebalanced food production/Water production\n    Add electricity usage to all manned crew vehicles (along with electricity)\n    Added waste recylcling loop for Farms/Biodomes.\n    Reduced Civ immigration rate for Civie Docking port (it was too fast.)\n    Model Optimization (memory reduction and rextuxure to several models) THANKS COSMIC_FARMER!\n    \n    Laser Drill has MetalOre extraction added\n    Laser Smelter to smelt said Metal Ore into Metal.\n    CNC Mill to take the metal and create rocketparts.\n    Construction Drone to Construct Base parts in-situ. (NOTE: Due to the way EPL\u0027s productivity system works, there is still a manned requirement for parts to be construted. I simple attach a small housing modules to the Drone.

Ive already got a model for a large Hadron-like Particle Collider that id like to bring into the pack.\n- Happy to take any suggestions you may have.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T19:29:48Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rabidninjawombat**"},{"CreatedByName":"DigitalProeliator","CreatedById":75677,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:28:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ill fix those nodes today ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Thought i had gone through all of em but guess i missed a couple. Also will have the rest of the construction parts out today. \n\u003E In regards to the Airlock.. No IVA on the airlock.. I may get around to working on one in the future. Getting a kerbal into a dome is simple. Just enter through the outside, then EVA them by clicking on the inside hatch, and select EVA. I can also implement the default IVA as well.. though it obviously wont match interior (it what the MkII modules use in MKS)\n\nNo worries. When I was messing around with the Wayland Eagle MK2 and I had odd things happen like parts go flying off, parts shifting positions on reloads and falling through the planet. It only went away after adding the black placeholder IVA so I just assumed... Probably a bad thing when your trying to learn how things work lol.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T21:45:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 09:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DigitalProeliator**"},{"CreatedByName":"garithmar","CreatedById":131642,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T00:49:16Z","Content":"Not sure if it\u0027s just my other mods but the three bio domes for space seem to have bad output input amounts for resources."},{"CreatedByName":"rabidninjawombat","CreatedById":108889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T01:36:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not sure if it\u0027s just my other mods but the three bio domes for space seem to have bad output input amounts for resources.\n\nI did find a small error in the largest Orbital biodome, (wasn\u0027t drawing enough electricity, and the efficiency was off, was actually producing too much) \n\nAll the other parts seem to be fine.

If your just looking at the CFG, it looks like they are using the same, but the EfficiencyBonus rating each part has is different, each number should be designed to produce the request number of food to match the corresponding apartment block (i.e. the Large Biosphere, will produce enough food to support the large apartment block) put all 3 on the pad, and activate them individually and you\u0027l see the difference.
