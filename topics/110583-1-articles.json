You just need enough wing to lift at low thrust in the thick atmosphere. By the time you get to the middle and mach 1 you will have so much thrust you barely need wings at all, and when you enter the high atmosphere at 1200 m/s the wings are mostly useless anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, IRL, THIS is what the wings on a high-altitude supersonic interceptor look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Lockheed_XF-104.jpg/1024px-Lockheed_XF-104.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221024px-Lockheed_XF-104.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this is a good guide and I appreciate you taking on the work.

Regarding the intakes thing, all this really came from trial and error, but I had three suborbital spaceplanes that turned into SSTOs by doing nothing more than adding a few radial intakes.

Two of the three spaceplanes I fixed by adding radial intakes had less than 1 RAM intake per RAPIER. It might be that you just need at least a 1:1 ratio or the equivalent, so if your design didn\u0027t allow for exactly one intake per engine maybe compensating with radials helps.
