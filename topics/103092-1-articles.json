It is capable of landing at sea level on Eve and then getting back into orbit with about 1000 m/s delta-V to spare. This is enough to (just barely) leave Eve\u0027s SOI. I\u0027m not necessarily sure if it will land in water, however, but it will get to orbit from under 500 meters above the ocean.\n\n![0085B8E4679EFAAD1FD69E9FF16D10265DF260EE](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37493678727722918/0085B8E4679EFAAD1FD69E9FF16D10265DF260EE/)\n\nI have yet to build the main tug for it when it re-orbits. It will quite obviously be an enormous tug.\n\nThe orbit (note apoapsis and periapsis heights from Kerbal Engineer):\n\n![F88C4070F54EE20D136457319577025F04B5D463](http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/37493678727723648/F88C4070F54EE20D136457319577025F04B5D463/)\n\nSo that\u0027s all. I just wanted to show it off as it turned out relatively well, although it is pretty much strutted to death. I certainly didn\u0027t focus on aesthetics.\n\nYou can grab it here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/br65r6yj50erm0m/Eve%207_1.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/br65r6yj50erm0m/Eve%207_1.craft?dl=0)\n\nNote: This craft was built for me for the Eve Rocks challenge on Jebediah\u0027s level, so I have no parachutes. I also haven\u0027t put ladders down yet. All the rest of the craft will be completed in the next few days. NO part clipping was used. As you can see in the above couple of pictures, I have mods. These mods are ONLY for VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS and INFORMATION.
