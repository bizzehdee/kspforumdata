Performing a quick save will allow you to go back and try again in the event an oopsie was made. Of course, you can play along with no saves if you like, but while you\u0027re learning it can be a little aggravating sometimes to put so much effort into a failed attempt. F5 to save, and hold F9 for a few seconds to load that save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy condolences for the loss of Bill \u0026amp; Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
