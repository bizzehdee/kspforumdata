If so, then you are running from that parent KSP directory. Either way copy the backup over the file you changed when you are done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m actually guessing its in a hidden folder similar to the links you started the thread with, only the username is Guest or whatever windows wants to call that account. At this point I would definitely do an all disks search, but for me that is as simple as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efind / -name \u0022*.craft\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wakaleo","CreatedById":143502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecybersol and goldenpsp - Thanks again for your suggestions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a shortcut on the Guest account desktop which is used to launch the game. The target is C:\\Users\\Guest\\KSP_win\\KSP.exe which should be a pretty solid indication that the game is run through that account. To test this I tried your .cfg editing suggestion cybersol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I launched the game from the Guest desktop shortcut and made sure the price of the Mark 1 command pod was as it should be at 600 funds (it was). Then I shut the game down and edited the .cfg file to make the price for the pod 601 funds, then launched the game again. The price was now 601 funds in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried searching for the names the games were saved under (\u003Cem\u003EJiFi Rocketech\u003C/em\u003E - which, by the way, still load with all experience, credits, ships etc.) but the only files it finds are .png files of the flags I created. I\u0027ve searched for any .sfs files on the Guest account. I\u0027ve been into AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files (x86) and found only two folders with no relationship to KSP. I\u0027ve searched in many other places and done a deep search of the entire computer and external drives. All to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I\u0027m stumped!
