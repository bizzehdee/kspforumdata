I am not an expert with computers but I\u0027m also not a dummy. So, to begin:\n\nSystem: Win 7 Pro 64 bit; Intel Core i7 Q740; 500Gb HD; 4Gb RAM\n\nThe hard drive is partitioned (C: \u0026 D and I have a \u0027Games\u0027 folder on D: to install to. I first installed KSP on this partition and it works well. I then installed a few mods to get an idea of what they do and how to use them. I\u0027m still playing this game.\n\nI then decided to install another iteration of the game that I could play without mods and installed it while logged on as \u0027Guest\u0027 - I have two \u0027Users\u0027 - \u0027Guest\u0027 and an administrator account (through which the first KSP was installed). I have played the clean, \u0027Guest\u0027 game for several Kerbal hours, fulfilling contracts and gathering science to unlock more parts (so far having unlocked all up to and including 2 x \u002790 credit\u0027 nodes - I\u0027ve only been a Kerbophile for a few weeks!)\n\nNow I\u0027d like to move the saved game/s and craft from the C:\\Users\\Guest game to the original \u0027Administrator\u0027 installation but for the life of me I cannot find any .craft or .sfs files nor any saved files that relate to my games anywhere in the \u0027Guest\u0027 KSP\\_win account.\n\nI\u0027ve tried the suggestions (e.g. changing permissions, looking elsewhere, etc.) given to the other posters like [LordQuentium on 21st Dec 2014](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104170-0-90-Can-t-find-my-save-files) and [Amishacker\u0027s post of 4th June 2015](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124244-KSP-1-0-save-files-hidden-My-craft-missing) but none have so far helped me to reveal where they are saved.\n\nThere is **no** KSP folder in C:\\Users\\[uSERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\VirtualStore\\Program Files (x86) and no .craft nor .sfs files in the KSP\\_win root folder apart from the default planes, ships and .sfs files in Saves\\Scenarios and Saves\\Training.\n\nSearching for \u0027saves\u0027 or \u0027\\*.sfs\u0027 or \u0027\\*.craft\u0027 or \u0027quicksaves\u0027 generates the \u0027No items match your search\u0027 message, even though the default .sfs and .craft files exist in the KSP\\_win root folder, as does a \u0027saves\u0027 folder. Might this help one of you wonderful people to tell me what is going on?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any further tricks other Kerbophiles may have. It\u0027s all terribly frustrating! ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nAnd I can find the flags created for the game!
