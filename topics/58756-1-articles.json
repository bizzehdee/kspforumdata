I was working on a Tylo landing. Turning a \u0022just captured\u0022 elliptical orbit into a circular one was going to be hell, and doing it in my mothership scheduled a ridiculously long burn time. It was far more efficient to just drop the lander in that orbit, and let it deorbit from the pe. Once it got back into orbit, having a very lightweight lander meet that elliptical orbit on half of one small tank and rockomax engine was a lot more efficient than trying to circularise the mothership.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
