Downloading ships sounds like you are getting them off of spacedock or some such.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo implement\u00A0said ships into your game, you need to open up the folder where KSP is kept. Go to saves/mysandboxmode/ships/ and place it in the correct assembly building.

Inside that are a bunch of directories named by you, when you start a new game.
