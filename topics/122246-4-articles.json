So, if we put the full rover in a 3 x 3 x say 7 meter container, you could feasibly launch a full rover in presupply, which makes it some or no assembly required (Maybe keep the wheels as KAS/KIS assembled at sight parts). Then in 2 launches you could bring both rovers \u002B whatever food stuffs you want as well. Then another say 2 for hab parts including a solar farm and then the Hermes brings the MAV for the next mission as well as the MDV. So, we could keep it as a whole rover and only need say 5-6 pre-supplies which is half of what IRL needs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T23:05:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I love assembling stuff on-site. It\u0027s so much fun for me. So I plan to do it all that way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as KIS goes, there\u0027s a module you can use in the config file to set the volume the part occupies, instead of KIS calculating it based in the mesh size. So I plan to cheat that a little and use the volume the parts would take up if they were folded neatly instead of assembled (ie the wheels). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest container KIS gives is a 6000L storage. Using the cheated part volumes, it would be possible to send all the wheels in one container, possible strapped to the main flatbed. The second flatbed would have the battery pack attached, and a third launch for the cockpit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bazz","CreatedById":61364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECool I have been using the pathfinder rover parts with KIS the jack part is helpful as a base to assemble. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny plans to make parts for the MAV lander?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe MAV lander could have storage that the rover arrived in\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:37:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the MAV is supposed to have the ISRU components to refuel itself, so I assume that\u0027s what a lot of the hull is used for. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd at this time, maybe eventually I\u0027ll do it.
