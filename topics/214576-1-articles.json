After that feat, nothing seemed impossible.

Then they partnered with the mcKerman Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Space to build Starlab, their Kerbin Orbiting Station.

With that task completed, Tobias and Emma waited a day for the latest dust storm to dissipate before they hopped into the rover and set out to collect the AUS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022eKiYkAV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/eKiYkAV.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gFEAe2b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gFEAe2b.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IZpl00H.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IZpl00H.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Dznxfc8.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Dznxfc8.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter driving at unsafe velocities for half an hour, Rover 1 arrived at the AUS. The engineers carefully backed the trailer up until it was right next to one of the AUS\u2019s refueling ports. Then they commanded the stage to retract its solar panels and antenna. Tobias and Emma hoped out of the rover to ensure that everything was lined up properly. Then, after adjusting the trailer\u2019s docking port, they docked to the stage. Carefully, they abused the stage\u0027s refueling port when they lowered the stage onto the trailer for the trip back to Duna Base. The port shrieked, protesting that it had to perform a function that it wasn\u0027t designed for, and it would never again accept propellant transfers. But, it worked- though they blew out one of the wheels in the process. Tobias decided to leave it for now; the weight of the stage now rested on the front trailer wheels. Instead, he added a pair of struts to support the weight of the stage, and then got back into the rover. Once they settled some control issues by shutting down the stage\u2019s reaction wheels, they began the 26 km journey back to Duna Base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Cc9LHkf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Cc9LHkf.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wzUC2oR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wzUC2oR.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey had a mishap on the way back to the base- one of the jack lifts scraped too close to the ground and sheared off- and yet another dust storm overtook them. Then, the rover kept jackknifing, so Tobias stopped the rig, got out, and replaced the broken wheel with one from the back of the trailer. Between that and adjusting the shock absorbers, they finally got the rig under control.

Revolutionary for its time, the Mk33 was the world\u2019s first \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E that had also put his company on the map. It was instrumental in creating several world\u2019s firsts including sending the first space tourist into orbit, building the first space hotel, and building the first orbital shipyard. But as revolutionary as the Mk33 was, it paled in comparison to the Kondor and the technology that it possessed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile the Mk33 was built to carry cargo and crew into orbit like the retired Shuttle Launch System, the Kondor could only carry a pilot and up to three passengers- though larger models were also being considered. Kondor was perfect for those times when you just needed to ferry passengers into orbit and didn\u0027t need the payload capacity of a cargo plane. It was the size of a Buffalo rover like the ones on Duna; in fact, it shared the same body construction. It could easily fit inside a Mk33 payload bay and yet it too was an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E. It accomplished this amazing feat thanks to new propulsion technology that would forever change the nature of spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKondor was powered by a gravitic engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeveloped as an application of graviolium- the exotic matter first discovered when his company captured an asteroid, dubbed \u201CMagic Boulder\u201D by the media, the gravitic engine worked by zapping graviolium with an electric charge, which in turn distorted a small, localized volume of space-time to form a mini gravity well. When electric charge is no longer applied, the distortion field dissipates quickly, and space-time reverts to its natural state. The field is projected a fixed distance in front of the ship- or above it or behind it- and the ship \u201Cfalls\u201D towards the artificial gravity well if the field\u2019s strength is greater than the local gravity field. Gravitic engines aren\u2019t powerful enough to continually apply electric charge and constantly warp space-time, but by rapidly blinking the distortion field- also known as a virtual singularity- on and off like how brakes are applied in an anti-lock braking system, the ship will fall in the desired direction of travel. Best yet, the occupants won\u2019t feel the acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGraviolium had numerous applications, and the gravitic engine was just one of them.

Just the other day, for instance, he proposed a ground-based training facility that would simulate weightlessness and make zero-g trainer aircraft obsolete.

Before they commit to the next iteration of DSEV, they are asking for two teams to create a prototype vessel within 60 days of selection. They\u2019ll evaluate each design for 30 days before selecting the winner. The winning team will have just under 200 days to build the next DSEV and have it ready for the upcoming transfer window to Jool, and they\u0027ll build the next two DSEVs after that as well.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScott paused to let Frolie absorb the information. \u0022What are they evaluating that requires a prototype,\u0022 Frolie asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good question! A number of items, but chief among them is that they want to pit our gravitic engine against Kerbodyne\u0027s new graviolium-catalyzed fusion engine,\u0022 Scott answered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The KF-1 Supernova? I read about that,\u0022 Frolie said. \u0022It\u0027s a pretty clever way to drastically reduce the energy requirements needed to achieve ignition. I thought it was just a paper study. No wonder why they want a prototype...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, makes sense,\u0022 Scott responded. He looked around and then snapped his fingers. \u0022I\u0027m glad\u00A0 we\u2019re here, I\u2019ve finally figured out the questions that I wanted to ask.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure, go ahead.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay, so, we made Finch to be modular, right?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u2026Yeah\u2026?\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe DSX- uh, Deep Space eXperimental prototype that they want has a bunch of requirements. And each ship has a limited budget- but we can contribute our own funds too if we want to. I want us to have a ship that\u2019ll meet all the requirements, and I think the Finch is a good starting point. But, I wonder if there\u2019s a way to build a ship like Finch- only bigger, more modular, like, uh, like having an extended cabin, one or two of the vonKerman cryo-modules built in, an airlock- that sort of thing.\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COh, and dock them together like Finch,\u201D Frolie asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo, DSX wants more capabilities in the command hull. I was thinking that we\u0027d meet the requirements, but like Finch, it can add additional modules like extra habitat areas, maybe a uh, cargo rack, modular engines, and so on. We could add modules to, say, have enough space to rescue the crew at Duna if their plan fails. If that happens, we\u2019d have just under a year to prepare. We\u2019ll need a shuttlepod to land, unless we use gravitics to land the ship\u2026\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, ok,\u201D Frolie said, already thinking about potential designs. \u201CTo move fast, we\u2019d need several gravitic engines to move a larger ship- unless we build a bigger one\u2026 hm, maybe for a new Mk33\u2026 but yeah, I think we can do it\u2026 let me think on it\u2026\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Mhs9dHo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Mhs9dHo.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter their layover at the Orbital Dynamics Shipyard, Scott and Frolie boarded Kondor once more for their trip to Magic Boulder. A couple of hours later, they arrived at the asteroid. Formally known as VDP-762, Magic Boulder became so named for unusual glowing striations of graviolium ore. In fact, it had high concentrations of the stuff. The handful of other asteroids visited had nowhere near as much graviolium, but that wasn\u2019t stopping various companies that had sprung up from proposing missions to go hunting for more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks to rock-powered mass drivers generously provided by Drax Aerospace as a gesture of goodwill- and as part of the reparations for their industrial espionage- the company finally moved Magic Boulder into low orbit.

The pier would have to be relocated to enable the construction manipulator to do its job, but for now it provided a handy location for shuttles with construction crews to dock. Once they shut down Kondor, the two commercial astronauts headed for the command deck to greet the skeleton crew and check out the new facilities. Scott could see that there wasn\u2019t much to do aboard yet- he knew that the permanent staff wouldn\u2019t arrive until next week, and they were still working out issues with the upgraded Payload Maneuvering Vehicle, but the station really was impressive to see in person.

With that completed, it was clear that there were some design differences between Estonian 2 and Estonian 3. They\u2019d need to build a new docking port for the craft.

The flight controls and displays would need extensive testing, but they were in place. Then, with Jonas operating the crane\u2019s winches, Tobias and Emma cut Estonian 2\u2019s ascent tank away from the crew capsule. Next, they welded a Buffalo docking port to the underside of the capsule. Finally, they tried to back the trailer up next to the AUS and lift the capsule up top, but they quickly realized that the trailer wasn\u2019t wide enough to fit around the stage\u2019s new landing legs.

So, they did. Emma ran the printers in Duna Base to print up more chassis parts, and then she welded them to the sides of the trailer. After repositioning the other pieces, she greatly expanded the trailer/crane\u2019s width to easily accommodate the AUS\u2019 legs.

One team was led by the Arrow Space Corporation, another was led by Drax Aerospace, and a third was led by Orbital Dynamics. Given their recent industrial espionage scandal and a \u201Csuggestion\u201D from the heads of \u003Ci\u003Eall three space agencies\u003C/i\u003E to downselect the Drax proposal, the DSEV(X) Selection Committee settled on the proposals from Arrow Space and Orbital Dynamics. They flipped a couple of coins to assign the DSX-01 registry number to Orbital Dynamics\u2019 Newton, and DSX-02 to Arrow Space\u2019s Halley.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth designs met the minimum requirements for the DSX prototype- and then some. Both could support a crew of eight on active duty for a minimum of 200 days or a crew of eight in cryostasis for ten years. Both had a small 3D printer lab for spare parts and, if needed, new construction. Both had a Nautilus-derived habitat ring and had a pilothouse based on a cupola. But that\u2019s where the similarities ended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalley (DSX-02) consisted of a single hull with interchangeable sensor masts while Newton (DSX-01) had a far more modular hull to meet changing mission requirements. Additionally, Newton\u2019s command hull had a greenhouse that Halley\u2019s lacked, but Halley\u2019s command hull had twice the 3D printing capacity of Newton, an integrated mobile processing lab, a hangar bay for a Compact Payload Maneuvering Vehicle, and a sickbay, none of which Newton possessed. Plus, it had eight docking ports for various accessories or cargo modules versus Newton\u2019s three, and designers considered adding one or two more to the command hull\u2019s spine. In terms of the command hull, it also cost more than Newton\u2019s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest difference between Newton and Halley were in their propulsion systems. Halley favored a revolutionary graviolium-catalyzed fusion engine from Kerbodyne, while Orbital Dynamics\u2019 Newton had an equally revolutionary gravitc engine. The Kerbodyne KF-1 Supernova needed a small amount of graviolium as a catalyst to achieve fusion ignition. After charging the capacitors to start the engine\u2019s fusion reactor, it became self-sustaining. Once started, the Supernova performed like a \u201Cstandard\u201D nuclear thermal rocket; it heated propellium and expelled it to produce thrust. The difference is that the Supernova heated propellium into a plasma with an unbelievable specific impulse of 16,000 seconds! With Halley\u2019s propellium tanks, DSX-02 had a whopping 35,000 m/sec delta-v.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy contrast, Newton\u2019s four GND-00 \u201CBaryon\u201D Gravitic Engines consumed graviolium to warp space and \u201Cfall\u201D towards the localized artificial singularity that it created. Though it used more graviolium than the Supernova, a ship equipped with gravitic engines and a sizeable store of graviolium had the potential to produce hundreds of thousands of meters per second of delta-v. Ships could potentially travel for \u003Ci\u003Eyears\u003C/i\u003E without the need to refuel, much like the nuclear submarines that the nations used to pit against each other. Plus, with such a vast delta-v reserve, gravitic ships could potentially perform interplanetary travel in a fraction of the time of a traditional Hohmann transfer orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two competing designs had much to offer the DSEV(X) program, and the Selection Committee looked forward to testing their capabilities. Both proposals offered more than the minimum requirements that the Committee would have to take into consideration. With the two teams selected, and both receiving written notification by next-day courier, they each had 30 days to produce their spacecraft\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uOn4Moz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/uOn4Moz.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmma and Jonas took the Buffalo crane rig out to the Sandcaster Lander\u2019s crash site to raid it for parts.

There it would stay, preserved for future generations to visit and to see how early space explorers lived and worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-13T20:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 11\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022hDoTzqo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002275.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/hDoTzqo.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBolstered with the success of their first outing, Dudmon authorized another outing- after repairing and upgrading the Buffabus. While the Buffabus crew rested, Tobias handled repairs to the rover as well as stocking up its repair kits.

That required additional facilities to handle contingencies. To expand its capabilities, the vonKerman engineers planned to dock support rovers to the sides of the bus and drive them as a single unit- much like how the two Buffalo rovers joined together during DBE-1\u2019s landfall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth support rovers had the same basic design with a standardized chassis, sloped front, a docking module, a set of retractable solar arrays, and an aft-mounted large-scale fuel cell array and drill. But that\u2019s where the similarities ended. The port support rover had a small 3D print shop and a galley, while the starboard rover had a sickbay and a gym. Together, the three linked rovers essentially formed a mobile base to conduct extensive research with.

As Calbro prepared a meal in the galley, Ferwin got some exercise time in the gym while Emma did some work in the exploration module. After dinner, Calbro and Ferwin insisted that Emma sleep in the hab module, while they stretched out in the two support rover\u2019s airlock modules.

They would extend ok, but for some reason they kept retracting, and nothing in the control software appeared to command them to do that. Frustrated, she entered the print shop and printed up a set of non-retracting solar arrays and attached them to the sides.

At just under 400km away, it would be a hard day of driving for the rover autopilot, but they\u2019d break their previous record for the longest off-world road trip.

Not long ago, he led a decadent lifestyle befitting his aristocratic origins. But his ambitions got the better of him. In his youth, he concocted a brilliant plan to make the world depend upon his company when he defaced carvings on an ancient Kermantian pyramid to make it look like the world was going to end. He kept everything secret and over the decades he slowly unfurled his plan, hooked the necessary world leaders, and got the contracts flowing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings were going well: his company squashed any attempts to use the Lindor 5 rocket for the new reusable orbiter in favor of his Shuttle Launch System. Next, he pressured the government to make Drax Aerospace one of the commercial contractors for KOTS- the Kerbin Orbital Transportation Services program that freed KSP funding for Project Laythe, the first mission to Jool\u2019s nearest moon. Then he maneuvered Drax Aerospace so that it received the lion\u2019s share of the contracts needed to assemble the First Jool Fleet. Finally, he muscled his way into the commercial space markets pioneered by Orbital Dynamics- their chief rivals- and were poised to take over the markets despite their rivals\u2019 technological edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then it all fell apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically overnight, \u003Ci\u003Esomeone \u003C/i\u003Efigured out Drax\u2019s plan as well as his attempt to poof Dolores Kerman, the other student with him on that Kermantian expedition so long ago, and the only other person at the time who knew the full extent of Drax\u2019s plans. As it turned out, Leando Kerman- one of his executives- also found out about his plan and turned over evidence in exchange for leniency.

It consisted of several prefabricated modules- essentially airtight tents- that crews unpacked and assembled and outfitted with various types of equipment. Standard air pressure and an internal frame kept them expanded, but their modular design enabled crews to pack them up again so that they could move to another location.

Exactly how the advanced techniques avoided cut marks remained a mystery, but some experts suggested that high pressure water could do the job. So, if aliens helped the Kermantians reach Duna and carve The Face, as some Ancient Astronaut theorists believed, then why were there no mentions of them in Kermantian texts? And if there weren\u2019t aliens involved, then where did the Kermantians get their advanced technology from- and where is it today?

As a bad sandstorm rolled in, the team boarded the Buffabus once more for the long trek to the next anomaly a \u201Cmere\u201D 885 km away\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022taCjOT2.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/taCjOT2.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat felt like weeks was only days later, but the Buffabus made it to their next destination. The team found another artificially created arch- it seemed that the Kermantians really liked building them for some reason. After their previous discovery, finding yet another arch felt like a letdown; hoping for something more exciting like a Lost City or a crashed spaceship, the media barely gave it a mention in their broadcasts. Nonetheless, the team cataloged the find and noted its location, but Mission Control elected to not set up any science instruments to study the structure. It appeared just like the other crude stone arches built on Duna. Instead, they pressed onward to the last anomaly on their list\u2026\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at their map, their last stop was another 480 km distant- not including detours around mountain ranges. It would take a couple of days at least to get there. If nothing else, at least their destination, Sector SNJ3, would give them a view of Duna\u2019s Southern Lights. The crew took turns driving the Buffabus (more like letting the autopilot drive, and just monitoring the instruments), and a couple of days later, they approached the last anomaly on their list. According to Dudmon, the casinos back home were taking bets on what they would find. Another Face? Another Dunalith? Another arch? Perhaps another forgotten space probe. As they got within 20 kilometers of the anomaly, their BTDT sensor started pinging, helping them home in on the exact location. What they found had 200:1 odds on the betting circuits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022SHCNXFD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/SHCNXFD.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHoly mulch\u2026\u201D Ferwin said and trailed off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThat\u2019s not something you see every day,\u201D Emma finished for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Oo9Qpnn.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Oo9Qpnn.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there was any doubt that Kermantians had somehow visited Duna seemingly without advanced technology, all those doubts were shattered by Team Buffabus\u2019s latest discovery.

Hensen Kerman (PLT), Sofia vonKerman (PLT), Rolf vonKerman (ENG), Maxbret Kerman (SCI), and Guest Astronaut Munvan Kerman (SCI) all boarded the Halley (DSX-02). When A6-5 arrived at the Space Operations Center, astronauts could see the contrast between the large cargo shuttle and the smaller Galileo-class shuttle. The Ministry of Space was debating whether to discontinue the Galileo, with its expendable service module in favor of the fully reusable Arrow 6. Both used the Arrow 6 booster, but while Galileo could carry six astronauts, the Arrow 6 Crew Pod could carry twice that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226Pg9JgH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6Pg9JgH.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CReactors on, centrifuge started, fusion engine charging,\u201D Hensen stated as Halley pulled away from the Space Operations Center. The Kerbodyne KF-1 graviolium-catalyzed fusion engine took a full minute to charge before igniting its fusion reactor. Given the amount of electric charge required, the ship\u2019s flight computers stopped the centrifuge\u2019s rotation and paused the redundant recycling systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LThruFY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/LThruFY.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the engine started, and the centrifuge and recycling systems came back online. \u201CPower hog\u201D was the nicest comment that Rolf could make about the engine startup sequence. But at last, the fusion engine became self-sustaining, providing all the power that it needed. The long startup time was a tradeoff for using far less graviolium than the Newton.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Halley lit its engine for the first time to increase its orbit as the first leg of its journey. The crew noted that the spaceframe flexed as the burn continued.

Some \u003Cs\u003Eautostruts\u003C/s\u003E software tuning of the engine\u2019s thrust pulses to avoid resonating frequencies resolved the issue. But even with the software changes, the ship had problems staying on its burn path. Leaving the fusion engine on during the coasting burned through some of its fusion pellets, which gave the crew some concerns. At least the ship\u2019s propellium supplies gave it an impressive 25,000 m/sec of delta-v\u2026 Three hours later, Halley arrived at its first destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jIEyrvx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jIEyrvx.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast to the mothballed and dormant Starlab, Sky Reef was a bustle of activity. The lights were on everywhere, its greenhouses and labs and habitation units were in use, and even its centrifuge module- a leftover from Project Laythe- was spinning. Phildas Kerman, Sky Reef\u2019s current commander, gave the crew of Halley a tour of the new space station. \u201CWe have all the amenities of Oasis,\u201D Phildas explained, \u201Cincluding a dedicated Sandcastle 3D print lab, a mobile processing lab, and Homestead habitation modules.

A half-hour after that, DSX-02 performed a four minute, 30-second burn to put it on course for the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En. Like the Newton, Halley had a 3-day coast to Kerbin\u2019s nearest natural satellite. As planned, Newton had a day\u2019s head start on them, though. Not long after shutting down the fusion engine, Rolf started sneezing uncontrollably, and his eyes itched like crazy.

It was a breakthrough capability, especially given the microgravity conditions that made medical procedures more challenging to accomplish. Halley\u2019s sickbay could hold up to six patients, though today, as Halley coasted towards the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En, Rolf was the only patient, and Maxbret took up residence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI\u2019ve no idea how I caught a cold,\u201D Rolf began, \u201CI was careful and never broke quarantine before launch.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe you touched a contaminated surface,\u201D Maxbret responded. \u201CI\u2019ll ask the crew to help wipe down anything you touched.

Not only did he receive well wishes from his own crew, but he 4also received them from the DSX-01 crew and from Mission Control as well. All the good cheer made Rolf even more embarrassed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Rolf received his diagnosis, Phoenix Aerospace launched Phoenix Station, a renovated backup to the old Starlab module that formed the core of the now retired Kerbin Orbiting Station. The former Starlab 2 languished for years in storage until the Kerman Air Force acquired it. At the time, Starlab 2\u2019s new mission was to serve as the core of a station designed to discreetly process blutonium from Magic Boulder. When that idea was shelved in favor of simply returning the blutonium to Kerbin, Starlab 2 was shelved along with it. The station module again sat in storage until Phoenix Aerospace found a use for it: the company wanted to use the refurbished module as a waystation for trips to the Mun\u2019s surface. Phoenix Aerospace hoped to offer tourist trips to paying customers, but business analysts questioned their ability to compete with Orbital Dynamics and their polar orbiting Oasis station. It was a desperation move; things were not looking good for Phoenix Aerospace\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhoenix Station blasted off from Pad A at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E early in the morning courtesy of an Edna 1F- itself a relic from the early days of M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Enflight. Though on the verge of retirement many times, Edna survived into the modern day thanks to repeated upgrades. But with gravitic technology making its debut, Edna\u2019s days were finally numbered. Nonetheless, the launch vehicle lifted off the pad flawlessly and climbed into the sky. One minute later, it jettisoned its reusable side boosters while the core booster continued its trip uphill. Five minutes after that, the expendable core stage departed the spacecraft, leaving the upper stage to finish the job. Phoenix Station entered a 119.4 km by 130.6 km orbit and deployed its solar arrays and high-gain antenna. At long last, the venerable station core reached orbit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFour hours later, the E1F upper stage dropped off the module and got out of the way to enable PPE-1 to dock with the module. With its business completed, the upper stage flipped retrograde and made its death burn. Then, after a few false starts, PPE-1 lit its ion engines and propelled Phoenix Station towards the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En. A course correction six hours later ensured that it would reach its target in three days\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA day after Phoenix Station blasted off, Phoenix Aerospace launched a spare Resupply Module along with a tank of xenon gas to refuel PPE-1. The REMO, named Williams after an obscure movie reference, sat in orbit awaiting PPE-1\u2019s return from the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fICukAr.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fICukAr.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022VZhruxG.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/VZhruxG.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA day later, Newton entered the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En\u2019s sphere of influence. A quick calculation showed that the ship would hit the ground if it continued its course, so three hours later, she made a quick correction burn to raise her periapsis to 223.7 km. Once again, the crew had to gently increase the throttle to avoid overshooting their required delta-v. It took another half-day before DSX-01 entered m\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Enar orbit and lower it to 22.8 km by 30.5 km.

The trio boarded the diminutive craft, powered up its systems, and extended its wings. Hanse then gave the go ahead to depart, and Pod 1 undocked from Newton. Samny let the shuttlepod drop away for a few seconds before starting its gravitic engine. It was hard for the away team to believe that such a small craft could go anywhere on the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En from any orbit, but such was the advantages of advanced technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFive minutes later, Pod 1 executed a 224 m/sec burn- technically an incorrect term, but tradition dies hard- to drop out of orbit. Within minutes they halted their forward velocity and hovered over the ground as they searched for their target. \u201CAmazing,\u201D was all that Samny could say. They searched and searched, and then realized that they missed the target and had to turn around. That was a trivial maneuver for the shuttlepod. \u201CWe \u003Ci\u003Ehave \u003C/i\u003Eto have at least one of these on every DSEV,\u201D Samny said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIf we can find more graviolium,\u201D Karl countered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CDrax found some in their asteroid,\u201D Danwig pointed out, \u201Cso we know it\u2019s out there.

They held the record for the longest off-world land driving distance for many years until the Buffabus utterly demolished that record on Duna. Unfortunately, in an attempt to drive Miss Piggy to Billstown\u2019s new location, the rover hit a rock and broke apart on the landscape as it tumbled to a stop.

They piled back into Shuttlepod 1 and lifted off to their next destination. The craft had no trouble restarting its gravitic engine and effortlessly floated away from the surface. Samny had hoped to find the landing stage of the Own M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Enar Excursion Module but the away team was unable to do so. With their excursion time running out, Samny elected to point Shuttlepod 1 at Newton and firewall the gravitic engine.

Forgetting them on \u003Ci\u003Etwo\u003C/i\u003E ships was a process error, one that the ISC intended to correct. That would take some time and wouldn\u2019t alleviate the situation aboard DSX-01 and DSX-02. In the meantime, Mission Control scrambled to find jetpacks, ore, and repair kits, which both ships also lacked. While looking through their resources, they realized that Sky Reef had what the two ships needed- they just needed to get them out to the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En. Fortunately, Phoenix Aerospace had the answer: their REMO Williams, currently waiting in orbit for PPE-1 to return. A quick consultation and negotiation session later, Phoenix Aerospace agreed to fly REMO Williams over to Sky Reef to be refueled and have some of its monopropellant replaced with some ore for Newton and Halley. The station crew would also add a small cargo box stuffed with the needed jetpacks and repair kits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, while neither ship was originally scheduled to dock with a space station while orbiting the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En, ISC quickly changed their plans and directed both Newton and Halley to rendezvous and dock with Phoenix Station when it arrived in m\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Enar orbit, and then wait for REMO Williams to reach the station as well. It wasn\u2019t ideal, but it would give the two DSX crews opportunities to compare notes on their respective vessels, and Phoenix Aerospace would get their REMO to the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En sooner\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the Sky Reef\u2019s station crew got their new directives, they were in the process of replacing their Power Tower solar array. An accident with their PMV shattered most of the Payload Maneuvering Vehicle\u2019s solar arrays and both arrays on the Power Tower. Orbital Dynamics quickly printed up a replacement and sent it over. The station crew swapped out Power Towers without incident, and the broken tower deorbited since its support vehicle didn\u2019t have the propellant needed to return to the Orbital Dynamics Shipyard. By the time that they finished their work, Sky Reef experienced its latest orbital dawn\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Halley crossed over into the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En\u2019s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and plotted a maneuver burn to raise its periapsis, Phoenix Aerospace worked with ISC to bring REMO Williams to Sky Reef. As soon as it docked with the station, the crew refueled its propellants and converted four of its monopropellant tanks into ore tanks. Then, the station\u2019s 3D print lab got to work printing up a pair of small cargo containers and veteran astronaut Gerrim Kerman stepped outside to attach them to REMO\u2019s flanks. Finally, she filled the containers with jetpacks and repair kits. With the work completed, REMO departed Sky Reef for its trip to the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mftHtao.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mftHtao.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003En, Halley took several minutes to power up her fusion engine in preparation for her orbital insertion burn. Once again, the ship\u2019s flight computer stopped the centrifuge to conserve electric charge, but this time it shut off several lights as well. Nonetheless, Halley powered up her engine in time for the insertion burn. By engine stop, DSX-02 entered a 412.6 km by 416.9 km orbit. \u201CThe problem is the amount of charge needed to start the engine,\u201D Rolf said between coughing fits. \u201CWe need about ten times more electric charge than the ship has.

For its day, Magellan offered much more comfortable living and working arrangements for crews heading to and from Kerbin\u2019s m\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Ens compared to the cramped quarters of the M\u003Cspan\u003E\u00FC\u003C/span\u003Enflight-era K-20 KerbalSoar.

Drakken Hause 3 was just over eleven years old, but it had been abandoned not long after Project Laythe reached Jool.

Originally slated to expand Drakken House 1, the third Drakken station was hastily fitted with wheels and further modified to handle landing on Minmus. Later, the VKR sent three additional modules to extract ore and process it into propellants that were then shipped to awaiting tankers parked at Unity Station.

At apoapsis, Raumschlepper increased its periapsis to 1,400 km.

The Discovery-class provides living quarters, deep freeze pods, a laboratory, a sickbay, and a briefing room for a dozen crew members. The command hull also has a large hangar bay capable of holding a Compact Payload Maneuvering Vehicle as well as a single Shuttlepod with its revolutionary gravitic engine. The Discovery-class is also powered by a gravitic engine module, but it can also accommodate other engines, such as Halley\u2019s fusion engine, should graviolium prove to be too scarce to mine in quantity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe modular nature of the Discovery-class enables the ship to be configured at an orbiting shipyard for a variety of missions- and enables the ISC to spread the production contracts around. Orbital Dynamics is responsible for the ship\u2019s command hull, gravitic engine module, its Shuttlepod, and for the integration of all vessel hull components, while the Arrow Space Corporation and Drax Aerospace will provide other modules such as hab rings, cargo racks, and bulk fluid containers.

Nautilus represents a huge investment for not just the Kerman States, but also for the mcKerman Kingdom and the vonKerman Republic. She was state of the art when she launched but that was over five years ago, and a lot has changed since then. Project Laythe originally planned to turn her into a space station when she returned, but that changed when we leased Sky Reef from Orbital Dynamics. Once she returns, Nautilus will be placed in a storage orbit and kept in ready-reserve status until DSEV-05 and 06 are operational. At that point, Nautilus will be decommissioned and offered to private ventures as a museum ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAs you\u2019re well aware, Kopernicus is still on active duty and orbiting Duna. She and her crew have another 190 days until they return to Kerbin. Given the decisions made during her design and construction and the technology available at the time, Kopernicus cannot meet the new quality of life standards set by the International Space Consortium for Deep Space Exploration Vessels. As a result, she will be decommissioned and recycled upon her return to Kerbin unless a private venture steps forward to preserve Kopernicus as a museum ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNow, if there are questions related to Nautilus\u2019 and Kopernicus\u2019 successors\u2026\u201D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Angelo Kerman","CreatedById":106975,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-21T22:25:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInterlude: The Discovery\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EThis mission report is almost at the end, but I\u0027m already planning the next one.
