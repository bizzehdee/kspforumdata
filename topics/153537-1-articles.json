They don\u0027t have to leave craters, or leave any sign on the terrain that they ever hit, but it would be fun for RPing, if I could have to worry about my bases being hit by asteroids, and then evacuating/repairing any damage to the base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T02:45:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/80483-0-23-5-Custom-Asteroids-1-0-0\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECustom Asteroids\u003C/a\u003E can do that, tho you\u0027ll need to create the config that spawns the asteroids on a path towards whatever planet/moon you\u0027re looking to hit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
