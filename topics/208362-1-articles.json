Lots of it. Do that again and again and you melt your rails. So if you have spare rails and the means to reprocess melted ones back to tip top shape, you can fire away and view rails as expended ammo lol... reprocess them at your leisure. Hopefully when not in a combat situation lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T00:44:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224137914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208362\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221653598206\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133381\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Arugela said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow much is lost to heat.

That\u0027s just Ohm\u0027s Power Law. But by far the bulk of the heat in the system is the result of frictional losses, which act in largely similar ways on both the conductor and the rail itself, since the materials must both be conductive. The laws of thermodynamics tend to frown on any attempts to force heat to flow from something cooler into something warmer, which is what you\u0027d need to do in order to use the projectile as a heat sink for the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0However, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a lost cause. There are many ways to cool things, after all. For rocket engines, you can use radiative cooling (requires the vacuum of space and a large surface area), regenerative cooling (requires a fuel you can use as a coolant), or ablative cooling. Ablative cooling sucks for rocket engines, generally, but it\u0027s used to great effect on spacecraft heat shields. An ablator carries away heat by being vaporized and carrying that vaporization heat with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one way to make a railgun work would be to use a conductive projectile, but place a layer of an ablative, conductive material on either side. Then, use rails that are slightly narrower at the exit than they are at the entrance. Thus as the projectile travels down the barrel, the ablative coating is gradually vaporized by the combination of Ohmic heating and friction. As long as the ablative coating vaporizes at a much lower temperature than the rails, the rails themselves will remain undamaged. The process causes the overall size of the projectile\u002Bcoating to shrink, which is why the bore of the railgun narrows toward the exit. This way the heat is carried away not by the projectile, but by what the projectile leaves behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a little extra design work, you could even shape the rear of the projectile such that the escaping vaporization gases expand against it like an aerospike engine, adding to its velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBonus if the reduced stresses on the rails mean that you can use the rails themselves as a supercapacitor, rather than needing a separate capacitor bank to fire. Air is not an ideal dielectric for a capacitor by any means, but perhaps it would still be doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-27T04:44:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the ablator vapor will condense on the rails, covering them with a thin and non-uniform layer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the gun will overheat and vibrate, then crash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
