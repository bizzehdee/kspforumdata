Close fly-bys of Saturn and Titan gave Voyager 1 an advantage with its extra gravity assist. When New Horizons reaches the distance of 100 AU, it will be travelling at about 13 km/s (29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (8,900 mph) slower than Voyager 1 at that distance.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(spacecraft)#Propulsion_system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDawn\u003C/a\u003E is using ion propulsion to get over 10 km/s of delta-V, allowing it to do all sorts of cool science at multiple places around the asteroid belt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-01T06:25:01Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2013 06:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T06:33:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe escape trajectory was set off by a Centaur stage, not the craft itself, that\u0027s why I didn\u0027t mention it.
