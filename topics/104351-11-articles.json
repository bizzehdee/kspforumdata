I\u0027m just thinking of more things that engineers could do.\n\nI agree that itd be nice to have repaireable (or at least partially repaireable) heat shields. I know realistically ablative stuff gets destroyed after long enough useage, but i feel itd be nice to have maybee the option to convert ore into say repairing heat shields (i dont know, the ore is converted to material the shield\u0027s made of). Youd still need to get the shields resupplied, but you could even do it with the ship you are currently flying.\n\nAnyways, im happy the storage bays removing that center beam, now i should easily be able to fit 1-2 missiles in one of those bays. While ive used cargo bays for missile storage before, these things look far more attractive for useage in smaller craft such as fighters, a deployeable missile bay thats actually smallish."},{"CreatedByName":"Magion","CreatedById":97022,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T18:34:31Z","Content":"The 1.0 is gonna be so awesome!

Its pretty obvious that the spaceplane parts will be able to handle an gentle deorbit or spaceplane parts is pretty pointless. Now if you took an spaceplane to Mun and go for an direct landing on return like apollo did it will probably burn up. \n\nI also think temperature tolerance for parts will change a lot from now so science equipment, rover stuff, landing cans and similar can not take much heat while spaceplane stuff and pods will manage more."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T19:28:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Lucky you!
