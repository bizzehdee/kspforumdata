It\u0027s NEVER fine for that to happen \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I took it upon myself, and for myself, to go through and describe all the parts one by one, to give them more descriptive descriptions. For example, the 3 wings that are \u0022wing shaped boards\u0022 will now be described as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EType A:\u003C/strong\u003E A stubby 4x2 wing segment, 4 meters in chord and 2 in span.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EType B:\u003C/strong\u003E A long 2x4 wing segment, 2 meters in chord and 4 in span.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EType C:\u003C/strong\u003E A 2x2 wing segment. Placing 2 of these is like using one Type-A or Type-B wing segment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, other wing segments are also more descriptively described. I also made similar changes to nose cones, intakes, elevons and the like, and then realized that wow, this was a lot of work. No wonder nobody at Squad has bothered to undertake it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is the config as it stands. It\u0027s got (what I am fairly sure is) a full list of parts but those I\u0027ve not described are blank. I post it here for 2 reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s useful as it is, even though it\u0027s not that complete. For me wings were the absolute worst offender and this basically fixes that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMaybe someone wants to help, and I\u0027d love it if they did. Either making my descriptions better or adding their own.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know if this is the best way to present the file, but as it\u0027s a single file I\u0027m just putting the config up on GitHub and letting people download it. I\u0027d be interested in opinions on splitting the file into multiple configs vs one big one, mod support (I likely won\u0027t do it but I\u0027m willing to support it if it doesn\u0027t get too hairy), and of course any pull requests with extra descriptions (after I vet them of course) are welcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/5thHorseman/DescriptiveDescriptions/blob/master/DescriptiveDescriptions.cfg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/5thHorseman/DescriptiveDescriptions/blob/master/DescriptiveDescriptions.cfg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr visit the github page here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/5thHorseman/DescriptiveDescriptions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/5thHorseman/DescriptiveDescriptions\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
