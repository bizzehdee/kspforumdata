I mean it\u0027s up to you, but my experience was the amount of parachutes and landing legs (though you have custom ones) required for a consistent unpowered descent was too much. In the end I found it much easier to just spend a bit of fuel on landing (my 300t lander has 12 drogues and 12 radial parachutes). I could land at 3 m/s, so the parachutes would put me to around 10 and then under 50m I\u0027d use the engines for a safe landing. Only costs about 100 dV, could even just throw a couple drop tanks on the sides for the landing fuel and drop them when you launch, though that does mean debris.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be right. I could add four FL-T800 drop tanks on some of the points of my hexagon of boosters and add them to the asparagus flow without adding much to the part count. A powered descent for the last few meters is probably a good idea anyway as when I tried landing on a slope the flex in the landing legs allowed it to \u0022walk\u0022 down the hill.
