KSP colleagues,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust one time, I would like to build a rocket so that a cluster of engines were canted.\u00A0 In other words, instead of the engines all being parallel with the center of thrust, they were instead installed at any angle.\u00A0 I just want to see if doing so induces a spin on the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is it possible to install the rockets with an angle.\u00A0 Using symmetry, all the engines could be placed that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMind you, please, I am not contending that canting engines is desirable.\u00A0 I just want to try it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank

managed.\u00A0 The resolution was to top-mount the engines on the wing, which is unconventional but looked even cooler.\u00A0 Still asymmetric (since wing incidence was a main driver in the design),

may need to disable engine gimbaling to get the effect you are shooting for. \u00A0 KSP does indeed model off-axis thrust, more or less as you would

with multiple engines- a single engine mounted inline with the vertical axis won\u2019t produce much of a roll moment. \u00A0 But it will try.. \u00A0 Multiple engines mounted slightly laterally from
