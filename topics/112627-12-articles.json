And thinks for all the work you put into the mod. I was wandering if you ever thought about adding ocean exploration branch to tech tree? I think it would add even more \u0022depth\u0022 to an all ready great mod. Thanks again!\n\u003E \n\nThanks!

The one thing I wish was different is the techs you unlock in the initial \u0022Aviation\u0022 node in a mostly stock career. You don\u0027t get access to any cockpits or jet-engines until a later node, so I guess I don\u0027t understand why there\u0027s a point to unlocking a Mk0 Liquid Fuel Fuselage when you have no purpose for it until the following node, when you will get the Juno and Small Circular Intake. Do we need to have a stepping stone in between which provides parts you can\u0027t use yet?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Again, I am a fan of your mod, which is why I bring this up at all.\n\u003E \n\nThe aviation side of the tree is pretty abysmal compared to the other branches.

Sometimes a part gets put in too early or late.  That\u0027s for sure.  But, believe it or not, I am very systematic when I put the parts in.  \n\nFor instance the solar panel problem: I\u0027ve grouped the solar panels (hopefully) in ascending nodes by the amount of power they put out.  I found this to be better for balance purposes.\n\nAnother oddity you might find is that I sometimes put a 1.25 size part in the first node but a 2.5 and 0.625 in node second node.  This is to simulate technology being able to make the part smaller and make a larger version of the part that is more powerful.\n\nI sometimes start with large parts and progress to smaller and more efficient versions later in the tree.\n\nThere is a method to my madness, but always point out a part that you think is in the wrong place, either here or by PM.  I will move it or explain why its there.  Sometimes I move it, don\u0027t like it there and move it back in the next rev.  Just trying to balance all the parts is quite daunting.  The science parts can be especially so.\n\nI hope you enjoy it as ETT progresses.

In that mod scrubber efficiency is based on tech. When you research new tech, a small black box pops up telling you that you\u0027ve just increased scrubber efficiency.

Since I just started with ETT and am not a science type at all, I can\u0027t possibly come up with correct tech slots.
