However, to assume that there is a black hole at the center of every star and planet because of this is to assume black holes are the only objects capable of emitting light and heat. We know there are plenty of other phenomena which can create considerable light and heat. For example, radioactive decay, toasters and computers, tidal forces between planets, and nuclear fusion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlack holes release a lot of energy when they collide, because they accelerate to extreme speeds when near each other. If there were a black hole within every star, we would observe that much energy when regular stars collide. However, we don\u0027t see such an intense collision when that happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStars form as gas collects by gravity inside a nebula. Eventually the \u0027protostar\u0027 object collects enough material that its weight compresses the matter in its center so much that nuclear fusion occurs. That fusion is what produces\u00A0the star\u0027s light and heat. At that point, the star is not nearly dense enough that its\u00A0weight compresses the core into a black hole. It takes a force like a supernova, where a giant star collapses in on itself completely, to get the core dense enough to become a black hole.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, planets form by accruing material from nearby asteroids, comets, and dust, all of which have gravity and are gravitationally attracted. The compression force inside a planet from the weight of all the material builds up over time, but it is never enough to cause the creation of a black hole - Again, it takes a force like a supernova, one of the most powerful types of explosions in the universe, to create a black hole. Planets\u0027 gravity comes from their own mass, of rock and metal and ice, not from a central black hole. (You can imagine how very light rocks and metal would have to be if all the planet\u0027s mass was in a black hole at the very center.) And their internal heat comes from the collisions that originally collected the material, tidal forces from nearby bodies or the sun, and radioactive decay of heavy elements in the core.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, the material in a star would have to be spinning very fast indeed in order to orbit the black hole without falling into it - So fast that the sun would probably be blue on the east side and red on the west.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-11T19:23:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2019 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by cubinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-12T10:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe only have 1 image of a black hole, and its the accretion disc that gives off light, not the object itself.
