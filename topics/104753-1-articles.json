Are the Mk2 parts too small for your application, and Mk3 too large? Introducing the Mk2.5 series of parts! Well, the cockpit, at least.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/hgbfb)\n\nWhile still quite early in development, I thought I\u0027d share what progress I have so far to get an idea of what the community might like from such a line of parts. The application I\u0027d imagined for them was to fill the gap between the current mk2 parts (good for carrying .625-1.25m payloads) and the new mk3 parts (good for carrying 2-2.5m payloads). As such, the Mk2.5 line of parts are designed to fit payloads between 1.25m and 2.2m in diameter without being obnoxiously large and heavy like the new Mk3 parts are. The Mk2.5 connection is designed to be the width of a 2.5m part, but with flat sides and a less curved bottom than the new Mk3 line of parts.\n\nLet me know what types of parts you\u0027d like to see in this pack, or mods you\u0027d like to see supported! Currently I\u0027m planning to include an inline top-facing docking port, reaction wheel / probe core, straight tail connector, raised tail connector with ramp, cargo bay, bomb bay, Mk2.5 -\u003E 2.5m adapter, crew cabin, Mk2.5 -\u003E 1.25 tricoupler, and (of course) assorted fuel tanks.\n\nDon\u0027t worry, I\u0027m planning to include IVA models (with RPM support)."}]}
