KSP has got me interested in designing (not making, but designing) liquid rocket engines. From my research, it seems that turbopumps have been limited to two types of pumps: axial, or centrifugal. However, there are other types of pumps for which I can\u0027t see any issues with besides RPM (and that can be solved with clever drive-shaft modifications). These are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. A staged Roots compressor- which has the advantage of creating a high amount of pressure while reducing risk of sloshing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. A scroll compressor- which is compact, lightweight, and relatively efficient, making it a good candidate for upper stage and transfer engines\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas you have, I would love to hear. What do you think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T02:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about xcor and their piston driven pump design?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T10:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou already said, both alternative types you suggested will need a drive shaft, so they are already more complicated.
