I have heard some people say that micromanagement would make something too hard, and others say that too slow growth rates would make things too hard. So what do you think?

Ideally all difficulty levels would have all the same parts, but they would act in different ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEasy: 1 Greenhouse makes enough food, O2, and purifies water to support 3 Kerbils (using stock TAC-LS) indefinitely. The same greenhouse also produces enough biomass to make monopropellant, liquid fuel, and oxidizer. Kethane production would be optional. Compressor parts needed to make the fuels, but they work automatically and don\u0027t consume electricity. Plants do not respire. All chemical reaction inputs and outputs are accurate, but the rates are very fast. It would be very difficult to kill all the biomass in a greenhouse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormal: 1 Greenhouse makes enough O2 and purifies water to support 2 Kerbils (using TAC-LS) indefinitely. Plants respire, meaning you will need to use greenhouse lights for optimal growth. If you also want to make food or fuel, you will require an additional greenhouse. You can make monopropellant, liquid fuel, and oxidizer. Kethane production would be optional. Compressor parts are needed to make fuel, and they consume a minimal amount of electricity. All chemical reaction inputs and outputs are accurate, but the rates are faster than reality. It would be possible to kill all the biomass in a greenhouse, but not likely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHard: 1 Greenhouse makes enough O2 and purifies water to support 1 Kerbil (using TAC-LS) indefinitely.

With the reactor the biomass drops as expected and consumes power but no fuel is made. I even attached a tank right in line to ensure there isn\u0027t a hub problem and made sure all docking ports had crossfeed enabled. With the compressor, it seems to not work at all as even the efficiency stays at 0 instead of changing to 1 as the reactor does when activated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterestingly, this used to work but no longer is. Is it possible another mod could be interfering with the way Biomass works and causing this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad a problem with Kethane too producing fuel, but only on one ship.

The units you enter into a part\u0027s Resource node are the numbers that show up in the in-game resource UI and have no inherent relationship to volume or mass\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) The units you enter into most generator modules reference the number of the Resource node. Again, not directly linked to volume or mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) The density value in a resource definition is used to calculate the mass of the part when filled with that resource. So, if a solid rocket booster has 433 of SolidFuel, and the SolidFuel density is 0.0075, then resulting mass is 3.2475 metric tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Biological reactions are usually much smaller than metric tonnes, but KSP, in my testing, ignores values with more than 5 decimal points in generator modules. To get around this, one needs to multiply the resource numbers in the module by some value, and have that resource appear in both the input and output to get the actual desired changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe take home is that, because I completely misunderstood what the Resource node was, the most recent test release was completely FUBARed.
