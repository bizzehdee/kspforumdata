But wheels in KSP are still not working properly, since a Unity engine update a few versions ago broke them. Expect unpredictable behaviour, regardless of any claims by anyone of specific values being better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nSpring and damper - I don\u0027t bother changing these from the defaults unless the vehicle starts bouncing spontaneously at loading (which does happen with some regularity). Even then, there seems to be very little logical correlation between the settings and the behaviour. I just keep trying different settings until it stops bouncing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFriction - I usually apply low friction on front wheels and high friction on the back. This seems to minimize random skating and makes turning at speed a bit more predictable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
