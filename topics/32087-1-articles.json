That can be a bad thing, though, because it means an increased risk of rolling. The little rocket engine on the back is probably a bad idea, as zipping over even gently rolling terrain can cause you to do Dukes of Hazard leaps and lose control. Besides, you\u0027ll be astonished how quickly you run out of fuel while motoring around on the surface. An engine that thrusts for 5 minutes may get you from the launchpad to orbit, but that\u0027s still only 5 minutes\u0027 worth of motoring on the ground. There\u0027s nothing wrong with orienting the control piece vertically, put it can make steering kind of confusing. Anyway, fly them both up there and see how they do. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firedtm","CreatedById":61907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T03:24:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe little rocket engine on the back is probably a bad idea\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E yea well i needed to make the COM (Center Of Mass) center out, if you see the MK 2 got 2 nukes reactors on each side and the MK 1 only got 2 on 1 side and 1 on the other\u003Cp\u003Eso its mostly for show\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T06:12:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Firedtm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eyea i edited this\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aragosnat","CreatedById":60487,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T17:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I can suggest is. Have core probe part as your first attachment. That way when trasnfering it over to VAB. You can then ditch the probe and leave behind the rover. Also when building off the probe. Make sure it is where you want to attach the docking port / decuplers. Example: If you want to attach detach from the bottom the probe needs to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
