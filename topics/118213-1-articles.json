They were powered by three RTGs and even then could only operate at around 15% throttle, otherwise they would drain the electricity too fast.\n\nThey are nice because you can be very, very precise with them, you can keep the mass of the spacecraft down, increase your delta-V to tens of thousands of meters per second, and (eventually) get anywhere you want to go - just like in real life.

Even though they are overpowered compared to real -life engines, 2knewtons are pitiful for KSP. \n\nNow, you can always use Orbit Manipulator (if it still works) to time warp while burning your ions, which can let you reliably use them for a variety of purposes. Without it, you can still use them- but it may test your patience. My favorite use is to get probes at Interstellar space. An unusual way to exploit their efficiency is to make a hopper for Gilly, the only body you can reliably get a TWR of more than 1 with them. In that case, a single hopper could possibly make hundreds of jumps without refueling. Finally, you can use it for rovers and ion powered planes for unbreathable atmospheres. \n\nOh, and there is also the problem of the intense energy consumption. This is generally easily countered, though."},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:59:00Z","Content":"I find that stock ion engines are best served on extremely lightweight probes that merely want to get into a particular, likely distant, orbit. For example, putting survey satellites around other planets and their moons. You could also utilize their very low mass by, say, pushing four such probes out to Jool with the same interplanetary transfer tug, then detaching them to enter their own orbits around each moon. Without breaking out pencil and paper, I think common sense would suggest that even in career that\u0027s cheaper than sending four lifters and four interplanetary mids to carry four satellites.\n\nNote that even for tiny probes they\u0027re all but worthless in atmosphere. If you want a probe to land and return consider other options, at least for that stage."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:01:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E so in which cases is it best to use them?\n\nBecause of their low thrust, ion engines can\u0027t push much of a payload without the burn time being unbearably long (it\u0027s already bad enough even with very light payloads). So they\u0027re used almost exclusively for small probes that need lots of dV, such as the real Dawn mission which has gone all the way out to the asteroids and captured into orbit around 2 different bodies.\n\nHOWEVER, ion engines need a lot of electric charge, such as from Gigantor solar panels. This is just to run at full power. You can run at less power but that means lower thrust which means even longer burn times, so most folks try to run at full power. From Duna inwards, this is no problem with solar panels. But from there (or from Dres at most) outwards, solar panels are pathetic. So out there, your only option with stock is to use fuel cells, which means carrying LF/O for the fuel cell to run on. IIRC, a 6-pack fuel cell running 2 ion engines has an ISP of about 1900, not nearly as good as the ion alone but considerably better than even nuke engines. But the fuel cell and its fuel are heavy so TWR suffers even at full power.\n\nAnother use for ion engines, however, is flying on Duna. If you build a light plane with a lot of wing, and give it some other means of thrust to take off with, you can use ions to keep it flying at cruising speed."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:12:27Z","Content":"Take a look at [BetterTimeWarp](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85926-1-0-2-BetterTimeWarp-v2-0!-Customizable-Time-Warp-and-Lossless-Physics-Warp) for faster physics warping - the thread header says 1.0.2 compatibility, but the more detailed ChangeLog and the last author comment (8/5/15) state that 1.0.4 is supported as well. \n\nThe author says that a 1 hour ion engine burn was completed in only 3 minutes with 20x physics warp.

All Xeon needs to come from Kerbin while a local refinery can provide the fuel for reusable Monoprop and LV-1 probes.\n\nThat means Ion engines are only optimal for one way and/or long range missions. Otherwise, they are too expensive and/or too low powered.\n\nAnother complication of Ion engines is power draw. Any solution that is not \u0022burn with solar panels in the sun\u0022 requires extra weight and/or crazy Pe kicking. My probes often use a gravity turn around the Mun to avoid burning in Kerbin\u0027s shadow.\n\nTip: ox-sat panels have a better power to mass ratio than Gigantors."},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T21:47:00Z","Content":"To mangle a quote about the Dawn engine:\n\nPhenomenal Delta-V! ... itty-bitty TWR"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T23:15:21Z","Content":"I\u0027m quite fond of the ion engine, and if you\u0027re looking for more you may look into the Near Future Propulsion / Near Future Solar mods.
