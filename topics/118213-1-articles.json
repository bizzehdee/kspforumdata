An unusual way to exploit their efficiency is to make a hopper for Gilly, the only body you can reliably get a TWR of more than 1 with them. In that case, a single hopper could possibly make hundreds of jumps without refueling.

So they\u0027re used almost exclusively for small probes that need lots of dV, such as the real Dawn mission which has gone all the way out to the asteroids and captured into orbit around 2 different bodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, ion engines need a lot of electric charge, such as from Gigantor solar panels. This is just to run at full power. You can run at less power but that means lower thrust which means even longer burn times, so most folks try to run at full power. From Duna inwards, this is no problem with solar panels. But from there (or from Dres at most) outwards, solar panels are pathetic. So out there, your only option with stock is to use fuel cells, which means carrying LF/O for the fuel cell to run on. IIRC, a 6-pack fuel cell running 2 ion engines has an ISP of about 1900, not nearly as good as the ion alone but considerably better than even nuke engines. But the fuel cell and its fuel are heavy so TWR suffers even at full power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother use for ion engines, however, is flying on Duna. If you build a light plane with a lot of wing, and give it some other means of thrust to take off with, you can use ions to keep it flying at cruising speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T18:12:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85926-1-0-2-BetterTimeWarp-v2-0!-Customizable-Time-Warp-and-Lossless-Physics-Warp\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBetterTimeWarp\u003C/a\u003E for faster physics warping - the thread header says 1.0.2 compatibility, but the more detailed ChangeLog and the last author comment (8/5/15) state that 1.0.4 is supported as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe author says that a 1 hour ion engine burn was completed in only 3 minutes with 20x physics warp.
