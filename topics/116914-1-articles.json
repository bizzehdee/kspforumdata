Career mode is bashed a lot because of how shallow it is, and I understand that, all it is really is just \u0027do this task and receive money for it so you can do more tasks and get more money, also science\u0027.\n\nThere should be a more managerial-y feel to career mode, like you\u0027re actually the head of the space program. One way that could help achieve this would be the addition of an extra building, or an addition to the administration building.\n\nIn this building, you can choose how you want the program to be run. You can choose between being public funded and private funded. With public funding, you will receive a certain amount of money every Kerbin year or so, the amount depends on your reputation. You can still do contracts but the rewards for them are lower than what they\u0027d be like if the program was privately funded. Most of the contacts you get will be ones like \u0027Retrieve science data from \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u0027 or \u0027Set up a space station in orbit of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u0027, and less part testing and visual surveys. If you screw up a mission and a Kerbal gets killed or anything else happens that damages your reputation, be prepared to take a big reputation! Much larger than the reputation hit from being private funded. This in turn will affect the amount of money you get every year. \n\nIf you choose to be private funding, you get the full scope of contracts and much larger rewards for doing them, but you don\u0027t get the money every year that public funding gives you. Reputation hits from catastrophic failures are lower. Also with private funding, you can choose the sorts of contracts you want too. If you want to focus on visual surveys, then you can do so, and the generated contracts at Mission Control will be 75% visual surveys. This way you can choose to do the types of missions you want without having to spam the decline button in order to find one you want to do. You can switch between private and public funding at any time.\n\nAnother feature of this building is something like a suggestions box that members of the Kerbal public can put their opinions of the space program into. These tips will help you improve the space program, and they\u0027d be more strict for public funded programs. For example, if you\u0027re been doing nothing but Kerbin system missions for 5 years, you\u0027ll get a lot of suggestions like \u0027What have these scientists and engineers been doing all this time? Isn\u0027t it time to go interplanetary now!?\u0027 or if you have lots of astronauts in the Astronaut Complex, but none of them have been on a mission in a while, you\u0027ll get a suggestion like \u0027What are these astronauts doing all day? Playing video games?\u0027. If your space program is doing well, the suggestions box will praise that too, but its main purpose will be to point the player in the right direction for what to do next.\n\n(Also, this would also give Squad an opportunity to introduce a new KSC staff member who runs the building, who could be female.)\n\nAnother idea I had is one I already posted here, but I want to expand upon it. I like the outpost-building contracts because I like building space stations and stuff, but it sucks because...well, nobody actually uses them. I put this space station it orbit around Jool? Cool! ...Now what? As far as I\u0027m concerned, it\u0027s useless space junk once it fulfils its contract parameters. It would be neat if you had contracts that would have you ferry tourists to these space stations and bases, dock to them and spend some time there, and then get \u0027em home again. It would be even cooler if these contracts had a time limit too - if they don\u0027t get there in time, or get home in time, you fail the contract. Not only could tourists visit these outposts but scientists from the agencies could want to use the science facilities of your outposts, and could yield a little science rewards too. You\u0027ll only get these types if you actually have an outpost set up, like if you don\u0027t even have a space station around Eve you won\u0027t get a contract asking to ferry people to an Eve outpost.\n\nThose are all the ideas I have. I lack the knowledge of modding so I couldn\u0027t make it a reality, and I think this sort of stuff is outside the realms of what modding can do anyways, but they\u0027re my ideas at least."},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T21:07:35Z","Content":"I will always push for more uses of space stations, they get very little love in stock!"},{"CreatedByName":"Moesly_Armlis","CreatedById":112247,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T21:37:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E .. choose the sorts of contracts you want too.
