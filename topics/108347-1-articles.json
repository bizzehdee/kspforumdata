It\u0027s missing some important bits, but it\u0027s leaps and bounds ahead of what I could do a week ago. I find the more I get into it, the more questions I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I be creating collider models in Blender or in Unity? I\u0027ve seen both, though admittedly the unity created collider was not for an engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame question for thrust transform and attach nodes, unity or blender?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally (for now), any suggestions on programs to create a normal map without the nvidia scripts for photoshop?

You can also make simple cylinder colliders for engines and just turn it into a physics-\u0026gt;mesh collider in Unity; you can also do that to the actual engine models too, as long as you check \u0022concave\u0022 it\u0027ll fill in the polygons needed to make a solid shape physX will recognize. The third option is to add Unity primitive colliders (capsules or cubes) to your hierarchy. I\u0027ve done all three, there\u0027s a right time for all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for normal maps, there are normal map generators out there, but if you need an image editor you can try \u0022gimp\u0022 which is a free open source \u0022photoshop\u0022 type program, and there\u0027s a clone of the nvidia plugin for it: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://code.google.com/p/gimp-normalmap/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever used it though; Personally I use Corel Paintshop Pro, which is an old competitor of Photoshop and most photoshop plugins are compatible with it, including the Nviidia one. It\u0027s much much cheaper than Photoshop and a one time fee, but its also different in a few ways so you might want to do some research.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour tutorial helped me out a lot.

I even put a fairing on it! =D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some minor hilarity due to the rotation of my thrustTransform node at first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly lingering issues seem to revolve around Blender/Unity. For some reason, objects that have two \u0022facings\u0022 (such as the fairing, the outsidewall and the inner wall) are getting their textures flipped between Blender and Unity, IE the inside wall texture gets placed on the outside wall, and the outside wall is semi-transparent so you can actually see the inner wall.

You\u0027ll see that the troublesome faces have no lines (they\u0027re actually pointing \u0022inward\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a couple of ways to fix them. The way I do it is via the left tool panel (the one with the vertical tabs) Click on the Shading/UVs tab and you\u0027ll see another \u0022Normals\u0022 heading with 2 buttons; Flip and recalculate. Flip works by flipping all faces you currently have selected, so you can use sift\u002Bright click on the model to select the incorrect faces and then hit Flip to fix them. Recalculate takes the whole model and tries to decide which faces should be visible and adjusts the normals accordingly. Recalculate works in MOST cases but it won\u0027t handle some complex geometry quite right. Be ready to Undo and try the other method if you don\u0027t like the outcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that is done you can save and the changes should appear in Unity for you to re-export to KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis post has some more info in it; he and I may be using different versions of Blender so the tools may be in different places.
