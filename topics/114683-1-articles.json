Most important thing to avoid artifacts here is to not try to cut a too segemented(dense) piece into a piece without enough segements to define the curvature. Basically you would need more segements on the big cylinder to hold its curvature if you boolean in a high density operand. Hope this makes sense.\n\nthe picture above is the best case scenario. But you can get away with more operand segements if you terminate the polygons well(not so many in one place, and avoid terminating on the vertical between two curving polygons) and/or increase the big cylinder segements enough so that you have the operand going through 3/4 segements instead of just 2.

Boolean ops make some insets easier but you can do them without booleans. Except the resulting geometry is the same so its mainly a workflow preference. The other option is to use a normalmap baked from a high poly, generated from a grayscale image or via ndo/crazybump etc. for small details it can look just as good.

What i meant are ordinary edge loops that are going horizontally on your model.
