We saw flashes in the sky, looking like the flashing lights on a plane (also about the same brightness), but without any plane attached (we could see the red position lights of other planes very well). It were about 10 of them, randomly distributed across the sky. The first 3 occured at the same location with an interval of 10-30 seconds, the last 3 also on one (different) spot. The others werent grouped up in a noticable way. We both saw them at the same time in the same spot, so im sure it wasnt imagination or our eyes playing tricks. The only viable explanation we could find was that those were shooting stars directly aimed at us (and thus being only a point), but it seems highly unlikely that one third of the observed meteors would be aimed directly at us from different spots in the sky.

Aircraft flying in a certain pattern can appear to be fixed in the sky for a long time. That also accounts for the lack of sound, as they can be much further away than the other craft, or blow their noise in another direction. Having them turn ever so slightly while they do can cut the line of sight to the flashing light, changing the apparent frequency. The lights may also have been landing lights much further away, which are brighter than the navigation lights and will shine through where the others will have faded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am very used to having aircraft in the sky and even I still get caught out sometimes.

In more populated areas they pretty much punch through those altitudes as quickly as possible to minimize ground level exposure to emisions and noise. I am talking about manoeuvres much higher up. At larger airports, aircraft are guided in along predetermined path tens or even hundreds or kilometres out. These paths are often spiraled or twisting to account for other paths or to avoid certain areas on the ground. Having an aircraft change course will require it to make a turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at the traces of actual aircraft in the image below.
