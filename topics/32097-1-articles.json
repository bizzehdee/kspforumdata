Sometimes I want to slightly adjust the rotation of a part, but clicking it rips the part and everything attached to it from the ship, and unless you clicked exactly over the attachment node, its position shifts to the cursor location and it must be laboriously moved back to its original position, which can be extremely difficult with some of the fiddlier pieces like angled beams.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-09T21:59:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2013 09:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by giltirn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-09T09:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t.
