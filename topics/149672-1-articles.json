There are so many parts available in sandbox and you will be completely lost to know what to do with them. No dispute at all about that. Both career and science modes are designed to introduce parts slowly, and in using them you start to understand what is significant about each one (and sometimes, why a cheap and simple part can be more useful than an apparently \u0022better\u0022 part ... you\u0027ll see what I mean if you persevere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, career gives an incentive: money. You can simply get the satisfaction of getting progressively better as anonymous plebs pay you good money to do things. The first time you might only make a slim profit, but if you do it again you\u0027ll do it better, cheaper, and more profitably.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when it comes down to it, getting to orbit is all about profit: if it\u0027s expensive, it\u0027s inefficient.

It\u0027s just (engine thrust)/(current gravity)/(total craft mass).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s take these one at a time. First the engine thrust. This is given by the info panel when you hover the mouse cursor over an engine in the parts list. It has two numbers, both given in kilo-newtons. One is the thrust in vacuum, the other is the thrust at 1 atmosphere of pressure, which is what you get at sea level on Kerbin. Since that\u0027s where you\u0027re launching at, you\u0027ll want that 1 atm number. Type that into your calculator (if you\u0027re using more than one engine, then add them all up).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second number is the current gravity that you\u0027re experiencing. At sea level on Kerbin this is 9.8066 m/s^2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last number is the total mass of your fully fueled craft. This is given by the engineer\u0027s report. Find it on the bottom right corner of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E screen, the icon that looks like a wrench. Hover your mouse over it, and towards the top of the small window that pops up is the mass of your craft. (If you are in career mode it will be formatted as \u0026lt;mass1\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;mass2\u0026gt;. Mass1 is your craft mass, mass2 is the max weight that the launch pad can handle.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you take those three numbers and divide them out. Here\u0027s an example: 175 kn thrust / 9.0866 / 11.8 tons = 1.51. That 1.51 is your thrust to weight ratio, often written as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you\u0027re going to be able to lift off, that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E must be grater than 1.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-12T22:29:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/12/2016 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FullMetalMachinist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T16:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget though that not every game suits every person.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a particular type that sticks with KSP and you don\u0027t have to be that type.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lorule","CreatedById":170058,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-12T17:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156531-fullmetalmachinist/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022156531\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/156531-fullmetalmachinist/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@FullMetalMachinist\u003C/a\u003E!

It took me an enormous amount of time to design my first orbit-capable rocket, and now (with over a thousand hours of play time) I regularly create fleets of huge interplanetary transports to explore both the stock system of planets and even new planets that are added by mods. Doing anything in this game is very difficult the first time, but once you know how to do it, it\u0027s usually not difficult to do again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReaching orbit is tough. You have to make a vehicle that can accelerate to over 2km/s (though the actual delta-v requirement is almost twice that) whilst fighting a thick atmosphere, and that\u0027s not an easy task when you\u0027re new to the game. I didn\u0027t even have an efficient lifter design that I was fully satisfied with and could use regularly without risking the loss of a payload until I had a few hundred hours of play time. Around a similar time was when I learned how to dock properly. But once you\u0027re used to it, it\u0027s simply a matter of scaling your rocket to fit your payload (and eventually creating standard launch vehicles that you can just stick onto any suitable payload, which is what I\u0027ve gotten into the habit of doing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-13T14:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping it simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThrow a ball.
