Currently TACLS appears to use 30kg kerbalnaut, while the Life support maths post is around 15 when the numbers are halved. Lets keep it simple and say that heavier kerbals means double the consumption rate, and for the purposes of gameplay, it is less trivial if we use the consumption for a 30kg kerbal. If kerbals had varying weights, some fatter and some skinnier, the 30kg number would be the best one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did similar math and came to the conclusion that Kerbals weight ~32.5 kg on average. Plugged that into the equation here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.it/2012/06/kleiber-law.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://equation-of-the-month.blogspot.it/2012/06/kleiber-law.html\u003C/a\u003E, and came up with the ~51% consumption rate for Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TaranisElsu","CreatedById":57742,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T02:38:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022krenshala\u0022 data-cite=\u0022krenshala\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, a quick search turns up that the ISS crew members are assigned approximately 1.8kg of food per day, per person. If kerbals need half that we can round a bit and call it 1kg per kerbal per day. I\u0027m not sure what volume that should require, however. It just becomes a matter of determining what density the food should be. We know the mass (1kg per kerbal-day) so the density allows us to derive the volume needed. From that we can either determine how much the current containers can actually hold and what their mass should be, or we can determine what volume the containers need to be to hold the desired mass of food.\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the same (inefficient) packaging that we use here on Earth, then approximately 75% of the waste mass will be food packaging (the wiki page showed ~65% to 90% waste was food packaging on various missions). Not sure how that would play into the mod, however. It might be easier to just gloss over that part. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have a link for that?
