The SH3 comes in at 5.55t and is preset to make it to low orbit before the fuel runs out. For those of you struggling with stock SSTOs (as I was), this should help out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MUJrWFe.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MUJrWFe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ofVC97j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ofVC97j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/W7CVV4T.png\u0022 alt=\u0022W7CVV4T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best results, try this: After leaving runway on a 90 heading, pull up to 90 degrees line (or 45 degree incline from navball horizon) until you reach 1000-1500 meters (should hold course after that). Level off at 16K-17K to build up speed. Don\u0027t worry about flame out, the ceiling max is 40K\u002B. Once you hit orbit, hit group 1 and throttle up from 1/3 to half way (any more will make the nose rise). That should do it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/mopftoagesw7mmk/Stock%20Hawk%20III.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/mopftoagesw7mmk/Stock%20Hawk%20III.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-17T00:15:02Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2014 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by firegeek83\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xoknight","CreatedById":80283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T00:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes it carry any passengers?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"firegeek83","CreatedById":41843,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T02:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot this version.
