A game engine change isn\u0027t going to suddenly change their format. The parts are being made to behave the same as they did in the last version. New replacement parts may cause a little strangeness due to size and shape changes on existing craft, but usually won\u0027t cause anything to severely break, it will just look odd. In the past changes like this have caused gaps to appear or things to be out of place.
