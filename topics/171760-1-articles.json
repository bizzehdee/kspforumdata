So in your design if the wing root is in front of the center of gravity, but the elevons are behind it, they\u0027re going to act in reverse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"putnamto","CreatedById":184648,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-07T03:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah, i just discovered this.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nso whats the solution?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nanother question, this craft starts to veer hard to the left after 60m/s why is this?\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\ncorrected the veering, and now it becomes very wobbly around 80-100m/s until eventually one of the wings clips the ground and all is lost.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nthis is frustrating, i cant pinpoint a problem in this game so i just remove and add things in a semilogical(atleast in my head) manner until it works, i really wish this game would tell you how or why your ships having problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-07T03:10:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2018 03:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by putnamto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-07T05:45:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, for the wings, don\u0027t use swept wings -- unless every bit of them is\u00A0completely ahead or behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the veering and wobbly problem -- that\u0027s mostly an issue with your wheels. Those wheels max out at around 7 tonnes, and I think your plane is right around that number. However, if you redesign your plane to have more lift and better takeoff capabilities, you should be able to get into the air at 50 m/s or less and avoid the issue.
