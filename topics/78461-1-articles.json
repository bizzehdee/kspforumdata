It turns out that I can Focus View on Kerbin but I cannot target it (and I\u0027m still in Mun\u0027s orbit, I\u0027m not in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you move the mouse over the planet it seems as if it is not recognized (it doesn\u0027t provide information), and if I click on the planet the menu to target Kerbin does not appear, I just can focus view by double clicking on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same situation I\u0027m able to target other celestial bodies without any problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to increase the zoom out the view until all inner solar system fits in the screen and then I targeted Eve (no problem). At the same scale Kerbin, Mun and Minmus appear as a single dot. Then if I move the mouse over Kerbin, Mun and Minmus, information for all three appears in the screen and it allows to target Kerbin again.
