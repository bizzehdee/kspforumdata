As it currently stands, if you press W to go forward, you also pitch down (and even disabling the command pod torque causes that? I guess that part is a bug). In KSP 1, the key binds could be remapped to different keys, so you could drive around without tilting the rovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wheels should also have more traction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzz313th","CreatedById":149043,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T03:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you disable the reaction wheels, then it should be fine.\u00A0 I do this in KSP1 and never had an issue.\u00A0 Maybe your experiencing a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Turbo Ben","CreatedById":193979,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T11:01:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already put in a request for this with the devs. This is a must for me as I use a HOTAS setup. In KSP1 I set up steering to be the same as yaw (twisting the joystick) and forward/reverse to a paddle on the throttle. In KSP 2 I can\u0027t yet map yaw and throttle to the HOTAS, but at least pitch and roll can. It\u0027s a bit hit and miss as to whether the other buttons remember to work, and the map toggle only opens the map, still need to use M to close it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T11:39:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain we are re-living KSP 1 times.
