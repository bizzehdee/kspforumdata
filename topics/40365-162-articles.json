Small numbers are handled the same way, but with a negative exponent: 1.23E-4 represents 1.23 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10\u003Csup\u003E-4\u003C/sup\u003E, which evaluates to 0.000123. Scientific notation is used in science and engineering because you are less likely to make an error when reading or writing with them; you can\u0027t leave out a zero or add too many by accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe magnetometer is measuring first the strength of the magnetic field that you are in, and then the rate at which it encounters antiprotons (the rate at which you encounter particles is called \u0027flux\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, magnetic fields have a direction as well as a strength (measured in Tesla, or \u0022T\u0022) at every point, so it\u0027s not good enough to report just how strong the field is. Instead the magnetometer reports the absolute strength (labeled \u0022|B|\u0022, B for the magnetic field, with the absolute value operator around it), the strength radial to the planet (labeled \u0022B_r\u0022; presumably that would be B\u003Csub\u003Er\u003C/sub\u003E if there were scope for better typography in the game), and the transverse strength (\u0022B_T\u0022, or B\u003Csub\u003ET\u003C/sub\u003E). Now, most magnetometers measure the magnetic field along directions relative to themselves; if you twist or turn the thing in the air the values will change. The game magnetometer does some of the work for you and computes the radial and transverse values relative to the surface of the planet below, which makes things easier for you because you never have to care about which way your ship is pointing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe funny thing is that in the end you don\u0027t much care about the magnetic field. The magnetic field is necessary because it traps the antiprotons that you want, but what you really care about is how many antiprotons there are. The magnetometer measures this directly, so you can ignore the magnetic field; it\u0027s just there for flavor! The antimatter flux is presented in micrograms per second (mg/s). This is handy because the capacity of your tank is measured in micrograms. All you have to do is multiply the rate shown by the magnetometer by the amount of time you are going to wait and you can compute how much antimatter you will collect. For example, at about 100km above Kerbin on one of my craft: 1.586057E-006 mg/s \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 6 hours = 1.586057E-6 mg/s \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 21600 seconds = 1.586057E-6 mg/s \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 2.16E4 s = (1.586057 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 2.16) \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u201D 10\u003Csup\u003E(-6 \u002B 4)\u003C/sup\u003E mg = 3.42588312E-2 mg = .0342 micrograms of antimatter, after waiting one Kerbal day. You can probably find a better spot; just remember that a larger magnetic field traps more antiprotons, and traps them for longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, magetometer is an easy word to spell; just think of it as magnet-o-meter and you can\u0027t go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and I don\u0027t think Fractal_UK ever specified what the magnetometer is measuring transverse to, so that could be north-south, east-west, your current velocity vector, etc. It\u0027s just flavor text though, so I\u0027m not concerned\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"forsaken1111","CreatedById":2703,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T20:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edb48x, would you mind if I edited and used your explanation when writing up the tutorial/guide?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"db48x","CreatedById":66108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T20:18:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022 data-cite=\u0022forsaken1111\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edb48x, would you mind if I edited and used your explanation when writing up the tutorial/guide?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"db48x","CreatedById":66108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T20:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I\u0027d be happy to help in other ways as well.
