I mean, lots of experienced players rush through the Tech Tree as fast as possible and quickly reach the \u0022now what?\u0022 phase of game play. As many people have figured out by now, it takes a grind, but you can complete the entire Tech Tree without leaving the Kerbin SOI. I think Squad has been thinking about this kind of thing quite a bit, and now that the game-mechanisms for contracts, funds and rep are built, they will continue on towards their next internal milestone and see how the community reacts and how modders build onto their system. I predict that sometime around .26 or 0.27, we\u0027ll see a \u0022stretching out\u0022 of the tech tree - more and smaller nodes, requiring more Science!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 to unlock, giving people a disincentive to grind out missions in the Kerbin SOI. I think more of the science parts will be moved lower in the tree but will produce a lot less Science\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 on or near Kerbin, but will be correspondingly more beneficial the further away you are. That will give people incentive to launch earlier flyby missions to Duna and Eve (like the early U.S. Mariner missions in real life), and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut whatever happens, it will be interesting to see how it all plays out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caelib","CreatedById":59329,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-16T13:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuring the development of KSP, they are building SYSTEMS into the game ... when they do that, they only implement a fragment of that functionality to get the system working, etc. Once all of the systems have been implemented (referred to as \u0022Scope Completion\u0022), they will likely be expanded quite a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs stated in blog posts by Squad, it doesn\u0027t make any sense from a development perspective to create a bunch of content that has to be updated and tested with every release.
