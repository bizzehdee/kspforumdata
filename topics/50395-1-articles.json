One of the main achievements for the SLS is the Asteroid ReDirect Mission, set in 2021. Should the POTUS in 2016 win two terms, the mission will happen while he/she is in office (2016-2024). It is far enough for many to forget that Obama was responsible for it, yet close enough for the credit of the mission to be given to the next President. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, Project Constellation had the Moon as it\u0027s major selling point. It would\u0027ve landed a man on the moon in 2018-2020. This does not work for Obama, as his term limit ends in 2016, which means he would not have received any credit for the moon landing as it did not occur during his term. Also, two of the major test launches will occur during Obamas term/Early Other POTUS term. While manned missions would\u0027ve taken place in 2014, they would\u0027ve sent men to the ISS, which is not nearly as exciting as going to an asteroid, and also was not a first or highlight achievement of the program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, many of the POTUS candidates for the next election are Congressmen, who are overwhelmingly supportive of the SLS program. Those who come even CLOSE to opposing it are the House Republicans, who simply want it to be used for lunar missions. However, the recent Government shutdown has greatly damaged the reputation of the House Republicans who many now view as incompetent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd even if the new NASA Administration is against it, it will still likely be carried out, with the same reasons stated above. The highlight of the SLS project, the 2021 mission, will happen during the NASA administration that comes into play in 2016, far enough for less credit to be given to Bolden, but close enough for the agency administration to celebrate and be rewarded for the mission, rather than be passed over as a footnote in the space history books. Also, unlike the Constellation, which would\u0027ve done the job in some 15\u002B years, the Asteroid Redirect Mission is done in a mere eight years.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-24T18:10:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/24/2013 06:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NASAFanboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T15:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Constellation program was cancelled for many reasons, some political, some practical, but it was a boondoggle: over budget and -- more importantly -- behind schedule.

Obama has not the popularity of Kennedy, and the House does not support him at all. His policies are highly controversial, without the popularity of the Kennedy Adminstration. And thus, it is more likely that the serving POTUS be remembered for the ARM more than the POTUS that created it. That is, if Watergate 2.0 doesn\u0027t come and do him in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also highly risky for a program to completely go past a two Presidental terms without a significant milestone achievement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if it takes till 2023, the mission will still occur in the next Presidents term.

(About 25% of it is just sitting in vaults in the Federal Reserve doing nothing.) Foreign owned U.S. debt actually is a good thing because it gives us trade leverage, makes the dollar attractive as an international store of value, and gives us a small cushion against global economic shocks. And the debt has been increasing since the 1830\u0027s, with a few minor years here and there where it went down by a percent or two.
