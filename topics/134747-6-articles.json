Well or at least, a part of the problem. Point is Microsoft and Sony are kind of approving the software which makes its way to the console version. Now, if that piece of software is poorly written and doesn\u0027t work that\u0027s a problem - for Microsoft and Sony as they approved that software. If that happens too often, people will start thinking \u0022Company XXX produces crappy consoles and the games published for their systems never work\u0022 and simply stay away from that console. So, in the end that would cut into the earnings of the console manufacturers. So, I assume Sony went to Squad and told them to fix the quality issues first. Probably Sony is now reviewing the fixes Squad provided (at least, that\u0027s how I would do) and deciding on whether that\u0027s enough or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompanies are watching social media and are observing discussions on their products, especially once problems occur. These discussions are analyzed by marketing guys and they recommend to either publish additional information or not. If they aren\u0027t blamed for the errors they usually do not feel the need to act. If they are blamed they might publish some press release which gives new information to the discussion observed. Taking that into consideration, I think Sony is watching their fora and simply decided to put the release in the EU on hold. Consumer rights in Europe are better established than those in the US it seems. At least selling broken video games for consoles might lead to a huge PR problem which could cut future sales.
