I\u0027ll try to make this short: Built a ship called \u0022Kethane \u0026amp; Science\u0022, obviously entailing a lot of parts and tonnage. Built and tested each stage,(meticulously I might add). Launched for the Mun, got there but due to my poor piloting skills, crashed, hit the escape button, and got the options of \u0022revert to VAB\u0022 or \u0022revert to launch\u0022, which I chose the latter. So I\u0027m ready to launch and the second stage starts to just fall off the rocket! Reverted to launch again, and with the same results, 3 or 4 times! So why is this ship (originally sound) falling apart on the launch pad? I made no structural changes! What\u0027s the variable factor here? A bug?, or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-21T19:29:25Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2014 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SpacedCowboy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PUNiSH3R","CreatedById":102377,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T23:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERevert to the VAB, sometimes my bigger ships get bugged on \u0022Revert to Launch\u0022 and CATO without the TO...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-19T23:41:41Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2014 11:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PUNiSH3R\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E[sic]\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T02:30:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the response, I did go back to the VAB a couple of times just to check it out, but made no changes.
