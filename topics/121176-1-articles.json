Nothing big - just totally invalidating it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* We KNOW that the UI is issuing a ton of draw calls. That is the lack of UI mechanisms to make it easier - which the new UI will fix. Especially with a lot of multi threaded work going into Unity 5.2 to combine the draw calls in a separate thread or something like that. But the current UI is quite ineffective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Dx 12 helps all graphics cards. It kills a LOT of overhead in the driver section. I read in various places about a 20% gain even for old games that are not rewritten \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E And most graphics cards support Dx 12 - or they could not run Windows 10 at all. They do not support the new features, but they support the new driver model with less overhead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T23:41:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason to go with DX11 over DX9 under Unity 4 would be that Unity\u0027s DX9 implementation has a bug with CPU texture mirroring which inflates memory usage significantly (by keeping redundant copies of textures in system memory instead of offloading to GPU memory) which exacerbates KSP\u0027s 32 bit limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this particular bug has been fixed in Unity 5\u0027s implementation of DX9 then there won\u0027t be too much difference given KSP is (relatively) graphically lightweight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDX11/12 support would be nice though for their various advances, maybe essential even if the DX9 bug still isn\u0027t fixed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T12:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, but that\u0027ll not be part of 1.1, and maybe not even 1.2.\u003Cp\u003EDirectX 11 doesn\u0027t.
