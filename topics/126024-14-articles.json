If you have a widescreen monitor, then having text run all of the way across the screen will require more head/eye shifting.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m not really sure that I buy that, it seems like something that would only be an issue with larger monitors, 27\u0022 or above, and most people seem to be on smaller monitors or using laptops, where screens are never really that wide. And even if it does reduce head and eye movement it increases hand movement by making you scroll more.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRegardless of the reason, not using the entire width seems to be the standard for websites designed for reading (as opposed to shopping, streaming sites, or um... forums).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd have there been any images of actual forum posts using the new site, not just the forum listing? The current site doesn\u0026#39;t exactly make much use of horizontal space outside of actual posts, the edges expand, but there is pretty much always a huge gap running right down the middle if the window is maximized. So really it just shifts the wasted space to the middle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nActual forum posts are another story though, so it would be nice to know how they are handled.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T02:18:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 02:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DMagic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T02:20:37Z","Content":"\nOkay, but if something goes wrong and you can\u0026#39;t migrate the existing forum posts, don\u0026#39;t you dare think that proceeding is acceptable.
