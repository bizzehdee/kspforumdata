Shareing much of the same disign futures just bigger, the Air-16 can still turn. So the bay as you might expect is a little bigger. I probably could\u0027ve fit another row of bombs(15 more bombs) however 30 was hard enough(symetry didnt work). Anyways she is pretty much the same as the Air-15 exept not noob proof. If you havent flown any on my jets before i strongly advise you to try my Air-15 first. Also the same \u0022roof\u0022 carrier thing works on here like its little brother.
