As I\u0027ve said before, DRE does not implement its own thermodynamic system. It modifies the existing stock thermo system that was introduced in KSP 1.0 and it relies on the existence of certain data called PartThermalData (that\u0027s the actual name of the class, I\u0027ll refer to it as PTD) and it is generated for every single part that exists in KSP regardless of whether it is marked as \u0027physicsless\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe absence of the PTD is what was causing the nullref errors for some players before. So I checked to make sure that the PTD was actually present (and not null) before moving forward with further thermal related code. But I was logging the error and that caused performance killing lag for players so I removed the error logging code. That and the aforementioned changes treating massless parts as having a minimum of 1kg of mass is really the best I can do. Bottom line is that if I don\u0027t have that PTD to work with then it\u0027s going to cause problems. And it didn\u0027t go missing because of a bug in Deadly Reentry. That happened somewhere in stock KSP where that data is generated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there no way to just report a game bug, which is independent of OS and hardware?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T01:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would call it pretty much working-as-designed, tbh: if you break physics, physics breaks you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yemo","CreatedById":114412,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T02:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would call it pretty much working-as-designed, tbh: if you break physics, physics breaks you.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if I set the physics significance flag, physics should ignore the part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, massless parts are intended to work as an addendum to the host part, you could upgrade probe cores by attaching mass and physicsless parts, using KIS...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
