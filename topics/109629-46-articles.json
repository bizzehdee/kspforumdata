The orbiter design was finalized long before the ET and SRB were desgned. The entire design of the Shuttle bases on the Shuttle-Saturn concept. von Brauns concept was alsbolute superior to the final SRB and ET alternative. The Shuttle can lift up to 70 tons cargo with it. With the SRB that was limited to 22 tons. It is said that von Braun was deeply worried as the politicians demanded a budget version. SRB are against anything von Braun stands for. Beside the performance problems was another thing ...the SRB are extremly unsafe, uncontrollable and made the flights in the end much more expensive than the Saturn concept would have cost. \n\n14 life and 2 orbiters were lost because that decission that politicians made. Both lost orbiters got destroyed because this pathetic SRB concept. Challenger because the SRB destroyed her ET. And Columbia because foam from the ET hit her wing, something that would not have happened when von Braun would have been able to build exactly what he planned. And not many know that Atlantis almost suffered the very same fate but made it back home with extreme damage. \n\nsorry for the history rant but seeing this makes me mad xD"},{"CreatedByName":"olivertk","CreatedById":124146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T13:55:32Z","Content":"Sirkut was working on a dyna-soar here is the thread: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60540-WIP-X-20-Dynasoar](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/60540-WIP-X-20-Dynasoar) \n\nIt would be awesome if you made one!"},{"CreatedByName":"PatrickTeu","CreatedById":145601,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T14:57:29Z","Content":"Endeavour makes reentry:\n\n![w7fibf7v.jpg](http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/w7fibf7v.jpg)\n\napproach:\n\n![if2bvufv.jpg](http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150707/if2bvufv.jpg)\n\nlanded ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n![eoc3r32h.jpg](http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/eoc3r32h.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:02:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Endeavour makes reentry:\n\u003E [http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/w7fibf7v.jpg](http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/w7fibf7v.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E approach:\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150707/if2bvufv.jpg](http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150707/if2bvufv.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E landed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/eoc3r32h.jpg](http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150707/eoc3r32h.jpg)\n\nVerry nice but dont expect that in the campain!... 747 glide launches only until full shuttle is unlocked"},{"CreatedByName":"Mike-NZ","CreatedById":142683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:56:15Z","Content":"i didn\u0027t have time to do everything but here is a patch\n\nv1.7.2\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/lnhhc5ahq2bozrk/1.7.2.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lnhhc5ahq2bozrk/1.7.2.zip?dl=0)\n\nv1.7.2\n\nmodified module decoupling ability\n\nadjusted oms fuel usage to last longer\n\nextended APU (generator) lifespan\n\nremoved science storage from cabin. proper module required if science gathering is required\n\nlowered reaction torque in fuselage, too powerfull.\n\nput the COL back slightly\n\nfixed ET DOOR heat tolerance\n\nadded tail to Enterprise\n\nincreased dreamchaser part strength\n\nlowered dreamchaser TWR\n\nfixed animation delay on Enterprise\n\nadded SkyLab\n\nfixed rear rcs\n\nnew boster almost ready\n\nFSS rorator module almost ready\n\n![dEmb7Vq.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/dEmb7Vq.jpg)![gcuSBau.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gcuSBau.jpg)![1XQf72u.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1XQf72u.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyren","CreatedById":76757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T16:58:44Z","Content":"This is how a space shuttle mod should look like."}]}
