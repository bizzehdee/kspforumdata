But my implementation seems to be original.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that rather than being pre-set, systems NOT of your starting solar system should be procedurally generated and reflect the characteristics of the real universe - mostly dry, barren earth at inner planets and lots of gas giants.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen your ship exits the solar system, which only happens \u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/1189/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eonce\u003C/a\u003E, a warning will come up, saying \u0022Warning: You are about to leave this solar system\u0022. If you do not fire thrusters or boosters against outer space and towards your home system, The screen will black out and you will appear at the edge of another solar system. This system will be a procedurally generated one. You are free to explore, but it would be nice to have a base to refer from, right? So in this system, you will be allowed to select a rocky planet and set up a base there - with new parts. There will be a drill, allowing you to obtain fuel whilst on the surface, providing refueling capabilities, and a new \u003Cem\u003Einterstellar transmitter\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you decide to cruelly abandon your poor Kerbals on this desolate system, you can go back to your base on Kerbin, and build new ships! But after launching your ship, and zooming out into the planetary view, you\u0027ll be able to see a little arrow on the side. Well, this would be the \u003Cem\u003Einterstellar transmitter\u003C/em\u003E ( I insist on using italics ). An interstellar transmitter will allow you to locate your previous interstellar missions, but only telling you the general direction your ship drifted into. If you decide to retrace your footsteps, and continue in that direction, you will ultimately end up in the same system. And due to the new drill component, you can refuel your ships there and continue onwards in your exploration of that system!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe position of each system is stored in a 3 dimensional grid of coordinates. When you leave your system, your direction will form a ray which is 10 degrees wide, projected from the sun. The game will attempt to search for any system whose coordinates fall in this ray, and enter the closest one. Upon arrival, your map of little arrows will change again to reflect a perspective from your new position, thus allowing you to journey far from your home star in search of incredible adventure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for a simple problem - abuse of the drill. The simple answer is to make the drill lock onto the planet, unable to be detached. Thus, once you start mining for fuel, any attempt to lift off again would result in the risk of serious damage to your ship. However, with docking ports and good placement, you will be able to use it as a refueling station both in faraway systems or on a closer spot, say the moon to compensate for Kerbin escape costs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-28T11:01:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile a nice idea, this is far removed from KSP\u0027s current model of... well, anything. It\u0027s simplistic, but I think you\u0027ll find the general consensus amongst most players will most likely be that if there is going to be interstellar travel, it should operate on exactly the same physics as the present single-star system does -- i.e., no magic transference between systems, large swathes of empty space, and orbital mechanics required to be pretty darn accurate in order to get close to the SOI of another star.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
