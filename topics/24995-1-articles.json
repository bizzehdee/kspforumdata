Since an observer on board a ship traveling at significant fractions of c measures both of these things with significantly different results than an observer who is relative to the ship standing still, they will not agree on closing \u0022speed.\u0022 So when two approaching ships arrived at your station and you told the captains they were approaching each other at 1.5c they will laugh at you and show you video from inside their ship of them approaching each other at .96c.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not what I\u0027m missing because that\u0027s totally irrelevant to the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m talking specifically about what an observer on earth measures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T06:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Person012345\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Person012345\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo I\u0027m not. I\u0027m talking about closing speed not relative speed.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFair enough. But that\u0027s the source of confusion, at any rate. People were talking about relative speed in the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, closing speed is not really \u0022physically relevant\u0022. E.g., you cannot use closing speed to send information from point A to point B at 2c. That\u0027s really the proper test of speed limit violation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, speed of light is a local limit. Hence the warp drive, etc. But we had a lengthy discussion of that in another thread. I think it\u0027s safe to assume that in this thread we\u0027re talking about local violations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
