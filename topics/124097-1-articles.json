My regular spaceplane \u0022creeps up\u0022, basically goes on a top speed run at 18,000-20,000m , then i milk the nose up trying to stay airbreathing as long as possible getting all the horizontal speed i can. 2 RAPIERS and a Nuke on a 35 ton launch weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022other woman\u0022 is much more minimalist, couple of \u0022whiplash\u0022 bolted to a light 13 ton airframe. What I find myself doing is getting into a zoom climb after punching through the sound barrier around 10,000m, accelerating to 900m/s by 20km despite climbing at a 60 deg angle, loosing power rapidly thereafter but still coasting to 40k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to work out if there\u0027s anything special about the zoom climb vs creeper method... is my theorycrafting all hogwash, if not, is it only applicable to very high thrust-weight designs? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. At 14km and 800 m/s your engines have an enormous surplus of power over drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Used to accelerate horizontally, drag rises exponentially and you\u0027re going past the max power speed of your engine - the faster you go , the less thrust you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. So, use the surplus thrust to build momentum in the vertical direction instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything special about upward momentum? Is it better to be climbing at 45 deg at 800 m/s when your whiplash shut down at 24km, or 1150 m/s but barely climbing at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m expecting the answer to be \u0022no\u0022, 800m/s in a 45 degree climb is the same kinetic energy as 800 m/s horizontal. Although once I go anaerobic, I normally pitch up 10 deg AoA to try get out of the draggy air sooner, generating the lift to create the g forces for this pull up manouvre is something you\u0027d bank at lower altitudes when your airbreathing engines still have lots of thrust, if you were using the zoomer method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, my sandbox mk 2 gets to 27km and 1600 m/s before switching to closed cycle. She gets to orbit with only the oxidiser that comes with a pair of short mk 2 - mk 1 adapters (440 oxy?). For a pure LEO truck, it\u0027d make sense to carry more oxidiser and leave off the LV-N, but the main mission of this one is single stage to a Minmus refuelling station, whereupon it can swallow 3000 units of liquid fuel and go basically anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorpychan","CreatedById":72052,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T16:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVertical momentum means a higher AP, which means more efficient raising of the PE to circularise.
