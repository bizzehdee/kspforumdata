Honestly, again this is just from my experience craft files really do help people. In terms of people attaching themselves to mod particularly ones with alot of parts like this one or Tantares. People are impressed with the parts but when they get them in game they lose interest because they just don\u0027t know what to do with them. So you either have the super creative people who can do fantastic things with packs like this and people who want to do things like that and then get overwhelmed with the amount of parts and don\u0027t know what to do. So craft files are helpful to get the most people to download even if they just help inspire creativity. Also pictures of what the pack can do help too. However I agree with you 100% don\u0027t make craft files until the pack is close to or fully complete compatibility issues with craft files suck.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly -- it is too early at this point to start working on craft files as they would need to be rebuilt nearly every time the mod updated (at a substantial cost of time to construct and test);\u00A0 at some point after the initial \u0027public\u0027 releases are available (after 1.1) I will start working on (or rather start accepting from others) some craft files/examples that will be included in the mod distribution.\u00A0 Until then, just keep in mind you are using an in-development mod, and that many things are unfinished, unpolished, unbalanced, or unavailable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435764\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022117090\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456783837\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022138730\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowmage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MeAYtG9.png\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MeAYtG9.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MeAYtG9.png\u0022 width=\u0022422\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Screams internally*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was your real-life voice there.

I can\u0027t be sure except for the highly scientific method of removing SSTU from my mods and putting it back and seeing if I can repeat the results. Unfortunately with SSTU I am lucky if I can play 5 minutes before the game crashes. If I uninstall SSTU the game runs fine. I am not running that many mods my mod list is\u00A0way under 1gb and even though I am running on a Mac that is still way under the limit of what my computer can do. I have attached my log file and picture of all the mods that I am using. Maybe it is just my computer not being able to handle your mod and that makes me sad.

For me maybe because I am running it on a \u00A0stock macbook the game just crashes after about 5 minutes or less. It doesn\u0027t matter what I am doing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe log you posted isn\u0027t the log that I really need.. I need the KSP.log file; not sure where it is on a Mac, or if it even exists.\u00A0 I\u0027m not sure which log you posted, but that appears to be more of a Unity log.\u00A0 Thanks for the attempt though, is more than most people make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I -think- I have it pinned down / fixed (at least there is no problem on this end) -- looks like it was just an out-of-date .dll (had made code-side changes but not recompiled them).\u00A0 Check the link above for an updated release \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
