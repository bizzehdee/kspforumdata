Maybe when SSTU gets a stable release it might be worth while to set up a repository for craft like the SLS, Ares, Saturn etc etc etc.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, sp1989 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Agreed. Honestly, again this is just from my experience craft files really do help people. In terms of people attaching themselves to mod particularly ones with alot of parts like this one or Tantares. People are impressed with the parts but when they get them in game they lose interest because they just don\u0027t know what to do with them. So you either have the super creative people who can do fantastic things with packs like this and people who want to do things like that and then get overwhelmed with the amount of parts and don\u0027t know what to do. So craft files are helpful to get the most people to download even if they just help inspire creativity. Also pictures of what the pack can do help too. However I agree with you 100% don\u0027t make craft files until the pack is close to or fully complete compatibility issues with craft files suck.\n\u003E \n\nExactly -- it is too early at this point to start working on craft files as they would need to be rebuilt nearly every time the mod updated (at a substantial cost of time to construct and test);  at some point after the initial \u0027public\u0027 releases are available (after 1.1) I will start working on (or rather start accepting from others) some craft files/examples that will be included in the mod distribution.  Until then, just keep in mind you are using an in-development mod, and that many things are unfinished, unpolished, unbalanced, or unavailable."},{"CreatedByName":"MrMeeb","CreatedById":84238,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:18:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![MeAYtG9.png](http://i.imgur.com/MeAYtG9.png)](http://i.imgur.com/MeAYtG9.png \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\n\\*Screams internally\\*"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbodiah","CreatedById":152759,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:20:08Z","Content":"That was your real-life voice there.

I feel it might have something to do with the SSTU plugin. I can\u0027t be sure except for the highly scientific method of removing SSTU from my mods and putting it back and seeing if I can repeat the results. Unfortunately with SSTU I am lucky if I can play 5 minutes before the game crashes. If I uninstall SSTU the game runs fine. I am not running that many mods my mod list is way under 1gb and even though I am running on a Mac that is still way under the limit of what my computer can do. I have attached my log file and picture of all the mods that I am using. Maybe it is just my computer not being able to handle your mod and that makes me sad. However again my mod folder doesn\u0027t exceed 1gb so I have a suspicion it could be something on your end.
