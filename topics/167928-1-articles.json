Therefore, let me show you mine!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERefueling Station \u0022Veragon\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis station both produces and stockpiles rocket fuel (LfOx) and Monopropellant for outgoing ships. And by that I mean a LOT of it. Total reservoir is 51840 gallons of liquid fuel, 20250 gallons of monopropellant. And that entire reservoir gets refilled to full capacity\u00A0within about and only 8 days.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I am using KSTS mod (for automated delivery into low orbit) and Konstruction (for weldable ports), this station can be split into about 15 sections/deliveries. Tug then moves these sections into proper order, and weldable ports join them permanently. As for orbial delivery, I have recorded 37 tons delivery mission profile, so this would be maximum mass for each segment. But that does not particularly matter, because all deliveries are finished near each other with KSTS. If you split it into 30 sections, those will be within a hundred meters anyway. What you cut down on is docking procedures. Also tug is unmanned, so entire assembly is remotely controlled. Entire station cost is about 3M credits but that is mostly due to me just overbuilding it. Might make a smaller station with just one million.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Viyzqjh.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Viyzqjh.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPillars are on both ends of the station. Most outter docking ports are far from the refinery so even largest ships can dock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEngines on both ends allow changing orbit (of the entire station!) with prograde/retrograde. And since it refuels itself, well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pa1CeMx.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Pa1CeMx.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWind panels gather dust, Dysons turn dust into ore, Convert-O-Trons turn ore into rocket fuel and propellant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNuclear powerplant can produce 2000 ec/sek but station only consumes about 170. Powerplant runs only at 10% which extends its lifetime to about 50 years. However with full uranium it does cost 1.5M credits. About half the cost of entire station.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that since Dysons produce more ore than refineries\u00A0consume (only during day, wind panels require sunshine), and there is a large ore tank, refineries operate without stop\u00A0during entire night cycle (about 20 minutes). This means refineries require considerable electricity for 20 minutes windows. Solar panels would be able to produce this amount, but batteries would be huge. Therefore a need for nuclear reactors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth the reactor and all eight refineries require cooling, thats what Tripoles are for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rJAcVx1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rJAcVx1.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-25T23:52:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2017 11:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by agrock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
