I literally cannot think of a way to do it without excessive in-flight fuel management, due to not being able to make the jets draw their fuel from ONLY the fuselages. There\u0027s no way to block fuel feed from the outboard rocket tanks to the jets mounted on the back of them without also blocking flow to the rocket on the center, at least not that I\u0027m aware of, because EVERY SINGLE PART has crossflow enabled now and you can\u0027t turn off crossflow except on docking ports.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlright, I\u0027m working on the -H model...I modified the config on the [space shim](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/space-shim-by-um3kcorp/) I\u0027d run into somewhere before to make it block fuel crossflow(And to, you know, actually work).

Jets are much more efficient than rockets in almost all regimes, so you may as well just use the jet longer and not worry too hard about orphaned oxidizer.

(FYI if you want to fly a mission inside the K Prize mission rules they include lift off with horizontal start, though it only needs to be a few of meters, to distinguish it from a launchpad SSTO, the mission can still be flown using VTOL engines for the lift and can land any which way you please as long as it stays on one piece).\n\nI have flown it this time for K-Prize.\n\n![24ss.png](http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/3685/24ss.png)\n\n![mrs0.png](http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/1132/mrs0.png)\n\n![8od.png](http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/8761/8od.png)\n\n![b43.png](http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1395/b43.png)\n\n![5fqm.png](http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/4329/5fqm.png)\n\n![egii.png](http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/7351/egii.png)\n\n![d34g.png](http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/5749/d34g.png)\n\n![2gw.png](http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/6438/2gw.png)\n\n![x2tv.png](http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3104/x2tv.png)\n\n![jn2e.png](http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/5010/jn2e.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T21:56:07Z","Content":"That\u0027s OK Cupcake, its very innovative, and take off begins with horizontal movement... albeit backwards, if there is a back on the Scythe and presuming you actually did the mission the K Prize committee will take your word for it that you reached orbit and then landed safely as the video is a little ambiguous about that, since the PE is never clearly shown above 70km even though it is implied and the craft is evidently capable.

Been fiddling with some experimental crafts etc but yesterday I produced a new craft. Its still a bit of a prototype but it now works. Took me for ever to figure out that the rudders turn the wrong way when I used ailerons so well it went in to a spin when I tried to maneuver more then small increments.\n\nThis SSTO is unmanned, it saves parts sens you dont need an abort system and also wight so its not the world if it crashes. It has a new wing that do not run trough the center of CoG but is in line with the belly of the fuselage to better accommodation the small landing gears that KSP only offers atm. It also has engine nacelles 2/3 out and the idea was to have engines and fuel there but with fuel it was to heavy. If I could get the fuel there CoG would have been easy to maintain because placing fuel in the now lowered wing lowers CoG relative to CoT and well causes nose downs at high altitudes. I had to get around that by having some of the heavier fuel tanks on top of the wing and widening the fuselage. Was not the original idea but it solved that problem.\n\nEarlier version of the craft also had a V shaped stabilizer but it proved inefficient and increased the risk of a spin when doing a role with hard banking so a more traditional stabilizer proved more efficient. Also the ruder control surfaces are at the center line of the pod in the nose to avoid them turning in the wrong direction when ailerons are applied to avoid a stall and spin.\n\nThe craft is only capable if a 100km LKO but its main objective is to lift a payload and its booster etc to orbit where it then will be boosted to the target.

My craft is the HS-210 Photon, a small, agile, and fairly efficient spaceplane. It was actually created at the request of someone on the Fusion Aerospace thread. The mission wasn\u0027t originally intended to be used for the K-Prize so there aren\u0027t any screenshots from the launch phase. I used no modded parts, docked with a station and landed back on the runway without refueling at any point. I did use part clipping on the intakes (there are 8 in total), but I didn\u0027t see a rule against it, and there is no doubt in my mind that, if they were placed differently, the plane would still work as intended.\n\nImgur album with the screenshots: [http://imgur.com/a/MsRT6#0](http://imgur.com/a/MsRT6#0)"}]}
