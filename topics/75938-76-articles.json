Visually they are correct, but if i had to guess id say it resizes the colliders. When VAB and SPH are not fully upgraded yet, if i put tracks on a vehicle sometimes it tells me i cannot launch because the vehicle is too big, but the sizes it tells me are just ridiculous like 8m, 10m and 56m, so one axis is way off. When i remove the tracks / wheels the axis size returns to a normal of lets say 5m. I guess its more of a tweakscale problem but maybe you can have a look if you can reproduce and circumvent it.

Yeah, there was always a file missing that it complained about in the beginning when loading the project for the first time. I thought I\u0027d taken care of that. oh, well. I\u0027ll look through it again.

It also requires that the result is only a single line of code, otherwise hold on to those braces. Anyway, I was just trying out suggestions made by the software. I\u0027m sure not all of them are supported fully by other software packages. One feature it keeps trying to get me to do is changing things like \u0022if (var1 != 0)\u0022 into a check against something it calls \u003Cem\u003E\u0022epsilon\u0022\u003C/em\u003E which, when compiling, complains that it has no freakin clue what \u003Cem\u003Eepsilon\u003C/em\u003E is and fails the build.

The Epsilon thing is possibly a performance thing - I\u0027ll look into it. I suspect it may be a moot point in my code, as most of those kind of checks are done once at start of flight, rather than every physics frame which might be cause for concern. Overall, the suggestions were good, though, particularly the missing the const declaration for the static strings. I\u0027ll get onto removing the unused textures right away, though I\u0027m aware there\u0027s more work setting up model nodes for the tracks that share track surface textures, of which there are now quite a few.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Thanks for the TS update for the gear - was a bit stuck with that until I learned a few bits setting up the Thundertank track. I have found that inverse scaling things in one axis to \u0027mirror\u0027 them is utterly futile when they have any kind of worky bits. Wings would be OK, wheels are not. Thankfully, I have a solution, much as it\u0027s horrendously difficult to set up :/ RBI stuff is now all updated. One of the models had an unused texture, the other was an export snafu due to the map not being marked as a normal map.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-16T01:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2015 01:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lo-fi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
