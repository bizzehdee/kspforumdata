It took me a while to figure out what was happening but the capsule itself is what is causing my issues. I am running a mod heavy install and will begin to test vanilla and add mods in one by one if necessary but was hoping someone else might have run in to this and might have an idea of what may be causing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I attempt to launch the rocket with the capsule on top my Vertical Velocity indicator along with my RCS and SAS status lights flicker and disappear continuously. When I just sit the capsule itself out on the launch pad the Throttle gauge blanks out. In both cases it does not show my staging, or the portraits of the Kerbals in the bottom right while in both instances there are 3 in the capsule (Verified with Crew Manifest). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots to show what I am referring to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket with VA Command Capsule on top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a64/jessyager/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/VACommandIssue2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VACommandIssue2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapsule (Rockets and fuel tanks added to verify the absence of those was not causing the issue here) with blank throttle gauge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i9.photobucket.com/albums/a64/jessyager/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/VACommandIssue.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022VACommandIssue.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running v.23 of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main Mods I am running excluding parts are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Crew Manifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-KAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Proceedural Fairings/Wings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbal Joint Reinforcement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Infernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Remote Tech 2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Interstellar Mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T12:04:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your debug log (press Alt\u002BF2) for errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sparker","CreatedById":79522,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-03T12:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is weird!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using this capsule in 0.23 and it works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom your mods list I don\u0027t use MechJeb, Remote Tech 2 and Interstellar mod.
