I\u0027d build a lander with huge amounts of fuel, haphazardly throw it at the Mun, null my orbital velocity and sink down straight towards the surface from really high up while running the engines regularly to make sure my speed remained nice and low, for safety. It seemed to be a much more simple and safe solution than trying to descend out of an orbit and worry about all that sideways velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeedless to say, all my attempts ran out of fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurns out gravity is a big old meanie. Every second you run your engines pointing down, to fight the speed at which you fall, gravity eats away some of your fuel. The slower and more careful you try to sink down, the more time you spend fighting gravity, and the more fuel is eaten away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you don\u0027t want your engines pointing down for an extended period of time. And you don\u0027t want to come in slow. And, most of all, you don\u0027t want to come in from high up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would recommend the following: before landing, first establish a circular orbit, and make it nice and low down. Really low down. As low as you can go without risking to plaster your spacecraft against a passing mountainside. For the Mun, this would be between 8 and 10 km altitude. It may seem scary low - and certainly look that way when you do it ingame - but it is safe. It\u0027s also a good idea to quicksave (F5) here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a second step, make a retrograde burn so that you are now on a suborbital trajectory. The trajectory should disappear into the Mun\u0027s surface a bit \u003Cem\u003Eafter\u003C/em\u003E the spot you want to land in. In other words, intentionally overshoot for now. Usually you want to land inside a general biome area anyway, so precision is not required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a third step, once you\u0027re confident you\u0027re going where you want to be going, start burning full force retrograde towards the horizon. You only have a small distance to go down, but a whole lot of horizontal velocity to kill. That\u0027s a good thing, because it means you\u0027re not trying to burn towards the ground, so gravity cannot steal your fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, at some point you will see your retrograde marker on the navball detach itself from the horizon, and drift into the blue area. This is a good indicator you are slowing down measurably and are making good headway towards landing. Usually, you want to \u003Cem\u003Efollow your retrograde marker\u003C/em\u003E wherever it goes, because that automatically makes you zero out all velocity (horizontal and vertical) eventually. If you feel you are overshooting your target, keep burning more towards the horizon (but keep an eye on the rate you are approaching the ground at); if you feel you are coming down too early or are falling too fast, burn more towards the Mun (but beware losing too much fuel to gravity).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, try and aim for coming to a full stop in \u0022midair\u0022 (midspace?) a few hundred meters above the surface. You can sink down safely from there without spending too much fuel. If you screwed up, hold F9 to quickload and try again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you run out of fuel using this approach, however, then piloting is not your issue, but rocket construction is. You will need to learn how to build more efficient rocket stages so you arrive in orbit around the Mun with more fuel to use. (note: this doesn\u0027t automatically mean bigger. Just more efficient.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-03T15:37:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2016 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CSE","CreatedById":145588,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T19:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have researched solar panels in your career, then you could try landing one or two probes first.
