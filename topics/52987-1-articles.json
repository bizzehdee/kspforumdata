It\u0027s just we don\u0027t have any UI to help us design a rocket that has the right thrust profile. With a lot of either trial and error, or calculation on the side, you can do everything as described in that wiki page: go straight up for a bit, then a controlled pitch over, then burn prograde all the way up to orbit. Static fins will keep you pointing prograde in the lower atmosphere; higher up you need control input, either gyros or vectoring thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke-49th","CreatedById":200569,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-20T04:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a really interesting thread.

(And I know at least for KSP that you are wasting fuel if you go higher speed..as the density of the air let the rocket accelerate less...kind of ISP...dont know how to explain that in english terms)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always feel like the ascent Pilot is wasting fuel. I only use it if I launch several rockets..like satellites for Remote Tech...or if Im really lazy^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also yes...I use FAR. But as Im always got problems before without it, Im still afraid start to turn in a low height \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E I just recognized that I need a bit less fuel and fairings/cones make more sense with it (at least that is how I understand it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk...this does not work.

But is not very efficient for fuel and not very precise. Also with tall rockets they start to going crazy when the gravity turn starts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like Mechjeb..but control anything manual is much more precise and safe and fuel saving. Except landing...im too stupid or not enough trained to do a good landing. But still it sometimes do crazy things to my rockets and dont know why.

Works great if you have a high TWR at low altitude; past about 10km or so, you don\u0027t want to go quite so fast. There\u0027s another setting, for maximum acceleration, which is useful to set if you have high TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving high TWR isn\u0027t optimal for mass; you can generally do better with more fuel and less engines.
