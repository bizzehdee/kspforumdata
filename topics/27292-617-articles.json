I sent a small scientific probe on a partial Grand Tour. Orbits (not fly-bys) of Mun, Minmus, Eve, Gilly, Duna, Ike, Dres. Landings at gilly and minmus. At each SoI the craft takes and transmits a wide-range of readings, before parking up in low Dres orbit with 6k dV still in the tank. Why didn\u0027t I keep going with that extra dV you might ask? Well, it was a single kOS script execution. I hit \u0027run X\u0027 on the launchpad and went to bed, woke up next morning to find that it had harvested some 3.5k sci for me overnight and taken around 3 hours for the execution (a good chunk of it being a 20minute ion burn towards the end). The reason it doesnt continue any further is that I havent written that part yet. The reason it actually makes orbit everywhere rather than doing fly-bys is that it actually does its own time-warps to optimal phase angles and takes a long in-game time to make the journey, its far easier to predictably implement in code than trying to teach it to slingshot and fly-by like a pro player.

Im reasonably confident that i can hands-off automate an ISRU/shuttle/orbital refinery setup if I can just figure a way around KAS ground-docking, I dont have the scripted accuracy to make hard-docks on a surface. The idea that i can type run, go to work and come back to find a thousand tons of fuel in orbit is too cool. It would mine, transfer to the shuttle, ascend, dock, transfer, undock, deorbit, spot-land, dock repeat. It can even keep an eye on how many more runs are needed and park up when stuff is full, or even take a secondary destination.
