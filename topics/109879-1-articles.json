Then it will be easier for GPU to handle and for you to texture it. I suggest cylinders with max 32 sides (usually 24 is good enough; check stock parts). Even cylinder with 12-16 sides look good when it has smooth shading applied. Personally I wouldn\u0027t go beyond 5k tris for a final model but it\u0027s just me."},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T18:14:55Z","Content":"Also I can see you\u0027ve made most of that model, or all of it, manifold.

You can save a lot of polys by having intersecting meshes."},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T10:34:05Z","Content":"To start i would simplify your lowpoly. What you have there is a sortof \u0022not really hipoly or lowpoly but something in between\u0022(if that makes any sence). What i mean is that those small details there are too sharp and angled to be captured well in a normalmap(hipoly use) and too angled(and small) to look good as lowpoly geometry(will look alised/jagged as you zoom out). another result of the complex geometry is that you are making the uvs stretched and difficult to work with. Some of the details however ( the recessed window area for example) work well as lowpoly geometry.\n\nSimple Lowpoly workflow tutorial (without using highpoly mesh):\n\nId suggest starting over by creating a new mesh on top of the old one. Create a cylinder. Pick something like 24-32 sides. Scale the top inward to match the shape and inset\u002B extrude the top and bottom part using as few operations as you can to define the silouette. delete the left side and add a mirror modifier(do not apply this until you are ready to export to unity).\n\nCreate two loops (with the ctrl\u002Br \u0022quickloop tool?\u0022. Sorry im mainly a 3dsmax user) located where the top and bottom of the window area start. Now use the vert slide tool (hit the G key twice) to match the curve\u002Boutline. Now inset the desired polys, dissolve the lower edge of the inset(so the outer edge becomes a triangle) \n\nnow use the cut tool and ctrl\u002Br to create the loops for the windows and inset them. Remembering to both reduce the outline amount a bit to avoid those really angular edges(not necessary but you can put them there if you want the extra detail)\n\nUse floating geometry for the (big) remaining pieces on top (and keep them low geo). For the final stage you can reduce the top part geometry by welding every other edge if you want(going from 32 to 16 sides) this will reduce clutter and remove unessecary geo. Dont worry about tris or ngons on flat areas and single faces that dont curve(have hard edges around them).\n\nFor unwrapping just attach all the floating/detached geometry(just the objects not the mesh geometry) or use a plugin like multiedit if you want to keep them seperate at this stage. Create seams and hard edges where there is an edge of \u003E 45 degrees or where there is a cylinder \u0022cap\u0022. do an unwrap and edit the results. align the uv edges planar to x/y as much as possible as it will look better with lower res maps. For the sides it should look like a trapezoid. Export the uv layout and import to ps/gimp.\n\nDetach any floating geometry temporarily and Render/bake out an ambient occlusion map for each piece while isolated(turn off rendering on all other pieces while rendering) since you are using blender(no aa or supersampling on maps) render out maps of 2048x2048 then combine them all together in gimp/ps and reduce to 1024x1024. Re-attach all floating geometry.\n\nFor painting id start by using materials. create a base material, pick the color that is mostly prominent(almost fully black. Never use completly black) now create a second material and give it a gray color. Select the parts of the mesh that should be gray and apply that material to those. repeat for the remaining colors you want. If there are small patches of color you want that do not correspond to the available geometry then leave those with the base material And paint that in later. Now render/bake out a color map of 1024x1024. Import to the gimp/ps project with the ao map and uv map.\n\nFor the actual painting id suggest finding some flat reference textures to simplify the work needed (cgtextures.com has a lot of them but you can also find some with google image search) use layers in photoshop or gimp and combine several images and filters to your liking. Remember to use your ao and color map in multiply mode here. You just want that little bit of variation.\n\nyou can also skip this step and just use the color map with the ao map as-is.\n\nnow just do a small bit of manual painting in gimp/ps and/or inside blender(any small labels or details etc). \n\nOptional.\n\nFinal touchup in blender. Delete all materials create 1 new mat. Apply the ao and color/textures painted in ps/gimp to 2 seperate texture layers add one more layer (call it edge wear etc.). Go to texture painting mode and make that layer active. Now experiment with different brushes and create some nice wear On the edges.\n\nthis is also optional as you can probably get away with just the ao\u002Bcolormap for an ok looking result.\n\nHopfully this helps"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:05:18Z","Content":"THAT looks a great deal like this model I have right here.\n\n![IEnJXeU.png](http://i.imgur.com/IEnJXeU.png)\n\nCloser examination also looks like your UV map matches the model\u0027s topology exactly.\n\nModel Source is NASA 3D Model Repository.

These models were designed for 3D printing, not as a game asset.\n\u003E It would actually take less effort to make your own version of this rather than trying to optimise it.\n\nI agree, for the complexity of a game and all the parts the video board has to render all at once, models have MUST be low in complexity. The art in game asset design is to use clever texturing techniques to create the illusion of complexity. For example: bump/normal mapping to give the illusion of ridges, panel seams, welds, and etc. The modeling part is easy once you know how the tools work. \n\nSmooth rendering makes faceted objects look smooth and round, so you don\u0027t need 20,000 tris to make an object look pretty. All you may need is a few cleverly moddeled meshes and some good painting techniques. \n\nIn my opinion modeling and painting is the easy part. Setting up the imported part in Unity and applying all the needed components, animations, emissives, emissive animation, rigging, lights, thrust transform, and etc, are the tedious and hard parts for me, then the tedium of config writing. Once that is all over, I get the pure bliss of satisfaction that I crashed my part into the Mun.\n\nI\u0027m happy KSP doesn\u0027t use Oxygen2 for it\u0027s modding."},{"CreatedByName":"Eskandare","CreatedById":62742,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:35:10Z","Content":"Actually... the explanation of how to model and paint sounds more complex then it really is. I learned to model in just a week by playing with the tools in Blender and seeing how each tool works. I made tons of practice models and learnd how to UV each mesh. The more practice you have using the tools the better and quicker you become at modeling and the more efficient you become at making a working piece of art in ksp. Blender may not be as intuitive or user friendly but it is a very powerfuL cad engine I still haven\u0027t learned to unlock it\u0027s full potential. \n\nInstead of trying to make a full command pod, where you\u0027ll want to make an IVA model. Try starting with something simple like a fuel tank. A few cylinder meshes, or one if you chose, then add a UV. You\u0027ll start to get an idea of how the tools work. Read up on how to do certain things on the blender wiki. The blender forums have a plethora of information too. Study the geometry of real life objects. Don\u0027t just look at it, actually study how each shape fits together and try to replicate that shape in Blender.\n\nJust as a note, the model there you which you pulled off of NASA\u0027s website won\u0027t fly in Unity. Just the collision mesh alone is going to be a problem for you, and it may not want to compile into a \\*.mu file. I\u0027ll admit I\u0027ve torn apart meshes from NASA, but to study the shapes to make my own game compatible mesh.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I will not make it for you, so please don\u0027t even think to ask.
