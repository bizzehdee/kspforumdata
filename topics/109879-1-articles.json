Then it will be easier for GPU to handle and for you to texture it. I suggest cylinders with max 32 sides (usually 24 is good enough; check stock parts). Even cylinder with 12-16 sides look good when it has smooth shading applied. Personally I wouldn\u0027t go beyond 5k tris for a final model but it\u0027s just me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T18:14:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso I can see you\u0027ve made most of that model, or all of it, manifold.

What you have there is a sortof \u0022not really hipoly or lowpoly but something in between\u0022(if that makes any sence). What i mean is that those small details there are too sharp and angled to be captured well in a normalmap(hipoly use) and too angled(and small) to look good as lowpoly geometry(will look alised/jagged as you zoom out). another result of the complex geometry is that you are making the uvs stretched and difficult to work with. Some of the details however ( the recessed window area for example) work well as lowpoly geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimple Lowpoly workflow tutorial (without using highpoly mesh):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EId suggest starting over by creating a new mesh on top of the old one. Create a cylinder. Pick something like 24-32 sides. Scale the top inward to match the shape and inset\u002B extrude the top and bottom part using as few operations as you can to define the silouette. delete the left side and add a mirror modifier(do not apply this until you are ready to export to unity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECreate two loops (with the ctrl\u002Br \u0022quickloop tool?\u0022. Sorry im mainly a 3dsmax user) located where the top and bottom of the window area start. Now use the vert slide tool (hit the G key twice) to match the curve\u002Boutline. Now inset the desired polys, dissolve the lower edge of the inset(so the outer edge becomes a triangle) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow use the cut tool and ctrl\u002Br to create the loops for the windows and inset them. Remembering to both reduce the outline amount a bit to avoid those really angular edges(not necessary but you can put them there if you want the extra detail)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse floating geometry for the (big) remaining pieces on top (and keep them low geo). For the final stage you can reduce the top part geometry by welding every other edge if you want(going from 32 to 16 sides) this will reduce clutter and remove unessecary geo. Dont worry about tris or ngons on flat areas and single faces that dont curve(have hard edges around them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor unwrapping just attach all the floating/detached geometry(just the objects not the mesh geometry) or use a plugin like multiedit if you want to keep them seperate at this stage. Create seams and hard edges where there is an edge of \u0026gt; 45 degrees or where there is a cylinder \u0022cap\u0022. do an unwrap and edit the results. align the uv edges planar to x/y as much as possible as it will look better with lower res maps. For the sides it should look like a trapezoid. Export the uv layout and import to ps/gimp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDetach any floating geometry temporarily and Render/bake out an ambient occlusion map for each piece while isolated(turn off rendering on all other pieces while rendering) since you are using blender(no aa or supersampling on maps) render out maps of 2048x2048 then combine them all together in gimp/ps and reduce to 1024x1024. Re-attach all floating geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor painting id start by using materials. create a base material, pick the color that is mostly prominent(almost fully black. Never use completly black) now create a second material and give it a gray color. Select the parts of the mesh that should be gray and apply that material to those. repeat for the remaining colors you want. If there are small patches of color you want that do not correspond to the available geometry then leave those with the base material And paint that in later. Now render/bake out a color map of 1024x1024. Import to the gimp/ps project with the ao map and uv map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the actual painting id suggest finding some flat reference textures to simplify the work needed (cgtextures.com has a lot of them but you can also find some with google image search) use layers in photoshop or gimp and combine several images and filters to your liking. Remember to use your ao and color map in multiply mode here. You just want that little bit of variation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can also skip this step and just use the color map with the ao map as-is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow just do a small bit of manual painting in gimp/ps and/or inside blender(any small labels or details etc). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOptional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal touchup in blender. Delete all materials create 1 new mat. Apply the ao and color/textures painted in ps/gimp to 2 seperate texture layers add one more layer (call it edge wear etc.). Go to texture painting mode and make that layer active. Now experiment with different brushes and create some nice wear On the edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is also optional as you can probably get away with just the ao\u002Bcolormap for an ok looking result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopfully this helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"noonespecial","CreatedById":81942,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETHAT looks a great deal like this model I have right here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/IEnJXeU.png\u0022 alt=\u0022IEnJXeU.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloser examination also looks like your UV map matches the model\u0027s topology exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModel Source is NASA 3D Model Repository. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/orion-capsule\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tristonwilson12","CreatedById":136353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eit is from there i forgot to specify... im sorry for the confusion\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo remind us again how you want to make mods?
