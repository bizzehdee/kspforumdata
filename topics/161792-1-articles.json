Having it there makes it universal across all save games, even though Subassemblies are per-save.\u00A0 The end result is you have categories in a save game that has no subassemblies in it because those categories are are for a different save game.\u00A0 It\u0027s also less convenient for backup purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is to move the file to saves\\[SaveGameName]\\Subassemblies.\u00A0 This has multiple benefits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFor players using the standard per-save subassemblies, the categories will also be per-save.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCategories would no longer exist for subassemblies from a different save game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMoving a game from one installation to another, or simply making a backup of a game will no longer involve hunting down this file.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlayers (including me) who prefer their subassemblies and craft files to exist across all games can still use symlinks (directory junctions).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSymlink users no longer have to symlink this file separately, they only have to symlink the Subassemblies folder, which they would have done anyway.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just makes no sense to have it where it is in any use case, at least from a player\u0027s perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-08T16:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs somebody who never found the part filters menu to be particularly intuitive, I never venture there much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find that sub-assemblies being hidden in there breaks the workflow, so yeah, I\u0027d support this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe save-specific stuff just adds more weight to your argument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
