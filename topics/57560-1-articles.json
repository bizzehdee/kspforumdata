Example: I want to be able to create a spacecraft named \u0022Cassini\u0022, and have a probe detach called \u0022Huygens\u0022. Currently the detached probes simply copy the name of the parent spacecraft with \u0022probe\u0022 tacked on to the end (as if they\u0027re sort of glorified debris, which I guess is essentially how the game views them). This is only marginally useful since often you\u0027ll have more than one probe and they\u0027ll all end up with the same name and a lander or rover shouldn\u0027t be called \u0022probes\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest that the mechanic to implement this would be to have a name attached to each pod/probe core with defaults based on the parent spacecraft\u0027s name (similar to how it works currently). This would also allow the probes to have sequential names such as Parent Spacecraft Probe 1 and Parent Spacecraft Probe 2 (if you wanted to be really fancy you could try to detect what kind of vehicle it is, if it has wheels it\u0027s a rover, if it has landing legs it\u0027s a lander, if it\u0027s neither of those but it\u0027s crewed it\u0027s a shuttle or something). The names should be editable within the VAB/SPH as well as being able to change them in flight. Presumably you\u0027d have to have some way of figuring out which pod or probe core gets the roll of the parent spacecraft, and thus the primary name, when it isn\u0027t the root component (when it is the root the choice is obvious). Two reasonable choices are the pod/core which is highest (the downside being forward-placed probes would now be the parent) or the pod/core which is placed first (the downside being aft-placed rovers become the parent. Another option, though more fiddly and probably not worth doing, would be to provide a hierarchy of precedence (crew capsules take precedence over non-crewed probes, for example). But, of course, these defaults can be overridden by the user specifying which pod gets which name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second suggestion to this would be to enable a parent spacecraft to have one name at launch and, after separation, each individual probe gets a different name. For example you could launch a spacecraft called \u0022Cassini/Huygens\u0022 and then have \u0022Huygens detach\u0022 and do its thing while \u0022Cassini\u0022 goes off and does another. In other words they have one name while combined and different ones when separated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"federicoaa","CreatedById":94879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T06:50:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, if you dock and undock two ships, the two ships become one and therefore have the same name, after undocking, the second ship will be renamed as first ship lander/probe, which is quite bad if you are using remotetech\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dazhat","CreatedById":59413,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T07:20:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is more complex than it sounds because when ships dock, the game sees them both as a single ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T08:03:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022federicoaa\u0022 data-cite=\u0022federicoaa\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, if you dock and undock two ships, the two ships become one and therefore have the same name, after undocking, the second ship will be renamed as first ship lander/probe, which is quite bad if you are using remotetech\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the game docks two ships, it makes them one.
