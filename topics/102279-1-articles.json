UUGGHH), and how in English, no letter seems to have a single sound.\n\nSo I made a language that is based on English, Spanish. Latin (by extension), Greek (by extension), and German (noun-joining).\n\nI haven\u0027t made a name for it yet, but I\u0027ll take requests.\n\n[Link to the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DuSU45y_eGSUJ8oAg7Dk-UGeJLgJN0E9zCsXkTbkG4M/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T00:25:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 12:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bigyihsuan**"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T21:30:47Z","Content":"How about Gerenganlateek?"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T21:38:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How about Gerenganlateek?\n\nHmm. Hard to say (both literally and figuratively).\n\nHere\u0027s some rules that I\u0027ve made so far:\n\n- 2 vowels next to each other makes it sound like English long vowel\n- aa =lake, ee = knee, ii = ice, oo = oboe, uu = utility\n- All letters pronounced; no silent letters\n- Apostrophe in between 2 vowels means the vowels are pronounced separately\n- Combine nouns to make more words. If a word has more than 3 base words, it has a shortened form that uses the first and last three letters of the long form.\n\nHere\u0027s an example of that last bullet:\n\ngranpreesteraarignee\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2agwa (gragwa)\n\ngran: large, big\n\nprees: Pressure\n\ntera: earth\n\naar: air\n\nignee: fire\n\nagwa: water\n\nAll totaled:\n\nLarge pressured earth with air and fire water.

Because then you have to make sure you\u0027re talking about/to a female/male based on the situation.\n\nIt\u0027s not like in Spanish, where every noun has a gender.\n\nWhatever has a gender is preceded by a gender pronoun. For example, my monstrosity word of \u0022volcano\u0022 is gender neutral. So, you place a \u0022ne\u0022 to specify that it is a neutral gendered noun.\n\nAnother example is with people. If it\u0027s a guy, precede with \u0022he\u0022. If it\u0027s a girl, use a \u0022she\u0022.\n\nIt it doesn\u0027t fit into the categories of male or female, then you use \u0022ne\u0022, for either keeping the gender hidden (like in 2nd-person stories with the word \u0022you\u0022), it already is gender neutral, and/or the noun is generalized, like calling a generic dog a poodle. You don\u0027t know the specific gender of a sub-species, or an entire species for that matter.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why not use umlauts and accent marks? Then you can have letters make different sounds, but they have a distinction.\n\u003E Also, the thorn.\n\nIf you look on the doc, it says that the method of writing is using the Latin alphabet with standard English punctuation, with no accents, special punctuation symbols, etc.\n\nI specifically picked the Latin alphabet because any keyboard that has Latin letters on it can use it. And because it\u0027s easier to type. Though maybe I\u0027ll add that in, possibly as an alternative way of writing the double vowels.\n\nAnd I don\u0027t think there\u0027s an easy way of typing thorn without using an alt-number code."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T00:28:36Z","Content":"That\u0027s why I asked \u0022why not?\u0022.\n\nMaybe have an adapted digital version and a separate written version?

If you wish to go this route, you need to define things lest you run into its problems of incredible ambiguity when things become complex.\n\nAs far as some of the other things, what sort of goals are you going for? Just fewer irregulars, fun, or some other goal? You lack a lot of tenses (like progressives, for instance) that are common (but unneeded, Esperanto has them but hardly uses them, for instance).\n\nI shall be curious to hear more about how this progresses.\n\n*\\*This is not mean to violate any rule about posting in code or other languages to exclude forum members.
