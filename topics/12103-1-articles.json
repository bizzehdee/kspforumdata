The ship groaned, thankful to be released from the force of thrust. Aside from the life support, the only sound in the little room was the nervous breathing of Beck, the first Kerbal to orbit the Mun. He was afraid to look at his instrumentation. A slight mistake had taken him on an unplanned course, and he was not sure if he had enough fuel to push his perigee into the atmosphere. A few rolls of ductape and notebooks filled with frantic calculations and scribbles kept him company as they bounced between the walls. His eyes were fixed on one of the lights above the porthole, reminiscing to his childhood, pushed by fear to delay the inevitable as far as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course, he knew he was being silly. It would be best to find his fate out now, and prepare accordingly, but he had time. Approximately six hours, in fact. Assuming the best happens. He blinked, and felt the pain of staring into a bright light. He shifted his view below, and stared at the currently black porthole. His vision slowly returned, and he looked into the sea of stars years away. It dawned on him that he could spend the rest of his life staring at them, or at Kerbin through this little window outside. It felt strange, being so close to a certain end, knowing the irrelavent little chemical reaction that he was could end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Beck found it curious, how his little pod didn\\\u0027t seem to be in a crisis at all. It was a bright as on launch day, and the noise of the life support comforted him in an odd way. There were no alarms, no red lights. The ship didn\\\u0027t realize that the safety of the living, organic being it was meant to harbor depended on a few green numbers on a little screen. It didn\\\u0027t see that he would slowly starve to death, and be driven mad by the instincts designed to keep him alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis eyes started to wander.
