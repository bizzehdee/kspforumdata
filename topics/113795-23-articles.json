It reminds me of the older Russian MIGs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027m a sucker for those old MiGs. Those old Soviet planes always seem to be one part rugged simplicity, one part elegant efficiency, and one part borderline insanity.

You\u0027re using them to avoid stall, but all they\u0027re really doing is acting as stabilizers, considering I don\u0027t think FAR actually models flow that way (yet?). I think more control and stability can be attained via ventral fins, however, considering you\u0027re losing lateral stability during pitch stall, which is probably caused by occlusion of your vertical stabilizer/rudder. I\u0027ll have to mess with it later and see if I can net some benefit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood points about the stall. I also wanted to improve stability in level flight and on the ground, but it\u0027s entirely possible that the new tailplane is the actual cause of improvement and I can delete the dorsal fins. Actually, a large number of the design elements of the plane are down to my attempts to make it easier to land. Drooping nose, wide landing gear and hence wing geometry... I can\u0027t complain, because the alterations have always resulted in a better plane, but I do hope I work out how to land it eventually...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
