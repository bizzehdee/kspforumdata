Its great to see people using the mod. I have a few suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) You kept all engines enabled for boostback. This makes for the mod\u00A0to reduce thrust enough to delicately reduce the\u00A0minimum target error when it gets small since checks are only done 10 times/sec. Use\u00A0fewer engines for boostback, re-entry and landing burn as the booster is much lighter and is super-sensitive to thrust (I set up an action group to toggle nines). Your video didn\u0027t show what the final target error was at the end of boostback. Take a took at this, it\u0027d be good to see how low it gets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) You were quite\u00A0ambitious with a boostback burn so far away from the launchpad. The re-entry burn is nearly horizontal. I would expect the re-entry burn to be 20 degrees off vertical max for good accuracy. Because the trajectory is very horizontal prediction of aerodynamic drag makes the landing spot very prone to error (you can see that if the aero-drag calculation is wrong with\u00A0a vertical trajectory then the prediction error on the ground won\u0027t change much). The\u00A0landing was 126km off target was is embarrassingly bad though I\u00A0couldn\u0027t tell if this was an overshoot or undershoot. It is\u00A0possible to get the landing error to a few metres.\u00A0Staying a bit closer when doing boostback will make it easier for the mod to\u00A0be accurate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) Again because of the large number of engines with high thrust and landing burn thrust is applied very late (even though landing burn is enabled many seconds earlier thrust is not applied). With fewer engines the landing burn will span over more time and will work more accurately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(4) Raising the \u0022touchdown margin\u0022 in the advanced tab by perhaps by 30-40m will help, even if you do nothing else. It looked like the booster hit the ground at 80-90 m/s and decelerating at perhaps 40m/s/s\u00A0so it needed just\u00A02 extra seconds of deceleration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn (4) I\u0027m\u00A0working on making the landing burn more accurate for high thrust rockets. I\u0027ve learnt some more things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Upping the rate of thrust calculation estimate from 10 per sec, to the maximum physics rate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The vessel altitude given from the probe corer rather\u00A0the origin of the booster of the CoG. This meant some of my calculations were off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Upping the gain of the throttle. So the throttle will re-active more rapidly of the booster is travelling too fast. The gain can\u0027t be too high otherwise the throttle will oscillate around the required amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first change was in v1.1.0. The next changes are coming soon along with a full tutorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you get it working a bit better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Productions","CreatedById":208620,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-16T14:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk sure.

Sometimes, the booster will be upside-down at 3km from water. So the booster speeds up if it flips. Here\u0027s a diagram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

The mod shouldn\u0027t be causing the booster to flip. If you toggle \u0022Debug\u0022 in the \u0022Advanced Tab\u0022 you will then see a green line which is the desired orientation of the rocket pointing in the direction of the front of the rocket, so it should be pointing upwards. It\u0027ll be very useful to know if this is still pointing up, if so then somehow the aerodynamics of the booster has flipped it, not BoosterGuidance, but possibly BoosterGuidance has made its steering unstable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I suggest, enable \u0022Debug\u0022, try setting up the steering gains to far left so it won\u0027t try to steer at all, and seeing if it still flips. Also, at which stage does it flip, in re-entry burn? (I have seen a\u00A0rocket start to turn with thrust vectoring from the main engine, the main engine cuts and then it doesn\u0027t have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or reaction control wheels to stop the turn, this could be happening - more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters\u00A0or reaction control wheels, and less steering gain in re-entry burn would help this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal Productions","CreatedById":208620,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-31T12:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt happens after the re-entry burn. And I tried to increase the torque of the booster guidance unit. Before that, I noticed that the retrograde is locked in 180 degrees, making it flip, so I realized that the mod goals for retrograde, or maybe it was me who did it. I just forgot what caused it, but I\u0027ll try it soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raqnick","CreatedById":207140,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-01T19:28:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0This mod is doesnt\u00A0work.Stage just hit the ground\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-02T06:48:21Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2021 06:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Raqnick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
