Altering the \u0022Gameseed\u0022 value under ResourceScenario in persistent.sfs rerolled the entire system\u0027s resource distribution.

I\u0027m using Kerbalism and scansat, and trying to set up a fuel refinery on the Mun (I\u0027d use Minmus, but I despise super low gravity worlds, they make bases and rovers just.. unfun).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nProblem is, with Kerbalism if you don\u0027t have access to water you\u0027re basically SOL.. and scansat is telling me that there is no water anywhere near the poles where I\u0027d like to set up shop (permanent sunlight).
