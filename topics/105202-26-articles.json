Thereby bypassed Recycling and Hydroponics. I got a very unstable game with lots of USI-LS named NREs in the logs and frequent lockups at scene changes. I had trouble accepting it as possible to be really due to this mod due to a long record of trust worthy performance from all RoverDude products! I tried uninstalling other mods but the problem did not go away. Eventually, I realised a possibly unusual career development path had been followed and so proceeded to learn both early tree techs which open the Nom-O-Matic units. \n\n So far this appears to have fixed the problem! \n\n If this information helps anyone else then good. Otherwise, until someone can reproduce (sorry, my bad, I did not save a useful log file) it is not a \u0022bug\u0022 but something that perhaps warrants investigation. Or maybe CTT could be adjusted to make the path I followed unavailable (i.e. add a requires all in place of requires any?)\n\n***Edit: One day later and I am not so sure that this is not perhaps a case of general out of memory issues.***\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T11:53:05Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 11:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kaa253**\n  \nMore information at hand"},{"CreatedByName":"cipherpunks","CreatedById":114858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T15:05:40Z","Content":"Not directly related, but thought You might know: when my ModuleResourceConverter overheats, and the reading in menu says that efficiency is not 100% anymore, Fusebox still says 100% (the part produces ElectricCharge). Is this known issue?\n\nFor the record, the part produces 100 of resource and only has place for 100% of input resource per tick, and 100 of output resource per tick (that is, literally 100, and literally 100 per tick). I have DumpExcess = true (unsure what it does) but I do not have FillAmount (also unsure what it does)\n\nI got myself a stopwatch and timed it by hand, and it turned out that it\u0027s just Fusebox deficiency - in fact, resource-wise, ISRU works good.

Whenever they run out of the time they will allow themeselves to be hungry, they sit down and put themselves on stasis (with 0 consumption) for an indeterminate amount of time, programming the Pod to \u0022wake\u0022 them up as soon as supplies are there.\n\nI think it fits better the idea of life support.
