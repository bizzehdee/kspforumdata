Thereby bypassed Recycling and Hydroponics. I got a very unstable game with lots of USI-LS named NREs in the logs and frequent lockups at scene changes. I had trouble accepting it as possible to be really due to this mod due to a long record of trust worthy performance from all RoverDude products! I tried uninstalling other mods but the problem did not go away. Eventually, I realised a possibly unusual career development path had been followed and so proceeded to learn both early tree techs which open the Nom-O-Matic units. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So far this appears to have fixed the problem! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E If this information helps anyone else then good. Otherwise, until someone can reproduce (sorry, my bad, I did not save a useful log file) it is not a \u0022bug\u0022 but something that perhaps warrants investigation.
