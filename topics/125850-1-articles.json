Because it always knew when we were going to walk out a door and which door, we named the cat Radar. This was about two months ago. Earlier this week, we noticed that his back legs were not working correctly. My parents took him to the vet two days ago, where he was kept overnight to run tests. Yesterday, the vet called my mom and told her that Radar\u0026#39;s condition had worsened (his legs had stiffened) and that they found a Tumor on his spine. This was an irreversible condition so my parents chose to have Radar put down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRadar, I miss your happy meow whenever I left the house to go somewhere. ;.;\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T21:30:02Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sampa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T21:28:21Z","Content":"\nThat sucks I\u0026#39;m sorry to hear that.
