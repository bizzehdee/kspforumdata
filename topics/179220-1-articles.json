out the tip. The reason to make the end blunt is that in an operating aerospike engine, you get gas recirculation within the rarefied space below the blunt end, which causes those gases to act as a virtual spike extender. So a blunt-tipped nozzle (also called a plug nozzle) is really essentially just as efficient as heavier, longer spike.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
