There are specific requirements that your game, or any given patch for it, has to pass in order to be allowed a console release, but they have very little to do with how playable the game is. You can have a very rough, very WIP game, so long as certain requirements are met. You can\u0027t hard-lock the console, the game has to keep responding to the controller, you have to be able to get to relevant menus, certain accessibility requirements must be met, and I think there are some limits on how often it crashes, but I\u0027m not even sure about that. You just have to consistently make it from startup to the main menu without crashing. You\u0027ll note that none of it even indirectly says, \u0022Should be able to play the game.\u0022 The state that the KSP2 early access is in would probably pass console review. Yeah, there are severe bugs with rockets deconstructing, being unable to launch until you restart the game, and other corruption of the game state, but you can still get into the escape menu from anywhere, and the game doesn\u0027t lock up. As far as the console certification goes, that\u0027s good to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould it make sense to release the game on consoles in this state? No. The initial release was followed up by two patches. It\u0027d be an absolute pain to try to get these through the cert along with everything else that the Intercept was doing. But even if the Intercept had some spare time to get patch 2 out for the consoles, and assuming it worked at least as well as the PC version, requiring no further patching, while the Sony and MS would technically allow it, I don\u0027t think the player base would accept it. I mean, we see how poorly it\u0027s going on the PC side. And it\u0027s bound to be a lot worse for consoles, where, yeah, the console gamers are just far more used to playing finished games. Or at least, much closer to being finished.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-10T14:04:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEntropy will have taken everything you know or love long before this game gets a console release but fear not!

Guess what didn\u0027t happen? There was no update. No biggie, after all game devs get delayed all the time. Here\u0027s the thing; not only was there no update, there was no delay announcement, no new ETA, noo devellopment update. NOTHING. It\u0027s been over a YEAR since KSP teams communicated publicly about the updates in any fashion. In fact, they won\u0027t even answer questions when interrogated directly through social media, the forums, or even through their customer service lines. Let me insist;\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eover an entire year of complete radio silence, even when the latest possible release date completley passed.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPrivate Division (yes, private division, not squad)\u00A0 has set a precedent that has completley destroyed my faith in them. They have shown that they place no value in the console community. As such, I don\u0027t expect too see KSP 2 on console for at least another few years. I half expect the console version to release well after the 1.0 release, though thats just my expectation. Even when it does release, it very well might be lackluster, like when KSP 2 EA first launched on PC. To say the least, I\u0027m pessimistic. This is normally something I avoid, but with how KSP on console has been treated, who could blame me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is one element to this that inspires a little bit of hope, however. One of the main reasons that KSP EE has been abandoned is due to the studio history of the project. Enhanced Edition was not made by Squad, rather it was develloped by BlitWorks. They ported the game to both supprted console generations, and they were respnsible for keeping the game\u00A0 up to date. However, their contract was terminated before they got to finish the game. They were let go once they had gotten it up to 1.10, and before all of the game-breaking issues had been patched. This was in september 2021. At that moment, PD announced their intentions to update EE to 1.12, along with announcing that they were hiring new internal positions to help this effort. \u003Cb\u003EPlease note how we are still on 1.10, and many players still have their games destroyed by bugs. It is now May of 2023, and PD \u0022started work\u0022 in SEPTEMBER OF \u003Cu\u003E2021\u003C/u\u003E!\u00A0\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis can be a good sign for KSP 2, simply because \u003Cem\u003Eunless something goes horribly, horribly wrong\u003C/em\u003E (like what happened with KSP EE), then it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emight\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebe fine. After all, KSP 2 on console is being develloped by the same studio that\u0027s making the PC version, Intercept Games. So, for the situation to go as poorly as it did with KSP EE, something would have to go truely, horribly, catastrophically wrong.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to have hope for KSP 2.
