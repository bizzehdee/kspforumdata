I\u0027ve seen a few people posting about how to stop it happening so I thought I\u0027d show you how I do it without the need for docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd some fuel and then an adapter. Add your nuke engines next, decouplers under those and then an inverted adapter. For my example pictures I\u0027ve used a quad adapter but the same principal applies for any of them. You can also just use thin tanks with engines and then the adapter, as long as the tanks originate from an adapter so the spacing between them is the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to add some mini girders around the top of your adapter. Then you add the same number under the adapter but in the same vertical plane. Connect them with struts and you\u0027re nearly done. The last thing to do is to rotate the engines using shift so that the seams of the fairings face outwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe number of girders and struts you use should be determined by the amount of radial tanks or engines you have underneath. You should use the same number and place them in the gaps between the tanks. So if you have 4 tanks under the nuke stage then use 4 girders/struts. If you have 8 then use 8 etc. The minimum for this to work is normally only 2, which is a lot less mass and fewer parts than the docking port method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some pictures of what I mean and a simple test rocket using this method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/884120199324945306/A1C759851BD9CECEB14086A7A6AF3052A81327A1/\u0022 alt=\u0022A1C759851BD9CECEB14086A7A6AF3052A81327A1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/884120199324948559/4F45F91A2A077FBF78392AD9EEFD52BBE5C15E18/\u0022 alt=\u00224F45F91A2A077FBF78392AD9EEFD52BBE5C15E18\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/884120199324950946/EC95FAE3EE2650AB2A85D93D565B8C12B919FDA1/\u0022 alt=\u0022EC95FAE3EE2650AB2A85D93D565B8C12B919FDA1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/884120199324953577/28E4CE3D484D6141A63A24A8801914E95D8AF58B/\u0022 alt=\u002228E4CE3D484D6141A63A24A8801914E95D8AF58B\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this will help a few people from getting too frustrated and actually get to the far away places in the Kerbol solar system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy flying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T11:09:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not really ideal.
