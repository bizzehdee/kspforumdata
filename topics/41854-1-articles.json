This evening I completed my second successful Mun landing with my newly designed rocket. Although like the true newbie I am I placed an RCS thruster on top of my capsule\u0027s hatch and thus my poor Kerbals traveled all that way just to look through the windows! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suffer from severe bandwidth restrictions (long story - live in the middle of nowhere and can\u0027t get regular broadband) so I can\u0027t watch Youtube tutorials so I\u0027ve signed up here to bask in your superior knowledge. I\u0027m looking to learn more about docking and building Mun bases and space stations. Also, I hear there\u0027s this thing called \u0022maths\u0022 (I believe American Kerbals may refer to it as \u0022math\u0022) that can be applied to flight plans, particularly useful when you want to reach another planet without overshooting and ending up in deep space. So if anyone could point me in the directions of threads that cover these topics adequately for someone who is essentially a complete beginner I\u0027d really appreciate it.
