You can see the tower I mean in the red box. Behind the rocket in the blue box is another \u0022tower\u0022 structure that I wish was a separate model. If it were separate, I can make the red box tower look animated with movie magic. I can\u0027t make it look natural if the tower in the blue box is moving at the same time with the real tower though.
