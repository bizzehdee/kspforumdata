The thermal rockets need to be connected to their heat source, you can\u0027t easily get access to the heat of your reactor core on a different part of your spaceship, so that\u0027s why I have those direct attachment rules there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plasma engines though, they\u0027re just powered by electricity. You can run some nice chunky wires over to your electric generator and it no longer matters where you put the engine. If you have multiple generators, why not plugin them all in to your plasma engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plasma engines will constantly recalculate their supply too, so you could build a large spaceship with a set of forward and reverse engines if you wanted, turn off the engines at the back and the ones at the front would get all the power, etc etc. There are loads of neat things you could do with this, I\u0027m sure.

The vacuum also has some energy associated with it and therefore some mass associated with that energy, so the quantum vacuum plasma thruster, instead of carrying a plasma propellant, it treats the quantum vacuum itself as a plasma and exerts forces against it in order to propel the spacecraft. A spacecraft with this type of engine doesn\u0027t need any internal propellant, all it needs is some fuel to power a large electric generator because the amount of thrust you get from doing this is really tiny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a speculative concept and it remains to be seen how well it works in reality and whether it is practical as a propulsion system but it\u0027s definitely an interesting theoretical concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Railgunner2160\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Railgunner2160\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo any chance we\u0027ll see ZZZ\u0027s new collapsible warp ring in the next official release???\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had chance to look at the model myself yet, I will try and do this sometime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NeoAcario\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBug or Feature?
