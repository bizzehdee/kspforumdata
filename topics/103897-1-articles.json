So far the design has stayed pretty constant with just 2 C6-X rocket motors on top of the wing near the body. The first launch used one engine on the back and that didn\u0027t turn out well, my grandfather wanted to try out putting them below the wings too and that didn\u0027t work, and I once tried four motors but something went wrong and only 3 fired. I feel like I\u0027m ready to put together a custom aircraft with a wingspan \u0026gt;1m to launch by rocket. The only problem is I have no idea where to start. I want something with a good glide ratio and that\u0027s all I know at this point. I\u0027ve heard that on real planes that dihedral makes the plane more stable and putting wings on top of the body makes it less stable. I\u0027d also like the design to be able to incorporate a small and light auction camera. Maybe have it able to add electronics like servos later on so I could guide it while it was gliding. I\u0027m not sure what kind of form factor these would require so I came to the best place I knew of for help. For construction I\u0027d like it to be simple stuff like light wood and foam board. I do have access to a small 3D printer at my local library.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
