After getting the habitation pod and ship parking module docked, I decided I wanted a challenge, and that I wanted to boost the orbit in to a higher, inclined orbit. You\u0027d think that little voice of self preservation in my head might have chimed in at this point, but apparently Jeb had fed it some snacks, and it was quiet. So I sent up a new fuel module consisting of a Jumbo tank and some RCS tanks and thrusters, and docked it to the station. After that I used the station\u0027s propulsion module to slowly boost the orbit and inclination over several burns to ~27 degrees inclined, 350km circular-ish. I intend to trim that a bit more, still have plenty of propellant left in the station, but for now it\u0027s good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here is the question, I hadn\u0027t given much thought to this until now (of course), when I\u0027m ready to actually crew the nearly completed station, I have no idea how to launch in to the same orbital plane as the station. When it was equatorial it was easy, but now I am at a loss. I understand it is much preferred I launch straight to the correct inclination as changing on orbit is dV-intensive, and I can understand why. I even (think I) understand the concept of a launch azimuth, but it seems that I need to wait until one of the nodes of the station\u0027s orbit is over KSC when I launch, is that correct?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming that is correct, is there any way to predict when that will happen? Anything better than just timewarping until it happens? I am trying to do stuff by the book-ish, and calculate launch windows and such for these sort of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in summary, questions are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If I want to reach an inclined orbit, it is always better to launch straight in to it at the right time then try to match it from orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If I wanted to reach a 27 degree orbit, my launch azimuth should be 63 degrees instead of the \u0027typical\u0027 90 degrees?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I also need to launch when the ascending node of the station is over KSC to end up on a coplanar orbit with the station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3a. Is this a way to calculate that properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3b. If I launched when the \u003Cem\u003Edescending\u003C/em\u003E node was overhead, would I be able to just launch with an azimuth of 117 degrees?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-09T01:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002212/09/2013 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by photogineer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved the space station screenshot because the link keeps breaking\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tank Buddy","CreatedById":69635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T23:39:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanted to have the same inclination by launch, you would have to launch at the ascending or descending node.

Size of the orbit determines the period, and you compare the period with the rotation time of kerbin (6 hrs). The time difference is easily translated in longitude difference (with 6 hrs rotation time, 1\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 longitude = 1 min). That means you will find the crossings (nodes) coming at different longitudes. You have to wait for a launch window, when (generally every number N of orbits) either of the two nodes longitude will return to match with KSC longitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a perfect orbital insertion, the longitude of the node should be a bit east of KSC: while your rocket rises to the orbital altitude, it still is initially tied to Kerbin\u0027s rotation and therefore it will move a bit to the east in relation to the orbital path (perfect calculation would require timing your ascent and taking in account altitude and Kerbin\u0027s radius).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch at 63\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 azimuth on the ascending node, 117\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 azimuth on the descending node. However, as your rocket moves in latitude (northern than KSC in the first case, southern in the second) it will also continue to move to the east with the same initial speed of KSC, and that speed is greater than the speed of the ground at higher latitudes. This means you see the rocket drifting east (due to Coriolis effect) in relation to Kerbin\u0027s frame of reference, but that does not effect the orbital frame of reference. Heading has to be adjusted as it changes along the orbital path (as a sine wave, from 63\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude, to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 27\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude north, then 117\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 latitude descending, then 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at 27\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 south).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T18:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure, but does the node actually exist if you\u0027re sitting on the pad waiting to launch?

In orbital mechanics, the two planes are the ones containing orbits or a reference frame. In this case, one plane is tied to kerbin\u0027s equator (equatorial plane) the other the orbit of the station. Thence, yes, we have ascending and descending nodes; they have nothing to do with the rocket, the launchpad or else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the nodes (either of them) are the points to match for a launch. I did not even consider previously that we don\u0027t need to wait for the station to actually occupy one of the nodes or be in any specific position along its orbit. Though, most efficient rendez-vous launches are conducted when the \u0022station\u0022 already in orbit is just on the node, if the rocket is powerful enough to get to orbital altitude in a fraction of one orbit. If not, best insertion would also consider how fast the rocket will gain on the station while ascending (so, the station has to have crossed the node already by the same time that will be gained by going on a lower orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI definitely use Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC) for most time-related functions in KSP, and definitely to wait for a node passing. Even if I could calculate the time myself. As I wrote before, time calculations on Kerbin are really simple due to the rotation period of 6 hrs. It takes as many minutes to rotate as the number of degrees of the rotation (longitude difference). Given that an orbit in space is fixed (does not rotate with the body) and therefore the direction of the nodes is fixed, I only have to consider Kerbin\u0027s rotation to calculate where a node will be found with any orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T20:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022diomedea\u0022 data-cite=\u0022diomedea\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThence, yes, we have ascending and descending nodes; they have nothing to do with the rocket, the launchpad or else.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the nodes would exist in reality.

It is with KSP itself. It is a game and shows only what is relevant to the game. But to consider how planets and vessels move in space, I use astronomical concepts. KSP has them embedded, but does not show what is not relevant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have a ship on the launchpad (or landed), it actually moves with the ground of the planet. That point on the ground actually revolves due to the rotation of the planet, so it describes a circle at its latitude. That circle is parallel to the equatorial plane; in case of a point on the equator, it is on the equatorial plane, so I can say that the landed ship has an orbit on the equatorial plane itself. However, KSP does not show any orbit for a landed ship, so you can\u0027t see the nodes I am talking about (those would appear if you could ask KSP for a plane change for that ship, but KSP doesn\u0027t let that for landed ships). KSP is no astronomical software per se, so it does not provide references to let show purely astronomical concepts.
