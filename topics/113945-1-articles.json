Beware that most dV charts already take into account Oberth effect, so if you first go to escape velocity, and do a second burn in kerbolar orbit, you\u0027ll probably run out of fuel.

Calculation is rather easy, as the phase angle is just the angle traveled by Duna during the time the transfer takes (minus half a circle). \u003Cbr\u003EFirst, we\u0027ll need the time our transfer orbit takes. The orbital period is given by T=2*pi*sqrt(a^3/GM), where GM is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Estandard gravitational parameter\u003C/a\u003E (in this case of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbol\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbol\u003C/a\u003E, so it\u0027s 1.1723328e18 m^3/s^2), and a is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-major_axis\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esemi-major axis\u003C/a\u003E of the orbit. This formula can be derived by setting centripetal force (m*omega^2) equal to gravity (GM/r^2). As for the transfer the periapsis is at the orbit of Kerbin, and the apoapsis at the orbit of Duna, a is given by the average between the semi-major axis of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Kerbin\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbin\u003C/a\u003E and the semi-major axis of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Duna\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDuna\u003C/a\u003E, yielding 1.7163e10 m. With these numbers, our orbital period for the transfer orbit is 1.3048e7 s, or 151 earth days, or 604 Kerbin days. This is the orbital period, the transfer from periapsis (Kerbin) to apoapsis (Duna) takes half the time.\u003Cbr\u003ENow we\u0027ll need the angular frequency of Duna. Here the same argument regarding forces can be used, the formula is then omega=sqrt(GM/a^3). Here we input the semi-major axis of Duna\u0027s orbit and of course again GM of Kerbol, yielding omega=3.6285143e-7 rad/s, or omega=2.078986e-5 degree/s. \u003Cbr\u003EMultiplying the angular frequency of Duna with the time the transfer takes yields an angle of 135.6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. Subtracting a half-circle (180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) gives the phase angle of -44.4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003Cbr\u003EThis tells you that the ideal moment for the transfer is reached, when Duna is 44.4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 ahead of Kerbin. So, in order to hit the right spot, either get one of the mods I mentioned above, or look at the Kerbol system from above/below, center your view at Kerbol, and time-warp until the angle between imaginary lines Kerbol-\u0026gt;Kerbin and Kerbol-\u0026gt;Duna is about 44.4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAt the correct phase angle it\u0027s time to launch your ship. After bringing it to low Kerbin orbit, place a maneuver node and plan a prograde burn with the dV of the first burn needed for the transfer, maybe slightly more. If you\u0027re using a dV map, that\u0027s the sum of the numbers between Low Kerbin Orbit and Duna Intercept. Now move the maneuver node around your orbit, until the planned trajectory gets tangential to the orbit of Kerbin around Kerbol. Of course you could also calculate this ejection angle, but I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s a waste of time, as dragging the node around works just as well. After having the node placed in such a way, look if you\u0027re already lucky and have an intercept. If not, the two markers \u0022target position at intersect\u0022 and \u0022closest approach\u0022 will be your best friends, as an intercept happens when these two markers are close enough. Check if there\u0027s are node-lines visible, and how big the inclination of your plotted course is with respect to Duna\u0027s orbit. If the inclination is large (I\u0027d say above 0.2\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) try placing a maneuver node at the nodeline and to correct the inclination. If that gives you an intercept: bingo. If not, I\u0027d play slightly with the first maneuver node (the one placed on LKO), by slightly increasing or decreasing the dV number. If you cannot get an intercept, check the phase angle again. If it\u0027s too early, wait a few in-game days and try again. If it\u0027s too late, you\u0027ll probably need more dV for the initial burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Once your ship is on the way, check its trajectory regularly. I\u0027d have a look after about half the transfer, and if necessary do slight corrections. Apart from maybe inclination changes, these correction burns should usually just take a few m/s. You should also consider to fine-tune the target-orbit around Duna already quite some time before entering Duna SOI. Early course corrections are more difficult, but if carried out correctly usually take less dV.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E After entering Duna\u0027s SOI, make last course corrections if needed. I wouldn\u0027t aerobrake in 1.0, but rather first enter an orbit around Duna. I\u0027d aim for a rather low orbit, maybe 10 km above the edge of Duna\u0027s atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E For landing with parachutes, I\u0027d do a deceleration burn to bring periapsis to about 30 km or so, maybe even lower (I haven\u0027t been to Duna with stock atmosphere in 1.0, only with FAR, so this is an educated guess based on the pressure data given on the Wiki) and try to keep the heatshield (if present) pointing front.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E I wouldn\u0027t fire the parachutes until the probe/lander has slowed down to about 300 m/s, except if the ground comes dangerously close. Below 10 km you should get serious deceleration due to atmospheric drag, so there should be plenty of time to open the chutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E If you don\u0027t use chutes, I\u0027d first test the lander on Kerbin. Of course unmanned, as Kerbin has a higher gravity and you\u0027d need a higher TWR for a successful landing. The reason is, that you\u0027ll need to make sure that your lander either is aerodynamically stable during descent and has the engines pointing forward, or that you\u0027ll have at least enough torque to orient the lander this way when needed. If you can control your lander at 10 km above sea level on Kerbin, it\u0027ll probably also stay under control everywhere on Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: On the Oberth Effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just found that the Wikipedia article on Oberth effect is not very descriptive, and I think that adding an example will help to illustrate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this, let\u0027s start from a circular low orbit around Kerbin. Our orbit has a certain radius r, and our ship has a certain velocity v0. We already used the formulas on the Wikipedia article on Hohmann transfers to calculate the dV needed to enter the Hohmann orbit to Duna (let\u0027s call it dVh), but that number applies only if we are already free of Kerbin\u0027s gravity. Naively one might now think, that one could simply add the dV needed to escape Kerbin to the dVh needed to go into the Hohmann transfer, but the situation isn\u0027t that easy. Thing is, there\u0027s the principle of conservation of energy, and energy is the quantity we can add here. Let\u0027s assume we burn and add to our current velocity v0 an additional velocity dV0. The kinetic energy of our ship after the burn will then be m*(v0\u002BdV0)^2/2. In addition, we sit in Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, adding a (negative) energy of -GM*m/r, where GM is the standard gravitational parameter of Kerbin. After we leave Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, we would still like to have enough kinetic energy to enter the Hohmann transfer, so we\u0027ll need a kinetic energy of m*dVh^2/2. This gives us the energy balance:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Em*(v0\u002BdV0)^2/2-GM*m/r=m*dVh^2/2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe required dV for a burn using Oberth effect can now be found by solving this equation for dV0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m not sure if this is really correct.
