Is it important in real life? Probably not, but getting payloads into orbit is mainly a question of TwR and rocket engineers ensure enough fuel into rockets to accomplish this anyway. Basically having an increased thrust in a vacuum is just an interesting scientific observation but the base TwR at sea level is what people count on getting the craft off the ground.

Not enough to justify re-writing, re-balancing codes and save breaking to accomplish as the general consensus of the community is to \u0022add moar boosters\u0022 to achieve the desired TwR to get rockets off the ground.

The main governing mechanic to getting craft off the surface is TwR, which eventually becomes useless in space because the main importance shifts to the high Isp values to get the craft anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how the \u0022this will educate people the correct way\u0022 be a valid reason for something that is not that important to begin with and its implementation simply means that you\u0027ll end up having bonus fuel to play with in orbit. Not to mention adding extra programming workloads to SQUAD, whom are better off doing optimizations and adding other features. It\u0027s not that all important for people to learn because it\u0027s simply extra stuff that has no impact on craft design or planning (except in real life where you have to ensure that there is no over-expansion of the rocket nozzle, which you can\u0027t control or design anyway in KSP). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a final note people aren\u0027t that stupid when it comes to KSP physics and are well aware of its quirks that are contrary to real life.
