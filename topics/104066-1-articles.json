The main problem with this idea is that such a ring is not stable. Any disturbance from the perfect balancing point will result in a net force that leads to a larger disturbance, and so on. You could potentially add thrusters that thrust the ring back to the equilibrium point when there is a disturbance. This is a control system which acts to create a net restoring force when there is a disturbance from equilibrium. Such a system would require fuel and energy, of course.\n\nIf you are willing to accept tethers, however, you can tether a ring around Earth with a radius larger than geostationary orbit, and it will be held up there by centrifugal force. It would be nothing but a ring of space elevators.\n\nEdit- an alternative to a thruster control system would be a if you had a ring that WASN\u0027T rigid, but could be actuated. Say that one side of the ring started to drift away from the central gravitating body (which correspondingly makes the other side drift closer). Normally, this slight imbalance would be amplified till the closer side of the ring crashed into the central body. However, if you could actuate the ring- deform it at will- then you could move portions of it closer to the cental body to create a force imbalance in one direction, which you could use to keep the ring suspended. Again though, this would require energy.\n\nAnother alternative control system I just thought of would be to spin the ring, and wind or unwind weights to various lengths on long tethers. As the rotation speed is fixed, unwinding the weights further out would cause them to exert more centrifugal force on part of the ring they were attached to. In this way, you could apply restoring forces to the ring to keep it suspended.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T19:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|**"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:41:12Z","Content":"B is the thing that will happen.

If you first create individual space elevators and then send the rest of the stuff on those elevators, then yes, it would slow down Earth\u0027s rotation. But the slowdown would not be significant enough to affect anything. In an extreme case, you might add an extra few milliseconds in a year (defined as 365 days), or something like that. Big deal. You\u0027d have to send up a huge fraction of Earth\u0027s mass before it would have significant consequences for life... and by that point, just by the mining required to send up that much of Earth\u0027s mass (you\u0027d have to strip the entire crust and work your way into the mantle a large distance), life would be long extinct anyway.\n\nThe bigger environmental impact could be caused by the ring brightly illuminating the nighttime sky, disrupting all sorts of biological balances.
