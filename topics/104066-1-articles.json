The main problem with this idea is that such a ring is not stable. Any disturbance from the perfect balancing point will result in a net force that leads to a larger disturbance, and so on. You could potentially add thrusters that thrust the ring back to the equilibrium point when there is a disturbance. This is a control system which acts to create a net restoring force when there is a disturbance from equilibrium. Such a system would require fuel and energy, of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are willing to accept tethers, however, you can tether a ring around Earth with a radius larger than geostationary orbit, and it will be held up there by centrifugal force.

Say that one side of the ring started to drift away from the central gravitating body (which correspondingly makes the other side drift closer). Normally, this slight imbalance would be amplified till the closer side of the ring crashed into the central body. However, if you could actuate the ring- deform it at will- then you could move portions of it closer to the cental body to create a force imbalance in one direction, which you could use to keep the ring suspended. Again though, this would require energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother alternative control system I just thought of would be to spin the ring, and wind or unwind weights to various lengths on long tethers. As the rotation speed is fixed, unwinding the weights further out would cause them to exert more centrifugal force on part of the ring they were attached to. In this way, you could apply restoring forces to the ring to keep it suspended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T19:46:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by |Velocity|\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T19:41:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB is the thing that will happen.
