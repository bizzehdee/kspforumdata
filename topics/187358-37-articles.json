Solution? Allow people to implement their own multiplayer solutions with mods, building off of the network framework that the devs have. I know that I will try to implement my own solution once the game comes out, as that is the most fun to me. As long as there is access to time warp and craft control by the modders, all of this should be feasible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-13T14:53:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224115946\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649848145\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept that you do have to send information to the past in your system to avoid the paradox of vessels and colonies overlapping at different times and then syncing by time-warping to the same common time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a pretty convoluted way to put it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer organization always follow IRL player time, not in-game, regardless of the system you adopt.
