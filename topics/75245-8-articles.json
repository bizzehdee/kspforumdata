Feel free to post your idea to the issue tracker (I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s original), but my above disclaimer about how we\u0027re focusing on bugfixes at the moment still applies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second one, no. The KSC range is what it is to give you an incentive to build your own network. Rolling out a rover is maybe taking the easy way out, but that does count as building your own network. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Floppster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Floppster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf there isn\u0027t one around this thread already, I made a quick and dirty MM patch for adding SPU and an antenna to all probes after RT2 has done its thing with the stock probes.\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing is that I couldn\u0027t get it to work the way I wanted so it relies on parts having ModuleCommand, no SPU, no antenna and no internal (IVA view). Meaning if you bring in a pod from a mod without an internal, it will get a SPU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:courier;\u0022\u003E#minimumCrew[0]\u003C/span\u003E instead of \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:courier;\u0022\u003E!INTERNAL\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:courier;\u0022\u003E[*]\u003C/span\u003E. You don\u0027t need mods to run into IVA problems, since both the Mk2 and Mk3 cockpits would get through your filter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, we won\u0027t be including a convert-everything patch like this in the main RT2 install. Cilph says that when he tried it, a lot of people complained. Also, I\u0027ve been playing with a similar patch in my own game, and I\u0027ve run into problems with some mods giving ModuleCommand to parts that don\u0027t really make sense as probe cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpacedInvader\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so if I\u0027m reading the equation correctly, its the range of shorter range antenna plus the square root of the sum of the range of both antennas? So if I\u0027m working with an antenna with 200GM and another with 600GM, the total range I should expect is ~228GM? Does this cross the omni / dish line as well, or do both still have to be of the same type?\u003Cp\u003EAlso, can you please explain the multiple antennas multiplier? I\u0027ve found several posts talking about setting it to values like 0.5 and 0.25, but no clear description of what the value actually does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould be the square root of the product: 200 \u002B sqrt(200 * 600) = 546. It works with (in fact, is probably most useful for) mixed omni/dish connections. Also, if you plug two identical antennas into the formula you get double the range, so you may want to use RangeMultiplier = 0.5 to compensate for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultipleAntennaMultiplier lets multiple omni antennas on the same spacecraft work as if the ship had one slightly larger antenna. A value of 0 means only the longest-range omni matters, and the others are dead weight. A value of 1 means you add all the ranges together, and use that as the range of the spacecraft. Other values follow a line between those two extremes (so, for example, if you have four 2500 km antennas and a MultipleAntennaMultiplier of 0.25, your ship would have an omni range of a quarter of the way between 2500 km and 10,000 km, or 4375 km).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will all be explained in the next version of the RT manual, but we\u0027ve got some other details we need to double-check first.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-25T15:39:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2014 03:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nnavinraj","CreatedById":112089,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T15:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not make a probe/sat and just land it there.
