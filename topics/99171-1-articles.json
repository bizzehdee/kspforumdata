How do you land planes? First planes where blessing for me (fully retrival vessels for in-atmosfere missions like taking crew reps above or below some alts or on surface). As I didn\u0027t invented gears for some time, first launches were really fun (separatrons are great for launching planes from a place:cool:). But about landing... I just can\u0027t manage it... crashing all the time... problem are the controls - flying those planes with keyboard is ok if you have to hit some point more-or-less, but precise flying is almost impossible. How do you manage this (currently I\u0027m just using parachutes for landing)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What to upgrade (and to what level) to be able to make planned manouvers in space?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T10:44:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout landing planes, my approach is to follow a procedure as close as possible to what done in reality. I\u0027m sure most of it will not sound foreign to you or others. Sure, need to have gear, or you\u0027re better with chuting above the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to know beforehand the lowest speed your plane can stay airborne and stable, of course at very low altitude. It pays to experiment to find out. During all approach and landing, you should never slow below the minimum speed. Also useful to know the Angle of Attack (AoA) to keep altitude at such slow speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Approach the runway from the sector you want to land (e.g. eastern to land on heading 270), reduce speed and descend. Call tower for landing authorization (ehm, not yet in KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. while still some Km out from the runway, you should aim to be aligned with it, or, to see the runway exactly at 270\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 bearing, and have the plane pointing that way. In reality your heading may differ to compensate for wind, not in stock KSP. The distance at you should be aligned depends from expertise, we don\u0027t follow mandatory approach procedures like in reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Also, you should aim for the correct slope. Let\u0027s say the correct slope is 2.5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (quite often used), that means to have altitude (above ground) of 440 m at 10 Km; 220m at 5 Km; and so on. Sum the altitude ASL (above sea level) of the runway (70 m for KSC runway), you get the altitude to read (510 m at 10 Km distance).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Fly the approach slowing to just a few m/s more than the minimum speed, always keeping aligned with the runway, and descending to follow the slope. If you have those, set your flaps. At a convenient distance (let\u0027s say, 5Km out) have your gear down and confirmed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It is normal for a plane to require some AoA, or pitch up, to keep altitude at slow speeds. Let the plane assume the correct AoA while it slows down. Real pilots know the correct AoA for a given weight and speed, and the correct pitch is AoA - slope. The correct AoA also means the plane will touch down with the rear gear first. Don\u0027t slow too much, or the AoA will be too high and you may hit the runway with the tail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. If all the above went correctly, you should be slow just above the runway gate, aligned, ready for touch down. Different planes may require different ways to handle, I like when all required is just to cut the engine and let the plane descend those few meters while also slowing at the minimum speed. Touch down. Pitch down, apply brakes (apply reversed thrust if any), reset flaps. Let the plane roll until it almost stops and then drive it into the taxiway (not really required in KSP).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PlonioFludrasco","CreatedById":98915,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T10:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOften I follow those procedures too.

It might be worth taking your preferred vehicle on some flights around KSC, see if you can buzz past the tower, or between the buildings in the research section, and find out what your minimum speed at sea level is. Does it roll awkwardly, does it straighten up if you release the controls, and what\u0027s your slowest speed for stable flight?

I\u0027m rubbish at lining up with the runway, so I just come down anywhere at KSC. That whole peninsula, that looks light green from high up, is nice and flat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for the actual landing, one thing is to start your descent nice and early. If you try and nosedive above KSC you\u0027ll build up too much speed to land. This is especially important if you\u0027re using FAR or another aerodynamics mod, because it\u0027s much harder to shed speed than in the stock \u0022soup\u0022. In real life, if you were flying an airliner at 33,000 feet (10 km) you would start your descent around 150-200 km from the runway. That\u0027s several times as far from KSC as the island runway is. In KSP you probably can do steeper, but still you get the idea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re getting fairly low you can also back off the throttle. It depends on the plane and the aerodynamics mod (if any), but I tend to find just a little above zero works well. I don\u0027t like to outright cut the engine but some planes do warrant that. If you\u0027re making an out landing - ie one not at KSC - then you should by now be looking for a landing site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELower your landing gear and let the plane steadily descend until it\u0027s just above the runway or landing site. The Small Gear Bay comes with a light, turn that on using U and it will help you judge the distance. Then pitch up to maintain near-level flight and slow down further, and gently let the wheels touch the ground. Apply the brakes but be careful not to flip end over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your plane\u0027s controls are too twitchy, use fine controls by hitting Caps Lock.

It\u0027d be easier to answer the question if you could tell us a little bit about the aerodynamic model you\u0027re using, and maybe show a pic or two of the planes you typically fly. I use stock aero myself. I also use NavUtilities; Alshain\u0027s provided you the link. Before I used NavUtilities, though, I used to set up a manual ILS. To do this, take a Kerbal, put him out on a very basic rover (or walk/run - it\u0027ll just take a lot longer) and drive him out to the ocean-side end of the Runway (just off the raised \u0022ramp\u0022 portion). Have him plant a flag. Then drive him/have him run to the other side (landward side) of the runway. Have him plant a flag. Those flags become your ILS - when you\u0027re trying to land, line up those two marks on the screen; you know you\u0027re aligned with the runway at that point. You can then use the distance between yourself and the current flag to determine your glideslope - you want your altimeter reading in meters to be one hundred times the distance to the marker, plus 100 meters. (For example, if you\u0027re 12.3 kilometers from the flag, you want your altimeter to read (100*12.3)\u002B100 = 1330 meters). If you\u0027re more than 200-300 meters above that mark, you\u0027re too high; more than 200-300 meters below that mark, you\u0027re too low. That\u0027s just a handy way of doing things if you want to stay stock. Note that you can set out more flags landward; marks at 1, 5, 10, 15 and 25 kilometers will give you more points of reference and will improve the accuracy of your runway alignment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there it\u0027s pretty much like people have said. Keep your throttles at 2/3 or below until you\u0027re 10 k out, then you don\u0027t want to be above 1/3 throttle or so. Drop the throttle down to one or two klicks once you\u0027re 2-5 kilometers out, and then try to go that last kilometer with throttles off. Touchdown needs to be gentle - 5 m/s downwards, tops. Try the plain out before you shoot for the runway; it\u0027s generally an easier target to hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeorbit such that if you start at 100 kilometers, you put your periapsis right over KSC at 44,000 kilometers or so. That\u0027ll generally get you within 100 kilometers of KSC; get it right on the money and you should just be able to glide right in.
