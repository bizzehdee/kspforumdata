Needless to say, the launch went nominally on the first try and ended up as a great little KSP demo and cinematic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously it has been chopped up and cut very much, as getting into orbit without warp or video editing takes about 12 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis video is more short and sweet at under two minutes. And of course, as all of my KSP videos are, it is in High-Definition. The best KSP videos are the ones where you can see what\\\u0027s happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe C/SM will orbit Kerbin for the next twelve days to test its reliability for long term stays in space during later missions to Minmus in this spacecraft.
