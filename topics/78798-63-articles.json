Kabonite is largely responsible for fueling Kebin\u0027s Industrial Age- and polluting the skies. Nearly all modern vehicles on the road run on karbonite or a fuel derived from it, and nations are known to use the flow of karbonite- or the lack thereof- for political gain.

Scientists believe that asteroid bombardment during the early period of Kerbin\u0027s formation brought karbonite to the surface, and thus asteroids are thought to contain karbonite deposits as well. While typically found as a solid in the crust of a planet or burried in an asteroid, trace amounts of karbonite can also be found dissolved in oceans. Additionally, trace amounts of dust-form karbonite are theorized to exist in the atmospheres of some worlds, all the way up to and including the exosphere. As the technology to harvest karbonite improves, perhaps future spacecraft could even scoop up the substance from just above an atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not as clean burning as traditional rocket fuels, karbonite is effective as a propellant. Engines consuming karbonite generate greater thrust than traditionally fueled counterparts while suffering from worse ISP. Additionally, engines fueled by karbonite are more prone to overheat and explode. Since karbonite provides its own oxidizer, jet engines and turbofans powered by the substance can operate in atmospheres lacking significant amounts of oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T21:46:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 09:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Angel-125\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sober667","CreatedById":116695,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T22:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei make somethink fun i take fuel thank with no oxidizer and aerospike rocket and scoop trigered to oxygen and i can simply start rocket with no oxidizer on lauchpad and at full trust get enough to lauch small rocket to orbit (smaller mass-better trust to mass rate)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T23:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Angel-125\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Angel-125\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHm...\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite is an oily black crystaline substance ---.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA warning- It may be much better to leave somethings ambiguous.
