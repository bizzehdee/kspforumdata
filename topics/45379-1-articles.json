I don\u0027t know, orbital construction via welding parts together as an extra-vehicular activity just seems a bit much to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe will, however, be getting some type of repair tool part which you can open up with a kerbonaut and...I don\u0027t know, take tools out to do stuff with \u0027em. They haven\u0027t really explained how repairing or maintenance is going to work yet, but it\u0027s gotta be planned \u0027cause that\u0027s a HUGE part of real space programs, spacewalking to fix, install or repair things and doing EVA science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey have said that we\u0027ll get a strut gun of some sort eventually. So that\u0027ll be cool. They might even refine that idea into some form of welding, who knows?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely not going to be in .23, though. Basic repairing or maintenance might get in at that point, but I feel like that\u0027d be the currency update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
