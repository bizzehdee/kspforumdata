IMHO the patch is not introducing any problems in docking because the issues are the same in stock MJ2.\u003Cp\u003EThe above behavior definitely happens in unpatched MJ2. I believe the cause is that you still have \u0022control from here\u0022 set on the MJ part itself (which is where it defaults to when the ship spawns) instead of the docking port. If MJ is the \u0022control from here\u0022 part, it will line itself up with the target docking port. Because it\u0027s stuck on the side of the ship, this causes the 1/2-off misalignment. Setting \u0022control from here\u0022 to the docking port or any centrally placed command pod solves this problem, but it\u0027s a problem the patch should fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnpatched MJ also has the problem a docking ship stopping indefinitely a short distance from the target. I don\u0027t know what causes this but there\u0027s an easy work-around. Disable the autopilot, tap RCS in any direction (but usually ahead is better), then reengage the autopilot.

Ideally it should have the two ports aligned and the relative motion vector parallel to the docking axis by about 10m out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor visualisation purposes, envisage a curved horn or funnel coming to a ~1cm point 10m out from the target port. The docking pilot should use the minimum amount of RCS fuel to maintain appropriate forwards velocity while remaining within this shape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while ago I made a quicksave then let MechJeb\u0027s docking autopilot do the procedure.

Very little RCS usage that I see, but boy does it push that speed limit. I like it. \u003Cp\u003EOne problem I\u0027ve found (but haven\u0027t narrowed down) is that if you\u0027re negative position relative to the docking vector (vector pointing outward from the target dock - toward where the active docking vessel will be) then the docking vessel appears to orient the right way, but thrust the wrong way - so it flies away from the target. If you get positive position relative, it works fine. I\u0027m not sure precisely what the condition is that causes the problem, but it did it it twice to me and that appears to be when it happens. Essentially, I\u0027m rotating my orbital boost stage 90 degrees and re-docking to the same craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfirming this bug, I also had one of my ships fly away from the station when I came in on the wrong side and asked MJ to auto-dock to a port on the far side of the station from where I was.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T10:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eother feedback: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian, speed limit needs to either use the absolute value or prohibit negative number entries\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T11:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAn other version (2.0.13243.1312)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ship flying away when docking from opposite side of the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better RCS usage, I hope\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Speed Limit can\u0027t be negative\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Default docking speed is set to 0.5m/s now.
