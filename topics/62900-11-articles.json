Hmm. I could add something so that you could earn science (at a similar rate) as long as vessels are building (your engineers are getting hands on experience). Otherwise, maybe you could reduce your build rate and divert some of the resources to \u0022research\u0022. At the end of the research, you get a science point. It\u0027d be like another build list (maybe with the upgrade system I want to introduce, you could upgrade your research rate). I will think about this.

It proved fatal for me (luckily I had backed up my save), so I implemented simulations in the first pre-release after I took over so you could test a ship before building it.

How do I quantify a \u0022successful\u0022 simulation? Is it based on the time? But that\u0027s not always applicable.
