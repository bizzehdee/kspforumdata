Now I did build on it and can add a lab with more stable connection (normal docking port). My small docked lab is full of experiements. 740/750. My new one is half full. 300/750.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I transfer the experiments from lab 1 to lab 2, then decide if I want to split my station into 2 or deorbit the first lab ? Or should I wait for the experiments to eventually finish ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I want to simply switch to normal docking port lab is because I almost got attacked by Kraken and barely avoided disaster by disabling almost all the SAS Reaction wheels. Since the option to load is not available to me I would like to avoid having to rescue kerbals / lose kerbals / clean debris.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D8VVun9.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D8VVun9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T19:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, this cannot be possible. Each lab keeps a list of which experiments have\u00A0been processed into data already -- because you can only process each experiment\u00A0once per lab. If you could process on one, and then move the data to another, then you could defeat the limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mapoko","CreatedById":139980,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-03T12:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
