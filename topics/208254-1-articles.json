Having features that allow people to customize their craft more and learn about space flight as a result is fine (and the devs get to choose which features they decide to implement that with) but the problem comes when people are forced to interact with those non-core systems.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, putting aside the topic of \u201Cis it worthwhile to add this\u201D which is almost entirely subjective, I think that this could work, as long as people can still slap on an engine and it works. Some people would have fun customizing their engine nozzles and cones and even the internal mechanics of the engine if things go that deep, but others will want to just drop an engine on their craft and have it work. So, just like pods should have default software with the modular computers thing, engines should have default sizes that work so that players who do not want to interact with that system can get by reasonably well. Thus, the argument of \u201Ctoo complex for beginners\u201D is mitigated because beginners do not have to worry about using those systems until they feel ready to do so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-06-02T19:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224140557\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221654197463\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113880\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shdwlrd\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, shdwlrd said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes and no.
