I thought that it is reason why governments does not see colonization as a productive operation unlike colonization of different continents couple of hundreds of years ago. But if government is not interested in space colonization of course it does not buy equipment from companies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that we can discuss politics on general level without comparing countries or political ideologies (if not, moderator please notify). It is impossible to talk about ideological space projects, like colonization and exploration, without politics because politicians decide practically all of it. Maybe I am little cynical. It is better with politics. But I do not see that cold war begun suddenly in normal conditions. There was World War II in which USA and Soviet Union was allies and cold war developed after that. Developing of space race took 10 years and its main motivation was development of intercontinental ballistic missile. There is no such motivation on next cold wars. Even relatively poor countries can achieve ballistic missiles now and colonization equipment have not straight military applications.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also other thing. Apollo was short period project compared to any colonization projects. Even most primitive space colonies need huge investments over several decades. I think that it is very improbable that cold war like situation can stay stable so long. It ends or leads to actual war. It is also difficult project for democratic governments because it should stay over tens of election periods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven Industries","CreatedById":159877,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T16:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there\u0027s no good reason to go into space - each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2015 Randall Munroe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that sums up why manned exploration and colonization is potentially\u00A0useful in the long run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T17:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222452568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457715507\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159877\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbalSaver\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, KerbalSaver said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe universe is probably littered with the one-planet graves of cultures which made the sensible economic decision that there\u0027s no good reason to go into space - each discovered, studied, and remembered by the ones who made the irrational decision.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u2015 Randall Munroe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that sums up why manned exploration and colonization is potentially\u00A0useful in the long run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at my sig \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0 VVVV\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-11T17:01:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2016 05:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Spaceception\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven Industries","CreatedById":159877,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-11T17:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222452572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133914\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221457715640\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022152800\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spaceception\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n42 minutes ago, Spaceception said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at my sig\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw your sig in another place, and that\u0027s what reminded me of the quote.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
