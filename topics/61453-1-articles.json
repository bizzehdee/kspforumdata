A 100% Tylo certified lander, capable of putting a kerbal on the surface and returning to orbit with boatloads of fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.com/a/img689/9071/65z4.png\u0022 alt=\u002265z4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft is still under development, in the final tuning stages, so no craft file is ready for release yet. The best part is, the upper stage is capable of landing on any other non-atmospheric body after it dumps the lower stage and drop tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran it through a hyperedit test where I landed on Tylo and went back to orbit. I then magically refueled the craft to simulate redocking with the Nebulon mothership, the first Sentari class tour ship ever built, which will be running a grand tour. I teleported myself to Vall, landed from a 75km orbit, and then went back up to a 200km orbit with fuel to spare. I repeated the process on Ike. After that, I can safely say this is a \u0027go anywhere, do anything\u0027 lander.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did say it\u0027s in development. There is currently a glitch where the kerbal is unable to transition from the fixed ladders to the yellow ladder on the upper stage lander going down. The issue does not occur when going up. You may have to fall off and then climb back up. I\u0027ll have to be careful of this on Tylo. The craft file will be released here in the coming weeks as I run the Grand Tour as well as part of the pack of all my grand tour craft modules, which will be released upon completion of my tour.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe image does not show it well but there are Rockomax 48-7S engines on the main boosters.

Also, you could place the upper stage engines with triple (or quadruple, or whatever) symmetry and attach the decoupler directly to the tank, it would still work, it\u0027s stiffer, and the ugly gap is smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
