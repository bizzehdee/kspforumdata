Been playing the game for a while, thought I\u0027d see what the community for the game is like and from what I\u0027ve seen so far, it\u0027s fantastic! The fanart is by far the best I\u0027ve seen. I actually have KSP running right now and thought I\u0027d post this. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a bug or a breakdown purposefully implemented in the game (I mean both of those statements with the utmost respect, I really do enjoy this game very much), but I just landed on Mun with a broken altimeter. It reads \u00220 m\u0022 I can post a screencap if anyone wants it bad enough. Just thought I\u0027d mention it. I didn\u0027t know where else it could go within the rules of the forum.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T22:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Spartan117, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe altimeter can go funny from time to time, sometimes the numbers disappear, also as it gives height from the sea level of Kerbin and the mean ground level of the Mun, it will often read high or low when landed, as yours is saying 0 meters you must have landed in one of the few places that is dead on the average for the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"5@1312EWULFX","CreatedById":28947,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T23:19:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI notice the larger rockets I build will have a similar problem makes it hard to land without a mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T23:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spartan117","CreatedById":25092,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T02:21:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Spartan117, and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe altimeter can go funny from time to time, sometimes the numbers disappear, also as it gives height from the sea level of Kerbin and the mean ground level of the Mun, it will often read high or low when landed, as yours is saying 0 meters you must have landed in one of the few places that is dead on the average for the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually forgot to grab a screencap, so that\u0027s my bad. But I know the altimeter fault wasn\u0027t related to actual altitude because it read \u00220 m\u0022 for the entire landing procedure on Mun. And it\u0027s probably my fault for not expressing the fault correctly. It\u0027s not \u00220m\u0022 per se, but the left-most digit on the read out is zero and everything else in-between the 0 and the m are blank. I should\u0027ve said \u00220-----m\u0022 But I channeled my inner Bob Kerman and used the lander\u0027s shadow to gauge distance. Jeb was quite upset at that. At least it wasn\u0027t a \u0022Main Bus B Undervolt\u0022, eh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I messed around on Mun and thought I had an intercept course with Minmus before I saved and quit for a small while. When I came back, there was no intercept course to be had. I tried small thrusts to get within Minmus\u0027 gravity well but it wasn\u0027t to be. That was the farthest and Kerbal had been in my local Kerbin system. I really wanted to check out Minmus. But I don\u0027t have a solid grasp of the advanced piloting I read about on here and just do straight launch-shots to my target. Extremely fuel inefficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
