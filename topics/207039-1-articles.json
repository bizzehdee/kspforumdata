Of course, it\u0027s not my place to say who is and who isn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou know, I went through a couple of years where I thought \u0022transness\u0022 was weird and I didn\u0027t understand, but I gradually got over it through exposure, and now it seems like just another facet of the human journey of figuring out who we are. That\u0027s probably the most important and significant thing any individual can do, so it goes without saying that trans rights are human rights and should be defended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you ever need someone to be really mean to anti-trans people, let me know. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
