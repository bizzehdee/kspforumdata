Many people don\u0027t know that Ceres was itself considered to be a planet until the discovery of more and more objects in similar orbits leading to its reclassification as an asteroid. This is pretty much what happened to Pluto, we discovered more and more similar objects in similar orbits giving it more in common with these objects than with the other eight planets and so a call was made for it to be reclassified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe debate about Pluto\u0027s status, of course, isn\u0027t just in the public but among some scientists. Some take issue with the definition agreed to by the IAU for a planet, they consider its third criteria \u0022has cleared the neighborhood of its orbit\u0022 to be somewhat vague. What constitutes the \u0022neighborhood of its orbit\u0022? When is the orbit considered \u0022cleared\u0022? Some have even suggested that by the current definition Neptune is no longer a planet because it has never \u0022cleared\u0022 Pluto, which crosses orbits with Neptune. Some may yet argue that Jupiter\u0027s orbit isn\u0027t clear because of the Trojan Asteroids, though this is easily countered by remembering that it is Jupiter\u0027s gravity that dominates these objects. Then there could be the argument that the Earth hasn\u0027t cleared its orbital neighborhood because there are Earth-crossing asteroids. Some also point out that the definition only holds for objects in our Solar System because the definition states that the object mud \u0022orbit the Sun\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will take several years for the debate to run its course, we just have to accept that unless the definition is revised by the IAU in the future, or they promote Pluto, that as far as textbooks and all other scientific literature and facts are concerned Pluto is now a dwarf planet. I personally consider Pluto a planet for old times\u0027 sake, but would not teach anyone that it was a planet while the scientific community considers it otherwise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T22:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI, like most of us, grew up with Pluto being a planet, to have that changed is weird.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, but I grew up with 105 elements, and protons, neutrons and electrons were elementary particles that couldn\u0027t be subdivided.
