But, that is a rule for myself, not a general rule every and all of the moderators are bound to. And sometimes I even forget to apply it. In my view however it helps make clear what needed to be moderated (and generally I show why). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo rule exists nor is in general considered necessary about marking moderator actions in any special way. Most of the time those actions are so clear by themselves to not require further explanation. But in case, each one of us is free to choose the way he sees best. While I\u0027m convinced of my system as fitting, others do not, and remain free to do as they like: going on with requesting them to change is not much different than from me to require any member to be posting as I\u0027d like, instead as they would. Oh, perhaps that could require me \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff8c00;\u0022\u003Eto take action\u003C/span\u003E (eh, not to show other moderators what I do as an example, already did).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
