Takes a lot of dedication and, I\u0027m sure, a thick skin.\n\nJust a quick comment/suggestion based on what I saw in a few threads recently. There sometimes seems to be confusion around when a moderator posts officially with his/her moderators\u0027 hat on, and when they do socially with just their own opinion to participate in the forum as any other user might.\n\nCould I suggest that you adopt a convention to make it clear whether you are posting as a moderator, or as a user? That way people would be in no doubt whatsoever how to interpret your posts.\n\nMany thanks, and keep up the great work,\n\n - Micha."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T11:58:07Z","Content":"That\u0027s a topic that comes up from time to time among the moderators, and while it seems like a good idea on the surface there are some problems with it (as explained to me by a more experienced moderator when I suggested something similar):\n\n- It further segregates the moderators from the regular users.\n\n- Any font/color convention is easily duplicated by regular users, inviting rule 3.3 violations.\n\n- Some users will always, always read a moderator\u0027s posts through the lens of \u0022written by a moderator\u0022, even if clearly marked as personal opinion.\n\n- If you need special fonts or colors to show when you are moderating then you are doing it wrong.\n\nThat said, sometimes we do it wrong, we\u0027re human and make mistakes sometimes. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T13:41:52Z","Content":"I can see the segregation being an issue; hadn\u0027t thought about that aspect of it.\n\nAs for your other points, instead of saying \u0022This is a moderator response\u0022 (which can be duplicated/faked as you said), have a \u0022This is my own opinion\u0022 disclaimer for social posts, and leave un-disclaimed posts as the moderator-hat ones.\n\nAnyway, if it\u0027s been discussed before, then sorry for raising it again.

The current situation as it stands (as I have noted many years ago, this is not a recent issue) leads to issues and unnecessary infractions. Currently users are becoming the victim of bad policy and that is not very conducive to an open and pleasant forum for fear or infractions or even bans.\n\n\u003E - It further segregates the moderators from the regular users.\n\nIt is the current situation that segregates moderators from the regular users, not making things clearer. Currently, vague situations regularly pop up, making people tread lightly round those statements that might very well be personal. If you are unmistakably clear, moderators can be one of the boys while discussing things, and a moderator when the need is there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Any font/color convention is easily duplicated by regular users, inviting rule 3.3 violations.\n\nNot an issue or an argument. Anyone replicate police equipment too, but the occurrence of police impersonators is incredibly low. As long as the convention is clear, anyone copying that does so at his own (and very short lived) peril.\n\nOh, and in other forums them simply have colours and fonts not available to the rest.

The semantics really are not that relevant and change little about what is wrong. Whatever the case or what you want to call it, improvements could be made. Not only according to me, but also to various other people in this thread. This issue pops up from time to time from the user side (as this is certainly not the first time this has been discussed ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)) and, by your own admittance, on the moderating side of things too. Being a moderator might obscure the issue at hand a bit, since the experience is one-sided and a discussion feels rather different if you have no leverage at all. The long story short is that people regularly detect some bumps in the road, and those could be flattened in a simple and elegant way. \n\nBesides, moderators have indicated in this thread they have some issues with being segregated, so if anything, that would be improved.
