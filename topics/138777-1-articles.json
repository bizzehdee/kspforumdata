One thing I\u0027ve learned about the universe is that it\u0027s a lot less fragile than Hollywood science or people in general make it out to be. Just like you can\u0027t destroy the universe by looking up \u0022dictionary\u0022 in a dictionary or dividing by zero, I don\u0027t see much real probability that trying to warp places is going to spawn dramatic time loops and universe-breaking paradoxes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd on the topic of communication in particular, people have already demonstrated that they can handle information being sent and received out of order. Quite often people send chat messages that end up being listed before the messages to which they were responding, and thus they have to decipher the \u0022real\u0022 order of communications. Before we had that, similar events frequently occurred in the mail system - letters would be out of date by the time they arrived, or people would arrive at destinations before their letters arrived to announce them.
