Oh well I suppose. There were polls at the time and a clear majority wanted them to finish the art and keep it so I think they should just go for it but if the hyper-bland teir one they have now makes people happy then I\u0027d be fine with An official mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T15:43:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPeople got so weird about the barn, no one seemed to get that they were seeing preliminary concept art.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EPeople got weird about the barn not because of the barn but because of the wealth of stereotypical redneck iconography that accompanied it.
