So whenever I go on EVA, I\u0027ll have to remember to turn off AUTO camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try removing all my mods and seeing if this can be reproduced in a vanilla install, in which case it\u0027ll be reported as a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-28T00:44:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2014 12:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Brixmon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u0026#039;Fix\u0026#039; found\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
