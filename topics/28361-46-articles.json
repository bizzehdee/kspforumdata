I\u0027d gotten into the habit of carrying a mobility enhancer along when doing station modification just to give the Kerbal a convenient temporary anchor so they don\u0027t float off while I\u0027m trying to get the new part aligned and fixed properly. More handrails will be very convenient for KAS users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T08:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgress Report, 12 May 2016\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bit of a setback I\u0027m afraid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter diverting my attention to updating SDHI SMS and Strobe-O-Matic, and finishing off some contract work on the side, I resumed work on FusTek.

For the most part, the newly re-exported parts turned out okay, but there was a bit of a problem with the module identifier decals - specifically, the transparent regions of the decals show up as ugly blocks of opaque color in the VAB/SPH parts list, but otherwise look okay in the build area itself and the flight scene:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QCMsbIz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QCMsbIz.png\u0022 style=\u0022width:1000px;height:560px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is related to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/137968-flag-decals-see-through-in-the-vab/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethe issue regarding flag decals causing areas of parts being (conversely) transparent in the build area\u003C/a\u003E.
