The original four should be the only ones with orange IMO. The multicolored helmets are also a lot more technically feasible, as you would only have to swap out the helmet model instead of the entire kerbal. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nLuke"},{"CreatedByName":"Planetfall","CreatedById":154594,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:32:07Z","Content":"i wish the four had their EVA suits orange too. it would make it easier to recognize them."},{"CreatedByName":"Scientia1423","CreatedById":116562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:55:50Z","Content":"What about having the suit have text that says: Trusted KerbalTM"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralVeers","CreatedById":148918,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T04:33:01Z","Content":"I\u0027ll see your suggestions and raise you a \u0022hey, I\u0027ve got an even better idea!\u0022 ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nHow about adding a feature in the Astronaut Hotel to customize your astronauts\u0027 suit colors....? The game has two suit graphics now; a few more could be added and there could be a feature in the Astronaut Hotel to let the player choose what color each astronaut wears. With the proviso that the Original Three (or Original Four or whichever it is now) remain orange, of course. Jebediah wears orange. Period. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
