As I\\\u0027ve played the game, I\\\u0027ve been introduced to a number of concepts that I never knew existed. As such, I\\\u0027ve been doing a lot of research (mainly reading), and it\\\u0027s more fascinating than ever. I\\\u0027d be interested to get recommendations on documentaries about rocketry and/or spacecraft that you found really interesting. I watched the \u0027When We Left Earth\u0027 series about a year ago, but will re-watch soon as I\\\u0027m sure it will be a lot more interesting now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T12:49:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon_%28TV_miniseries%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EFrom the Earth to the Moon\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a documentary, but a must have for any budding rocketeer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T03:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thiel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thiel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot a documentary, but a must have for any budding rocketeer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve seen that, and I must say it\\\u0027s not very appealing.
