As I\\\u0027ve played the game, I\\\u0027ve been introduced to a number of concepts that I never knew existed. As such, I\\\u0027ve been doing a lot of research (mainly reading), and it\\\u0027s more fascinating than ever. I\\\u0027d be interested to get recommendations on documentaries about rocketry and/or spacecraft that you found really interesting. I watched the \u0027When We Left Earth\u0027 series about a year ago, but will re-watch soon as I\\\u0027m sure it will be a lot more interesting now."},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T12:49:49Z","Content":"[From the Earth to the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon_%28TV_miniseries%29) \n\nNot a documentary, but a must have for any budding rocketeer."},{"CreatedByName":"Phoxtane","CreatedById":6626,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T03:31:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Not a documentary, but a must have for any budding rocketeer.\n\nI\\\u0027ve seen that, and I must say it\\\u0027s not very appealing.

Like HBO\\\u0027s \u0027ROME\u0027 series - I actually learned a lot of interesting info (after researching various events portrayed in the series). Same goes for John Adams.\n\nThat said, I definitely appreciate programs that are thick with technical details as well. Do you have any recommendations?"},{"CreatedByName":"SmiteZero","CreatedById":10862,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:35:45Z","Content":"\u0027From The Earth To The Moon\u0027 is kinda.. meh. Tom Hanks is like a bulldog with lockjaw, hanging onto the Saving Private Ryan realistic drama idea that\\\u0027s carried him through the last few years with his various projects, all being essentially the same with the actors just wearing different period clothing. Aside from the continued high production values one has come to expect from Mr. Hanks when he engages in a project like this, there\\\u0027s not much to it.\n\nI usually scour the youtoobs for documentaries. Stuff on von Braun, World Kerfuffle 2, Nazi rocketry - that kinda jazz."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T04:48:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That said, I definitely appreciate programs that are thick with technical details as well.
