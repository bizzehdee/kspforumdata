Also, does this account for KSP\u0027s lacking aerodynamics? As far as I can tell, the whole issue can be summarized by looking at the amount of potential work done against the vessel by different components, namely atmospheric drag, gravity drag, and inefficient fuel usage. Since I use NEAR to provide enhanced aerodynamic simulation, atmospheric drag also has a component related to the vehicle\u0027s AoA (which adds another level of complexity)... but even without it one can see that it takes a lot of work to change the velocity vector from pointing nearly at the horizon to straight up, so it seems like you should point as prograde as possible as early as possible... at least after a balance point (where the savings in fuel efficiency are offset by additional costs incurred from staying in the atmosphere longer), although good aerodynamics can allow lift to offset the penalty for turning earlier and may in fact provide an incentive to do so. I\u0027ve been working on this problem for awhile, and what I\u0027m seeing is that the tipping point is actually about 24km... and if you assume a smooth turn is better than an impulsive turn (which it usually is [at least with decent aerodynamics]) then depending on velocity and rate of turn, it could be completely reasonable to begin a slow steady turn at about 10-12km, be at the 45 degree point at about 24km, and then horizontal by 34-36km. This seems to be in line with what i\u0027ve noticed in-game; however, I must admit that I doubt a truly constant turn rate results in the absolute best result... based on the exponential nature of the atmosphere, I imagine it\u0027s probably something that looks more like a turn which begins gradually, but picks up speed as you gain altitude and then slams on brakes when you are horizontal... though I have nothing that mathematically supports this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-14T06:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth the threads I and Kasuha referenced (posts 5 and 8 respectively) have the actual workings in them and more recent posts.

I understand the difficulties associated with this type of calculation, but your post suggests that some things are optimal which are not optimal (by quite a wide margin in some cases). For example, you could use a lower angle than 45 degrees and less thrust on the second part (think 30 degrees and 2.5 g\u0027s), and just burn a little longer. Also, breaking this up into many more segments would increase its accuracy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to discourage you from doing further research, in fact I encourage it, I just want to also encourage you to be careful how you present things in this particular forum... as there may well be people looking for answers here that don\u0027t have the requisite knowledge to judge the efficacy of the method presented from an analytical standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T18:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hydropos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hydropos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Emy math has already shown that any circumferential velocity prior to 34km up is actually bad for your \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much delta-v does it take you to get into 75km LKO? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe record stands at 4343m/s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39196-Launch-Efficiency-Exercise-Updated-for-0-21-1?p=502762\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post502762\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39196-Launch-Efficiency-Exercise-Updated-for-0-21-1?p=502762\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post502762\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting the turn at ~10km i regularly get there with a little under 4400m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(that is without FAR or NEAR)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T23:24:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow much delta-v does it take you to get into 75km LKO? \u003Cp\u003EThe record stands at 4343m/s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39196-Launch-Efficiency-Exercise-Updated-for-0-21-1?p=502762\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post502762\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/39196-Launch-Efficiency-Exercise-Updated-for-0-21-1?p=502762\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post502762\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting the turn at ~10km i regularly get there with a little under 4400m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(that is without FAR or NEAR)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know exactly how much DV it takes for me since I don\u0027t have any add-ons to give me an exact measurement, but it\u0027s got to be under 4,400 m/sec according to the calculated DV at launch and fuel reserves remaining in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I launch vertical to 7.5 KM at 1.5-2G, then follow a very close approximation of a gravity turn with an approximation of the sine of pitch for t/w the rest of the way.

It seems logical to me that just as optimal ascent involves a compromise between drag loss and gravity loss, simply minimizing steering loss is not optimal but rather steering loss to is a component of the compromise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a real gravity turn is generally gradual and slow, meaning the rocket spends more time being closer to vertical than it would in case of a more aggressive turn, thus causing more gravity loss.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-31T12:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHydropos,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E There is simply no way to create an equation that can answer this question.
