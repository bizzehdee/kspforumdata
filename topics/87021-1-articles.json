Resource flow (fuel, air, whatever) only works properly in 1 direction through a bicoupler, from the single side to the double side. IOW, bicouplers will take 1 big flow and turn into to small flows, but will not combine 2 small flows into 1 large flow.

But you can see it for yourself with a simple test. Make a ship with 2 LFO tanks attached to the front of the bicoupler and 1 rocket engine on the back. Alt-right-click on both tanks so you can see how much fuel is in them both at once, and then start the engine.

I blame my persistent HUTA (Head Up The ... ) syndrome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about this? It\u0027s another thing Kasuha painstakingly researched.... The way multiple engines draw from multiple intakes is solely a function of the order the parts are attached to the plane, which determines the order in which the parts are listed in the .craft file. IOW, you have to attach the intakes for 1 engine, then that engine, then the intakes for the next engine, then that engine, etc. If you violate this rule, such as by attaching all the intakes, then all the engines, the 1st engine on the list will take all the air it can use from all the intakes listed above it in the .craft file and the engines after the 1st have to fight over what\u0027s left, so they\u0027ll flame out sooner. This usually means you\u0027ll have to NOT use symmetry when attaching intakes and engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T08:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t it work fairly well with symmetry on whole assemblies?
