You have to hold the save down for a couple seconds for it to save and tap the quickload button for it to load.

If you have another flight that was in progress, and had a quicksave before it crashed, you can use that one... but if the quicksave predates the launch of the other craft, you\u0027re out of luck\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MET?","CreatedById":31950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-26T02:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now I think Im out of luck, but my keys wont work.
