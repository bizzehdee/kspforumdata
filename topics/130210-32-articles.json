That\u0027s an interesting question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally, my guidelines were:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I (obviously) have plans for Camwise and Bartdon, so I (probably)\u00A0won\u0027t allow them to die before they have accomplished these tasks (ie: reload quicksave).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Anyone else is fair game, whether it is due to an\u00A0accident, or for the purposes of story-telling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn reality, things have become more complicated over time. For a start, Cam and Bartdon have been with me/us for more than three years, now. I don\u0027t know about you, but personally I\u0027ve become quite attached to the old b*ggers. It would be sloppy and disappointing for\u00A0my readers if I had to write \u0022Well, sorry guys, Bartdon\u0027s dead because I stalled the aircraft he took on a routine flight from Hammaguir to Bonny Island,\u0022 or \u0022Camwise died a lonely and futile\u00A0death in deep space because Froemone / the author\u00A0forgot to add enough units of life-support-whatever\u00A0to his ship.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we have some important secondary characters (Lisabeth, Catbeth, Froemone, Steledith, Angun, etc...). I\u0027ve been spending as much time as possible developing them\u00A0for several reasons. First of all, to alleviate the tedium of Bartdon\u0027s bluster and Camwise\u0027s existential crises. Secondly, to raise the stakes if/when the time comes to get rid of them. And finally, they make up a reserve of characters who could take up the mantle of\u00A0narrator if something \u003Cem\u003Edoes\u003C/em\u003E happen to one of our homies. (*shudders\u00A0at the mere thought of having to write Steledith in 1st-person...*)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, I won\u0027t strike off a main character \u0027cause I spilled\u00A0my beer during final approach to landing. However, I don\u0027t want to cheat with my designs. If a vessel is not capable of saving a character from a given situation, then it just won\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI apologise\u00A0if this makes for some lame story-telling. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E is \u003Cem\u003Ehard\u003C/em\u003E. If I screw up during the design phase and send a character off to Uranus in it, then that\u0027s too bad. I do spend a lot of time planning and testing, though. This is one of the reasons why all this takes so long, and why some of my craft are so over-engineered. Planning an exciting storyline, only to find out it is not possible with the ship (that you launched several in-game years earlier, and several months in real life) when you finally arrive at your destination is one of the things that keeps me up at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to answer your original question, it depends, I suppose. If I get rid of a main character, it \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E be entertaining for the reader. However, despite all the story-telling, I am still trying to \u003Cem\u003Eplay a game\u003C/em\u003E, and if everything is written in advance, that\u0027s no longer a game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way, for those of you who have read through the Logs, I\u0027m genuinely interested: which of the following scenes did you find the most convincing and/or dramatic when you first read them..?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130210-the-camwise-logs-moondust-messiah/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2678526\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ECamwise saving Cernin from destruction\u003C/a\u003E, Margaret\u0027s death.

Amongst other things, she ran an extensive campaign of hydroacoustic research across most of the world\u0027s oceans.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CColour me damned surprised...\u201D I muttered. \u201CAnd so, she found the Surgeon?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNo, she didn\u0027t. She missed it,\u201D said Tifal. \u201CYou\u0027ve seen how isolated this location is. The nearest hydrophone was hundreds of kilometres away and the signal was almost completely lost in background noise. However, when I learned that she wouldn\u0027t be coming home, I had a second look at the data. It took me months, and I had to rewrite her algorithm several times. But by late Year 9, I was pretty sure that there was something that I couldn\u0027t explain in this area. But by that point, there was no-one with whom I could confide in. That\u0027s when I met Sidke.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThis was our darkest secret and our greatest burden,\u201D said Sidke, his tone glacial. \u201CIt took us three years to confirm Tifal\u0027s discovery, and we only managed to set up this research station two years ago. The events that took place during your mission to Mars made it clear that we should move forward with the utmost urgency and create this platform, but you must understand that it was our greatest gamble yet.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou mean you kept this station secret for more than two years?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThanks to the dedication of Nephia and Granie, we managed to pass off the entire operation as research on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI felt a sudden surge of nostalgia for a time when performing scientific research had meant just that: gathering data to prove or disprove a hypothesis, nothing more, nothing less. That time was long-gone now. I sighed and looked away out of the window at the ocean. \u201CSo, what is down there exactly?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe same type of structure as the one found under the Pacific,\u201D said Tifal, \u201Cand, we assume, as the one you discovered on the Moon. It\u0027s a large slab of what looks like black glass that seems to be some sort of medium for data storage. We took all possible precautions to avoid disturbing it and set up an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E on the sea bed. Communication with the Surgeon is possible via a hydrophone to a building on the other side of the station. We gave it a couple of encyclopaedias and a bunch of audio archives to learn our language from, but otherwise it is completely isolated from the outside world. That prefab is the only place where we can talk to it.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Yy3FQlc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Yy3FQlc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAnd what have you learned from it so far?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CPrincipal Investigator,\u201D said Sidke, standing. \u201CWhy don\u0027t you come with me and find out for yourself?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nLeaving the others behind in the briefing room, Sidke lead me across the station to the building that sat alone in one corner of the platform. I shuffled along beside him, wondering what the hell I was going to say to the Surgeon. As we reached the entrance, I hesitated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022u41QroE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/u41QroE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nAfter two years trapped on an island with no-one to talk to, I was about to interrogate another one of these alien super-intelligences.

You can ask it whatever you think may be useful,\u201D said Sidke softly, as if reading my mind. \u201CRemember, none of what is said here will leave this room. There is still a lot that it is unable to tell us but it seems to want to cooperate. It\u0027s even quite friendly and pleasant to talk to...\u201D he paused as a shadow crossed his face, \u201C...that is, until the reality of what it\u0027s saying hits you.

It was difficult to get a sense of scale, but it seemed taller than I had imagined. Above all, it was completely uniform, cold and lifeless. No movement. No flashing lights as it spoke, nor the merest trace of any sentient reaction. Strangely enough, it seemed far more alien than any organic creature I could possibly conjure up in my imagination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere was a small control panel in the centre of the table. \u201CPress here to talk to it,\u201D said Sidke. \u201CHere, look...\u201D He flicked a switch. \u201CHello, Surgeon.

Its voice was richer and deeper than that of the Second Engineer. It had obviously had had much more time to study accents and speech patterns, and for some reason had decided to project itself as one of the upper class gentlekerbs of southern Albion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COh, hello old chap.

Mars is completely barren.

Didn\u0027t you see the stromatolites all over the damned shop?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nMy head spinning, I glanced at Sidke once more. \u201CThe samples we brought back...\u201D I whispered. \u201CDid you..?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI didn\u0027t need to finish my sentence. Sidke gave an almost imperceptible nod and a wave of conflicting emotions swept over me. Tifal must have studied the rocks that we had recovered from the depths of Valles Marineris and brought home onboard \u003Cem\u003EQuissac\u003C/em\u003E. She had found the tell-tale signs of bacterial mats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI felt a rush of elation followed immediately by numbing disappointment as the realisation hit me. In a parallel universe without alien robots, I would have gone down as one of the most important academic figures in history. Instead, the presence of fossilised bacteria on Mars was merely a mildly interesting footnote in the grand scheme of things. Clearly, the universe couldn\u0027t care less about my ego. And there was more...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYou just have to dig a little deeper, you know,\u201D said the Surgeon. \u201CUnder the polar ice-caps, or in places where the sub-surface ice-sheets melt. There are whole lakes of the stuff. In any case, we couldn\u0027t find a single drop of liquid water that didn\u0027t contain some sort of bacteria or archaea and its whole host of accompanying viruses and plasmids. That\u0027s what really ruined our day. It was almost as bad as on Earth.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBut you\u0027re a robot... \u003C/em\u003EI thought. And then, I remembered. \u003Cem\u003EColonisation Mission Seven.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CBack up a minute, would you?\u201D I said. \u201CYou and your Crewmates were trying to find a suitable place for your Creators to live in our System, is that correct?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSpot on old chap, and judging from the observations that were made by our space telescopes the Sol System was damned promising indeed. Two gas giants and a bunch of rocky planets, one of which had an atmospheric profile that suggested life on its surface... I don\u0027t know why they didn\u0027t send Mission One here in the first place. Something to do with its distance from our home system, if I recall correctly.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThen what went wrong? You say both Earth and Mars turned out to be impossible to colonise?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COh, certainly not impossible... Let\u0027s just say that things turned out to be much more complicated than we had expected. Ironically, due to one of the things that brought us here in the first place: the life already present in this system.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOne by one, the meanings of the images transmitted by the datacores were slowly beginning to make sense. Their ship near Mars, near Earth, and the bacteria being infected...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYour Creators got sick..?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CNot our Creators as such, if I may be so pedantic,\u201D the Surgeon replied. \u201CRather, all of the microbes that accompany them. They were overwhelmed by the locals. We managed to hatch a couple of test subjects, but they were unable to digest the food we had, nor were we able to grow any more to feed them. Many of their other vital functions were also impaired. Building the complete ecosystem necessary for their survival proved to be... difficult. All complex life is entirely dependent on these little critters, yourselves included. I should know, I dissected enough of your ancestors during our initial study of your species.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe bile rose to the back of my throat at this last admission. I began to understand Sidke\u0027s warning about crawling skin. I took a deep breath, trying to keep my cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo, the blasted Sol System\u0027s immune system rejected your Creators, eh?\u201D I avoided adding \u003Cem\u003EGood for us...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes, old chap, in a sense. It wasn\u0027t insurmountable, of course. The Head Scientist and I started experimental work on genetic modifications that would have made our microfauna more robust to infection and transfer of genetic material. It would probably have worked, but it was a time-consuming process. In the meantime, the Captain and the rest of the crew headed off into the outer system in search of a more pristine environment, hoping to find someplace more immediately suitable on the icy moons of your gas giants. They left me to do the dirty work.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThe dirty work?\u201D I wondered, not quite sure if I really wanted to know what the Surgeon meant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes, getting rid of you Kerbals, old chap. \u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI winced. Sidke was now staring at me intently. Why did I get the impression that this whole conversation was some sort of litmus test?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhy, Surgeon?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COrders, dear chap. Merely my orders.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI grit my teeth and puffed out my chest. \u201CWell, I hope you were better at surgery than you were at damned kerbocide. In case you hadn\u0027t noticed, there\u0027s still quite a few of us moping around this blasted planet. And other planets too now, I hear.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COh yes,\u201D said the Surgeon, shrugging off the jibe. \u201CIt was a close-cut thing, though. Your ancestors were in a pretty sorry state to begin with, if you must know. Ten thousand of your kind spread thinly across a single continent. Towards the end of the process, I managed to whittle you down to just a few hundred individuals from half a dozen settlements. Of all the other creatures on your home planet, you were the only ones that possessed anything resembling potential intelligence. Our situation was complex enough. We couldn\u0027t afford matters to be made even more difficult by competition, even way down the line. So you had to go. Don\u0027t take it personally, old chap.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe Surgeon\u0027s words struck me like a slap in the face. They made perfect sense. How could we have been so na\u00EFve all this time? And yet...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CAnd yet, we are still here.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D said the Surgeon, his tone suddenly grave. \u201CThe counter-order came in just in time. These were the last instructions I ever received directly from the Captain. \u003Cem\u003ECancel all previous directives. Protect the Kerbals. Keep them alive.\u003C/em\u003E This came only hours after the start of the gamma-ray spike and loss of contact with the \u003Cem\u003ETransmare\u003C/em\u003E. It was the last I ever heard from any of my crewmates.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThere was a pregnant silence. The Surgeon seemed to mull things over before adding \u201CGood job too, don\u0027t you know. I was getting quite attached to you little green savages.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CWhat did we need protection from, Surgeon?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CYour world was dying, Bartdon. The ozone layer had taken a massive beating. The most immediate danger was from ultra-violet radiation, and very quickly land vegetation and trees began to waste away. There was no shade or shelter, so I had to lead your ancestors underground. We took to the caves. Meanwhile, a thick shroud of smog enveloped the entire planet. Nitrous oxide in the upper atmosphere. Temperatures plummeted, and then most of the sea-creatures were gone too, from the smallest plankton to the mightiest \u003Cem\u003Eleviathan\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CKeeping the tiny population of Kerbals alive pushed me to the very limits of my abilities and resources, but I had no choice but to comply with the Captain\u0027s orders. I managed to develop working ecosystems that they could learn to maintain themselves with the subterranean life that was available. I even made some genetic modifications to certain species to make them more suitable for farming. I must take the blame for that foul fish-paste you still eat today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIt was a miserable existence. Your folk blundered about in the dark for generations. Hell, those poor chaps didn\u0027t even have anything to build a decent fire with. The population dwindled further. Bartdon, every single Kerbal alive today literally descends from a few dozen individuals who made it through those dark times. And don\u0027t get me started on the problems of inbreeding. But it worked. Many generations later, the conditions on the surface began to improve, and here we are.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nThe room grew darker as the sun sank towards the horizon. \u003Cem\u003EAnd here we are...\u003C/em\u003E I sat slumped in my chair, as if crushed by the weight of the Surgeon\u0027s dark narrative.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHow did you end up here, on the bottom of the ocean?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IpocLnH.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/IpocLnH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CMy Crewmates and I were built to last. But we are not immortal, Bartdon. After hundreds of years of intense use, my locomotion system was barely functional. There are certain maintenance operations that only the highest-tier constructs are authorised to carry out, and even they do not have the permission to self-replicate. Once I was sure that the Kerbals would survive, my mission was complete. I had your folk remove my datacore and place it in a boat they built from the remains of my physical structure. They cast me adrift on a river that flowed away out to sea. Eventually, the boat sank. I came to rest where you find me here today.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CHow did you get to Earth in the first place? Was it on a ship like the one we found on the Moon?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CIndeed, dear chap. I suppose you\u0027ll want to know where I left it parked, eh? Well, you would have to put that question to my old friend the Second Mate who was that last one to use it. Although I gather that he has already been accounted for \u2013 on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean \u2013 so he\u0027s not going to be answering any time soon. You\u0027ll just have to keep looking for it, I\u0027m afraid.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nExasperated, I stood and may my way over to the windows that faced seawards and gazed out across the ocean, trying to make sense of all that the Surgeon had said. It certainly seemed to suggest that something I had feared ever since I had heard the Martian Transmission was indeed correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSurgeon,\u201D I called out. \u201CWe were kept alive for a reason. Do you have any idea why?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CI can think of many possible reasons,\u201D said the Surgeon promptly, \u201Cbut speculation is a matter best left to organic beings old chap, not to us constructs.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDamn you blasted machine, that\u0027s too easy... \u003C/em\u003EI thought. \u003Cem\u003EYou were going to eliminate every damned Kerbal on the planet. Those were your mission directives. There must have been a damned good reason for you to change your minds.\u003C/em\u003E The bile rose at the back of my throat once more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COne more thing,\u201D I rasped through clenched teeth. \u201CHow did you kill off all those Kerbal settlements, before you got the counter-order from your Captain?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201COh, that was easy, dear chap,\u201D said the Surgeon amiably. \u201CAll it took was a simple nerve poison in each settlement\u0027s water supply. I had the Head Scientist engineer it specifically to combat your species. It didn\u0027t even have to be very powerful, just enough to take out the infants. After that, I just had to be patient.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI looked over at Sidke but his head was bowed. Trembling with fury, I strode over to the microphone sitting on the desk and spoke into it very clearly and deliberately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThank you for those clarifications, Surgeon. I am now going to summon the very best technology my pathetic race of savages can field and travel to the outer Sol System. I intend to pack a very powerful mining charge for each and every last one of your damned crewmates. I\u0027ll be thinking about what you just told me when I set the detonators. I\u0027ll be saving one with your name on it for when I get back, of course.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CGood luck with that, old chap,\u201D said the Surgeon. \u201CIt was nice meeting you.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nI stormed out onto the deck and let the cool evening air wash over me. I wandered over to the edge of the platform and looked out across the ocean once more. It felt good to be back out in the open. The atmosphere of the dark, cramped little room had simply become too oppressive, too rank with the ghostly echoes of my ancestors and their dealings with an adversary that had been above and beyond them in every way that mattered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nIt simply hadn\u0027t been a fair fight.

The Surgeon\u0027s description of our near-extermination was chilling, as was the destruction of Earth\u0027s ozone layer and the mass-extinctions that followed. Had their ship been the cause of this? If so, their technology was far beyond anything we could dream of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nFootsteps plodded slowly and deliberately across the metal deck at my back. Sidke had joined me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CSo, Principal Investigator. May I ask what you have concluded from your discussion with the Surgeon?\u201D His voice was tense, anxious. This was the real litmus test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201CThey need us for something.

He stood next to me and gazed out across the waters himself, as if listening for answers in the endless crash of the ocean swell.

The Resource Companies had very specific goals in mind when they sent you to Mars: to gain access to advanced technology. I have to be sure that we\u0027re past that stage now. Any intelligence that helps us seek out and destroy the remaining Crewmates is fair game, but anything else-\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u201C-is to be strapped to the biggest rocket we have and fired into damned Sol,\u201D I cut in. \u201CI don\u0027t need any lectures on that part, Sidke.
