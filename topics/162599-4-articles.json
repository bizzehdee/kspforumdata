The cost for a flight has everything to do with launch, and much less to do with duration for the regime of short stays (a couple weeks or a couple days have little cost difference I would imagine).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssume ITS (lol, we\u0027re assuming super heavies, right?). Booster and ship are supposedly on the order of 500 M$, but good for 1000 flights for booster, 12 for spaceship. The spaceship flights can really be doubled (2 take offs per flight, 2 entries). Long duration, too.

If the 10M spaceship costs per launch can be reduced due to much lower requirements for a short hop, then this could become even cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSafety is the kicker here, though.

You can treat each third stage as part of the payload, so that the second stage places your entire payload stack into an almost-orbit, all four payloads plus their stages are released, and each one circularizes and then does its own transfer to the desired\u00A0orbit. On the other hand, if you can make propellant transfer work, then you can use a larger second stage and a single, small third stage with a heat shield. The second stage establishes a parking orbit with significant residual propellant, and then the third stage takes the first payload to its desired orbit and then does a short deorbit burn at apogee to aerobrake back into LEO.
