I think they were still technically keeping the 6-engine option in play for a \u0022lite\u0022 Ares V alternative, largely due to cost considerations (six RS-68s were still cheaper than 5 SSMEs) and how the baseline mission profile was changing about every 15 minutes (less lift capacity required = less caring about the performance hit from the 6 vs. 5 configuration). There was, if I recall correctly, a lot of politicking inside and outside NASA about this.... (I think PWR wanted to push things towards the RS-68 option, because they could then go and use the RS-68B on the Delta IV and make some $ off it it, making it a better business proposition for them. The only use for the SSME would have been Ares V.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: But I still think the SSME would have won, mainly because the RS-68 hasn\u0027t been man-rated yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sax Man Aeronautics","CreatedById":65964,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T23:41:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I try opening the Buran model in the VAB, it says \u0022missing part Buran Manipulator\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T00:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you downloaded the robotic arms pack?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T01:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Good_Apollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou guys are trolling the **** out of Bobcat.
