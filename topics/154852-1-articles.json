One day, I decided to use my headphones (logitech G35) for a bit. While the game was open, I switched back to my speakers, but that didn\u0027t work. This usually means you just have to relaunch the game.\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that didn\u0027t work. When I have my speakers as my default audio device, KSP refuses to make any sound whatsoever. It is not muted in the volume mixer, but it does appear there. The crazy part is, the audio DOES work on my headphones (when I have those selected as audio device).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in short: KSP plays no sound when speakers are default audio devices, but the sound works fine when using my headphones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried resetting setting, re-installing the game (to a different directory) and rebooting multiple times.

All it does have are settings about audio volume for different kind of game sounds, and for the \u0022sound normalizer\u0022. All sounds are processed by the system (e.g., by DirectX in Windows) and other specialized software. Please check if you have other games showing the same issue (sound playing only from headphones), that would help finding where the issue really is. In case it only happens with KSP, I\u0027d look if audio drivers are actually ok in the log files (please provide them as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83211-known-issues-amp-self-help/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Edescribed here\u003C/a\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Killbeam","CreatedById":173634,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-11T23:31:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked, and it only happens to KSP.
