By mounting a bunch of control surfaces on the bottom facing down and backward (the amount they\u0027re tilted backward affects the level hover speed), the \u0022lift\u0022 created by these control surfaces will always produce a force equal and opposite gravity in the vertical direction. However, because the control surfaces are tilted, a component of the force generated is also in horizontal direction. This is what propels the buggy forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, because the component of the force in the vertical direction never exceeds the force of gravity, an external force (mono prop engines in this case) are required for the buggy to gain altitude. Once at the desired altitude, no more fuel is required to stay there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPitching the buggy fore and aft changes the magnitude of the horizontal component of the \u0022lift\u0022 force, thus controlling your speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003EHOW TO OPERATE\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-EVA kerbal from attached capsule, and board the external command seat in the buggy\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage once to decouple from empty capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-(from here on out, SAS is highly recommend)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Stage once to activate mono prop engines and throttle up to gain speed/altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Once you are as high as you like, cut the engines and relax as your Infinity Buggy gently hovers along\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-At this point, the buggy flies much like a plane (in terms of controls). You can do loops, barrel rolls, ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImportant: The relationship between throttle/pitch and speed/altitude is counter-intuitive (for my fellow real-life pilots out there, this will be familiar). To gain altitude, open the throttle (increase thrust). To gain airspeed, pitch forward (not too much!). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for descending, there are a couple ways. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Pitch forward until the control surfaces are past horizontal. This will result in a dive (and you will gain speed)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

I found that putting the control surfaces on at a 45 degree angle achieved this beautifully. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I tried giving the buggy a roll cage, but everything I tried just looked goofy.
