(Yes, I know it\u0027s not a perfect simulation of real life- but it\u0027s the closest consumer-grade simulation you\u0027re going to get.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, I\u0027m HORIFFICALLY bad at it. Part of this is due to the limitations of the computer that I\u0027m running it on- it\u0027s a Mac, which has an even lower memory limit than Windows, so \u0022critical existence failures\u0022 are quite common. Another part of is that I JUST started playing with RemoteTech, so it\u0027s quite common for me to lose line-of-sight communications.... oh.... just as I need to perform final circularization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, here\u0027s the list of AstroLift flights prior to me making this thread:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CvwGbgw.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CvwGbgw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAL-01: Successful SSTO test, deploying a 1.17 ton communications satellite into a 200x120 orbit with high inclination. Took about 10 test flights until it worked. (Would be less if the RS-25 was restartable, which it should be- it\u0027s an excellent engine for SSTOs- had to include 3 extra restartable hydrolox engines to offset this fact. PLEASE make TEATEB MFT compatible, NathanKell...) Sadly, SSTO was not recoverable due to me not including enough fuel, or parachutes, or indeed any recovery equipment of any kind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/51Mlnnj.png\u0022 alt=\u002251Mlnnj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAL-02: Test 1 of the \u0022Magnum Dragon\u0022 lifter: a TSTO with 4 Falcon 1Ds on the first stage, 4 RD-120s on the second. 5 ton payload.
