In regards to your questions about landing and positioning, you can use one of two methods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The skycrane method. Google \u0022mars skycrane\u0022 and you should have a good idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The piggyback method. Simply build a nice lander with space on top. Your base module will ride piggyback style on the lander to the surface. Once landed, you can simply drive the base component up to the rest of your base and dock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouhou torpedo has a nice set of (probably outdated) wheels that are invaluable to base contruction. They can move forwards, backwards, AND sideways! Like a crab. Without pictures, that\u0027s as well as I can explain the issue.
