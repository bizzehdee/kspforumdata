He was to accompany us all the way from Illasticonia to Kerbin. We had already been rushed up their space elevator (WAAAAY more spectacular than Kerbin\u0027s!) and onto a transfer ship, but it was night so there wasn\u0027t much to see.

It is an evolution of the Tauquantum Gate, which was\u00A0originally conceptualized by the Draftignarians, Ziquunodians, and (unintelligible clicking and screeching sounds) at the same time independently.\u00A0The first one was built by as a Galactic effort back when there were less than thirty or so planets that were members. The evolution from Tauquantum gates to Neutron bolts took many more decades.\u0022 There was a clunk as the pod we were in detached from the massive machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022MRCaBWb.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MRCaBWb.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It promptly exploded during its first test, but several years later there was another attempt, and it worked. It would be several more years before there was a companion launcher to make the whole system point to point capable though, and - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is entertaining and all, but a brief overview of what it is would be better than a history lesson right now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, of course. A Neutron bolt is a practical application of -\u002B2e*sqrt(tau/i)quantum gate technology, also called Tauquantum Gates, although that is a very casual inaccurate name.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Simpler please,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course, sorry. In one particular quantum spectrum, specifically the \u002B-2e*sqrt(tau/i) quantum spectrum, matter exists as a type of quantum matter wave, and can travel at insanely high speeds unobstructed by matter if given enough energy. As an object moves through this, for lack of a better word, dimension, it interacts severely with the spectrum\u0027s field itself. It\u0027s a bit like re-entering an atmosphere. All ships going through this spectrum must have an extreme amount of shielding, by the way, which is why our ship is designed like it is. Better shielding is in the works, but its been in the works for a long time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A lot of shielding, but\u00A0standard glass windows,\u0022 I muttered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022EX3jYca.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EX3jYca.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Reinforced and shielded windows that are not exposed to the Field Stream unless something seriously wrong happens. As ships travel through the spectrum, they decelerate and lose energy exponentially with velocity, although the energy itself continues\u00A0with far less resistance. This limited Tauquantum gates to very short ranges, as once you drop below the minimum speed needed to maintain a proper field barrier you are converted back into matter and placed back into the real world, really far away. Fortunately, you can recapture the energy spent with a catcher. A catcher can also absorb energy from the craft if designed well, greatly reducing energy cost, and can take you out of the spectrum at a fixed point. Even without a catcher, accuracy is now at the point where you could drop into the sphere of influence of a particular planet, but not any more than that. If you were aiming for a Moon, God help you... In the early days, though, you were lucky to get in the right star system.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022EVzSIqC.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EVzSIqC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022However, one day a clever Seiu theorized for reasons too complicated to explain that neutron stars interacted with this field. It took a long time to prove, but basically Neutron stars are extremely polar and oscillate nearly unpredictably in this particular spectrum. They are also good at absorbing energy and pouring it back into anything that passes through it. It took a long time to accomplish and even longer to perfect, but you can predict how a neutron star will osculate out a few seconds. If you point your Tauquantum gate in the right direction, and we\u0027re talking exact, you can fire a ship into a neutron star, which will capture the lost energy, redirect it to the ship when it gets there, and shoot it out another direction based on which way the neutron star is pointing at that given moment! The stars aren\u0027t perfect, but can extend the range of Tauquantum gates by a few orders of magnitude if used correctly.\u00A0You can go across the galaxy in just a few minutes if you need to.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Half of those words made sense on their own,\u0022 Evelina said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So...

It happens several times a second, at this scale though. Nobody in their right mind would need to synchronize a hundred neutron stars unless they were going for a record or really needed to book it across the galaxy... But there are better ways of doing that. Realistically, we are more limited by traffic than oscillations.

It is incredibly unprofessional for a Galactic Representative to be forming bonds with members of a species currently under an acceptance test.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Accepta-\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bye.\u0022 Jeb slammed the door of his plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027d back up if I were you, quickly,\u0022 said Dafsil. We all scrambled down the stairs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022ULsVfKJ.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ULsVfKJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb\u0027s engines quickly spooled up as he launched into the sky and flew dramatically away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022dDf5axd.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dDf5axd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Friends with a Galactic Representative... Cherish that title, few bear it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022No. I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t admit that. I can\u0027t feel that. Not now. I need to focus everything on the war. It would be a stretch even if there wasn\u0027t a war going on... And if it lasts? I have to watch them grow old and die. I don\u0027t know if I could do that again.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022You hypocrite. Saying you need\u00A0to focus on the war while personally escorting your \u0022friends\u0022 around in a sports plane.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t show it that much, but I was fairly elated to be back on Kerbin. The fresh air, the normal colored sky... I wasn\u0027t allowed to talk to them, of course, but there were more than a few humans within a mile of me for the first time in a long time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter we got into the building, we were told to disable our disguises. We obliged. They put us in what appeared to be a standard office room and locked the door. \u0022Stay here,\u0022 they told us. \u0022We\u0027re still getting your proper rooms ready. Don\u0027t think about running away, not that you would. We will have guards in the hallway just in case. If you need anything you can talk to them through the intercom!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I need some rest,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s probably been less than two hours, maybe even one, since you snuck out of your hospital room in Illasticonia not being able to sleep.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well it\u0027s been a very full two hours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not our fullest.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... Are we going to do anything?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you mean?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For the sake of argument, maybe run off?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, why?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe we could get back into space and help somehow, and it would also extend the adventure.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s a bad idea. A terribly bad idea. I hope I don\u0027t have to explain why.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah.\u0022 We stood around for a few \u00A0seconds. \u0022Explain why anyway. It might help us think of something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027d be two teenage humans walking\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Estraight\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0into a meeting\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eclearly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0set up to show how powerful The Species is in comparison to our galaxy. Walking straight into a trap. You\u0027re proposing suicide. By all logic, we shouldn\u0027t even be alive now!\u00A0This isn\u0027t a movie. While our luck may make it seem\u00A0otherwise, there is no writer, no director to save us. We can\u0027t just keep on throwing ourselves at danger and expect to be caught at the last minute.\u0022 She was silent for a few seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Unless...\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why are we still alive?\u0022 she asked, with an intense yet ponderous expression on her face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sheer dumb luck?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. There may not be a director, per se, but there are equivalents.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EOh.\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Namely, God or Gods, and The Species. Both are possible, I guess, but focusing on the latter...\u00A0We\u0027ve heard from Jeb that The Species are incredibly methodical with everything they do. Conquering the universe as efficiently as possible. They are probably manipulating a whole bunch of stuff behind the scenes to make it easier for them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And they attacked us with two ships several times more advanced than ours, with pulsed warp or whatever, lasers, and who knows what else. We had four comparatively primitive nuclear weapons. We shouldn\u0027t have survived.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, no kidding. We fell into a gas giant, and only survived due to several things lining up perfectly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So you\u0027re saying that it was The Species who almost killed us and purposely let us live?\u0022 I didn\u0027t say it, but I was slightly deflated at the prospect of my miraculous piloting of the Wyvern having been partially if not fully a farce.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Possibly. You\u0027re probably the most important human alive right now, with far reaching fame and deep connections behind the scenes. We\u0027re both alive despite the numerous near death experiences we\u0027ve had. We\u0027ve been through more than many people would have in a thousand lifetimes... And we are alive. If they are any bit as strong as they claim to be, then they are keeping you and I\u00A0alive for a reason. Nudging us towards something. Something that will benefit them.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If that is true, then we are\u00A0nothing more than gamepieces in their master plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we are, then I can\u0027t imagine this ends well for us...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Assuming its The Species and not a coincidence or God or something... Then yeah. If their goal is to run the universe in the most efficient way possible, once we\u0027ve served our purpose then I\u0027d imagine they\u0027d likely do away with us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That implies that we have a purpose in their plan. The question becomes, what is our purpose?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No.\u0022 she turned around to face me again and grinned. \u0022The question becomes, how do we mess up their plan as much as possible?\u0022 It clicked. My eyes widened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, that\u0027s genius... But I can\u0027t see that ending well for us either.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re right. But if there is a fraction of a fraction of a chance that we can shift the situation even slightly in our favor, it is our duty to try.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow. Dramatic.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Because it is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So why would they do what they did to us in that specific way? What benefit could dropping us into Jool and having us miraculously survive\u00A0have for them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good question. Inflating our egos so we try something risky later? Making us into heroes to thwart later on? Giving us, and the rest of the galaxy, a false sense of hope that we could actually beat The Species?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Valid... Although our exploits would have to be made public for us to be heroes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That can\u0027t be too difficult. You\u0027re already pretty famous for the Voyager mission.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah... Never, until it happened,\u00A0did I think that the Voyager mission would actually take a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eback seat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to something else.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anyways... Assuming we are being used for something, we should make it our priority to get into another precarious situation and throw a major wrench into the works.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All fine and dandy... But what if they wanted us to have this conversation? What if we\u0027re supposed to do something which we think will hurt them but will actually help them?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That is a very good point... So once we get to a point where we can do something important, we do the most random thing we can think of.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hypothetically at least. There\u0027s a lot more we need to do, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, its not like we can go up to Jeb and ask for a spaceship and fly it to the center of the galaxy.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027d definitely have to sneak off. We do still have the disguises, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And don\u0027t forget. We need to clone you this time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We should clone you too, Ethan. If we do it right, and our clones get back in time,\u00A0they won\u0027t even know we left. Then we can do both Kerbin\u0027s plan and our plan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Good idea. Slight problem.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There would be three of me. Two is hard enough on the other me.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True... Could you do recombination of consciousness?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It took the Jool incident for me to get it the first time. Almost no chance of me doing it again without either a lot more training or another experience similar to Jool.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True. The galaxy is at stake here, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Before I know it there will be a dozen Ethans...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022More chances to mess with the Species I guess?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ignoring that, say we actually decide to do this. How would we? How would we get to that meeting at the center of the galaxy?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022These Kerbals don\u0027t bother with security much, because why would they? Their crime rates are probably near zero. It should be fairly easy to get around as long as we maintain our disguises.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True, I guess. We would be stealing a spaceship though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. So?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022So?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never mind. If you haven\u0027t noticed, we\u0027ve sort of been locked in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no, a scary office door with a lock!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They really want us to stay here. It may not be much by human standards, but they cared enough to give us quite a bit of security by their standards.\u0022 Evelina walked over to one of the room\u0027s windows\u00A0and opened it effortlessly. She gestured to the outside.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yup. Quite a bit of security,\u0022 she said. She stepped one foot out of the window.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait. We\u0027re not actually doing this, are we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I thought we were.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean, we have some points, but I thought it was all hypothetical! We can\u0027t actually steal a spaceship and fly towards possibly the greatest assembly of power in the galaxy to attempt to disrupt the Species invasion!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I would like to not die, thank you very much!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I would like for the galaxy to not die, thank\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0very much!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022True... But Evelina, this is madness. If we have any chance of saving the galaxy, the Species will have calculated all of it. Maybe they even calculated this! Maybe this is what they want us to do!\u0022 She stopped for a second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u0022True. Maybe they are influencing our thoughts right now.\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And\u00A0we have no way of knowing which way is the correct way.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re going both ways.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Which means that The Species might be guaranteed to get what they want.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay... Agh. Why can\u0027t there be a clear path forwards?\u0022 I slumped down in defeat. Evelina came back inside and closed the window. We sat there for a short while. \u0022How badly could we mess this up?\u0022 she asked me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You mean mess our chances up or theirs?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ours.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If they are as powerful as they claim to be, they wouldn\u0027t let us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But if we went, what are the chances we\u0027d do more harm than good?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How am I supposed to know?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ethan, whatever we do, we\u0027re going to need to make a decision soon.\u0022 She stepped up and opened the window again. \u0022All those stars out there. I don\u0027t know how many of them have life around them, but some of them do. They don\u0027t have much time left. We may not have much of a chance at all, but if there is a chance, no matter how small, to save them, we should take it.\u0022 She stepped out of the window and looked up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only if the chance of us helping is greater than our chance of hurting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we hurt everyone, then what\u0027s the loss? It\u0027s enslavement and death one way, or enslavement and death the other way.\u0022 I stepped out of the window, sitting on the edge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well... It\u0027s a point. It only makes sense if we are, in fact, in a unique position where we are so important that our chance is worth jeopardizing all of the galaxy\u0027s chances.\u0022 I looked upwards, in the process hitting my head. I lost balance and fell\u00A0forwards out of the window. \u0022AAA!\u0022 I fell diagonally but headfirst\u00A0on top of Evelina. I felt a sharp pain in my neck. \u0022AAA!\u0022 I shouted again, this time from pain and not surprise.\u00A0There was a click as the door to our room opened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, Ethan, Evelina? We\u0027re ready for you!\u0022 a Kerbal called. Evelina clamped her hand over my mouth, muffling my cries. \u0022Hello? Are you in here?\u0022 The Kerbal opened up various compartments looking for us.\u00A0\u0022Huh. Weird. Arfpod must have taken them to the interrogation room already.\u0022 We\u00A0heard him walk around. Somehow, he didn\u0027t notice us, or the open window. Then, we heard him walk away and close the door. Evelina spoke first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They are going to be after us in a few minutes when they realize we aren\u0027t in there. We could make up an excuse, and the Kerbals might believe it, but Jeb won\u0027t. Not right after he told us not to wander off.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022MRFF!\u0022 I screamed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, sorry!\u0022 She released her hand.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022AAAAGH! Something stabbed me!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my goodness, are you okay?\u0022 I came up to a kneeling position. There was definitely a cut in my neck. \u0022Oh no!\u0022 She was extremely concerned and began\u00A0examining the cut. I looked down. Evelina\u0027s Swiss army knife was on the ground, the largest blade opened up halfway, slightly bloodstained.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Evelina, the knife.\u0022 She looked down and picked it up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my. I wasn\u0027t messing with it. It was closed! Inside my pocket! Ethan, I swear! I\u0027m so sorry!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I can barely get some of those attachments open on a good day. They couldn\u0027t just pop open, could they?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The chances of that would be really small. I\u0027m no medical expert, but from what I can tell, the blade didn\u0027t do any major damage. The cut is fairly shallow. I\u0027ll grab something to wrap it with.\u0022 She stood up and peeked in the window. \u0022You\u0027re very lucky. That could have easily killed you.\u0022 I was slightly relieved at this but also concerned. A thought struck me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t luck,\u0022 I said. \u0022It was a threat from The Species.\u0022 Evelina froze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How can we be sure?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re discussing how we\u0027re going up against them and then I\u0027m taken to within a fraction of an inch of death in a scenario that shouldn\u0027t have happened. This almost can\u0027t be a concidence.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So it\u0027s a threat? Like \u0022Do not do anything to stop us\u00A0or we\u0027ll kill you?\u0022 A message like \u0022We control you?\u0022 or something?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe. But you know what they just did?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They just revealed that I am a threat, but they need me alive for something.\u0022 Evelina turned back around to look at me. \u0022If I wasn\u0027t a threat, why threaten me? If they want me dead, they would have done it right there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So they need you alive, for now, but you could easily do the wrong thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So by that logic, we\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0go to the galactic center and try to mess something up.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But what if they only almost killed you to make us think we should go there? Knowing we would come to that conclusion?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well what if they wanted you to say that so would decide against going?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well what if they wanted\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to say that so we would decide to go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is like playing chess against a computer,\u0022 I declared. \u0022Um, can we get my neck wrapped up now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh right.\u0022 She turned back to the window. \u0022There\u0027s stuff in there we can use.\u0022 She hopped back in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Careful or they will see you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ill be careful!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m coming back in with you.\u0022 I climbed back into the room, trying to keep my hand over my neck. By then Evelina had found some fabric.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright. Hold still,\u0022 she said as she came near and began cutting up the fabric with the knife. Then, suddenly, the door clicked. We froze. A Kerbal opened it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Podrue, they can\u0027t just have vanished from a room!\u0022 He said very annoyed. He turned to face us. I was backed up against the wall, a cut in my neck, Evelina holding out a bloody knife. The Kerbal\u0027s face went pale. Our eyes widened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This isn\u0027t what it looks like!\u0022 Evelina said. The Kerbal panicked and ran off, shutting the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guards!\u0022 shouted the Kerbal, muffled by the door.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no,\u0022 I said. Evelina quickly applied her makeshift bandage to the cut and made for the window. \u0022Where are you going?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you think they would believe the truth?\u0022 she asked. \u0022That you just fell\u00A0on my knife that happened to be open?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can explain it to them!\u0022 I shouted. Evelina was now out of the window. I followed her trying to convince her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hide the knife! Say it was something else! He was in here for a few seconds, maybe we could make him think he mistook something else for a knife!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right,\u0022 she replied.\u00A0\u0022Quick, help me bury it!\u0022 I hopped out of the window, in the process accidentally kicking it, so that it fell and partially closed. We both started digging into the ground. We heard the door open again and froze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Arfpod, nobody is in here!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Podrue, I swear I saw them! Evelina was holding a... a...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A what?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A knife!\u0022 The people in the room gasped. \u0022And she was threatening Ethan! She had cut his throat!\u0022 More gasps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Arfpod, are you sure of what you saw? I was in here a few minutes ago and they weren\u0027t\u00A0in here! They aren\u0027t even in\u00A0here now!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I mean... Maybe the stress is getting to me... Maybe I just hallucinated the whole thing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nobody took them down to the more secure location,\u0022 reported one of the others in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. Did they run off?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022They should know better.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, why would they run off? Maybe they were kidnapped!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys? We literally just\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Elost\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0two of the most important humans on this planet, and they haven\u0027t even been here for fifteen minutes!\u00A0We need to find them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But she has a knife! What if she killed Ethan?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We don\u0027t know that for sure, but we need to be safe. I want all of our security personell equipped with shieldplane generators and tasers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Tasers, sir? Is that amount of force necessary?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Only if they try to attack and nothing else can be done.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But sir!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I want every available person who knows about how significant these two are to help us search. They can\u0027t have made it far in ten minutes. And chances are it\u0027s nothing malicious... But then again, we must be prepared.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guards, we start now. If we don\u0027t find them within an hour, we will notify both the general \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E population and higher authorities. No sense escalating this over something that could easily be nothing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait a second,\u0022 said one of them. \u0022The window is open!\u0022\u00A0He walked over to the window. We sat as still as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, I must have left it partially open by mistake,\u0022 said another Kerbal. \u0022This is my office. It got pretty warm so I opened it a tad. I probably forgot to close it before Ethan and Evelina got in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh okay.\u0022 The Kerbal closed the window and walked away, having not seen us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey briskly walked out of the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022An hour,\u0022 Evelina whispered. \u0022We have an hour.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, probably a minute until they walk around the side of the building and find us!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is an hour enough to get us cloned and two of us back here?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know how accessible cloning machines are!\u0022 I harshly whispered back. \u0022I\u0027m fairly sure my cloning wasn\u0027t exactly typical!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If we don\u0027t find them in half an hour we turn back, alright?\u0022 she asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, fine. And if we do get cloned, and try to do anything, we come back at the first sign of trouble.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sure.\u0022 She turned her Kerbal disguise on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are we actually going to do this?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can debate all day or we can try to do something.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well... If we get caught, this was your idea, alright?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Deal.\u0022 She stood up. I turned on my Kerbal disguise. \u0022They won\u0027t have a cloning machine at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u0027s both a Kerbal and human area. They aren\u0027t stupid enough to house that sort of tech within our reach. We need to get out of here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aren\u0027t there trains? Like, hyperloop style maybe?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, but where would those go? Likely more human cities.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We need to go somewhere where only Kerbals can go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The airport,\u0022 she said. \u0022I worked mission control here for months. There are regular Kerbal-only flights out of here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you know where they go?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably some place without humans.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Seems like a good bet. Could we get back here fast enough though?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably. Their planes are crazy fast.\u0022 Evelina began running towards the spaceplane hangar, with several Kerbal airliners already there like always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u00220aeoQAq.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/0aeoQAq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aaaand, were running off,\u0022 I muttered. I looked at her, running away. I looked back to the window, then back at her and back at the window again.\u00A0I flip flopped a few more times, having second thoughts\u00A0before settling back on her. \u0022Oh whatever. Here we go again,\u0022 I said,\u00A0and I ran after her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBy now, Jebediah had been through several meetings with his top advisers. One of his clones, likely clone 3 or 8, would attend the meeting. He would attend in a low tech, yet slim and durable spacesuit that had no computers to be hacked, with a slim backpack carrying several Illasticonian crystals, a quantum distress beacon, and significant stores of oxygen and water.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EHe would make the journey in a high profile ship outfitted with as much scanning equipment as possible. Beforehand, the council chamber would itself be fitted with as many sensors as possible to learn as much about The Species as possible. The ship itself would park low around a nearby star and listen in. Jebediah would approach and dock to the chamber in a small, fast and nimble spaceship that could seat eight Kerbal-sized beings, one of the smallest ships that one could fit the right engines in -\u00A0\u00A0the engines necessary to orbit a black hole at functionally though not literally several times the speed of light. The chamber had devices to allow normal ships to dock, but if something were to happen to those devices, Jeb needed to be able to escape.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EA second ship with similar but different technology would be piloted by one of the most skilled pilots Kerbin could find - not necessarily a Kerbal. Both would dock to the station, the second ship would serve as a backup.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAlthough it was heavily debated, none of the Kerbal ships would carry weapons, but the flagship\u00A0would carry armor and shields.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EAll across the galaxy, the remaining members of the Galactic Council formed similar plans with as much redundancy built in as possible. The Illasticonians, at the start of a planetwide evacuation, did not have many resources to spare, but managed to come up with a similar plan. Representative Xanth came from a less prominent world, far less rich than Illasticonia. He would hitch a ride in with the Diek representative, with their superior planning. The Jslan representative was also coming in on borrowed technology, as were many others.\u00A0The Ziquunodian representative would dock in his huge flagship in an intimidation attempt... And as a large distraction in case time was needed for other representatives to escape.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EGalactus the Cow was extremely annoyed at having to cut his last trip around the galaxy short. He took his fastest ship and had it modified specifically for the mission. Extra stealth technology and more escape options were the primary concerns.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESeveral of the galaxy\u0027s species had turned to warfare, and began to station as many weapons as possible around the black hole. Governments quarreled at whether or not they should trap the station or station troops there. Ultimately it was decided by the race that contributed the most to the station\u0027s construction. They decided no, but weapons on docked ships were fair game.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EZiquunodian days were shorter than Earth days, but longer than Kerbin days.

Several other planets did the same thing, with as much secrecy as possible. Only a few representatives knew of this plan, and they all were equipped with devices that would teleport them away, or kill them, if they even came close to uttering\u00A0a single revealing word.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EIn mere weeks, the ships would be done.

Laythe remained largely uninhabited due to the Kerbals\u0027 low radiation tolerance. Laythe Outpost 4 was built\u00A0primarily underground. All surface features had several meters of shielding.

Standard tourists would usually go to the dedicated tourism outpost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the outpost was all but a dead end in almost every way, it suffered from outdated equipment. Many of the vehicles still ran off of fossil fuels, including all of the dropships, which were most of the few aircraft that could hover. Some aircraft were nuclear powered, and could fly rapidly, but could not hover. There were solar powered airships, but they were slow, and, of course, the base had plenty of ships and submarines, but they were also slow. The outpost did, in fact, possess a few helicopters, but their range was not very good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base had halted most of its scientific operations when Cheng had crashed.

Our car was an express version, with seats on the roof, so we could slow down quickly.\u00A0Finding a way to sneak onto the elevator car without a ticket\u00A0took longer than the actual trip. If you\u0027re curious, we blended in with a larger group where one person paid up front. They counted us and noticed the discrepancy but the attendant thought she must have miscounted... The car was leaving soon, so she just waved us through.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the large hub at the top of our tower where it met R7, it was easy to find a cloning machine... Almost too easy. There was a giant sign that said \u0022CLONING CHAMBERS.\u0022 Getting in was quite a bit harder... Cloning was reserved for high risk activities, individuals of significant cultural importance, and notable leaders and politicians. They weren\u0027t going to let us in without proper identification, and that wasn\u0027t going to be easy to obtain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSneaking through the entrance, however, was scarily easy. Who knows how little the Kerbals\u0027 more important machines were protected... A society built completely on trust that everyone is altruistic would be terrifyingly easy to take down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, the machines needed to be turned on by the attendants as a precaution. So we watched for a bit. Three well dressed Kerbals were readying themselves for cloning.

They turned their heads. \u0022You\u0027re the,\u0022 she got up close and tried to subtly read their nametags and briefcases, \u0022ambassadors to Erdwa, correct?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, that\u0027s us,\u0022 said one of the Kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Someone was asking for you out there earlier, it\u0027s urgent!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just me, or?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022All of you. They sounded anxious and a bit panicky. I don\u0027t know what it was about, but you should probably check that out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thank you for bringing this to our attention,\u0022 he said. \u0022I\u0027ll bet they are talking about the Zawee projects...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are you here for?\u0022 asked one of the others, as he walked past. Evelina faltered for a second before I spoke.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We mine Illasticonian Crystals.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow. Why do you do that? Isn\u0027t it mainly Illasticonian Robots now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, mostly. They have a small unit trying to diversify, just in case.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, carry on! I wouldn\u0027t want to get stuck with that job, but I have respect for you. The worlds turn because of jobs as dangerous as yours.\u0022 The three briskly walked off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright, let\u0027s go.\u0022 Evelina opened the door to one of the chambers and I opened the door to another. \u0022Wait!\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How does this work?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If it\u0027s the same as on the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EMemories\u003C/em\u003E, you\u0027ll get injected with a whole bunch of new material and growth stimulants, and somehow your cells will duplicate and you\u0027ll split in two. But with pain medication this time, I\u0027d hope.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew that, but, you know... Does it duplicate the spacesuit?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interesting... I mean, I guess I\u0027d never thought about... Did it on the - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does it duplicate clothes?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... Oh. I mean, it did on the Memories. I think.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh okay. Let\u0027s hope these work the same.\u0022 We both entered our cloning chambers and closed the door. There was a screen and I was prompted with a choice of Species. I blinked. Would human even be on here? How many times had a human even been cloned? If it was just me then there wouldn\u0027t be an option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThankfully, human was on the list. The next prompt was, however, \u0022Warning: Insufficient information on target species. It is\u00A0recommended to remove all garments as they may present obstructions to the cloning process.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI searched for an option to clone the clothes separately. If there wasn\u0027t, it would not only be a lot of embarrassment, but a disaster for the plan... If the spacesuits were not duplicated, which pair of clones would get them? The ones going to the meeting, or the ones staying on Kerbin? Same for the clothes. And\u00A0for the disguises, too!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI searched frantically for an option. I didn\u0027t see any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Agh!\u0022 I clenched my fists. Those three would be back shortly. I heard the whir of Evelina\u0027s machine. I made up my mind, I would attempt the cloning fully clothed. It wasn\u0027t preventing it outright, so it must be safe to some degree, right? And I was cloned just fine once with clothes on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pressed next on the screen. A table rose up from the base of the chamber, angled. The screen prompted me to lay back on it. I took a deep breath and pressed start. There was a green light, presumably the machine scanning me. The door closed. The machine began to whir. Then I remembered what happened the last time I was cloned, and briefly said something out loud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whichever clone ends up on the left goes back to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Please expose veins, injections currently obstructed,\u0022 said an automated voice. The machine\u0027s whir slowed and went away. Of course. I felt so stupid. How could I be injected with tons of stuff if I had a spacesuit on? \u0022Suit will be duplicated separately, place suit within chamber.\u0022 Oh, okay. It could have told me that earlier! I took off the spacesuit, rolled up my sleeves and pants,\u00A0laid back, and pressed start again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whir started back up. The green light passed over my body again. I felt the stabbing pain of a needle in each of my limbs, which quickly dulled. Suddenly, dozens more appeared and stuck themselves into me, but I did not feel any pain. The noise intensified and a brilliant\u00A0blue light flashed on and intensified. I closed my eyes and clenched my muscles as my body expanded, bubbled out, and...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*plop*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh hey,\u0022 both of us said. \u0022Um... Left? Wow, um...\u0022 Instead of left and right, we had popped out one above the other. We were facing each other. \u0022Oh no. Um, top talks first I guess?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh okay. Um,\u0022 I stood up and turned away from me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow does the back of my head really look that weird?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Shut up, Ethan!\u0022 Bottom\u00A0Ethan stood up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you feel weird at all? Hopefully the clothes didn\u0027t make a difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, good, me neither. Spacesuit time!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, which suit do I get?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Does it really matter?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, maybe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Rock paper scissors?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can read each others minds, Ethan!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Haha!\u0022 remarked Space-Ethan from Laythe Orbit inside our heads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Just take the closest one. Now, a bigger issue... I\u0027m more left of the main hallway from the way we entered? And we said left Ethan goes back to Kerbin?\u00A0So the bottom\u00A0Ethan goes back to Kerbin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re just saying that because you are having second thoughts and want to go back to safety.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh, yeah you got me.\u00A0First number we can find in here, if it\u0027s odd you go home, if it\u0027s even I go home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Let\u0027s see...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Four. Right here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay... Aww... Now I kind of want to go...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh boy, adventure time.\u0022 I began getting into my spacesuits in two separate instances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know that would have been incredibly awkward if we had to completely take our clothes off,\u0022 thought Star-Ethan.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t think about it,\u0022 the other two thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, what are we calling ourselves now?\u0022 asked bottom Ethan. \u0022We can\u0027t both be Star-Ethan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll be Star-Ethan, You\u0027ll be Kerb-Ethan, no, Home-Ethan? Ground-Ethan? I don\u0027t know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ll stay Space-Ethan.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Guys who cares about names. I\u0027ll be Kevin for now for all I care, we need to go! We probably have under half an hour left!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Sorry.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This is going to get confusing.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Space-Ethan, I say this in the most polite way possible, shut up please.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes sir, mister polite.\u0022 By this time, Star-Ethan was in his spacesuit and Kevin was in his clothes, getting his suit on. A few seconds later, Kevin was ready as well. we took a deep breath(s?)\u00A0and pushed the door open. The Evelinas were waiting for us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Whoa, this is so weird!\u0022 said the one on our left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I know, right!\u0022 The one on the right stuck her hands out through the open visor of the one on the left. \u0022My face feels so weird without my own touch feedback!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh let me try!\u0022 The left one grabbed the cheeks of the right one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay,\u0022 said Star-Ethan, after clearing his throat.\u00A0\u0022We decided that I am going to the meeting, and Kevin is going back to Kerbin.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wait, what?\u0022 said both of the Evelinas. \u0022Kevin?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh no,\u0022 said Kevin. \u0022We\u0027re not actually calling me that, are we?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kevin?\u0022 they both giggled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s besides the point. We should get going. We don\u0027t know when those three will get back.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kevin? Nice!\u0022 The Evelinas both fell backwards onto the door of their chamber. \u0022Wait a second,\u0022 said the Evelina on the right, \u0022It\u0027s locked!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hmm. They must lock after we exit,\u0022 said Left Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What if they can tell we\u0027ve been here? They would be able to tell!\u0022 said Kevin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We should use and lock the third chamber on something so it\u0027s all uniform,\u0022 suggested both Evelinas at once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right!\u0022 exclaimed Star-Ethan. I ran over to the third chamber, but it too was locked. A screen displayed the message \u0022Machine inactive, has been idle for too long. Contact an attendant for assistance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 said Left Evelina. \u0022That\u0027s good!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aah!\u0022\u00A0said Star-Ethan as he tripped over a briefcase, which spilled open. \u0022Ow! They left a briefcase here!\u0022\u00A0On the floor was an extremely baggy looking dress suit in a Kerbal style. \u0022Interesting.\u0022 I picked it up and looked at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What are you doing? We don\u0027t need it! We have about\u00A027 minutes to get back down,\u0022 said Left Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right.\u0022 We heard voices growing louder around the corner. I panicked and tried to fit the suit back in the briefcase.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Odd, we couldn\u0027t find those people who wanted to talk to us...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, I hope they get ahold of us eventually, it seemed urgent.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Speedwalk away. Don\u0027t look suspicious,\u0022 said Right Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The suit! It won\u0027t fit back in!\u0022 The Evelinas tried to stuff it back in with me but it wouldn\u0027t fit. We saw the shadows of those three Kerbals about to round the corner to the chambers. Evelina grabbed the briefcase and tried to conceal it with her body. We all speedwalked off, eventually breathing sighs of relief when we passed the exit. We were back in the main hub area of the orbital ring. It was still night where we were, but that didn\u0027t diminish the wonderful view we had of the planet below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So which one of you two are going home?\u0022 Kevin asked the Evelinas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And today on this round of choose your girlfriend,\u0022 joked Left Evelina. The right Evelina laughed along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022On the left, Evelina. On the right, Evelina,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027re probably down to 26 minutes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. It\u0027s me,\u0022 said the one on the right. \u0022I\u0027m going back, sadly.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wish we had more time together,\u0022 said Left Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Me too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hug? Wait, no.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Group hug.\u0022 The four of us all hugged, probably longer than we should have.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And Kevin is coming back, right?\u0022 asked Right Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a temporary name!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. I know we\u0027d all love to say goodbye more, but we really have to go,\u0022 said Left Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right. Good luck, you two.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You two too!\u0022 We hugged again and waved goodbye, turning our backs on each other.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Star Ethan (with Left Evelina)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, that was weird,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We should get this suit back in the suitcase and leave it in the hall.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, good idea. We don\u0027t really have a time limit any more, unless we are found out...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Kevin (with Right Evelina)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow, that was weird,\u0022 she said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. I know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do you ever get used to it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022To a certain extent, but not completely.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Alright then. Elevator time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You think we can just sneak in again?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Probably. Hopefully there is a flight back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E... Err, HSC in time.\u0022 We both made for the elevator. In next to no time, we were descending with 24 minutes left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Star-Ethan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u00A0was a weird suit! It was\u00A0like automatically adjusting and stuff! I wonder, would it have changed to fit me?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Interesting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But that\u0027s besides the point. So, what\u0027s next?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we need to... obtain... passage to the council chamber, somehow. We could sneak places, or we could find a suitable ship and steal it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Stealing a spaceship is a whole level above sneaking onto a space elevator.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah... But you know... We do know someone who happens to own a lot of spaceships?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh... Do you remember where he lives?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I reread my diary entry on it a few days ago... If memory serves me correct, Ring 5, Berth 3361? 81? Somewhere in there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So we\u0027re going to steal a spaceship from the person that saved our lives?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Unfortunately, maybe.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Kevin\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a rapid descent through Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, we were at a loss for how exactly we would get back to the space center... The airport was huge. It took us several minutes to find the schedules and stuff, and several minutes longer to get to the right gate. We under\u00A0fifteen minutes left at this point, we were cutting it dangerously close. We got to the gate, snuck through, and... No. Nonononono. It was the exact same pilot as before! We couldn\u0027t pull the same trick twice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027re not really supposed to sneak into a cargo bay in human aircraft especially, but we had spacesuits on. What could go wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean, a lot. But we were in the plane, on the way back to the space center, and that\u0027s what counted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Star-Ethan\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00228bPpo2c.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/8bPpo2c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ring transfer car glided smoothly to a stop on its rails after a harrowing magnetically confined journey between rings 7 and 5. It was now Ring 7, not Ring 5, that disconcertingly flew past at a relative velocity of over two kilometers per second.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe recognized the docked ship and we knew we were in the right place. There was a click and a hiss. The hatch between the transfer vehicle and the ring opened and we floated through. A bit of slightly confused meandering later, we had arrived at the entrance to Samley\u0027s residence. There appeared to be an intercom-like device. I pressed the button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello?\u0022 I called out. \u0022Is Samley Kerman, Spaceship Collector here?\u0022 There was a pause.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s not home, is he?\u0022 asked Evelina.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Maybe not. I could be working this thing wrong.\u0022 the door clicked and swung open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hello, there! Samley Kerman here, at your service! You two look strangely familiar, have we met?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, Samley, we are Ethan and Evelina,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022You rescued us and Jebediah a while back after our spaceship exploded while on a suborbital trajectory.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, right! It has been so long! That was a fun day. I\u0027m happy to see you again! What can I do for you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we were just thinking about fast spaceships,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022We know a bit, of course, but since we were up here, we thought, hey, we know of a spaceship collector, why not ask him?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You want me to show you my ships?\u0022 he asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If it wouldn\u0027t be too much trouble,\u0022 I replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Trouble? Oh, no! None at all, it would be a great joy to present my collection! Please, come in! So, speed? Are you thinking atmospheric speed, warp speed, sustained speed, or what sort of speed?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, hypothetically, if we needed to cross the galaxy as quickly as possible, how fast could we do it?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oooohhh. Well, I have a warp ship designed in the 32nd generation of Erindunqui development, which is capable of an extremely high sustained velocity, and could complete the trip in just a few days, perhaps! Oh, and I have a quantum drive I have been working on! No ship at this point, but it could cross the galaxy even faster, though not by much! It has begun to show its age, sadly. Oh, and I have something else!\u0022 Samley giddily led us towards his hangar and workshop, bubbling over with information about the various ships he owned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n========== Kevin (I need a new name)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022bSa8QiQ.png\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/bSa8QiQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aircraft slowed to a stop. Hiding behind some various cargo and luggage, we waited for the door to open. Time was up. We had been out for too long. We heard the click of the door opening and peered out of our hiding spot. There was a single Kerbal unloading the luggage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Excuse me, sir,\u0022 I announced, standing up, \u0022We\u0027re from the department of airworthiness and this has been a surprise routine flight inspection.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Department of airworthiness?

A different one, a clean one. \u0022No blood here, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u0022 She quickly put it away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But... But... Alright.

We went up to the roof after that to sit around and talk, you know. And we realized we\u0027d been gone some time so we ran back, that\u0027s why we were panting.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We searched the roof.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Obviously not when we were up there.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aaaagghhhhh... I don\u0027t believe you. I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t. Who did you talk to? Where did you run to? Did you talk to your friends, Evelina? The mission controllers? That piano Kerbal? That Australian guy from the construction process?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, we were on the roof, sitting, talking, stargazing, breathing in the fresh Kerbin air,\u0022 I said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022For an entire hour? Without letting us know? Through the panic, and guards shouting, walking around the building with flashlights and megaphones?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We were next to the air conditioning unit, it was pretty loud and our view was obstructed It would have been pretty easy for us to miss them, and it would have been pretty easy for them to miss us.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You\u0027re hiding something, I know it!\u0022 shouted\u00A0Jebediah, now up in our faces. \u0022You two have been nothing but trouble and you\u0027ll never cease.

Wait, actually I had all three already, but for different reasons, so it wasn\u0027t that difficult... \u0022But, you know, stuff happened, and now we\u0027re going to be together for quite a bit longer.\u0022 I looked over at her and sheepishly smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And that was pretty much the first time we\u0027ve been alone since we\u0027ve seen each other.

And you two! I will not say this again. DON\u0027T. RUN. OFF! I came all the way back from an important information session with the planners for the m... Important thing...

The original person\u0027s mother was injured. The only reason you were on the Voyager instead of Isabela Jeanette, who we carefully calculated would be an amazing astronaut, or even instead of Noah Brown, who was supposed to be a replacement, is because I decided on a whim that the younger generation would need some more inspiration. I only knew of you because you RAN OFF in the middle of the night and taught a Kerbal piano! And then you found me orbiting above Pol, ready to try to save the universe, because you RAN OFF! The only reason we had to abandon the Memories was because I overstressed it trying to escape from that homecoming party. I wouldn\u0027t have had to spend all that time looking for a new ship, potentially blowing my cover, I wouldn\u0027t have had to go to Earth, I wouldn\u0027t have gotten into that battle over Jool in the first place, I wouldn\u0027t have had to deal with Evelina, her knife, your obstructive romance, and who knows what else if you hadn\u0027t RAN OFF when we landed back on Kerbin! And now you RAN OFF again, causing a panic among those that know of what is coming, just to suck face! Just think, had you humans not rioted and rebelled all over the planet, Isabela Jeanette\u0027s mother would not have been injured, and she would have gotten the trip of a lifetime who would have not RAN OFF, instead of an obstructive, selfish, clumsy, clown!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jeb - \u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I called you my friend, but now I realize you\u0027ve been a thorn in my side this whole time. If you say you won\u0027t let me down again... Prove it, Ethan Edwards.\u0022 He let go of me and stormed out the front door. Everyone in the room stared at the door, shocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s the maddest I\u0027ve ever seen him,\u0022 one Kerbal remarked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is he okay?\u0022 asked another.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We need to get him a therapist.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022He\u0027s so busy right now though!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is someone so angry fit to be our leader?\u0022 The concerned comments continued as we were marched into the basement. We passed several secure checkpoints, and several heavy doors. I was put in one room, and Evelina was put in another. I only had a few minutes or so to wallow in my concern before there was a knock at my door. They didn\u0027t wait for a response before opening it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In an hour or two, the mind extraction machine will be ready.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Mind extraction? Are you going to take my brain out?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No. It simply reads all of your memories. It can be accurate at times, but it isn\u0027t perfect, so we will still interview you often and attempt to stimulate memories.

It was piloted by the great Marcney Kerman, in the great Galactic League, back when it was still up! In this very ship, he won two\u00A0Galactic Cups!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So this is a racing ship?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Precisely! For this league, contestants would start on an atmospheric planet, and would have to race to space. Once there, they would activate their jump drives and race to a planet around a mid-range star, which would have properties unknown to the racers before the race... It could be a rocky planet with a station you needed to dock at to receive the codes necessary to find the next jump target... Of course, in these ships, refueling isn\u0027t really necessary unless you are doing some insane travel, but the option is there and for early races it was required... But that\u0027s besides the point. It could be a rocky planet with a space station. It could be an atmospheric world with a runway. It could be an aerial refueling platform above an atmospheric world... It was varied, and each planet would have unique challenges! Oh, in a later league, Galactic League Plus, they made the worlds more extreme! Ocean, lava, mountains for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E, gas giants, low above stars, neutron stars, it was crazy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow. I wish all races were that epic!\u0022 I said, genuinely in awe. I wanted to hear more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And after a certain number of planets were flown to, there would be one last planet, or even planet system, with an elaborate flying course and finish line!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So, uh, these jump drives,\u0022 cut in Evelina, trying to bring back the conversation to details about the ship.\u00A0\u0022How do they work, exactly?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s understandable that you don\u0027t know, they aren\u0027t really used much any more... A quantum crystal, distantly related to Illasticonian crystals, is decomposed, and can propel the ship through a specific quantum space at extremely high velocity, as long as the engine is always firing. The quantum paths are attracted to a specific type of energy, which can be emitted from beacons, which were what was used for the races. You could fly without the beacons, but not in this ship.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why not?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It has to be as bare-bones as possible for the races. Every gram counts. This ship really doesn\u0027t have the equipment for navigating in deep space, only for low and medium orbital flight, atmospheric and non-atmospheric flight, and jumps between beacons. Oh, and also each jump can only be so far... The fuel cartridges deplete after each jump and can\u0027t be swapped out mid jump. They automatically swap after, though.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How many cartridges does the ship carry?\u0022 asked Evelina. \u0022And how far will that much get you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, we have about 200 left I\u0027d think? Not very many were made originally, as they are custom for this ship. This whole ship is ridiculously custom. It was terrible trying to find replacement parts for even the simplest things! More than enough to go across the galaxy and back if you use them efficiently. It doesn\u0027t matter how far the jump is as long as it is below maximum, it will use up the whole cartridge.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are those beacons still there?\u0022 I asked. \u0022Like if someone wanted to go across the galaxy in this thing, could they today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Of course! The technology is derived from general identification beacon technology. A lot of stars have them!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cool! So how would one pilot the ship to one of these beacons?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve only done it a few times myself, but I\u0027d be happy to show you!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n==========\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022I\u0027m so stupid,\u0022 thought Jebediah Kerman.\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u0022I blew up.

It\u0027s a client. I\u0027m sorry, you two, but I\u0027m afraid I have to go.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aww.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s a shame, I was going to let you fly the thing around with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E for a bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Really?\u0022 I asked.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah. Sadly, though, I\u0027m afraid we don\u0027t have time.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aww. Ethan has flown ships on his own before. Can he take it out?

It would be interesting to jet around for a bit.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well... I guess you can. But bring it right back, okay? And don\u0027t get outside the excursion radius! If you go out of that, you could hit a tower and the whole ship would be destroyed, and you with it! Fortunately, there are barriers, shields, and diverters so you don\u0027t take out the tower, and the entire orbital ring system... That would be a true disaster.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Are you for real, Samley? You\u0027re really going to let me fly it? You\u0027re telling the truth?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Do I look like a human to you?\u0022 Ouucchhhh.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aww, sweet!

In seconds, Samley had exited the craft and closed the hatch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well,\u0022 said Evelina. \u0022That was... easier... than I expected it to be.

Unfortunately this involves having actual actors in the same place and probably sets. And we would have to deal with zero gravity. The KSP of course would be loaded up on visual mods. Not quite nassault level but better than stock. And also we\u0027d need spacesuit costumes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately we don\u0027t have any budget whatsoever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull animation could also work but I\u0027d imagine the style would probably have to be a quicker and non photorealistic one if we ever want to finish it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we get serious about this, I don\u0027t know if I would be doing scripting or not, especially with college coming up, but if I don\u0027t I would like to at least consult on the script, as there is a lot I would change. This is less necessary if we wait until revision.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some parts that would probably be taken out to make the story flow better and to reduce runtime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot directly movie related, but an example of something that was in the first chapters that has changed: The council chamber has have been overhauled and is now completely different from it\u0027s description in the prologue. The council room is more or less the same but the station is way cooler and way bigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStarted work on chapter 28 last night. Can\u0027t say what the total will come out to be, but we are in the last quarter. Can\u0027t say when 28 will come.
