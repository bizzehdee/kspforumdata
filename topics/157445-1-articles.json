So if you\u0027d like to see me play KSP and get into some shenanigans please stop by. My twitch user name is the same as here (Leafbaron). Since I am new to this, any constructive feedback is always appreciated.\u00A0Thank you for your time and consideration!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeafy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T18:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing is more fun than being a Monday morning coach! Without having seen your stream, I\u0027ve seen a lot of other ones and here\u0027s some general advice I can give about it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nTwitch is a brutal environment. If you\u0027re not good, you will not have viewers. If you\u0027re good, you will still not have viewers... at first. So don\u0027t give up; it takes time to build an audience. At the same time, be honest with yourself... and critical. Because if there\u0027s anything\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0about your stream you might think it\u0027s acceptable, your viewers likely won\u0027t and will simply switch channels.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAdd value to your stream. Maybe it\u0027s humor. Maybe it\u0027s educational. Maybe it\u0027s something thematic. But there should be a reason (other than \u0022it\u0027s 5 AM and no one else is on\u0022) that people will\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereturn\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0to your stream\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTalk, talk, talk. \u00A0\u201C\u003Cem\u003EWell, of course streamer X talks all the time, he 1200 viewers and his chat panel is busy all the time.\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Maybe, but the reason she has 1200 viewers in the first place was because there was an engaging stream. Talk about what you\u0027re doing. Talk about why you\u0027re doing it. Talk about what happens next. Talk about why it fails. But\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etalk\u003C/em\u003E. No one will watch a stream where you just watch in silence as someone is playing KSP. I can do that watching\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Emyself\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0play KSP!\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe buddy up with someone, so you stream together (in one room). The second person can ask questions, have a conversation with you. \u201C\u003Cem\u003ECross feed boosters, Leafbarron? I prefer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s myself. What makes you choose that?\u201D \u00A0\u201CWell, Kerbart, one of the advantages of liquid fuel boosters is...\u201D\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eetc, etc. There\u0027s a reason most early morning radio shows have two hosts!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have to have a pleasant voice. This one sucks, because if you don\u0027t, there\u0027s very little that can be done about it. People will just not listen if they don\u0027t like your voice. People with deep, booming Barry White voices tend to do better in this segment than youngsters whose voice hasn\u0027t settled yet, so to say. Not that pitch is the primary qualifier, but just to give you an idea of what I mean with \u0022pleasant voice.\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHowever, if you do have a pleasant voice... use it\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewell\u003C/em\u003E. Speak s-l-o-w-l-y, it makes it easier to understand what you\u0027re saying. Don\u0027t mumble; project your voice. Don\u0027t use filler words like \u003Cem\u003Eehm\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and \u003Cem\u003Eah\u003C/em\u003E, pause instead if you can\u0027t think of the word you\u0027re looking for (this is incredibly hard but it gets easy over time. Join \u003Cem\u003EToastmasters International\u003C/em\u003E to improve your speaking skills). A decent microphone (you don\u0027t have to spend hundreds of dollars) or at least an environment where your voice sounds \u0022dry\u0022 and not muffled, popping, hissing, echoing and weak. As I tell my colleagues:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethe key to professional looking video... is audio.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-07T21:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorks of fans, such as videos and game-related streaming, belong in the Fan Works subforum.
