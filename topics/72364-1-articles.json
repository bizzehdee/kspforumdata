I had one idea the other day. We have all these kinds of engines and fuel tanks, but what is the difference between them?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EHence this Mod!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan on doing a ModuleManager patch mod that has the intention of making KSP more fun and challenging in the design phase, because you will have Isp and weight to REALLY think about. I plan on doing it so it works with FAR and will have configs for DRE. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I plan on making (any of these are subject to change, depending if I can do it or have time.):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make different engines have different perks and uses. This would mean the poodle would be very efficient (but less than NERVAs) and would be used more!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-NERVA engine would only use LiquidFuel and Have more kick to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make ARM engines balanced and much different than Mainsal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Different solar panels have different efficiencies and/or are better!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-ION engine uses more power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Make science lab give more science to \u0027labbed\u0027 experiments, and making science harder-ish to get.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Science multiplier depending on distance from Kerbin, with kerbin\u0027s surface giving you useless amounts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Revamped Science flavour text!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Put ARM engines on experimental rocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-2.5m meter Truss parts and resized 1.25m engines with lower Isp but high TWR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Differenciate between different RCS nozzles\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If possible, a 2.5m AGU (Klaw)!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would really like to know if the community is interested in this idea and that I should go for it. Later down the road I WILL try to add mod support for mods the community wants. Think of this mod as a realism/fun designing mod for those that like a challenge and more variety on the stock parts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003ESTATUS: JUST STARTED \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SaplingPick\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PolecatEZ","CreatedById":58008,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T17:19:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot to hijack this, but consider another idea to be thrown out there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make a single catalog entry for all engines across the popular packs that have same/similar stats and use meshswitcher to change the look. Classes could be broken down into sizes x profile (tall/short) x lateral mount x type (nuke/regular). It could be organized in the catalog in various classes then instead of individually. RCS nozzles could get the same treatment, with heavy/medium/light crossed with multinozzle and multi-directional. Fuel tanks can also get the same treatment with radius x length - or even a simple TextureSwitch with Stretchy Tanks to match any mod style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The other ideas you listed sounds like it would have a place being put into the various \u0022realism\u0022 mods and I think there\u0027s a science enhancement mod somewheres as an addendum or as a contributor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As for stock engine rebalance, I think Squad is still looking at that for future updates.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
