The shuttle was cancelled, but the payload mass requirements were maintained, so it ended up being too large and too expensive for commercial launches, which make up the bulk of its manifest.

There is no point in building a rocket capable of sending 10 tons to GTO when most GTO comsats are in the 3 ton range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAriane 5 was originally designed to launch the Hermes shuttle. The shuttle was cancelled, but the payload mass requirements were maintained, so it ended up being too large and too expensive for commercial launches, which make up the bulk of its manifest. So they came up with the dual launch capacity as a way to overcome the launcher\u0027s market overcapacity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis has a serious\u00A0drawback in terms of flexibility. The payloads must both be targetted at a similar longitude (this is only used for GTO launches) and must follow the same launch schedule. If a payload from one customer is delayed, then the other customer is also delayed, which has a huge impact on revenue generated from the satellite. For those reasons, most customers prefer a single launch rather than dual launch, which is why Ariane 6 will be designed with a lighter 2 booster configuration for commercial launches and a 4 booster configuration for some rare heavier payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWouldn\u0027t it be more fitting to say that the Falcon Heavy and SLS are rockets without a customer and/or market?
