From there, automated systems separated the spacecraft and cut the payload shroud, fired the LES tower to pull the RM and OM clear (17 gees!), ditched the OM, dumped the heavy heat shield, deployed parachutes and fired the braking rockets, all automatic.

Proton has had its share of failures, most of them to do with the upper stages (\u0022Blok D\u0022 or \u0022Briz,\u0022 depending on the flight), and the rest in the first \u0026amp; second stages.

(Nobody has ever matched the reliability of the Saturn series, which suffered all of *two* major non-catastrophic failures in its entire flight history--Apollo 6 had the two engine failures in the second stage and the pogo-induced failure of the third stage to relight, while Apollo 13 had an early second stage second-engine cutout, but neither of these ended up being mission-killers, as the booster was able to compensate with extended burn times and, on 6, the ground controllers saved the mission by using the Service Module engine to fly a planned alternate mission after the failed second burn ignition. However, there simply WEREN\u0027T very many Saturn launches to begin with--ten Saturn Is, nine Saturn IBs, and 13 Saturn Vs--so with such a small sample size compared to the number of launches that just about every other major launch vehicle family has flown, it\u0027s really hard to say that you have a representative view of the vehicle\u0027s reliability; even the Shuttle flew four times as many missions as the entire Saturn family.) If I had a payload that really, REALLY needed to get into orbit without worries about a launch failure, I\u0027d certainly put the R-7 and Proton on my shortlist of booster options. (Yes, I\u0027d take out an insurance policy against a launch failure anyway. I\u0027m an engineer; I like to have my contingencies covered!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
