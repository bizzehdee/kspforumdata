The explicit cast float-to-int appears to truncate.  0.35 in binary likely being a bit smaller than true decimal 0.35, so \u00220.35 \\* 20\u0022 (with 20 being implicitly cast to float before the multiplication) becomes a float a teeny bit less than 7 and truncate then gives 6.  i assume the \u00220.35f \u002B (int)20\u0022 becomes almost the same value as \u0022(0.35f \\* 20)\u0022.  The implicit cast  float-to-string must then get rounded to get 7.\n\nSo it comes down to the implementation of the casts.

Learning about this slowly and probably making an ass out of myself grasping at straws here but after removing that all the values line up with your Default.cfg.   \n\nNot sure why Seti-CustomBarnKit config is not working though.  Not finding any errors specifically as to why its not being applied."}]}
