These include the trees that come with TechManager that can be found in the TechManager folder, for reference. As stated in the included (admittedly light) documentation, you only need to place these files anywhere under GameData for them to be found by TM *at startup*. So, you\u0027ll have to restart KSP for them to become visible. The KSP log file will print out a notification for each tree it finds, to confirm its visible and parsed correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second format does not have the header, must have the name tree.cfg, and must be found in a save game directory. If it is there, TM will find it when you load that save game. In order to add it to the set of active trees, you will have to enter the R\u0026amp;D building, on the science view tab, and press Modifier-F7 (on windows this is Alt-F7). This will open a dialog that will let you activate the tree.

It will also list the current trees that are active, one per line. So if its false, exit your save, change it to True, then reload. Also you can exit your save game, delete that file entirely, then load that save game. It should present you with a tree selection box first thing when you load the game.

I\u0027m still not entirely sure how the stock-like trees are pulling unlisted parts in (although I think it has to do with the techID flag on the node), but I did figure out how to get them in manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETED lists all of the parts and will put them into nodes, so I started using that to dump in the parts I want. But I was still getting parts not showing up in many cases. The problem there seemed to be that the part name that TM is looking for is different than what TED is generating, with TM looking for periods where TED is generating underscores. For example TED generates \u0022mk2Cockpit_Standard\u0022, but \u0022mk2Cockpit.Standard\u0022 is what actually works in a TM tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t say for sure which app has it \u0022correct\u0022, but there\u0027s definitely a mismatch. I will say that looking for the parts manually, the underscore version matches up with some file names that I find, whereas the period version doesn\u0027t. I think those filenames are where TED is pulling its names, so it maybe seems like TED is doing it \u0022correctly\u0022, but again I\u0027m really not sure if there\u0027s something more subtle going on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T17:46:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sherkaner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sherkaner","CreatedById":130303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T05:04:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy way of a feature request, is it at all possible for TM to parse an additional attribute for each node to specify the R\u0026amp;D facility level required? In creating a pretty dramatically different tech tree, I\u0027m finding that the fact that KSP uses the R\u0026amp;D level only to set a threshold on the science costs for nodes to be very, very limiting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to give you an idea of why that would be: I\u0027m working on a stock-parts tech tree using TM that gives the player much more choice in the technology \u0022path\u0022 they take by not lumping parts together somewhat arbitrarily into nodes, but instead having most nodes contain a single part. With this, a much broader variety of parts would be available to the player right from the start, such that the player would be able to focus on the sorts of craft they want to build (and spend their science on improving), rather than be constrained by the somewhat rigid upgrade path the stock tree nearly forces. It\u0027s about 2/3 done and right now looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CAF2Cup.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CAF2Cup.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty excited about letting others play it. LOTS of nodes, but moving horizontally, the nodes are of a related line of technology. For this kind of tree obviously the cost of each node will be much lower (and have more variance -- upgrading ladders will be a lot cheaper than going from 2.5m to 3.75m boosters). With that, the thresholds set by the R\u0026amp;D center level will make no sense at all, which unfortunately is a pretty major flaw for my tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
