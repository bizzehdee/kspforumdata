When I deleted 90% of the stock parts in one of my installs to free up memory to assemble a big group screenshot of all of the engines from stock and different mods all of the buildings at KSC turned pink due to missing textures (apparently they share textures with rocket parts?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, that\u0027s how I wound up with 45 installs of KSP on my SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DigitalProeliator","CreatedById":75677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T10:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWanted to say thanks for a great mod.
