The first stage is powered by five F-1 engines burning kerosene and liquid oxygen. The presence of carbon in kerosene results in the blindingly bright orange exhaust that turns into a sooty smoke trail. F-1 have a sea level Isp of 263s with a thrust to weight ratio of 94.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/020408_STS110_Atlantis_launch.jpg/772px-020408_STS110_Atlantis_launch.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022772px-020408_STS110_Atlantis_launch.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have the space shuttle orbiter firing its engines. The three SSMEs are cryogenic engines burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, resulting in a nearly invisible clear exhaust. The SSME have a sea level Isp of 363s due to much more energetic fuel but has a lower thrust to weight ratio of 73.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently in KSP almost all of our liquid fuelled engines use the same blue SSME-like exhaust. Now I understand that we don\u0027t really want to separate liquid fuelled engines into three types (the other one is hypergolic fuel) and have triple the amount of fuel tanks we already have in game dedicated to each type, that\u0027s just too much trouble for very little gain. I\u0027m happy enough with the generic \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 and \u0022Oxidizer\u0022 for bipropellants. However as a compromise we should at least modify the exhaust so that the lower Isp higher thrust engines give off the orange \u0022hydrocarbon\u0022 exhaust while the high Isp low thrust engines better tuned for upper stage retains the clear \u0022cryogenic\u0022 exhaust. Solids aside, the orange exhaust in fact is already in the game:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2u7rrf5.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222u7rrf5.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack in 0.17 days the aerospike had an unique orange exhaust that gave it a lot of character.
