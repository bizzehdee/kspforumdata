So, the mages should avoid battles in industrial areas.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, industrial areas make mechanisms and chemical reactions (powder, medicine) run better, with less fails.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, the areas full of Magic (sanctuaries, magic gardens, dungeons, etc) vice versa, enforce spells and make them stronger and successfuller, while the mechanisms often break, medicines and powder fail, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, in the magic area you need either magic weapon or healing, or the most primitive, melee weapon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, to take a rifle and grenades to a derelict monastery is same bad idea like try to cast fireballs in a factory.

Combining carbon, sulfur, oxygen, potassium, and nitrogen into natural compounds in the environment doesn\u0027t affect magic, but combining them into gunpowder in a laboratory or factory does. And only certain degrees and types of technology. Woven cloth is technology. Clothing buttons are technology. Leather shoes are technology. But apparently none of these things affect magic in any way. It all just seemed very arbitrary to me. To me if magic exists in a setting, then it follows natural, reproducible laws that predate human (or demi-human, or whomever) endeavors. If it didn\u0027t, then how was it discovered in the first place? Why would very specific patterns of technological development disrupt magical processes when other technological patterns, or even just simple patterns in nature didn\u0027t? It just struck me as a game mechanic in search of an explanation. You are correct, the Arcanum-style setting does make magic more competitive.

In this particular system, magic drains fatigue from the user, so a particular mage might be able to do one or more of those things for a short time, but not over a wide area or for a large group. So, for example, he might be able to teleport himself and a couple of others, for a short distance. But he couldn\u0027t teleport an army to another continent. If you wanted to do something on that scale you\u0027d need an army of mages in addition to your army, and that adds a whole new level of logistics to the equation. There are a lot of limitations. And, again, the setting is exploring the transition. Many of the examples you give are valid for 18th-19th century technology. But once technology advances further, they start to go away as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, yes, it all comes down to how the system of magic works. If your magic system allows someone to perform incredible feats with only a little training and staggering amounts of power, then it would trump technology. But in a world where such magic existed it\u0027s unlikely that technology would ever be developed at all. Why would they go to the trouble? That\u0027s true of any technology, not just guns or locomotives. If it\u0027s easy and convenient for anyone to light a fire by snapping their fingers, why would anyone develop the technology to light one by striking flint? If it\u0027s easy for the average person to wish clothing into existence why would they develop textiles? If it\u0027s easy for an average person to cloak themselves in illusion and keep themselves warm why would they develop clothing? So in order for technology to develop, there has to be limitations on magic in the setting that make such technology practical. If the setting has reached this technological level, there has to be a logical reason for it. Otherwise it isn\u0027t logically consistent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Okhin","CreatedById":201182,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-31T18:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not only how the magic works.

Or if there\u0027s even less mages, it ca lead to weird conspiracies. Some being false, some none. You can, after all, have a world with in total of 10 mages, each having gain extraordinary social and political power due to some minor tricks (mind reading, magical influence and stuff), and waging economics wars against each other from the secrecy of their lair (a bit like Vampires do in Vampire the mascarade.

Some consider magical users being touched by the demon and persecutes them, some others see the spirit as the manifestation of the saints for instance, or djinns. Magical tricks being the expression of the will of their god. Of course both views are present into the same religion, leading to internal fights that are not solved forty years after the re-apparition of magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then there\u0027s how you study magic if it needs to be studied. There\u0027s some magical courses in the MIT in Shadowrun. And one of the jokes we have with friends is to figures out what are the first spell that you\u0027ll learn as a student on campus. Some of them might be Detoxification (it helps with hangover), some Influence spells (because you\u0027re a jock who just wants to impress people), Sustenance (because you then don\u0027t need to feed, because food is to expensive, you\u0027re crippled with students debt after all). Probably not fireball.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking about the impact on the daily lives of both magic and technology will defines what\u0027s acceptable which aspects of magic and technology will be pushed forward, where the R\u0026amp;D is going, etc. Eberon is a good example of that. The world have an industrial view of Magic. There\u0027s no steam engine there, but still you have trains and airship moving fast with cargo hold. Some engineers just figured out a way of bindings elemental in those and uses those as an engine. It is both a feat of magic and technology. They even have some sort of magical smartphone (using enchanted stones), and there\u0027s entire guilds working around that magic to build infrastructure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, if you want to make magic relevant decides what makes it relevant, what problems does it solves and why technological solution are not common. Or, on the contrary, if magic is falling in disgrace in profit of technology, then why did it happened ? And what does it means for all the people that relied on magic to live. If there\u0027s a world\u00A0wide web of interconnected devices, there\u0027s no need for people magically sending message to their recipients. What are those magical messenger are going to do next ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
