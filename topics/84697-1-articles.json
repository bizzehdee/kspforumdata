I\u0027m scaling down and the smaller the parts become, the more the colliders fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also encountered when playing with physics delta time that the lower the value, the better. With higher values collisions don\u0027t work at all. Might there be a hidden option to get the value lower than 0.3?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027ve downloaded Time Control.
