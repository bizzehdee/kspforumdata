Is this possible, or am I just crazy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: specs- I dont really have plans on doing the IVA any time soon. I want to release the lowpoly \u002B uvmaps/baked texture information to the others developing this, and then get back to my own projects. Some time later, I might get to the IVA, if no one else steps up to it. . . but I can\u0027t really promise anything at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-06T01:09:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/06/2014 01:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Daemoria\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T01:20:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, heat shields as small spacing as that barely need that big spacing/bumps. Maybe it\u0027s... I dunno. A little bit too much on bump maybe?

If you keep the tiles super thin/sharp, the normal map will become noisy and aliased when baked. Also, take the image of the render in an external viewer and view it at 50% or less zoom level. That is typically the zoom level it\u0027s going to be in-game. Are they, in your opinion, still too pronounced at that level?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can still go in and flatten all the creases between the tiles, and make it almost completely seamless, but I think that would make it lose a lot of its character when viewed at a distance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
