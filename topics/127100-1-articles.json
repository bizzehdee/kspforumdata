And also when a spaceplane is accelerating/a fast plane flying the heat will blow your cockpit up. So if there was a part called \u0022heat duct\u0022 and it would function like the struts in terms of placing. Then you could move heat from the cockpit/wings/whatever into a part with high exposure or a part that gets heated and then jettisons/blows up. This would allow for a lot of new concepts and easier reentry for spaceplanes\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T18:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the radiators should work in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T19:00:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStruts and fuel pipes conduct heat now, and radiators do work in atmosphere, though the folding ones can break off if subject to enough airflow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T19:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut how much heat?
