I am playing on Xbox 1. I was just wondering if anyone has any updated information on the subject. From what I understand, it took a while for the making history DLC to be released on consoles. I only just recently began playing and, by that time, making history had already been made available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked around the forums and other sites for any information relating to its release.

Maybe I can\u2019t find it because it\u2019s not there?

I\u2019ve been hooked for the past two months straight! I would really love the ability to have the expanded \u00A0scientific rover tools and arms!

Although I don\u0027t know if the BG subforum is the best place as this is fairly quiet, maybe the more general subforums are better. b) I\u0027ve seen a number of complaints about the latest patches not being ported to the console version of KSP...
