Not a good idea for small craft RCS. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I have noticed a work around to keep rotation up to par with their actual thrust. If you move the model and such farther form the center point of the model the more torque the rcs has. basically imagine you take the rcs thrust and multiply it by the distance from the model origin. if it is 0.1m away from origin your thrust is only 1 tenth what it should be. but at 1 meter it is accurate. I noticed this with my RCS boom for KOSMOS. I just experimented with regular rcs and it works perfectly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1417259/kerbal/screen%20shots/rcsfix.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rcsfix.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Causeless","CreatedById":5366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-27T10:34:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s pretty cool.
