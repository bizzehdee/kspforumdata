Yes, I know I can rearrange the staging order but it get a little annoying to have to do that with every launch vehicle I\u0027ve built."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T23:56:50Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know. Sometimes they stage with your engines... and sometimes they get assigned to your Munar transfer stage.\n\nSo: game code, and relative to the other parts in your stage."},{"CreatedByName":"adinfinitum","CreatedById":49226,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T00:00:48Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s just how KSP handles any sort of decoupler, whether it\u0027s launch clamps or whatever. I like to stick my launch clamps up high because it keeps it above the CoM, and I just like how it looks. This always makes them stage somewhere in the middle of the sequence. \n\nIt seems the way it works is whenever you attach any decoupler, the game creates a new stage in the sequence below the stage of whatever the decouplers are attached to."}]}
