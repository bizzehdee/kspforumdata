But in reality, the outside surface of a part heats up much faster than the inside. Parts don\u0027t fail because the entire part hits a max temperature. They fail when the outside edge of the part gets too hot. Deadly Re-entry introduces the concept of \u0022skin temperature\u0022- the temperature of the skin/hull/outside edge of your parts. By default, only 10% of a part\u0027s mass contributes to it\u0027s ability to absorb re-entry heat (rather than the full mass).
