What I\u0027d suggest is to give yourself a massive amount of science and funds by editing the save. Then use the game interface to re-unlock things. Then trim your science and funds back down to equal what you currently have. This way you only have to edit two lines in the save file so it\u0027s less likely to break things, or create weird unpredictable side effects. Trying to port whole sections can be messy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Create a new save and just go into it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Quit back to the main KSP menu and tab back to your OS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- make a backup of both your new save and the one you\u0027re trying to port things from.

Copy the funds and sci values from your old save into the new one. Save and job done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternate approaches, but way harder:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are feeling brave, you could try and copy entire SCENARIO sections from your old save into the new one. If you copied the entire ResearchAndDevelopment one I think that might include the nodes you have unlocked but I\u0027m not sure how the game will deal with that. If you are going to attempt that, then you really need vim or at least an editor that can do line folding so it can automatically collapse whole sections down to a single line which you can then copy in one go and know you\u0027ve got the whole thing include the last } \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option might be to copy over your old save and then just nuke all the craft in it. Search for FLIGHTSTATE, leave the first part of it as it is, and remove each section that starts with VESSEL. This might be problematic as the crew roster section might reference vessels (I\u0027m not sure, been a while since I really hacked on my save). Again, line folding in your text editor will make that easier. (In vim you just place the cursor over the first { in a section, hit escape and then type zfa} that will collapse that section to a single line. typing zo will expand it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027d really recommend just doing it the first way and only editing the bare minimum you have to and let the game work out the details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
