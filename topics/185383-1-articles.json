Upgrades which could improve the thrust of parts, reduce cost, reduce weight, improve resource values, and so on. Sadly since this togglable was first implementation, nothing further has ever been mentioned or done with this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that KSP has finally reached a point where old parts need more care than a simple textural overhaul. As we add more and newer parts, the old become more and more antiquated and less and less useful and at a point, only remain in the game for for occupying the lower nodes of the tech tree and providing compatibility and ensuring that craft files and old save files aren\u0027t broken as they remove ancient parts in the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo major examples I can think of, are the LV-30 Reliant and the LV-45 Swivel. Two very ancient rocket engines that go back to before I bought in the game in 2013 and, isn\u0027t the oldest part in the pack. An honor I could bestow on the the mk1-2 cockpit, and the RT-10 Hammer solid rocket booster (at least, that I\u0027m aware of, amongst other parts). Two parts which have received love and attention over the past few years but a quick peak towards the LV-30 shows it\u0027s received little of the same affection. Merely receiving two visual overhauls (0.7.3 appearance, and it\u0027s post .18 overhaul that we have today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut for some parts, a simple shifting of ingame values (mass, thrust, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc) is no longer enough to keep them competitive with other parts and engines. Part Upgrades could help by reducing their price, their mass, their thrust, etc. Which could put the Swivel as a more competitive option to newer and more modern parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBut Zoo! How would Squad ever go about implementing such an idea?\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EWell thank you for asking hypothetical person- my proposal is this. In career/science modes, you gain % points when you use parts (bonus points when first used, when they\u0027re used to set a record/complete a major achievement), and you gain multiplied bonuses when you complete testing missions (test part on the launchpad, test at certain altitude/conditions). I suggest this, since I have never had inclination to accept the more complex testing contracts since I could earn more cash than the contract is offering by completing other contracts, however with this suggestion, there would be more incentive than just the typical cash/science/rep reward but also the chance to rapidly improve a part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you gain % points on a part, with certain milestones (5% increments, 10% increments, 20%, etc) you would gain an upgrade (reduced cost, reduced mass, more resources in said part, more thrust, reduced drag, improved lift, increased \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc etc etc ad nausem). Which of these options that are unlocked at which point are to be decided by Squad for game balancing. In sandbox- there would be a slider or buttons you could select that would select which upgrades are active and save them to the craft file like thrust limiter values and gimbal range values have been set up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVisually, I would suggest hexagons which would act as the buttons in sandbox and in career/science mode, these buttons would be fixed and not able to be pressed. Acting as a visual indicator of progress instead of a selector as it is in sandbox. In each hexagon, would be a symbol representing what is changed/improved.

Issue is players don\u0027t want to bother thinking (ironic despite the game), so to ensure the game is accessible to as many players as possible it needs to made straight forward and simple. Which is why a simple point system is so effective at keeping the game so easily accessible since points are easy for even the least aerospace informed player to grasp and work with. Especially since the game has a steep enough learning curve as is and introducing any more would cause some players even more additional mental fatigue as they try to learn the game.

Similar to Zoo\u0027s suggestion, science points and funds (R\u0026amp;D effort) can be spent to apply upgrades to parts in several categories depending on the part, and each category affects mass, cost, and other related category values based on the category delta from the reference part.\u00A0 e.g. increasing ASL and vacuum iSP for the Reliant might not affect\u00A0mass (engine bell geometry), but thrust would suffer because m-dot is the same. Increasing m-dot would increase mass due to a better turbopump, and might reduce iSP slightly.\u00A0 The amount of delta in each category is capped (as a balancing mechanic) and can be increased as the new tech nodes are unlocked.\u00A0 Once the part has been \u0027tweaked\u0027 and the R\u0026amp;D cost assessed (again based on the delta from the reference part), the part gets a new mode, or simply a duplicate model with different stats in the editor. This way, the player gets to decide how to apply upgrades, and they aren\u0027t stuck with precanned benefits or detriments, and they can have multiple variants of each part optimized for different roles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis could be a royal pain to implement though, because not only does each category of part need its tweakable parameters and their effects on other parameters defined, but the ranges have to set and\u00A0balanced for every part.\u00A0 A graduated slider (1 or 2% intervals) of upgrade might make this easier.\u00A0 Structural parts and tanks would be pretty easy, but engines and wheels could get complex.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like to see some default acceleration and thermal tolerances reduced to make reducing mass actually have noticeable detriments (default impact tolerance balance is probably fine).
