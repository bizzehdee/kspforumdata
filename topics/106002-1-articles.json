Grindy?","CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:20:30Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:20:30Z","Content":"**Game Type:** Normal, Career. Over 800 hours of experience. \n\n**Issue:** Gaining science is pretty hard- which makes upgrading the Tech tree additionally difficult. I really enjoy that contracts don\u0027t offer a lot of science, instead encouraging players to go out and explore. But in the early game it\u0027s pretty hard to explore- even Kerbin. Which leaves players with grindy contracts they have to mine for resources in the meantime.\n\n**How I\u0027ve played (for perspective):** It might just be me. I\u0027ve cleared almost tier three of the tech tree, and I\u0027ve focused as much as I can on space planes so I can take on contracts that require multiple crew reports or temp reports (there\u0027s a decent science/cash payout there) But I still don\u0027t have a fast enough ship to top 16,800 meters without stalling and falling back to Kerbin- which has limited my ability to take contracts. On the other hand, due to the atmosphere pushing my rockets around- it\u0027s made launching with large liquid fuel rockets pretty difficult to control. Which forces me to use solid states as a first stage- which often burn up my smaller/lighter craft. It\u0027s been a bit of a vicious cycle. Needless to say, I\u0027m grinding away at contracts or collecting science where I can- I just upgraded my R\u0026D department, so I can finally take surface samples- that\u0027s a gold mine for science. But targeted sub orbital landings (or a proper space plane for targeted biome landings) are pretty much out of the question at the moment. Which means more launches \u003E which means I need more cash \u003E which means I need to grind away at more contracts.\n\n**Solution:** Though I think the contract payouts should be tweaked slightly. As this seems a bit difficult for a \u0027normal\u0027 game. I wonder if a better science archive could solve this problem. Part of the problem is knowing where to gain science from. As you collect science instruments over time, it\u0027s hard to keep track of what biomes you\u0027ve done what science to- or where those biomes are at all. What would be cool- would be to have a science tool that works much like the mining tools. You\u0027d scan the area you\u0027re flying over- it would collect info that would be displayed on the map and you\u0027d have a very quick visual reference of where the biomes were, and what you have and haven\u0027t collected in regards to science.\n\nIt wouldn\u0027t hand you the science per se. But it would give players the tools needed to do it themselves."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:58:21Z","Content":"This has been the subject of much discussion, so far [this topic](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99521-A-more-intuitive-tech-tree) have a solution I would support.\n\nThe grindiness of KSP is bad in itself.\n\nBut the rigidity of its Tech-tree (which was supposedly revisited, but didn\u0027t really change) make it worse. For now I\u0027m hopping they did make it moddable enough for modders to come up with a better solution.\n\nMyself I would favor a \u0022Explosion-tree\u0022 where the player can research/buy part individually amongst technology-tier based on the level of the R\u0026D building (see the link above).\n\nThe question isn\u0027t (only) to admit whether or not a SPACE PROGRAM can come-up with groundbreaking invention like LADDER or SMALL CUBIC STRUT, but to have the players choose, with sacrifice : which road fit his immediate need and what he can sacrifice for now.\n\nSo that at least, you don\u0027t 2,5m fuel tank and 2,5m engines/structures in the wrong order.\n\nNot to forget that there IS **better than starting manned**."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:01:05Z","Content":"I find that it isn\u0027t about gaining science as it is about gaining funds to upgrade your launch pad and VAB so that *then* you can get the science.\n\nWhich, once you realize it and adapt, isn\u0027t too demanding."},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T16:20:07Z","Content":"Too hard: no, you can unlock the whole tree without ever leaving the kerbin system.\n\nToo grindy: ...maybe?"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T17:06:24Z","Content":"I quit the career mode because of that too. I hoped it had changed, but the early tech tree is still pretty much the same. Their efforts seem to have been more towards the late game/spaceplanes. Things that I think would improve the early flow (both for newbies and more experienced players):\n\n-Invert the progression of each size of liquid fuel tanks. At the moment you get the smallest 1.25m tank, then the 2.5m, etc. This means you make any length of spacecraft/rocket right from the get go. Even the part limits of the VAB or launch pad (don\u0027t remember which one) are easy to circumvent after single reasonably cheap upgrade. If you start with longest tank each time, it means you\u0027ll be forced to make large, inelegant rockets first before you can transition to more finely tailored designs. That seems to me a much more interesting path.\n\n-Make the early probes a bit more useful. Add a little bit of torque so that a satellite that is little more than the probe can still be turned. And make all probes at least be a SAS Level 0. Having the Stayputnik be SAS-less means unmanned is too big a challenge for new players and a useless part for more experienced ones.\n\n-Move batteries and fuel cells up in the tree. Power is necessary to make unmanned missions doable, but since early battery designs are radial or small it means you\u0027ll be forced to launch an ugly probe covered in batteries before you can move onto solar panels (after which you\u0027ll rarely use batteries again). The fuel cells would be useful in the early game to replenish power, but are made useless because they appear after all the useful solar panels are already unlocked."},{"CreatedByName":"Atlanticrash","CreatedById":127400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:18:52Z","Content":"Really?

This is just one of the many things about pre 1.0 that we all need to let go of. I had the same feeling of it seeming more like a chore to get science than fun until I realized that you can get Science from playing around with the equipment you have, no matter how low-tec.\n\nI created a little \u0027pod-hopper\u0027 that I would launch to each building/area just of the KSP. I would launch, go in a direction with a pod and science mods and bail from the rocket and try to land in the general area of where I was aiming with parachutes. Doing all the science just from each building area at the KSC gave me hundreds of Science, then the challenge of tossing a rocket into 1 of each Kerbin biome gave me a few hundred more. Tbh the trial and error of getting to each spot was entertaining. I even landed the top of the VAB by accident.\n\nIf you get science as you go you will have more than enough before you know it and it can be entertaining as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonide","CreatedById":32604,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T06:15:28Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E base-establishing is destroyed by the price of hiring crew.\n\nBase contracts do not require crew, they require crew capacity."},{"CreatedByName":"saskwach","CreatedById":57658,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T08:06:35Z","Content":"I kind of like the new science balance. Before, I could just build the rockets I wanted almost like in sandbox mode. Now I find myself building weird contraptions just to get to the Mun, then running out of fuel on the return trip and having to send out rescue missions. Part of it is the aerodynamics model, which doesn\u0027t lend itself to as much cheese, but part of it is definitely the scarcer science. Maybe I\u0027d feel differently if I hadn\u0027t restarted for 1.0.2.\n\nOn the other hand, the early suborbital tourism missions are just money factories. You can mine them ad nauseam until you actually achieve orbit of Kerbin. It\u0027s like printing money, but does feel pretty grindy. I do kind of like that approach to balance though. If it\u0027s easy, move on. If it\u0027s hard, grind to get better. It\u0027s easier than trying to balance an optimal path for people with different skill levels and goals.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T08:17:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 08:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by saskwach**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:12:00Z","Content":"I was almost stuck for a bit, that initial 30 part VAB limit and the 18 ton lainchpad limit just kill me. the upgrade to the launchpad wasn\u0027t too economically crippling, so I can have heavier ships now, but I look forward to getting that 30 part cap out of my way."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:37:47Z","Content":"I think \u0022normal\u0022 is just about right as far as amount of science gained and how much each tech tree node costs. I also think that the money is about right for what everything costs.\n\nI do however take some issue with what things cost relative to each other. Hiring a single Kerbal should not cost more than a new rocket. I thought it odd that I could get 500,000 roots off of my 2nd launch (my first orbit) but 3 upgrades later I was back to almost nil. And I hadn\u0027t built a rocket yet. Luckily, the rockets in this (rocket building) game are by far the cheapest things to build.\n\nAnd why are the first two 2.5 meter parts you get a decoupler and an adapter? There is absolutely nothing the decoupler will fit to except the adapter, and the adapter\u0027s only purpose would be to widen your craft so it can use that overlarge decopuler. Who thought that was a good idea? And right about the time you\u0027re unlocking that essentially useless stair-step of a tech node, you start building rockets that you\u0027d really like to slap fairings around. So why not put a fairing in that node instead of those useless parts? Put them a bit further up so you actually unlock them when you need them?\n\nBut as far as grind/play ratio, I think normal mode - for my abilities and preferences - is just about right."},{"CreatedByName":"Lorunification","CreatedById":135645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T09:39:21Z","Content":"As some people already mentioned it is, in fact, still possible to unlock the whole tree by landing on one moon and orbiting the other.
