Fuel crossfeed is the priority in which active engines can drain a tank. If a tank is not in the same crossfeed grouping as the engine, the engine can\u0027t use that fuel (unless you transfer it manually to a tank in the crossfeed group). Fuel crossfeed rules are what keep your ascent stage from draining fuel from the upper stage, since decouplers and separators all have the \u0022No Crossfeed\u0022 tag. Docking ports allow you to choose to crossfeed or not, and Jet Engines and RCS ignore crossfeed rules and do it anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-23T05:43:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/23/2015 05:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T06:00:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Crossfeed\u0027 just means engines can draw fuel from beyond this part, \u0027no crossfeed\u0027 means they can\u0027t.
