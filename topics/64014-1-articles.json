Sick of that price tag on those Anti-SAM Fighters? Well do we have something for you! Introducing the Join Strike Fighters, a lower budget Anti-SAM multi role plane! There is even TWO to pick from! The first is a convintional layout that promises tight turning and reliability. The second is a radical layout that promices low budget. But dont just take my word for it! Try them both and see what you like. Best of all it is only FOUR thousand easy payments of one thousand dollars! Still not satisfied yet?

The smoke maker is tested but the VTOL Trainer isnt the best so I wont release it. The two jets are also not like other JSF fighters on here. They are NOT replicas. They are my version also ment to keep parts down for stock and modded carrier operations. In VTOL mode the are NOT the best, what do you expect, Cupcake? I am nowhere near as good as he is so if you want a VTOL go check him out. Anyways good luck flying them. Here is a tip though, the are realistic in negative G\u0027s, don\u0027t pull much of \u0027em!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups(Both)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 VTOL Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 CTOL Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAF-32B \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www./?yxxz233jjl53n5v\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www./?yxxz233jjl53n5v\u003C/a\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAF-35B \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/zb9038845r84w7y/AF-35B.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/zb9038845r84w7y/AF-35B.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmoke maker \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./view/7h10necy69lcm4g/Smoke_Maker.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./view/7h10necy69lcm4g/Smoke_Maker.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-23T01:45:56Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2014 01:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Jeb Cubed\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"barrenwaste","CreatedById":91899,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T07:44:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice simple looking designs.
