Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor - of which no Kerbal had ever heard of. More popular than the Celestial Stationkeeping Handbook, better selling than Fifty-three more things to with your Kerbals, and more controversial than Neil DeGrasse Kerman\u0027s trilogy of astromical blockbusters The Eeloo Files, Some more of Eeloo\u0027s tiniest features, and Why do people care so much about Eeloo, anyway? It\u0027s already supplanted the Kerbal Space Program Wiki as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom, for two important reasons. First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words MORE BOOSTERS printed in large, demanding letters on its cover.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all.
