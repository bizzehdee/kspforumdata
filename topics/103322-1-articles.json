My ship \u0022vanish\u0022 and is merged into the mother ship. Ressources are shared, crew can transfert from seat to seat. Only the Mother ship keeps it\u0027s name. Action groups are merges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Crew : I can transfert the. Ok, no sweat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Ressources : Some are shard (elec, air intake), other can be transfered (fuel, RCS). OK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Action group : To get them manageable I have to prepare coherent action groups on each ships. If I set 1 to solar panels on one ship and 1 to toggle engines, it\u0027ll be a nice mess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Staging : they are merged. If I\u0027m on stage 3 on the mothership and stage 2 on my docking ship. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is the current stage on the resultaing stage. What will happen il I press spacebar ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- As my docked ship is now a part of the mother ship. As I undock the game spawns a new shipand sets a derivative name from the morther ship. \u003Cstrong\u003EWhy can\u0027t I get my ship name back ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the rule for the mother ship. Would it be the same if I had docked the mothership on the sub-ship ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature is very nice, but it\u0027s not intuitive at all. It\u0027s quite strage the the docking ship merge and thus disapear.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T22:27:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDocking/Undocking rules can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAction Groups: Yes,consistent action groups is a good idea. For example, 0 for me always toggles solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStaging: Is a big mess. The stuff in the lowest stage block is usually the stuff that is active. If you are going to leave things connected long term, it\u0027s a good idea to rearrange the stage stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUndocked Name: You should be able to get the old name back. The game stores the craft name for any ships that had a name prior to docking. If it isn\u0027t storing the name, then there may be something strange going on with the hierarchy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules for the mothership are the same as rules for the docking ship.
