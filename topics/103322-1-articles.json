Both have names and actions groups, ressources and crew.\n\nI\u0027m in the sub ship and I dock with the mothership. My ship \u0022vanish\u0022 and is merged into the mother ship. Ressources are shared, crew can transfert from seat to seat. Only the Mother ship keeps it\u0027s name. Action groups are merges.\n\n- Crew : I can transfert the. Ok, no sweat\n\n- Ressources : Some are shard (elec, air intake), other can be transfered (fuel, RCS). OK\n\n- Action group : To get them manageable I have to prepare coherent action groups on each ships. If I set 1 to solar panels on one ship and 1 to toggle engines, it\u0027ll be a nice mess.\n\n- Staging : they are merged. If I\u0027m on stage 3 on the mothership and stage 2 on my docking ship. **What is the current stage on the resultaing stage. What will happen il I press spacebar ?**\n\n- As my docked ship is now a part of the mother ship. As I undock the game spawns a new shipand sets a derivative name from the morther ship. **Why can\u0027t I get my ship name back ?**\n\nWhat is the rule for the mother ship. Would it be the same if I had docked the mothership on the sub-ship ?\n\nThis feature is very nice, but it\u0027s not intuitive at all. It\u0027s quite strage the the docking ship merge and thus disapear.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T22:27:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T16:51:55Z","Content":"Docking/Undocking rules can be found here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79594-Docking-and-Vessel-Type-Rules-%280-23-5%29)\n\nAction Groups: Yes,consistent action groups is a good idea. For example, 0 for me always toggles solar panels.\n\nStaging: Is a big mess. The stuff in the lowest stage block is usually the stuff that is active. If you are going to leave things connected long term, it\u0027s a good idea to rearrange the stage stack.\n\nUndocked Name: You should be able to get the old name back. The game stores the craft name for any ships that had a name prior to docking. If it isn\u0027t storing the name, then there may be something strange going on with the hierarchy.\n\nRules for the mothership are the same as rules for the docking ship. It\u0027s actually based more on craft type, which is outlined in the link above.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T22:27:35Z","Content":"OK thx a lot for this link.
