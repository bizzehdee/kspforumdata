I\u0027ll try to explain it better. \u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think that they need to make every dev decision a popular vote.

I don\u0027t expect to agree with all of their decisions, but I do expect to at least see a rationale. I\u0027m more than happy to wait for said thing.

We\u0027re customers and players and fans and community members, and we give feedback.

This was not supposed to be a multiplayer/resources thread, as you know. I am trying to jive the idea of pre-paying for an in-development game with any other form of consumer market, and whether we have any authority, as consumers, do decide whether promises are made or implied in a pre-purchase like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince the investment analogy clearly blew up in my face, I\u0027ll try another one. Let\u0027s say we bought a sofa from a furniture maker, a new style they hadn\u0027t done before, and have no floor models of (a game concept). They\u0027ve showed us the framework and their facilities to prove they can actually make furniture (the beta and demo). They offer us a discount if we buy now, and as a bonus we get to watch them make the sofa (play said demos). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, assuming that that analogy holds. Do we have the option, as the buyers of that sofa, to point out that this sofa is beginning to look awfully like a dining room table, complain that they seem to have left out the left arm of the sofa, or should we be content when other buyers say to us \u0027well, they never really PROMISED you a sofa, you know...\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tiberion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tiberion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe are not: bugtesters, decision-makers, or game designers.
