The ship originally had a more elongated appearance, but the similarity to the Eagle Transporters in Space: 1999 prompted Lucas to change the Falcon\u0027s design.[1] The original model was modified, re-scaled, and used as Princess Leia\u0027s ship, Tantive IV.[3]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sound of the ship traveling through hyperspace comes from two tracks of the engine noise of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, with one track slightly out of synchronization with the other.[4] To this, sound designer Ben Burtt added the hum of the cooling fans on the motion-control rig at ILM.[4]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[edit]Models and sets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis section needs additional citations for verification.

(December 2009)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVisually, the Millennium Falcon was represented by several models and external and internal sets. For A New Hope, a partial exterior set was constructed and the set dressed as Docking Bay 94 and the Death Star hangar. Besides the functional landing gear, an additional support held up the structure and was disguised as a fuel line. The interior set included the starboard ring corridor, the boarding ramp, cockpit access tunnel, gun turret ladder, secret compartments, and the forward hold. The cockpit was constructed as a separate set that could be rocked when the ship was supposed to shake. Several inconsistencies exist between the internal set and the external set, the cockpit access tunnel angle being the most noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[-moderator snip-] as for the 3d models origin?
