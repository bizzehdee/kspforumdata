It has no trouble getting a payload into orbit, but it doesn\u0027t like coming back down. At roughly 1200m/s, the craft spins out of control on the yaw axis. I\u0027ve tried moving the wings around, and added more yaw control, neither of which actually helped that much. What can I do to keep it from crashing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImportant to note, there are two wing strakes with Elevon 4\u0027s on them underneath the wings, and I\u0027ve drained the craft\u0027s fuel to give you a better idea of what it\u0027s like when dry.

Your center of mass is very far back, by your engines, so all the parts in the front have a very long lever arm to torque your craft around. Whereas your vertical stabilizers are almost on top of the center of mass so they have virtually no torque to prevent unwanted yaw. To fix this you need more substantial vertical stabilizers and they need to be moved further back towards your engines. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/HiKFdjN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s some more info that should help.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-12-22T08:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep, I agree with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/193062-ironmaiden/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022193062\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/193062-ironmaiden/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@IronMaiden\u003C/a\u003E on that one.
