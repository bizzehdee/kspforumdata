I started at AS-201 and made it as far as Apollo 11 (skipping Apollo 1, of course). Here\u0027s some feedback from a rookie, fwiw. My installation consisted of simply dropping the parts in and copying the ships into the stock ships folder and tweaking from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simulated the Saturn 1B by simply removing the 2nd stage -- the 1st stage has more than enough power to get you into orbit (almost too much!) and the third stages were pretty similar anyway. I also found that any major changes to the upper stages were tricky and often resulted in explosions (although this is as likely do to my inexperience with rocket building than anything). The built-in ASAS does a good job holding you on course and I had no trouble with MechJeb doing just about anything, including ascent and landing. I ran *very* tight on fuel on the LEM ascent stage from Mun, but that\u0027s probably pretty accurate (retrograde orbit makes it even more expensive). It\u0027s also very tricky to maneuver -- it\u0027s spins like a top if you\u0027re not careful. RCS is in short supply as well - with 2 docking maneuvers, you can\u0027t fool around. (While MechJeb will dock you, it\u0027s very wasteful on RCS fuel, so I would use it just to get lined up and then turn it off.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also bounced around a lot on initial Kerbal ascent, but that reminded me of the pogo issue in the real Saturn V, so I actually kind of liked that.

I\u0027ve tried to make the collider meshes as small as possible to reduce wobble on them, and we\u0027ll have to see how that holds up.

But, no worries.) and I think the flower petal idea might work. You make the fairings decouple from the service module, and then the other part of the adapter has a decouple effect on it, to disconnect those. It makes a sort of sense, since the adapter stays attached to the third stage, so it really has no use. That\u0027s really the only compromise I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Is it possible to have 4 decouplers on one piece?
