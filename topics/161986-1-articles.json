So why are 1.2 Kopernicus planet packs not working with 1.3, and how to fix that? Cfg files are text, so it might be just a find and replace thing, or am I wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nParticularly I\u0027m bothered by the fact that there\u0027s no other star systems translated into 1.3, only the rekerjiggers of the Kerbol system. I want to do this reconfiguration myself. How to do that and what do I have to edit?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gameslinx","CreatedById":144828,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-19T22:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not try to recompile planet mods to 1.3 without the mod author doing it themselves, mainly for security, licence and general use reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if you want to know, it is because in each update, parts of the game code change.
