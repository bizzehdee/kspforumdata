The photon computation sounds good - does it handle planetary occultation? For sure taking Kerbalism green house \u0027module\u0027 section then scaling it and adding to gigantor would get you a big green array that worked with Kerbalism. If you wanted to make it more Solylent-ish you could then get the helfire part consuming some of the resources that feed Kerbalism green house and modify the new Kerbalism Green Gigantor module to remove some inputs and replace with slurry.\n\n[@Waxing_Kibbous](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/151611-waxing_kibbous/) I think you probably want do MODULE:NEEDS[ProfileSimplified]:FOR[Kerbalism] rather than put it on the @PART. I guess you have Soylent installed and are not trying to \u0027pull out the bits you want\u0027? The SoylentResources.cfg is needed to define the resources - bad things happen if it\u0027s not there. The SoylentConfig.cfg holds some ratios that get used by newer parts - look at DarkGreenL.cfg to see how - depending how fully you wanted to Kerbalize Soylent you might want to put Kerbalism ratios on the Config object and reference them from parts.\n\nI guess it\u0027s possible that Kerbalisms \u0027Greenhouse\u0027 module has some resource hardcodings, maybe insolation just effects some \u0027rate\u0027 multiplier inside it. If I was doing it I\u0027d start by just adding a straight copy of the Greenhouse module to big green and see it works. Then add a Soylent output resource (even starter) and see that the result will produce starter into a starter tank. Then make helfire box consume Kerbalism resouces and produce slurry. Then Modify big green to use slurry. Do it in little steps so you know what went wrong as soon as it goes wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"ItchyBrother","CreatedById":1572,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T00:39:02Z","Content":"I\u0027m wondering if this works with the latest version of TACLS?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaga","CreatedById":157659,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T01:50:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, ItchyBrother said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m wondering if this works with the latest version of TACLS?\n\u003E \n\nNo problems for me yet but I am just now getting to the point of being able to use them."},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T07:03:53Z","Content":"Oh wow I knew I\u0027d been \u0027doing other things\u0027 but I\u0027ve missed a few TACLS releases - if [@Vaga](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157659-vaga/) or anyone else has / gets positive or negative testing info let me know and I\u0027ll update spacedoc and/or fix it. thanks !"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaga","CreatedById":157659,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T08:25:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, DBowman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Oh wow I knew I\u0027d been \u0027doing other things\u0027 but I\u0027ve missed a few TACLS releases - if [@Vaga](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/157659-vaga/) or anyone else has / gets positive or negative testing info let me know and I\u0027ll update spacedoc and/or fix it. thanks !\n\u003E \n\nMade a quick sandbox game and ran a test for about 300 days with no visible errors.
