If you havent, unlock kerbal EVA, go in LKO and spam Eva reports above each different biome.\n\n\u003E And once I get thos 9 points which tech should I get in order to get more science?\n\nI would say : go for the top item.

You can collect science in each of these. The same is true of the other planetary bodies (for example on Minmus you have Flats, Greater Flats, Lesser Flats and so on.\n\nE.g. if you build a \u0022space plane\u0022 in the space plane hangar that is just a command pod and lauch it you will start on the runway, this is another biome so you can do your collection thing there.\n\nOnce you have all this science you can use it to unlock parts in the Research Facility."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T10:46:57Z","Content":"Kerbin Biome Map:\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:KerbinBiomeMap.png](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/File:KerbinBiomeMap.png)\n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Biome)\n\nYou might want to check out if the Science Alert mod might be good for you. It doesn\u0027t change the stock gameplay, but instead it alerts you when there are science points to be gained and gives easy shortcut buttons to start collecting that science.

Get a Kerbal into a Polar low Kerbin orbit and pick up EVA reports from each of the biomes as they pass beneath you. Advantage of that, over the plane plan, is that you get more science from EVA in space and you can safely use the time warp feature to pick up all the biomes. \n\nKerbal Engineer mod is another one that will tell yo uwhat biome you are currently in/flying over."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T11:44:15Z","Content":"You\u0027d likely get some useful information from this thread:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118433-Quick-tip-for-early-career-mode-science?p=1907740#post1907740](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118433-Quick-tip-for-early-career-mode-science?p=1907740#post1907740)\n\n...and the later parts of this one:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118977-Is-Normal-career-mode-too-hard?p=1906547#post1906547](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/118977-Is-Normal-career-mode-too-hard?p=1906547#post1906547)"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:56:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Without any scientific equipment?

You will need a tier 2 astronaught complex for Eva reports, and its going to be tedious because you will have to keep going back to the capsule to drop off your reports so you can take another, but each sample is like 7 sci and each report is 3. Totally worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:10:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep.

At this level, the only thing that cares about biomes in orbit is EVA reports, so no need to send experiments if you already did them in low space, however everything cares about biomes when landed so you could still bring them and land somewhere far from KSP and do them there (eg ice caps, badlands, desert). Getting all 9 EVA reports from space should give a decent sum. \n\nAlternatively an almost equatorial orbit a few degrees south will hit 7 biomes in a single orbit (8 if you can find the small patches of tundra near ksp)\n\nUnlock the top node (Advanced Rocketry), as it has the 909, a great vacuum engine, which can get you into orbit of the Mun or Minmus where you can use the same trick for tons more science.\n\nAlso if you haven\u0027t yet, you can get some good science from doing experiments/EVA/crew in high space (more than 250km). None of them are biome dependent so you only need to go once."},{"CreatedByName":"Jadis","CreatedById":17957,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:09:04Z","Content":"Can get more science for doing temp/other stuff in different biomes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Garius","CreatedById":142266,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T03:58:57Z","Content":"You can get temperature scans in different biomes when landed or in low atmosphere. Above that its global.\n\nCrew reports and temperature are biome dependent when flying low or landed, global otherwise (one experiment in high atmo, one in low space, one in high space). Goo and lab are biome dependent landed only, global everywhere else. EVA is like crew and temperature except also biome dependent in low space.\n\nThe wiki (first hit when googling ksp science) appears to have up to date info on all this for reference as you unlock more experiments."}]}
