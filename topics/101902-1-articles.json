The imgur gallery shows some details of how I made sure the center of mass was aligned with center of thrust for the VTOL system, and how I managed fuel flow to ensure that center of mass would not move around when I was in VTOL mode. Note that RCS and SAS motors are used to stabilize the system in VTOL flight.\n\nRockets and jets make more efficient VTOL lifters. Jets are very hard to control because of the lag time in controlling thrust. Good luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"jake9039","CreatedById":122602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T03:02:29Z","Content":"the mods really helped."},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T05:05:27Z","Content":"Vids of one of my VTOL builds and testflights:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTlBGSDeuec?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/whVQQ282Fbg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5pCJa4rrnfE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
