I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been jumping from task to task, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll try to remember everything. The difficulty options panel is implemented, and allows you to set gameplay options both when starting a new game, and also while in game, although the in-game options panel offers less parameters (which makes sense, since options like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153starting funds\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really apply after the game is started). This also prompted a thorough overhaul of the settings panel UI, which really was in need of attention. The difficulty options panel not only exposes the already-known tweaks you can see in the Debug toolbar, it also exposes new parameters we implemented, including being able to toggle crew auto-hiring, tweaking reward and penalty multipliers, and several others which I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m forgetting right now, but were pretty cool too.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also added a few other \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153features of opportunity\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 here and there. Most notably, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve added a second button above the altimeter, which allows you to return to the Space Center whenever you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in a stable situation. This button sits below the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Recover Vessel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 button (which moved up a bit), so if you are able to recover, the altimeter will slide down further and make both buttons available. This may seem like a small thing, but it has a great impact on gameplay. It allows you to return to KSC without having to pause the game, which always annoyed me because it meant returning to KSC required breaking the game flow. Pausing is an out-of-game type action, so now returning to KSC shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t detract from immersion anymore.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;After all that got done, we started integrating the many features in preparation for QA testing, which is starting this week. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve taken the opportunity to tinker a bit with the issue tracker, which finally got a much, much needed issue voting system, so we can rate issues for their subjective importance (which is really hard to tell without something like votes), and also a full CSS overhaul, which not only makes the tracker look much sleeker, it also should greatly improve readability and being able to spot the important issues among the less important ones.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m revising the Vessel Marker system that Marco started, to work consistently with other UI systems that were implemented earlier on this update.

The first one cuts off the text at a certain line number and adds a string indicating the textfield has been cut off. The second addition was a feature to have the text wrap around an image. These additions was written on top of the rich text parser Mike wrote earlier to handle text areas with multiple colors, bold and italic fonts. Simply put, \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;this parser works like this: It reads through all the lines in the text area, splits it up into words, parses the tags and in the end puts it all together in a list of string with different fonts.

We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re working hard on update 0.25, which means we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to be able to share more and more of it with everyone.

I had a really amazing conversation with one of our contacts at Steam, which is an amazing partner for our game and company. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nothing specific but it was very valuable. Also happy to report that our PAX Prime tournament was another success!

As you may have seen, we\u2019ve begun QA and it\u2019s been a nice big stack of content for us to sift through and test/break/provide feedback for. Thankfully it started off nice and slow at the end of last week to get us back into the motions of QA, but this week has been full speed ahead with a lot to get through. Additionally, it\u2019s the first QA period for a couple of new QA testers, so seeing them break in the builds has been very rewarding for all involved.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Moving on, we\u2019ve finally got most of the new Experimental Testers on the Team and they\u2019re getting acquainted with everything involved. There\u2019s still a fair bit to get up to scratch on for them though and as we\u2019re not at Experimentals yet, they\u2019ve got the chance to slowly get settled in. Additionally, there\u2019s still a handful of Testers that have yet to join, but they should be with us by the end of the day and questioning their decision to apply by tomorrow morning!\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;On the Bug Tracker front, we\u2019ve installed (Felipe and Alex installed, I watched) a voting plugin on Redmine to allow you all to vote up/down issues based on your personal opinion of the issue. So now the priority field can truly be how much of an effect it has on the game, while the vote field reflects on how much it affects you as a player. Additionally, Felipe touched up the theme on the Bug Tracker a fair bit, so it should be a lot cleaner and a lot easier to see which issues are what priority and what status, just from the formatting.
