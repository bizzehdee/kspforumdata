Do you HAVE to make multi part ships (horrible at docking) or can I just use nuke engines and lots of refuelling. Also I am only bringing 3 kerbals and a small rover with me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T22:13:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe larger your ship, the harder it is to get into orbit. Thus, I like to build my interplanetary and lander stages separately, then dock them together. I prefer to keep things uncrewed until the last minute, because I don\u0027t want the poor kerbals to sit in orbit for months, waiting for the proper phase angle \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear engines are pretty much your only option for a journey of that scale, especially how Eeloo doesn\u0027t have an atmosphere for aerobraking. I would suggest putting a small lander on top of your interplanetary engines, with room for one or two kerbals and your rover, then land in that and boost back up to orbit when you\u0027re done. I suggest taking a leaf out of the Apollo Program\u0027s book, and have a two stage lander. Eeloo does have similar gravity to the Mun, so it\u0027s entirely feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get back to orbit, you don\u0027t even have to dock dock your lander--just get close and EVA with your kerbals and fly them across.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SGT_RIZZO300","CreatedById":58229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T00:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like a good idea. I think to avoid to many parts I will make a smaller ship and stop at my Duna colony to get some fuel (I have a fuel station landed on the surface with a shuttle to take the fuel up) and then go over from there. I will have some screenshots of my design soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tom1499","CreatedById":38308,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-27T18:13:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPff I got there with one rocket,I think.
