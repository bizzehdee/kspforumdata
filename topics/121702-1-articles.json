I got to tier two on most of my buildings (VAB hadn\u0027t been upgraded, neither the runway or the SPH because I never used it) and starting to rebuild my funds and had a few contracts lined up to do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had FINALLY unlocked the Gemini capsule parts (most of them anyway) but was hampered by the fact that I couldnt build 1.875m heatshields... and my science experiments were in the Universal Storage array... expensive... and SETI does not allow me to recover goo or Materials bay science without actually recovering the part. *imitates Dr Gru* \u0022Lightbulb..\u0022 store the parts in my capsule.. yeah, no... its bugged. It would clone a kerbal, and to make matters worse, it borked my astronaut complex... cant hire any more kerbals, 0 VF for next hire (except... cant) and says I have 10 active kerbals even though I clearly only have 4... and none other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust when I had designed this thing beauty \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/687153777992861700/F2E21CF029C7216DC0426BA1ED72E054F696DFD2/\u0022 alt=\u0022F2E21CF029C7216DC0426BA1ED72E054F696DFD2\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for the 8km/s of dV is for several reasons\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKScale2 with 9hr kerbin days\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDesigned to orbit the Mun, in a polar orbit\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPossibly land on minmus\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Ecarry the scientific equipment like goo and mat bays with their own heatshield and chute, just to get around the glitched (science stuff launched seperatly)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOvercompesate for probably errors in flight \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Falcon 2 was the successor to the Sparrow series of single kerbal capsules and its launch system was prolific in putting satellites into orbit, not only kerbin but the Mun as well. However, I needed to expand my program to two kerbals and so I designed this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Falcon 2 uses 4 clustered Wildcat V engines (KW) burning RP-1/LOx for its first stage. Once the first stage burns out at around the 3m mark, the second stage ullage motors (4) start and boost the second stage clear of the spent stage, and the Maverick 1D (KW) ignites, also using RP-1/LOx (for thrust reasons). This stage also burns for about 3m and puts the CSM into orbit. 2 more Ullage motors fire on the CSM to boost it into orbit, and clear the spent stage. The CSM uses a LV-909 Terrier (Stock) burning Aerozine50/NTO. It took several hours to get right, it looks great... and flew a grand total of one mission (total failure and possibly what started the whole bug problem). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be posting a full launch overview though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else have a similar experience?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robet.G","CreatedById":151281,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T03:07:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does it look so small? like a 1/5 scale model or something.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
