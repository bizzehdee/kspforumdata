The culprit was a hecs probe core inside a service bay. Opening the bay doors would allow it to cool, closing them would make it slowly heat until it exploding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried moving the probe core around inside the bay; turns out it was attached to the outside node and clipped through the floor. Once it was attached inside, everything worked nicely.
