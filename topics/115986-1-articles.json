I made a research and found 2 temperatures: Tempext=0 (always 0) and Temp which is the temp for each part and this temps is always around 300.\n\nI didn\u0027t find any \u0022infinity\u0022 string in the persistent folder.\n\nI looked in the ship file in the save folder, made a research and did not find any \u0022infinity\u0022 string for my ship.\n\nSo the problem is still there"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T19:40:24Z","Content":"Be sure to choose the persistent from your actual saves.

I have a problem where docking at my station will cause parts of it to explode (I assume from heat transfer from the docking ship to the station). I see no overheating, just a sudden explosion\n\nI\u0027ve found pulling up the Alt-F12 menu and turning off conductive and convective heating will prevent detonation (radiative heating seems OK). I have considered adding radiators to my station, though if what you say about the nano bug is true, it probably wouldn\u0027t help. \n\nCurious what people do to overcome these bugs?"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T09:34:41Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only met spontaneous heating/combustion issues once.

The culprit was a hecs probe core inside a service bay. Opening the bay doors would allow it to cool, closing them would make it slowly heat until it exploding. \n\nSo I tried moving the probe core around inside the bay; turns out it was attached to the outside node and clipped through the floor. Once it was attached inside, everything worked nicely. That was a bit tricky to do because that probe was the root part."},{"CreatedByName":"gilflo","CreatedById":62881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T07:15:27Z","Content":"How can you say it\u0027s a sudden explosion?
