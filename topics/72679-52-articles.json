I\u0027m also clearer now on the what those actually mean to gameplay. If I have it right, amongst other effects, disabling Stock Scanning means that \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eall\u003C/span\u003E scans will require surface overflight to build the scan results (non-instantaneous) and if there is a separate scanner for a given resource it will be used instead of the stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy difficultly came from not understanding what stock scanning did and how it did it, having only had access to the M700 from the tech tree before I installed SCANSat.

In all instances, once I get to the point where I start launching ScanSAT probes to planets, after I get about 5 or 6 bodies to 100% scanned, my save starts to bug out when changing vessels. When I switch to a different vessel, the camera ends up in some random place in the galaxy (sometimes inside of a planet, sometimes inside of the sun, sometimes just randomly out in space) and I have no interface controls. The only thing I actually can do is Esc and return to the Space Center. When I do that, if I go into the Tracking Station, the UI is all messed up and the list of vessels is smashed up above the screen to where I can\u0027t select anything and even the Exit to Space Center button no longer works (I have to alt-tab out and force the app to close). Note that relaunching the app does fix the issue, but it will return before long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said, this only happens once I start to do ScanSAT scans of bodies. In my testing, I\u0027ve not ever run into the issue if I don\u0027t do any body scans. A few notes specifically regarding ScanSAT: I don\u0027t ever start doing scans until I have the radar, multispectral, and SAR modules. When I get those three unlocked, I make all of my satellites with those three modules and the stock M700 Resource scanner. I usually launch them in in sets for each system (so, for Kerbin I\u0027ll launch three on a single lifter and then send them to the bodies for that system - in this case Kerbin, Mun, Minmus; and then so on for each planet afterwards). The most I\u0027ve ever gotten scanned before running into the bug is all of Kerbin system, Duna system, and Eve system. On that particular instance, it was when I started my Moho scanning that I ran into the problem. Probably would have had Moho at 100%, but I remembered something else I needed to do that I didn\u0027t want to forget and switched back over to another vessel. The least I\u0027ve ever gotten done before hitting the problem is all of Kerbin system and Eve system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn regards to the rest of my KSP setup: I am currently running it using the Windows x64 temp fix. I understand that this is not supported and if that\u0027s the problem, so be it - mainly, if that\u0027s the case, I just want to know if others running x64 have hit this problem or not; that would help to verify if that\u0027s the problem. Beyond that, other major mods include OPM (with Kopernicus, of course) and some visual mods (like EVE, Texture Replacer - though, I don\u0027t have but just a couple of textures replaced). There are various other part mods, including DMagic\u0027s Orbital Science. My latest install of the game also includes Interstellar Extended, but the previous installations did not and I had the issue with those as well. To note: as you\u0027ve probably deduced from the previous info, I\u0027ve never gotten to the point of scanning any of the OPM planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust looking for any insight into this. Aside from that, I do love your mods DMagic - keep up the good work! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: should point out, I know it obviously could be something completely unrelated to ScanSAT that is causing the problem - I just have only ever SEEN the problem begin once I start doing my scans. To further this point - I\u0027ve had ScanSAT for a LOOOONG time, but never took the time to actually start using it until recently, and this particular problem didn\u0027t start until that time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: I know I type the name of the mod backwards (ScanSAT as opposed to SCANsat) - just habit from how I name my probes! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T13:42:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 01:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lexan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T14:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brigadier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brigadier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAdmirable goals.
