I think we shouldn\u0027t place any static vehicles in the city cause vehicles are made by players. Unless these are some Kerbal parts like those old tanks and engines seen in the island runway. That is why I suggest we should make train tracks, but no trains cause the player will build their own trains.Having a scrapyard full of Kerbal parts would be cool, but we don\u0027t have the models =(512x512 is most optimal, I know the textures look blurry up close, so I suggest using as much tiled textures as possible for up close. Take a look at my runway for example, it\u0027s quite blurry up close, it\u0027s 512px wide, the concrete specks look terrible, but still it looks good from distance and in the end it really doesn\u0027t matter that much, stock KSP stuff like the runway looks even worse. I am sort of looking into stock KSP buildings and parts for reference.I think that the performance is going to go drastically down when we add new plots, but I don\u0027t know until we actually see.I worked in racing games before and you usually had a shader that combined several maps, for example diffuse\u002Badd\u002Bmultiple where the diffuse could be the big base and then you would add a multiple layer and tile it much smaller so that it appears like detail when you come close. There is a similar distance blended shader used for KSP terrain, but unfortunately we don\u0027t have that shader in part tools.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EIf not trains, but about a functioning monorail? please tell me now if NO lol..

Unless a way around the Unity RAM limit comes soon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWell, my idea was just an automated travel system that did a continuous loop. I am not sure how to access EVA accessible animation windows yet, so without a plugin I couldn\u0027t get the kerbal to actually board and start the monorail, rather have the monorail stop long enough to board it and off it goes, the only issue is keeping the kerbal still, to get around that I will probably make a command chair type arrangement for the monorail capsule, which so far has proved challenging, but not impossible.Anyway, at the moment I am not focusing on anything in particular. Seeing as no one is actually assigned a position in phase B, it is difficult to plan ahead for your plot, so I\u0027m just making what I think would fit together in a plot ok. I want a VTOL landing pad, a runway, a couple of buildings and an access bridge to the next plot, nothing too fancy. I agree also, this mod if not made well will hit the RAM limit awful quick. I am trying my best to keep everything to a bare minimum and rely on texture trickery to achieve the effects rather than polygons. I also am making a tower, but I wouldn\u0027t mind getting down to ground level after, so it\u0027s got an animated glass elevator. The model is 304 verts, as I said as small.I am working on a generic texture set for my block, probably comprised of a few 512x512 sheets. The texture I am using for the glass is simply an alpha 64x64 flat colour, nice and ram friendly.small sample of one of the vtol towers with animated elevator\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.devogeninteractive.com/picup/image.php?id=67C8_521EE94B\u0026amp;jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022image.php?id=67C8_521EE94B\u0026amp;jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T06:48:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 06:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Devo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T06:48:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry if this has been asked already but are there any plans to work on other cities once KC is finished?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tobyb121","CreatedById":76289,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T11:35:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust working on my 3dsmax skills, still a complete beginner, but trying a few ideas out for a Kerbal farm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm240/tobyb121/kerbalfarm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbalfarm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould I take a spot on the island west of the main city to make a little farm and some residential area.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"alline1999","CreatedById":44738,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T13:18:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if anyone has planned a bridge between 2 buildings which would be a challenge to fly trough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomething like the building in the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yytBj0t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yytBj0t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be awesome and maybe 2 creators could collaborate for a future city each doing the building on there plot .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit would be awesome if somebody did that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DisarmingBaton5","CreatedById":68576,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T13:35:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPetronas Towers!
