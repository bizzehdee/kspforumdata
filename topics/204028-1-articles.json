The base is oriented inward towards the planet, so one end flies at an altitude of say 100 km\u00A0 and the other end at 110 km. I\u0027m asuming\u00A0 that the CoG is in the middle and there is an circulair orbit with the AP/PE at 105 km.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow we release a small part (let\u0027s say a mk1 crew pod) at the lower end of the base. We do it ever so gently at 0 kN and 0,0 m/s.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat will happen to the mk1 crew pod? Will it follow the base? Staying at 0 m/s relatively velocity to the base? or will it go faster since it\u0027s in a lower orbit of 100 km?

That, added to the fact that center of mass is somewhere in the half, means that neither bottom or top end orbit at speed adequate to their altitude. The released pod will start at the same speed but on low altitude, and here regular orbital physics come into play, what happens if your velocity at any given altitude is different from one needed for the orbit to be circular? The opposite side of the orbit is at different altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it will drift off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, you can test it in ksp using eva construction. Cheat a long stick with removable parts on both ends into orbit, bring an engineer there, remove one and just kinda put it outside. Repeat on the other end. They shouldn\u0027t move at first too much but if you let them orbit a bit, you\u0027ll notice their movement away from the stick.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-26T12:49:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2021 12:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by The Aziz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-07-26T15:43:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in these scenarios lets say the original vessel is rotating at a certain way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it possible that after the separations happen, very gently as said above, all the individual parts to start drift off at the same/close rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr it would be pretty much a randomized chaos?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-07-26T15:47:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2021 03:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Serenity\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
