However, some areas around the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn are extremely prone to make my rover pratically flip around and make it land on its back, making the mission impossible to complete. The problem is not that the rover is so light it flips when steering. When driving, one of the frontal wheels seem to \u0022grab\u0022 the ground, and because the rover is moving, the rest of its body is tossed foward, which leads to the problem; flipped rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not even the first time I experienced this. When I was using the Alternis Kerbol mod, the same thing happened on Laythe with another rover, as it seemed to constantly \u0022grab\u0022 the ground and flip itself, resulting in destroyed rovers. It also used the Ruggedized wheels, which had even more traction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s of any value, I am running the game in the lowest graphic settings possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(I apologize if this is in the wrong section.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T19:27:03Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 07:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Commissioner Tadpole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:07:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics would help, but you could use RCS to flip your rover back over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LethalDose","CreatedById":92657,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably a combination of a small wheel base and a high center of mass.

One of my favorite rovers that I use for scouting landing spots is very light and there are areas that flip it up into the air like a tossed penny even at 3-4 m/s. Between the reaction wheels in the probe core, the breaks, and a little bit of RCS, it\u0027s nothing that can\u0027t be corrected for. So it\u0027s not necessarily a design flaw. Could just be weird bits of terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. If yours is a tiny rover, disable the reaction wheels if you\u0027re driving with the WASD keys. You can always enable them again if you end up flipping or on a steep slope, but I find having them off makes it much easier to control lightweight designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-26T18:32:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2014 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Boomerang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T18:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI managed to find the problem: Apparently, setting the Terrain Detail to Low makes the ground \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E unstable to drive with rovers.
