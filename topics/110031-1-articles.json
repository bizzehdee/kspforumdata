BUT the game never took so long to load before.\n\nSomething is wrong since KSP last update... \n\nWhen i start the game and it starts loading i first noticed it was taking too long on each item it loaded.\n\nThen on task manager i saw KSP process at 17% CPU.... Shouldn\u0027t it be way higher if its loading?\n\nI tried with and without the active texture compressing mod thing. still its at an extremely low cpu % while the idle is at 80~ %\n\nOh and its not a hardware problem. i have been playing dead rising 3 and witcher 3 no problem at all.\n\nAnyone got any suggestions ?\n\nIll upload images soon.\n\nI got a:\n\nCore i7 3.4 ghz\n\n16gig ram\n\ninstalled on SSD drive.\n\nRadeon HD 7900.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:28:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by otoduran**"},{"CreatedByName":"otoduran","CreatedById":116059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T03:26:58Z","Content":"ok.
