The build would just need to be way to large (to many parts) to hold it in tact, as well as the issues of actually getting the sections into space without colliding with other sections. Theoretically, you could build a ring, but it seems most people can only handle anywhere between 700-1k parts, if that, before it starts to choke. its not really how big, as how many parts. After optimization and engine buffs, maybe, but it would still be strenuous and would probably require specific mod parts to be able to do it as doing it vanilla would take just to many parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dont think stopping it from spinning would do much, assuming you get it about 70km up and in a safe and stable orbit, stopping the spinning would only do that, stop the spin. Pushing it to one side to bring one side closer to kerbin would probably crash that section, while the other half would probably be alright, if not broken its self.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bacterius","CreatedById":69384,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T01:21:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA recent thread asks roughly the same question, perhaps you would like to check it out: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47093-globe-encompassing-station\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/47093-globe-encompassing-station\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T01:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ring around the planet question has been asked a lot.
