When parts intersect, do they stick together? I\u0027m thinking no, because I have intersected wings and they flop around like they are totally separated--but I have also seen designs where there is a blob of like a dozen wings in the same spot that are pretty stable. Maybe they just hid struts, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond question. Are the orange fuel tanks always a recipe for disaster? Every time I use one, my rocket can\u0027t take off of the ground, regardless of how many engines I add. They also seem weaker structurally and less efficient than other tanks, even though the stats say otherwise.

The key with orange tanks is to use the EAS-4 structural connector to reinforce the connection, usually at least 4 of them.
