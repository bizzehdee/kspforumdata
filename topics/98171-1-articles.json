The way I see it, one can look on KSP in one of two ways. Either you think KSP is a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E where you construct your own rockets, fly to the places you want just because you want it and explore the KSP universe simply because its fun. Or, you consider KSP to be a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E and load up career mode, struggling to manage your base, upgrading the right building at the right time, choosing the right contract and try to make as much roots as possible (to get to that next upgrade.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this poll is that I myself used to see KSP as a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E, playing a lot in sandbox just because it was fun (for a few hundred hours since a couple of years), using mainly MechJeb as a mod. Lately though, career mode on hard has grown on me, and I have started to look at KSP as a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E. Though when I start to express that I think that career mode on hard stops being fun when you start going to other planets (it works beautifully while inside Kerbin SOI) I got shot down by many who suggested for me to find a mod to fix this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, using a mod when you play the \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E part of the game is perfectly fine and fun, but to use a mod while playing the \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E... Consider for example Mass Effect. If you just play random fights and chose to install a mod which makes the weapons 500% more powerful, just to see the enemies explode in cool ways, I think that is perfectly fine. But if you load up a new campaign on hard, but then uses that same mod making the fights super-easy, I fail to see the point. To me, when playing a campaign in a \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E, I want to play \u0022the way the creator intended\u0022, i.e. without mods that seriously change the way you play the game (ruining all balance.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to the poll. Before I make another try to discuss whats wrong with career mode on hard (and career mode only), I would like to know what others think about this game. If everyone see this game as a \u003Cstrong\u003Esimulator/emulator\u003C/strong\u003E, there is not really any point for me to start arguing whats wrong with the \u003Cstrong\u003Egame\u003C/strong\u003E part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo vote and argue.

Of course, if you install something that gives you imbalanced engines, you shouldn\u0027t be playing career, but TAC life support and DR, for example, don\u0027t precisely make the game easier. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith some mods, if an imbalance comes along, you can fix that with the settings. I like DMagic orbital science, for example (more experiments is better), but I reduce the science rewards so that I don\u0027t get 1000 SP from a single Mun landing (I get about 150 per landing at around 50% rewards). For TAC, on the other hand, no settings can compensate: you will need bigger rockets to get to other planets, you will have to unlock more parts. That\u0027s why I would like a life support system to be integrated into stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, KSP is a game. The question about realism is weird to me, because no amount of realism is going to transform the game into a space program simulator, unless you want to sit in front of a control board with a lot of switches and not even see you spacecraft. On the other hand, there are various game mechanics that could be considered realistic: life support, reentry heat, greater distances, etc. I think Squad really has a handle on which ones they want to integrate and which ones wouldn\u0027t be fun (I think they haven\u0027t expressed it very well, but never mind). RSS might be more realistic, but it makes the game much harder, it transforms it into an experience that would be impossible for the casual player, so that should not be stock (fortunately, it\u0027s moldable). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry heat also makes the game harder, but I think it presents you with challenges that you can overcome and are interesting to solve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that my opinion on RSS and DR is subjective, but that goes to show that some mechanics make the game more interesting and some do not, regardless of which ones you consider to be one or another. Realism for the sake of simulating would end up in an unplayable game: what about the risk of radiation for the kerbals on interplanetary journeys, what about signal delay and having to wait a couple of days before you know if your Eeloo probe is alive or not, what about having to convince the Kerbal Goverment to fund you program and dealing with burocracy, what about n-body physics, what about solar flares, what about managing the poo of the Kerbals and the Kesler syndrome... If we really wanted a simulator, we would have to wait another 20 years for development and computers that could handle that program. I would rather go into a real life space program for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn conclusion: KSP is supposed to be fun.

In real simulators all the crafts you fly are not constructed but rather pregenerated by the simulator maker, thus involving no need to balance parts that are found in construction/building style games. I personally enjoy being able to have the freedom to build a craft that may, or may not, work in the confines of the game, it gives me a chance to learn what or where I may have gone work in the build process.
