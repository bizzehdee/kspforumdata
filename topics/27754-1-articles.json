I can land my ship on duna no problem manually and the \u0022land somewhere\u0022 function works. Problem I have is with land at target, it seem to under cut the landing prediction, tries to correct, and then sends the craft into a spin in 100km orbit. I abort and re engage it but it does the same. Any ideas what it could be? My ship is in 100 km orbit when I star and the target in almost on my orbitable path. Should I try from a higher or lower orbit? Not sure what the problem is....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T17:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the latest dev build or the download linked directly from the forum thread?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iEvermore","CreatedById":57098,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T17:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using 2.0.7.
