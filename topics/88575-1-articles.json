So you unclick the checkbox in settings to use the fallback of SM2 shaders, which provides a tremendous boost to frame rate... BUT.. it comes at a cost - and NOT just the cost that it inevitibly must come at , which is that it makes the graphics a bit less pretty. It also makes them very DIM so it has to be high noon in order to see the terrain well and even then it\u0027s still quite dark. At morning and afternoon when the sun is at an angle, the terrain is extremely dark and barely visible on screen at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt can\u0027t be *that* hard to just add a fixed brightness boost to the terrain polygon colors when SM2 rather than SM3 shaders are being used, to compensate for this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slumpie","CreatedById":121922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T19:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this a suggestion or are you looking for help?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-27T04:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022slumpie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022slumpie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs this a suggestion or are you looking for help?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t tell if the fix exists and I just don\u0027t know how to activate it.
