The only limitation (which seems to be an issue with Steam, not KSP) is that the Left Ctrl and Left Shift bindings don\u0027t seem to work, meaning I can\u0027t incrementally control the throttle. Setting a secondary key for those in KSP and changing the controller bindings to use the secondary keys works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
