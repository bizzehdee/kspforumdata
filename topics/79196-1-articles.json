To control non-atmospheric crafts, it\u0027s much better to control pitch/yaw with the stick. Roll is usually secondary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I have to exit the game and re-assign axes. It would be awesome if there would be a hotkey swapping roll/yaw axes. It would be even more awesome if this action could be mapped to a joystick button.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pellinor","CreatedById":85299,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T20:00:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood point.
