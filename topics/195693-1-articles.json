Both are free software, so you do not need to buy anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to avoid scaling. For example, set your game resolution to 1080p, tell OBS to record in 1080p, and use one of the 1080p profiles that Handbrake offers. If at any point you mismatch resolutions, it will still work, but there is a decent chance that you lose quality. For example, recording with OBS at 720p to save filesize and then converting to 1080p again in Handbrake. That just means you threw away information in the first step, then told the computer to guesstimate that information back in in the second step. And it won\u0027t even save much filesize since Handbrake can cut down 1080p recording sizes by 80%-90% anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt will probably take you a number of tries to get something you\u0027re satisfied with.
