Is it safe to judge it by the size of the file(s) going into the gamedata or does that not matter since, even with a larger file, only a small portion of the mod could be running at a moment in game, causing that memory usage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize I can measure it with mods that measure mem usage, etc., but I am wondering how to predetermine, simply, so I don\u0027t go through that effort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peachoftree","CreatedById":110108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:41:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, there is no way to accurately gauge how much memory a given mod will take. However, in general Visual mods take up the most followed by part mods, plugins take up hardly any so add them with impunity!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T02:42:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFile size don\u0027t matter only way, I have found and it\u0027s just a rough way is to have a stock install and guess you could delete the stock folder also to get it better then put you mod in and goto debug for right tab think it is and check the memory being used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Friend Bear","CreatedById":123301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T03:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys I appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
