You fire off the radial stages at launch, decouple the SRBs first, then simultaneously decouple the 3 radial LV-T45s and fire off the central engine. The central stage should get you to the Mun and partway through the landing process, but you\u0027ll need to use the upper stage for Munar return. The sole issue I see is that the liquid stages are a bit heavy, so you need to have a slower gravity turn (stay pointed upwards longer, and turn eastwards more slowly as you fight your way through atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pbj6g9Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pbj6g9Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T15:17:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EExplosive stage separation is a \u003Cem\u003Eperfectly valid tactic\u003C/em\u003E, why thank you very much. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETouchy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENobody said explosive stage separation isn\u0027t \u0022valid\u0022.

There\u0027s science on the launchpad, the runway, the flagpole, each of the buildings (I landed on each of them lol), the KSP grounds itself, the nearby beach and grasslands, and the mountains to the west. That alone will give you science enough to dive into your research tree and get moving up and out... I worked first towards obtaining more science experiments to work with - goo, materials, temperature, pressure. Think it out first, plan ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
