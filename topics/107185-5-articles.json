(A good thing, it becomes more playable and enjoyable).\n\nthere is no need for any dropships for my modules they are fully autonomous.\n\nmy modules are modular so you can mix and mach everything you want. i would recommend to not carry the rover and bus modules- they are the most part heavy"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T18:20:11Z","Content":"I\u0027m not opposed to a pull engine setup, it\u0027s true that chemicals could have lower part count, but not that much of a difference if you need structural arms and struts to compensate for added thrust.\n\nNo cargo at all would mean no refinery / mining module, no rover etc... I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a good idea to remove them all, even though Layth is 90% water the surface it still has ore.\n\nAlso do you intend to land the whole craft? I though it was meant to stay in Layth low orbit while you\u0027d use the cargo dropships to transit stuff between land and orbit.\n\nHave you thought using a toroidal habitat module on a rotor to create artifical gravity? I could make one with relatively low part count, powered by electricity.\n\nDropships aren\u0027t really droptanks. Though drop tanks could be useful if they\u0027re small enough (2.5m) to fit inside the mk3 cargo bays and maybe with wheels to attach them to a truck trailer, so that you can fill them up with mining and send them back to orbit inside a cargo dropship, also there\u0027s already 2 free spot on the HUB module for this.\n\nHave you considered using KAS, to load/unload cargo from the dropships? A new update is coming very soon which could be extremely useful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T18:22:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RevanCorana**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMSP","CreatedById":124853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:06:52Z","Content":"@RevanCorana: Yes, it would stay in Low Laythe Orbit and use Automated Dropships (The MK3 ones) to deliver modules down. The faring in the front would the separtate, and the crew would land and start the colony.\n\nOh, and about the dropships, what I meant was I take your dropship, replace the cargo bay with fuel and ditch it when it is empty. It would look cool and add DeltaV.\n\nI have and use KAS, but I don\u0027t want to use this because it would be cool to make it stock.\n\n@EladDv: I meant that we would use you base modules and use the Dropships to deliver them. I know your landers can land on their own, but I\u0027ll scrap the Retro-Rockets so we can use the dropship.\n\nAlso, just a reminder, I\u0027m trying to even everybody\u0027s work out, but the more you post (more ideas, crafts, ect.) the more your ideas are in the final product.\n\nDMSP"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:14:09Z","Content":"[Habitation Module Download](http://www./download/a1a2r9tbc15e6q2/Colony_Ship_Habitation_Ib.craft)\n\n![tLBmwmn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tLBmwmn.jpg)\n\n[If you want another dish you could use the one that was part of my Death Star.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112602-Death-Star) I think it comes off in one piece. \n\n![6y1uxLI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/6y1uxLI.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T19:25:34Z","Content":"You can do a direct Laythe intercept for very little dV like this:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![jUhtdpa.png](http://i.imgur.com/jUhtdpa.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E This is from 0.25 from my Jool-5 challenge.
