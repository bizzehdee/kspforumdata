As in, a genuine one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really. Prefectly realistic and intuitive. The wings inboard of other things absolutely have to be stronger (heavier) to be as structurally sound with more forces to deal with (it\u0027s own and anything attached to it) plus those forces further out are magnified by the lever arm that a wing is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI kinda feel the same way about this myself. I like the idea behind it but it really adds alot of hassle to the design process, and I REALLY dont like the way it got implemented. You can have have incredibly different wing mass depending on how you build the exact same wing. That and you often end up with wings denser than solid steel on some larger craft. This means wings as subassemblies are a big no no. I\u0027m still hoping for a way to at least \u0022set all wings to X strength\u0022 or a way to change the default strength. \u003Cp\u003EFun exercise: Make a 2X4 grid of wing parts on one side of an aircraft by daisy-chaining wing panels. Now make the same wing on the other side out of four 1X2 sections. Your CoM wont even be inside your fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWish it based part weight on distance from the CoM of your craft rather than whats attached to that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut they \u003Cstrong\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E the exact same wing. They have completely different properties and different wing loading. If you tried to make an asymmetrical wing like that in rel life you would absolutely expect one to be heavier than the other.

If heavier then you still get the same thing with wings stacked out and craft with wings tucked in would be penalized despite being structurally more sound.
