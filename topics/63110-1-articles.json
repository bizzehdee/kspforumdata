In the last couple days though, I put a fuel station in orbit of the Mun. I do have some mods, one of them is Kethane, and some other parts that looked handy. On one of my trips from a Mun kethane deposit to the station I got the Mun station most of the way full with fuel and kethane. But in the middle of transferring the tanks on the station started wobbling and within 5 seconds or so the station broke up. It happened several times and seems to happen when the tanks opposite each other are at about the same level. If they\u0027re significantly uneven it doesn\u0027t happen, at least not yet. The weirder thing is, I already did this same thing once before with no trouble. I got a Kethane processing station at Minmus filled to capacity with no problems but now even if it twitches when it\u0027s full it disintegrates, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t find any other reports similar. Don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a physics bug or a mod.

The Minmus station is really easy to get going even though it never did it until now. A little wiggle in the wrong direction gets it dancing and then nothing I do can save it, even time warping only delays the destruction. Once it started right after loading physics when I jumped from another ship, never even touched the controls. I could quicksave and load but this is something that\u0027s designed to make interplanetary trips if necessary so I\u0027d rather not have to do that all the way to Jool and then do I always do, hit F5 when I meant F9.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuick question, are there any cubic octagonal struts on this craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rassa Farlander","CreatedById":63627,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T22:44:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve had problems with this before.

I did some experimenting with the persistence file, changing resource level and such. The odds of trouble go way up if the drive section is empty but the storage tanks are full or close to it. The storage tanks are two of the orange tanks and two large kethane tanks. They\u0027re attached to a scaled up version of the stock six way hub. It seems like when the center of mass is in that area it gets extra squirrely, even though that\u0027s where I want it. If one tank is half full and the others are topped off, everything seems ok.
