Multiple reference points and values would be nice, but I think a point of of 1 Km/s (10-30 deg above horizon) at 18K would be the most useful reference transition point. (if that\u0027s not a good reference point, please provide a better one with rationale)\n\nI know that 3-3.5 is the commonly cited vacuum dV for a ballistic launch to LKO, but I can never find citation for dV of a rocket launch with initial speed and altitude."},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T21:15:28Z","Content":"orbital speed for LKO is 2200 m/s, plus a few more m/s to reach orbital height.\n\nif you\u0027re moving at 1000 m/s, it would be about 1,400 m/s of delta v.\n\nthe amount of drag you have on the ssto could add some more delta v, since there is still some air at 20k."},{"CreatedByName":"Destroyer713","CreatedById":136956,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:36:07Z","Content":"Since bare minimum Delta-V to reach a 70x70 Kerbin orbit is 3200 m/s, and you would be moving at 1000 m/s already, the amount of Delta-V you\u0027d need would be about 2200 more. \n\nGranted, I don\u0027t know how atmospheric drag would factor into it, and you\u0027d probably want a higher orbit than 70x70, so more would be better, I imagine.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T22:38:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Destroyer713**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T22:52:40Z","Content":"It would of course depend on your timing and ascent profile, et cetera.

Of course, you want a few hundred m/sec for orbital maneuvers and deorbit, so you should really bump it up to 2 km/sec DV budget.\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T08:32:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 08:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27**"}]}
