The lift and the position of the wheels are also major factors when it comes to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA common mistake is to place the rear landing gear too far back(and I have also done that for a long time). The rear landing gear should be a little bit in front of the middle between the COM and the rear of the plane. Placing it closer to the COM makes the plane able to lift of faster, but also increases the tailstrike risk. Placing it closer to the tail makes the plane take of slower, but lowers your tailstrike risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T21:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always make my planes with an angle of incidence of 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on the wings.

You also have to have enough lift-generating surfaces to actually take off; swept wings and delta wings support about three tonnes of craft per wing (i.e. six per pair), while wing connectors generally support one tonne each. Control surfaces also support about one tonne a piece.

Because the wheels act as a lever the further they are from the CoM the harder it is to take off because you need more oomph on the nose, which most aircraft don\u0027t have.

Where you\u0027re in trouble is if, after flying off the end of the runway, you start nosing down towards the drink instead of picking up altitude.

In my experience, craft in KSP (stock anyway) fly better with a combo of canards and elevons. If that doesn\u0027t work - check the mass of your craft, make sure you\u0027re using enough thrust and lifting surfaces, and don\u0027t try taking off until you do unless you want to send your Kerbals swimming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DocMoriarty","CreatedById":57433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T17:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESpace plane construction is all about putting the correct number of everything together.
