There is a large thread about it somewhere. \n\u003E The way to fix it is this:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1) Delete the Settings.cfg in your KSP\\_win folder (or steam game location) this will cause the game to generate a new one with default settings\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) load up the game\n\u003E \n\u003E 3) add all the settings you want, including joystick axis\n\u003E \n\u003E 4) exit the game\n\u003E \n\u003E 5) copy the Settings.cfg file and paste it somewhere where you can easily locate it. \n\u003E \n\u003E This way, if your settings start to bug out again, you can just delete the settings.cfg and replace it with the one you copied and saved. (Also, I think the bug starts when you plug/unplug in a joystick mid-session, I would advise to plug the joystick in before starting the game and not unplugging it during the game)\n\u003E \n\u003E Hope this helps! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(ignore the parts about joysticks if you don\u0027t use them)"}]}
