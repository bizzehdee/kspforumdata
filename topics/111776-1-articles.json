There is a large thread about it somewhere. \u003Cp\u003EThe way to fix it is this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Delete the Settings.cfg in your KSP_win folder (or steam game location) this will cause the game to generate a new one with default settings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) load up the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) add all the settings you want, including joystick axis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) exit the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) copy the Settings.cfg file and paste it somewhere where you can easily locate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, if your settings start to bug out again, you can just delete the settings.cfg and replace it with the one you copied and saved. (Also, I think the bug starts when you plug/unplug in a joystick mid-session, I would advise to plug the joystick in before starting the game and not unplugging it during the game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(ignore the parts about joysticks if you don\u0027t use them)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
