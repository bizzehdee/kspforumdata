Initial versions had substantial phantom force issues, which have not been 100% resolved. The final version has no vertical stabilizer due to off-center thrust and pitch-up issues during the final parts of ascent/circularizing orbit. This results in increased sideslip and roll issues during the later parts of descent, though. While safe landings are possible, precision gliding is more difficult.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot14_ultramin4C.png](http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c128/raptor_87/KSP/screenshot14_ultramin4C.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nWith or without a vertical stabilizer, it seems to have good maneuverability and stability. Spins appear to be easily recoverable, and landing on any large flat patch of land is easy and safe. However, the poor glide ratio (~4.5-5, comparable to the actual Space Shuttle!) and lack of air-breathing engines limits cross-range. Time your deorbit burns carefully.\n\nI would like to thank this thread for the idea of running 2 sets of LV-909 engines instead of a single Aerospike or LV-T30/45."},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-30T10:21:18Z","Content":"Update on that attempt to fly the Albatruss MkIV without leaving the pod anywhere (well, one of the attempts):\n\n\u003E ![screenshot198.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4152380/screenshot198.png)\n\u003E ![screenshot200.png](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4152380/screenshot200.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nDiscoveries made: 1) Aircraft need fuel to fly. 2) They also don\\\u0027t like swimming."},{"CreatedByName":"Salda007","CreatedById":3432,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T04:31:54Z","Content":"Success!
