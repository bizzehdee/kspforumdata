I had plans of making a big loop of roids all docked together (like a necklace) but after sticking 2 together my save broke. I dont know if it was because of this or something else but it was the first time i ever broke a save game (maybe someone else can confirm?). They also are very unstable and juggle around alot. I docked a large D with an E onto 2 flat surfaces and then when i returned from the VAB the E class had rotated a bit so the claws (3 holding each asteroid) were not locked in the same place as they were, they moved slightly and over time it added up to a semi rotated E class asteroid. When watching you could actually see the claws slipping along the surface of the roid because i could not line the claws up to the centre of mass on both at the same time. Oh and rendezvous and docking are simply painful moving that much mass precisely. Because of the save break the only screenshots i got of them together were in the dark, but here is a look: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i57.tinypic.com/2b8vwg.png\u0022 alt=\u00222b8vwg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/4qsy07.png\u0022 alt=\u00224qsy07.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-27T03:14:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2014 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nano606\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jdsutton","CreatedById":74265,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T03:34:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, that\u0027s weird, are you using any mods?

The save game death did not happen immediately it took a few reloads before it finally died. First the ship wobbled all over the place, so i kept away from it as to not have it break, went and did other stuff for a few launches. I then captured a C class asteroid and and moved it to dock with the other roids shown. When i finally arrived after over an hour of fighting the thing into orbit i arrived to find only the ship that was attached to the E class (called \u0027tug\u0027) and no roids anywhere to be found. So i reloaded and the save and now the ship called \u0027tug\u0027 has completely disappeared and is not found in orbit - the ship that was attached to the D class appeared on the launch pad somehow. But i soldiered on and then all my other ships in orbit started to vanish so i quit that one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nimbim","CreatedById":66497,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T05:15:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll asteroid types docked together:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/4lm1at.png\u0022 alt=\u00224lm1at.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was super wobbly even when it was just the Type E \u002B C.
