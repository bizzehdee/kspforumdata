As the title says, I would very much like some visual hint to whether there is data already stored in the smaller science parts, namely the thermometer, barometer, gravioli detector and seismic accelerometer. If I wanna take this data back home to Kerbin, telling apart the free thermometers from the occupied ones becomes fiddly rather quickly, especially in the dark (thank you for not suggesting mounting some illuminators). The two larger parts, the Mystery Goo container and the materials study bin already give this kind of visual feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea would be a small window you could pop up with all the science parts listed that are on your vessel and from where you can access and operate them and view their status.
