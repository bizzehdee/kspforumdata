The issue is that the docking port is on the side of the target and not the end (there is a docking port Jr.on the nose but that is the wrong size). I can get to with in 400M of the target but the target is slowly rotating\u00A0on its Main axis. If I go into the target and set my docking ship as its target I can point the Target Port at my Docking Ship but when I transfer my control to the Docking Ship the Docking target does not hold its orientation and starts rotating. My Docking ship ends up doing the back and forth dance where I i keep trying to fly past the target and then turn and repeat. If I do get close to the target the port has rotated out of alignment and I cannot circle the target to get the alignment right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am trying to use the Docking Port Alignment Indicator mod but it is giving me fits.

more importantly, I have a couple of solutions to go with them.\u00A0 I put them in spoilers because, in my search to give you a complete answer, I ended with four answers and would spare you an intimidating wall of text.\u00A0 I also have instructions on how to use the Docking Port Alignment Indicator and explanations for what each of the indicators means.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mentioned that you are in orbit of Minmus.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know your altitude, but typical Minmus low orbit is between ten and twenty kilometres, which gives orbital periods between approximately forty-five minutes and one hour.\u00A0 That is not quite so fast as low Kerbin orbit, but it still means between six and eight degrees per minute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you set a vessel\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to stability assist (what you called \u0027set position\u0027), it fixes the orientation in a non-rotating reference frame.\u00A0 The problem is that orbit, at least from the perspective of a vessel in orbit, is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E a non-rotating reference frame.\u00A0 During each orbit, the vessel will hold\u00A0its orientation fixed relative to the stars, but because you are in orbit, it will appear to rotate away from you relative to your perception of directions such as \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 The reality is that the direction of \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E changes (relative to that non-rotating reference frame), but you\u0027re trained to assume that it doesn\u0027t (by your lifetime of experience with \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0being a reliable direction and likely equivalent experience of not standing on your head), and what you are seeing as an unhelpful rotation is in fact related to the rate of change of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s the problem--or, I should say, that is what I believe to be the most likely problem given what you have said so far.\u00A0 Here\u0027s my first solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPoint the docking port in a direction such that this pseudo-rotation doesn\u0027t matter.\u00A0 In other words, align the docking port axis with the axis of the vessel\u0027s rotation.\u00A0 The straightforward way to do that is to use the part action window (also known as the \u0027right-click menu\u0027) to control the docking port (right-click it and select \u0027control from here\u0027), and then rotate it so it faces in the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enormal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:normal:\u0022

works just as well), use stability assist to hold it in place, and then, instead of flying past and trying to circle the target, you approach from \u0027above\u0027 or \u0027below\u0027 the plane of the orbit to find a docking port that, albeit still rotating, is much easier to approach.\u00A0 This may be tricky if the target docking port axis is significantly distant from the centre of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a second solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

the target vessel to rotate back to face you.\u00A0 Alternatively, turn\u00A0it so that it faces somewhat away from your approaching vessel and take advantage of its rotation so that instead of beginning perfectly aligned and rotating away from you before you get there, it begins rotated away from you and ends perfectly aligned when you arrive.\u00A0 Divide 360 by your orbital period to get the number of degrees per minute that it rotates, multiply by the number of minutes that it typically takes you to approach, and turn it by that many degrees--I know that Docking Port Alignment Indicator has a rotational alignment readout, though it may take you a couple of tries to turn the vessel in the correct axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a third solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

approach.\u00A0 By this I refer to your procedure of closing distance between the vessels, not just your intellectual exercise in solving the problem.\u00A0 Getting within 400 metres of the target is absolutely phenomenal for a rendezvous, but perhaps you should try to get the vessels to within 50 metres before you consider rotating the target to align the docking port.\u00A0 To do that, set the navball to target mode, zero your relative velocity, and then thrust towards your target.\u00A0 Normally, that won\u0027t work for docking, but it is a passable means of reducing your separation when you are already close to your target.\u00A0 I suggest that you use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E rather than the main engines for this (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E uses H and N for forward and reverse thrust, if you didn\u0027t already know that) because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E 4-way block thrusters can thrust in reverse without you needing to rotate your vessel (and without blasting the target with engine exhaust).\u00A0If that doesn\u0027t work, then consider 20 metres.\u00A0 I suspect that you approach docking with a relatively slow closing speed--that\u0027s good and will save paint and broken parts--but it also leaves more time for mis-alignments to happen.\u00A0 Consider closing\u00A0first and then aligning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a fourth solution:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am merely making a guess, but your mention of circling the target suggests to me that you are approaching docking with a minimum of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E use, or at least without much translational control.\u00A0 I suggest that, provided that your vessel has both reaction wheels and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, you use the reaction wheels for rotation and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters for translation.\u00A0 For your information, the translational controls follow somewhat the same pattern as the rotational ones, but using IJKL instead of WASD on the standard layout, with H and N for forward and reverse in the same vein as you use Q and E for rotation on the longitudinal axis.\u00A0 L, for example, will move your vessel so that it strafes right--do please keep in mind that your camera orientation may make it so that it doesn\u0027t appear to be the correct direction:\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is determined by the orientation of the controlling part, which is usually a pod or a probe core.\u00A0 You may want to change the camera setting to\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ELOCKED\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(press V\u00A0repeatedly until you get to this setting) to aid your approach.\u00A0 This way, instead of circling the target in a way that takes a long time, you can translate to the side as you approach such that when you reach it, you follow the rotation of the docking port and can simply rotate to face it, again using translational controls to keep yourself from overshooting.\u00A0 It helps in these cases to also switch on Fine Control Mode (Caps Lock, and the orange pitch, yaw, and roll indicators in the lower left corner will turn blue to show that you are using\u00A0Fine Control) because Fine Control Mode automatically adjusts \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E output to prevent unwanted rotation while you translate from side to side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I will warn you that Docking Port Alignment Indicator, while an informative tool, also presents a lot of information in a small window and can be difficult to interpret without\u00A0experience.\u00A0 There are many\u00A0different indicators in the main window and they are all related to one another, but they tell different things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe white crosshairs, which are\u00A0permanently fixed to the direction of your controlling part.\u00A0 If that part is a docking port (and it should be), then they reflect\u00A0the direction that the port currently faces.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe\u00A0orange target indicator, which tells you whether your vessel is aligned with the \u003Cem\u003Eplane\u003C/em\u003E of the target docking port.\u00A0 If you are significantly misaligned (such as pointing in the opposite direction), then the orange marker may be missing, and instead there will be an orange arrow at the edge of the indicator that points in the orange marker\u0027s direction.\u00A0 Simply rotate your vessel until the marker appears.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe\u00A0green crosshairs, which tell\u00A0you whether you are aligned with the \u003Cem\u003Eaxis\u003C/em\u003E of the target docking port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe yellow prograde (or retrograde) indicator, which tells you your travel vector towards (or away from) the target docking port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe curved indicator at the top with an orange alignment marker and degrees readout (R\u00B0), which tells your roll alignment.\u00A0 This is used when you want to make ISS clones or other stations where you want to get the orientation of the solar panel modules just right, in cases where you\u0027re using ports that won\u0027t dock outside of specific rotational alignments (Konstruction welding ports can be\u00A0like this), or when you\u0027re simply obsessive\u00A0about getting all of your alignments perfect in every direction.\u00A0 This indicator changes mainly when you use Q and E to roll your vessel.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThree numerical indicators at the bottom:\u00A0 \u003Cem\u003EDist\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003ECDst\u003C/em\u003E, and \u003Cem\u003ECVel\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EDist\u003C/em\u003E tells your straight-line distance between your controlling port and the target port, in the sense that if you went EVA, that\u0027s how far you\u0027d need to go to get to the other port.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECDst\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0tells your closing distance, which is the distance to the target port\u0027s plane.\u00A0 Geometrically, if you imagine a right triangle where your docking port is at one acute vertex and the other port is at the other acute vertex,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDist\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is the length of the hypotenuse and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECDst \u003C/em\u003Eis the length of the leg to the right angle.\u00A0 If\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EDist\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ECDst\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0are significantly different, then you\u0027re not aligned.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ECVel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is your closing velocity, which is the rate at which you are approaching the target port\u0027s plane.\u00A0 Like the difference between \u003Cem\u003EDist\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0and \u003Cem\u003ECDst\u003C/em\u003E, this may be different from your vessel\u0027s velocity.\u00A0 Unlike the other two, any discrepancy between vessel velocity and this is unimportant in docking.\u00A0 So long as you are aligned, a closing velocity under three tenths of a metre per second will give good results (unless there is a different problem, such as having one port on backwards or mismatched sizes).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTo use it correctly (and there is more than one way, but this is one of them), once you are within approximately

green crosshairs.\u00A0 When they are aligned, then it means that your vessel is aligned with the axis of the target--that is to say, your vessel is directly in front of the target docking port.\u00A0

prograde marker approximately halfway to the green crosshairs.\u00A0 As the green crosshairs get\u00A0closer to the white, I keep moving the yellow marker closer and closer to the white crosshairs to ensure that I consistently reduce my translational velocity during the approach.\u00A0 That forestalls the possibility of overshooting the alignment and needing to correct.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the green crosshairs ever turn red (this is usually accompanied by the orange marker disappearing, the yellow marker turning into a retrograde marker, much confusion, and possibly much cursing), then that means you have overshot your target port.\u00A0 Press N for\u00A0reverse thrust.\u00A0 Do this quickly; if you are still translating, then you can

provided that you and the target have the same orbital period, you will always return to the same relative position no matter how far you drift, and you will do this reliably on every orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other common trick to avoid orbital drift, and this works when approaching from any direction, is to close quickly, but incrementally.\u00A0 The idea is that as you make successive approaches, correcting the drift can be done with the braking burn.\u00A0 To do it in KSP, zero your relative velocity, burn towards your target (\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:targetpro:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/TargetPro20px.png\u0022 title=\u0022:targetpro:\u0022\u003E), and then, while keeping the navball in target mode, set \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to retrograde (\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/retrograde2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022\u003E).\u00A0 Do \u003Cem\u003Enot\u00A0under any circumstances\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0orient your vessel to antitarget (\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:targetretro:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/TargetRetro20px.png\u0022 title=\u0022:targetretro:\u0022\u003E).\u00A0 When you achieve your desired separation (closer is better--until you crash, so don\u0027t get that close), burn retrograde to re-zero the relative velocity.\u00A0 This solves for both your excess speed and the accumulated drift in one burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo long as you are within physics range (that\u0027s somewhere between two and three\u00A0kilometres), you can zero your relative velocity, point towards your target, and burn.\u00A0 A rendezvous burn from two thousand metres may drift enough that you completely miss the target by a hundred metres or more--especially in a low or fast orbit.\u00A0 In that case, brake at your point of closest approach (using the navball\u0027s relative velocity readout and retrograde marker for the speed and direction, and\u00A0the map view\u0027s target distance readout for range) and do it again.\u00A0 It wastes a bit of fuel, but that bit of fuel is from an aptly-named \u003Cem\u003Emanoeuvring reserve\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Docking is not about conserving\u00A0fuel; it\u0027s about conserving rocket parts.\u00A0 Since you can reliably get to within four hundred metres, you will have a much easier time of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis drift is the reason why nearly every docking tutorial begins with a review of rendezvous; when you are more than a few tens of metres from the target, any attempt to approach\u00A0the target directly will result in enough drift that you will miss.\u00A0 This is a fundamental consequence of the way orbital mechanics works:\u00A0 they had the same problem with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_4#Rendezvous_attempt\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGemini 4\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 The reason is because even though you begin dead in space relative to one another, you are both following curved trajectories around another body, and any difference in those trajectories will result in a variable relative velocity.\u00A0 If you were moving in a straight line, then pointing at the target and giving a tiny amount of impulse would always result in a dock, but you never are moving in a straight line when you are in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the reason why docking is considered among the most difficult of skills to learn.\u00A0 But you\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0learn it;
