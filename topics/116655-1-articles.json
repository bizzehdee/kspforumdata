Apologies if I\u0027m repeating something that has been covered already.\n\nAll fuel tanks were empty in my tests - the only power source was the booster. Pictures were taken at pre-launch (to show the test scenario), during ascent (as the results become apparent), and at booster burnout (to show the final result).\n\n[Test documentation gallery](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8ojv8tm1kjf7hbd/AAAeACDhQ__jVTvm-JTr47Z-a?dl=0)\n\nMark 1 / Mark 2 pieces. Question: is node size the predominant factor, or do different piece sizes matter?\n\n![1.1%20Rig1%20pre-launch.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/1.1%20Rig1%20pre-launch.png)\n\n![1.2%20Rig1%20ascent.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/1.2%20Rig1%20ascent.png)\n\nResult: piece sizes definitely matter. The raw Mark 1 / Mark 2 interface seems to cause a lot of drag.\n\nMark 1 / Mark 2 adapters. If piece sizes matter, what effect do adapters have?\n\n![2.1%20Rig2.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/2.1%20Rig2.png)\n\n![2.2%20Rig2%20ascent.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/2.2%20Rig2%20ascent.png)\n\nResult: adapters reduce drag, orientation matters\n\nOffsets - what if pieces are offset into each other?\n\n![3.1%20Rig3%20pre-launch.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/3.1%20Rig3%20pre-launch.png)\n\n![3.3%20Rig3%20result.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/3.3%20Rig3%20result.png)\n\nResult: offset does not matter\n\nOffsets, continued - what if pieces are separated?\n\n![4.1%20Rig4%20pre-launch.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/4.1%20Rig4%20pre-launch.png)\n\n![4.3%20Rig4%20result.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3333645/Aero%20test/4.3%20Rig4%20result.png)\n\nResult: offset does not matter\n\nBad news for my crazy plans, but hopefully the tests help someone.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-24T14:00:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by drewscriver**\n  \nfixed pics. arrgh."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:00:48Z","Content":"Piccy no worky."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:25:45Z","Content":"As I understand it, each node has a \u0022bulkhead profile\u0022 parameter, which defines whether a part is 0.625m, 1.25m, 2.5m, 3.75m, Mk2 or Mk3. Mismatched profiles in attached nodes will have more drag than matched profiles; this is how KSP models smooth profiles being better than ones with steps in them. It completely ignores offsetting though, so you can make some silly looking things that are still aerodynamic according to the model.\n\nRotation, however, is not ignored. You can exploit this by mounting an appropriately-sized nose cone to the front of a stack and then rotating it 180 degrees so it clips into the stack, this will actually result in less drag than having the pointy end exposed. I don\u0027t use this method for \u0022serious\u0022 craft though, as I feel it is exploiting the simplifications of the model.\n\nAnd yes, your inlined pics need fixing. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T15:39:11Z","Content":"Very strange.

I suppose the offset thing is only to be expected, there being a limit to just how much can be calculated/modelled without burning up the CPU. \n\nI tried something a bit like this but simpler a while ago. I found that even turning a part through 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 so it was blunt side into the wind didn\u0027t change its drag.
