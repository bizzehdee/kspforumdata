It was a very reliable 30-seat turboprop plane. We called it the \u0027bus airplane\u0027 because it\u0027s kinda shaped like a bus with wings... It also had a more upgraded cousin, the Short 360. A military variant of this plane is the C-23 Sherpa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/x59wY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
