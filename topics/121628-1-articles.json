This new iteration of the ubiquitous 8-sided probe core features a much more advanced guidance system. This new model however, does not feature built-in reaction wheels and does requires more power to run, even on standby. Its internal battery supply is also very limited, being intended mainly to keep the Standby LEDs lit.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eric bloedow","CreatedById":151553,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T23:51:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyes, i had thrusters and monopropellant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-07T00:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat about electric charge?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease post pictures of the vessel with the resource tab open (top right) to imgur.com and your output_log.txt from KSP_Data to a file share or test paste site such as dropbox.com or hastebin.com\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the support stickies for details.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
