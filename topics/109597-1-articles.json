Should be oriented with black on bottom and white on top with the same central point and 2:1 aspect ratio. Any way to unwrap this onto a sphere, rotate it from 0,0,90 to 0,0,0, and export the texture with the new poles?\n\n I was planning on actually touching it up before working it through a pass in Blender to reorient it. For one, it\u0027s missing pitch angle numbers all over the Northern hemisphere, and B ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif), the white half needs to be darkened to gray so as not to conflict with the yellow pro/retro markers.\n\n* * *\n\n A second question: I\u0027m looking at trying to use an alpha channel to add emissive shaders to my custom navball (EFDAI) on post 135 here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...ball%21/page14](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69540-Making-high-contrast-nav-ball%21/page14)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![HUDNav_Ball.png](http://s3.postimg.org/6i9tp9vqr/HUDNav_Ball.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n ... to give a slight glow to the reversed IVA navball and to highlight lines for added contrast.

The iva NavBall sphere material uses KSP\u0027s specular shader by default so technically it would work but you won\u0027t have any way to modify the shader\u0027s other properties (primarily specular color, shininess, and opacity). You might need to write yourself a quick plugin to do that"}]}
