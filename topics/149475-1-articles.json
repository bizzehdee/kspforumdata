So i plan the maneuver and start the burn. Everything *seems* fine until about 80-90% of the Burn then the m/s countdown slows down, stops (or even reverses slightly) and that keeps up until i have no more fuel. I tried using mechjeb in case it was some mistake i made but the same thing happens. The only explanation i can come up with is that Minmus is somehow \u0022running away\u0022 from me, but 1. Minmus is in a stable orbit it is not getting faster and 2. even if that were the case, that should have been accounted for in the maneuver and not happen out of the blue. I can\u0027t imagine that this is some kind of bug. I think i would\u0027ve heard something by now if it were impossible to get to minmus. Especially since i was there before and i didn\u0027t have that problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i do is basically get into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E (75x75) and then go to the map, set minmus as target, set a maneuver at the Ascending (or descending) node and pull the prograde vector until i get an encounter. Then i finetune that until i have a minmus periapsis of \u0026lt;100k and start the burn. According to the map i should arive at minmus and then start a circularization burn.

It only takes a couple of hundred ms \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to halve that time (or more), so if the Mun is in the right place when you start, you can get into orbit within about 4 or 5 days without too great an expense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should take a look at the Alex Moon porkchop planner to see what sort of timings are possible: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Minmus/30/Mun/40/false/ballistic/false/1/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Minmus/30/Mun/40/false/ballistic/false/1/1\u003C/a\u003E. If you click on advanced settings and reduce the minimum time to 3 days, you\u0027ll see that a 4-day travel time is possible without excessive cost once every eight days or so, there is an option for a reasonable 5-8 day transfer for about two-thirds of the time, and the rest of the time it is always possible to get a decent 9-10 day transfer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat the planner is showing, in fact, is just the effect of accelerating more towards Kerbin to catch the Mun in the right place. The best 4-day transfers generally have you leaving Minmus heading directly towards Kerbin with a 400m/s escape burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally, since that shorter travel time leaves less time for Kerbin\u0027s gravity to accelerate you, you actually end up meeting the Mun at much the same speed as if you\u0027d dropped slower, so the capture burn at the Mun varies surprisingly little.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-10T12:36:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2016 12:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Plusck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T18:22:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222794901\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149475\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476046864\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168715\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fuzzra\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Fuzzra said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re starting that long a burn at 75k you\u0027re possibly ending up dunking yourself in wispy atmosphere for a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot that I\u0027ve ever done that. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did it yesterday... and just boosted back through it. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut as others have posted.

It only takes a couple of hundred ms \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E to halve that time (or more), so if the Mun is in the right place when you start, you can get into orbit within about 4 or 5 days without too great an expense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should take a look at the Alex Moon porkchop planner to see what sort of timings are possible: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Minmus/30/Mun/40/false/ballistic/false/1/1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/#/Minmus/30/Mun/40/false/ballistic/false/1/1\u003C/a\u003E. If you click on advanced settings and reduce the minimum time to 3 days, you\u0027ll see that a 4-day travel time is possible without excessive cost once every eight days or so, there is an option for a reasonable 5-8 day transfer for about two-thirds of the time, and the rest of the time it is always possible to get a decent 9-10 day transfer.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat the planner is showing, in fact, is just the effect of accelerating more towards Kerbin to catch the Mun in the right place. The best 4-day transfers generally have you leaving Minmus heading directly towards Kerbin with a 400m/s escape burn.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd finally, since that shorter travel time leaves less time for Kerbin\u0027s gravity to accelerate you, you actually end up meeting the Mun at much the same speed as if you\u0027d dropped slower, so the capture burn at the Mun varies surprisingly little.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, i am still a noob when it comes to Interplanetary Travel. In fact i was never farther than Minmus. I\u0027ve been stuck in the Super-SSTA building cycle for far too long. Thx for the link. The diagram seems familiar i think i even have a launch window calculator mod. The problem is basically the Umbra Life Support mod. It depletes no matter if you fly or wait so if a wait for a perfect launch window that\u0027s just as bad as just flying. Of course it saves fuel, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
