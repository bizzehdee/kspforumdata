Minecraft, Elite, Space Engine, No Man\u0027s Sky, they all use procedural generation to create their universe. Yes they are beautiful, sure, sometimes Minecraft can create jawdropping structures, and sure it can make the universe feel bigger, but is it really needed for a good space game? To be clear, I\u0027m talking about complete procedural-ness, not something like Kerbal Space Program where terrain detail is aided by procedural bits, but overall the planets are designed by the developers.\n\nThe thing is, procedural generation can not create real uniqueness. In a randomly generated universe, there will always somewhere be another planet or terrain area that feels the same. Selena planets in Space Engine or Desert Biomes in Minecraft, for example. This doesn\u0027t have to be a bad thing of course, but you have to make sure it will really help.\n\nLet\u0027s compare to designed universes. For examples I will use Kerbal Space program and [The Outer Wilds](http://outerwilds.com/).\n\nEvery single location in Kerbal Space Program is unique, one way or another. Eve is a purple planet with ocean-filled craters, Kerbin is the green and brown and blue planet that reminds you of Earth. Duna is the red one with the white ice caps, Jool is a gas giant. A *green* gas giant for kraken\u0027s sake! Vall is the valley-mountain-range ice moon, Laythe is the ocean-covered moon, Tylo is the one that\u0027s hard to land on.\n\nThe fact that they are all specially designed means that there is only one place like it! Everyone will have the same challenge by going to the purple planet, and be able to share it properly. In a procedural universe, however, separates player experience. However, procedural worlds do allow players to be the first to discover a given object.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E \n\u003E \u003E Even more awesome perhaps is Outer Wilds. Outer Wilds has tiny little planets in its solar system. But they are also all unique, even more so than in Kerbal Space Program. The green-brown-blue planet is covered in these deep craters, somewhat normal. Then you get to the other planets. The gray one is literally falling apart, and has a moon that\u0027s spewing lava everywhere! The gas giant is actually a huge ocean world with sea creatures the size of small moons, the dark bramble is literally a mass of thorns! Thorns! There\u0027s so much variety here that you don\u0027t know what to expect (unless you read this paragraph before playing the game, which you shouldn\u0027t have.)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nI don\u0027t know *why* I wrote this. But, like, if you\u0027re gonna make a game, maybe this helps or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Flymetothemun","CreatedById":17689,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:55:02Z","Content":"I think it can be great for some games, good for others, and crap for the rest. I don\u0027t like it being used as an advertisement buzzword, though, It\u0027s just another way of having a world for the player to be in. I think, especially in this age of quickly-evolving computer hardware, that procedural generation might be sacrificing disk space for processor load, sort of a \u0022cut off the nose to spite the face\u0022 situation, and that that processor load might exclude a large portion of computer users who aren\u0027t involved in the high-performance gaming world. I do agree with you about the advantage of designed worlds having the same challenge to go to the same place or do the same things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T18:59:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 06:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Flymetothemun**"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:10:10Z","Content":"Wait for No Man\u0027s Sky to be released.
