Early in the game, you could really screw up if you were to lose your only pilot. Having both Jeb and Val serves a useful gameplay purpose that two more Kerbals would not serve. The main four characters may be 3/4 male, but the rest of the kerbal generator is 50/50 male/female. Just because the first four are mostly male does not mean it\u0027s sexist. I always thought of the veteran Kerbals to be brothers and sister. There are real world families that are three sons and a daughter. The skewed fraction is not inherently sexist. The representation of Valentina as a veteran kerbal on her own, with no gameplay differences from her male counterparts, is in my opinion enough. That said, I would still welcome an extra two female Kerbals, perhaps named Svetlana Kerman and either Mae Kerman or Sally Kerman. I don\u0027t feel that they would be necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the problem with gender diversity in KSP does exist: just not as the astronauts. None of the KSC staff are female. No female engineers or scientists, no female administrator staff. We still have a few buildings which we could add female administrators for. The Tracking Station could have a \u0022software-enginner\u0022 named Margaret [Hamilton] Kerman. You could even give the Engineer Report function for the VAB/SPH a face, and have that be a female Kerbal. Still not equal representation among administrators, but that coupled with the male and female KSC engineers, ground crews, and scientists on the VAB/SPH floor, can get it closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T15:18:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T17:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think that another two named characters are needed tbh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough if they are added, make it so at the start of career you pick 3 out of the 6 main characters to keep it balanced.
