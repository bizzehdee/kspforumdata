Some of you (if not most of you) haven\u0027t been here for the whole ride and missed out on alot of \u0022early\u0022 ksp. Below is a link to one of the earliest full fledged lets plays of KSP. All the way back when it was in 0.13...its still one of my favorite things to watch for neostalgic purposes (and was the initial reason I got into ksp). The youtuber\u0027s name is Kurt J Mac (i\u0027m sure many of you know him already) for those who don\u0027t know him he has inspired quite a few to play this game. I\u0027d just like to thank him (tho i doubt he\u0027d ever see this post ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)) for sharing with me one of the best and most enlightening games I\u0027ve ever played!\n\nFor those of you who haven\u0027t (or even those who have) seen his series, please, take some time and watch an episode or two! You might enjoy it!\n\nvery first episode: \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD603D8234AE51EF0\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T04:45:23Z","Content":"Wow, this is old... 2 months before I started playing."},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T05:19:12Z","Content":"Hahaha. That\u0027s the very video that got me into KSP!\n\nI was very into Minecraft at the time, and followed Etho, Guude and the Mindcrack crowd in general, One day I noticed Kurt had this KSP game and thought my son would like it. Bought it for him almost straight away. Then I started playing it (more than my son).
