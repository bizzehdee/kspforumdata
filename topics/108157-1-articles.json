The youtuber\u0027s name is Kurt J Mac (i\u0027m sure many of you know him already) for those who don\u0027t know him he has inspired quite a few to play this game. I\u0027d just like to thank him (tho i doubt he\u0027d ever see this post \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) for sharing with me one of the best and most enlightening games I\u0027ve ever played!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you who haven\u0027t (or even those who have) seen his series, please, take some time and watch an episode or two!
