When you get within 500m switch to RCS transitioning.

Also switch to chase camera (usually the V key). This way you can aim your ship exactly in the direction you want to get on either side of your target or directly to it. Then you can gain required speed by short burn or by using RCS. At 500 m I would probably still use normal engines, especially if your ship is equipped with retrograde engines to which you can switch to brake when you get closer (because turning around at such close distances may be dangerous).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking is no different than hunting navball markers at close rendezvous, if you\u0027re oriented the right direction, just keep your prograde marker on the target marker and watch your relative speed to not get too close too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-07T17:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Skorpychan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter which way I burn on the pink markers, it pushes me further away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I just burn straight for the target, or what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically yes.
