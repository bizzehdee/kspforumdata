Not specifically for KSP. It\u0027s actually built for extreme simulation and modeling programs. So far just got all the drivers set up and my gawd this thing is insanely fast. Also I haven\u0027t ever quite seen a BIOS screen as spectacular as the GIGABYTE.

That also includes a new tower because the G1 mobo is huge. I just built a simple craft and put it in orbit. All mainsails. Did not skip a beat once! All the graphics settings are maxed and it is in full screen mode. I\u0027m going to crash the ship now and see how it handles a big explosion!! From the feel of it this system is awwww just love it!! OK found that FSX display!

I\u0027m going to bed now, but I will bring my save file over with my much larger ships and stations and we\u0027ll see what kind of performance I can get!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-14T02:46:04Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2013 02:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Xiphos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T04:46:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds EPIC!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut $3000 is a wee bit TOO much money for me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thermobaric","CreatedById":31322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T10:29:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt sounds EPIC!\u003Cp\u003EBut $3000 is a wee bit TOO much money for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats probably because of the graphics card, that card costs 750 dollars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOP, may i ask what you are planning to do with that graphics card?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: nvm i didn\u0027t see you used it for modeling\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-14T10:33:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2013 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by thermobaric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T14:22:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thermobaric\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thermobaric\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThats probably because of the graphics card, that card costs 750 dollars.\u003Cp\u003EOP, may i ask what you are planning to do with that graphics card?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: nvm i didn\u0027t see you used it for modeling\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes modeling and simulation. Running finite element analysis on entire assemblies, thermal analysis, all while the assembly is in motion. Or simulating assemblies while fully rendered. Takes a computer that can really, REALLY handle it. I\u0027ve been using a standard desktop for a while, and finally got sick of it taking 15 minutes to run a simulation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd as far as cost, yes the components are top of the line, but there are many options just below what I have and you save $100 here, $100 there. Ex: all that ram is $300. Maybe you only want 16GB. Saves $150. Maybe you don\u0027t care about the SSD? Take another $250 off the price. And since you don\u0027t want 32GB of ram, you can go for a smaller MoBo, saving you even more $$. etc, etc. I can tell you though so far I haven\u0027t regretted spending the money one bit!!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moxzot","CreatedById":25497,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T20:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eso i know that card isnt built for gaming and ksp uses cpu as much as gpu on hard rendering can the card be used as like a sub cpu to help with processing so in theory it preforms just as well asa gaming card on ksp but its all a guess ive only used gaming cards\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TouhouTorpedo","CreatedById":30603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T20:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re running Solidworks, aren\u0027t you?
