For example, in the US there is no law directly saying that landowners do not own the airspace above thier lands. By \u0022airspace\u0022 I mean everything from ground to mars and beyond. The common law (ie 1000\u002B years old) was that you owned all of it. Then the airplane was invented ... but nobody changed the law.

Many have speculated that, were it not for the lawyers putting the brakes on overflights, the US would have been first into space. Google \u0022international geophysical year\u0022 to learn about that debate. Week governments like the US fed do not have the authority to usurp landowner\u0027s rights. So they don\u0027t speak about owning various altitudes. The treaties they sign instead speak of non-aggression, not officially complaining about overflights. (The US fed is \u0022week\u0022 in that\u0027s its authority is limited in respect to individual states, versus countries like Canada where the national government is the be all and end all.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practical terms, altitude doesn\u0027t matter so much as trajectory. A sat at 1000km, but on a suborbital trajectory, would still be considered an overflight (ie DPRK lobbing things over japan).
