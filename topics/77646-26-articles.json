Rather than making small coils with ferrite cores, it might be a good idea to have frames with large area. (For a current loop, torque is IAxB) We can count on a mag field of about 30\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BCT. Maybe a bit stronger. The loops can carry an amp easy. So a 100 turns on a frame that goes around the full face of a sat, we can get 30\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BCNm of torque. With a 1kg cube, depending on how the mass is distributed, we could be looking at 0.01 - 0.02s\u003Csup\u003E-2\u003C/sup\u003E of angular acceleration.

I\u0027d probably want a 50 turn frame on each face with individual amps for a touch of extra reliability.
