Those are the limitations. And to be honest, 1.0 lifted a very great amount of them. And no, seriously, I\u0027ve seen realism complaints about aero, RTGs, solar panels, engines, fuel tanks, communication dishes/antennas... the list goes on. And as far as I know, people have been sharing crafts and content based on specific addons forever, so I don\u0027t get what the fuss is now. Lastly, I did not know that moddability depended on stock being bugless. So long for the days of the API giving us insane amounts of hooks to go in and replace/modify all the stock systems.\n\nIn that case, then, I agree. 1.0 definitely lifted a lot of those limitations. But unless you\u0027re classing the performance of engines in that, it doesn\u0027t mean much in regard to the issue here.\n\nThe fuss now is the same as it\u0027s been before.\n\nIf you build crafts with mods like B9 or KW, you aren\u0027t expecting to share it with people who don\u0027t have those mods. The same applied to FAR, as well, since a lot of things that behaved like planes in FAR, behaved like anvils in stock. It\u0027s different when you want to play stock and build stock crafts, but are using a mod to correct some kind of ridiculousness in the stock game. That\u0027s why we prefer the ridiculousness to be corrected rather than just living with mods.\n\nIf stock itself is already suffering with bugs, why would you want to add more bugs on top of it with mods?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The spring that Creativity comes from is called Constraint. Your thinking of Imagination.\n\nAnd when the spring is so rigid that creativity is actually hampered, that\u0027s how you know something\u0027s screwy. You especially know something\u0027s screwy when the creativity is being hampered \u0022just because\u0022, rather than for actual gameplay value as is the case for career, with the constraints of funding on top of the standard constraints of gravity, aerodynamics, ineptitude, etc.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This game is a simulation...people will debate the accuracy of it, but it is a simulator, not an arcade game. You are asking for things that are impossible. Of course ion engines will not get you to orbit. If you have such a problem with this fact, edit your files. Make the ion engine create enough thrust for your mission. It is a simple .txt file. Back it up and edit it to make the game work for you.\n\nIt\u0027s a simulation of an alien species and their space program on an alien world. If you want to use impossibility as an argument, and also use our real world as the definer for what\u0027s possible, then things like atmosphere-capable Ion engines are probably near the bottom of the list of things you disapprove of, and not solely because atmosphere-capable Ion engines are (apparently) already in the works.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Nothing has changed in the game that stops anyone from building unrealistic \u0022cool\u0022 ships.

If you want your Enterprise replica to fly like the TV version, well, the SF mods are over that way.\n\nOf course, as long as they just want to admire them on the ground and don\u0027t plan on actually doing much with them. I realized the efficiency price for aesthetics myself when I sandwiched a plane in a fancy and complicated wing setup. Had all the lift in the world, but also a glide distance of like 2-3 kilometers before becoming a stone. The issue isn\u0027t really about that, though (my problem there was drag), it\u0027s about how severely the engines have been restricted to their designated roles. Aesthetics doesn\u0027t have as much to do with that.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So basically you don\u0027t like the efficiency of the engines as currently balanced and aren\u0027t willing to step outside the box that Squad put them in? Good to know.\n\u003E The KR-2L isn\u0027t for sea level work so you\u0027d have to choose a different engine if that efficiency bothered you.

That\u0027s an example of there not really being a choice when there was almost no scenario that I remember encountering where I would pick the Terrier over the Spark.\n\nIt is true. Differences between engines are quite large and there are often choices should I use one larger engine, which is somewhat overpowered, or two or more lighter engines which requires complicated radial or cluster structures. For example between Mainsail and Skipper in launchers, LV-Ns, Poodles and Terriers in interplanetary use, Terrier and 78-7S in small probes and landers etc. Difference between 1.25 m and 2.5 m systems is also very large (multiplier is 4) and forces to make choices.

If you can not come up with working planes/rockets it in fact shows that you are not using creativity to come up with solutions to problems. Now I hate grinding things out and that is why I do not play mmo\u0027s but ksp never feels like a grind at all. If you see it as a grind then this game is not for you in the slightest. I am sure there will be a space program game built for the COD generation in the future which will be more to your liking and level of play.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I find it requires MORE creativity. The old, unrealistic way meant you could just find one or two go-to engines and use them for everything. Now it actually matters that you pick out engines more suited for different phases of the mission.\n\nI must say that you sir have hit the nail on the head. 1.0.x now gives you the tools and the actual need to be hyper creative and I for one think that it is a move in the right direction."},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T07:59:22Z","Content":"I frankly don\u0027t see any problems in stats, and I love the part rebalance.

It always will be unless you make them all have the same TWR, and the same Isp curves.\n\nPersonally, I don\u0027t think having engines with identical stats, just in different sizes, leads to much creativity.\n\nThat said, I think the sea level Isp of some of the vacuum engines is really low."},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T08:35:40Z","Content":"\u003E That said, I think the sea level Isp of some of the vacuum engines is really low.\n\nThough someone else mentioned the expansion ratio of an engine going from 16 to 117 between atmo and vacuum versions, from 97 atmospheres of pressure this ratio \u0027could\u0027 produce only around 13 atmospheres of pressure, about a 6th of the efficiency of the atmo (my maths might be really wrong). So my espresso machine produces 9.3 atmospheres of pressure, so a 13 atmosphere mechanical pump is probably feasible.

From then on the rhino is producing more thrust. Once you get to 9.7 km the rhino is putting out over 1800 kN and its Isp is better than the mainsail and keeps getting better.\n\nAlso, repeated implications that the people you are talking to are stupid is not usually a good way to get your point across (especially when your point is a matter of a somewhat misguided opinion)."}]}
