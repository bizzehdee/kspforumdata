When an event has 2m01s remaining it is shown correctly, two seconds later it displays 59s remaining instead of 1m59s. As it reaches 0s it again shows 59s remaining and the event fires off at the correct time so it is probably just not displaying the 1m component for events between 119 and 60 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d also like to know if it is by design that I can\u0027t seem to queue a command (e.g. kill rot) if connectivity is absent. I have already sent a re-enable antenna command so it will be established, or perhaps I know I will be in range at a future date. If this is by design then that\u0027s ok, but it was unexpected - perhaps if connectivity is not established in time for the event to arrive at the designated time it can simply be discarded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was getting frustrated that my probe\u0027s antenna kept falling off during re-entry until I figured out how to use the delay, especially the first command - retract in the future, and in the meantime accept the following timed commands. It\u0027s also a tad confusing that I can\u0027t set up a bunch of delayed commands (e.g. four minutes from now), then issue and immediate command after that (I\u0027m done queuing, go ahead and retract), so checklists are a must. Again, if by design then fine since inserting commands into an existing list as opposed to simply appending is a coding headache, but it is a bit counter-intuitive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I\u0027ve got these timed commands nailed I am having such a blast getting flimsy craft safely back to kerra-firma.

So far my network though consists of 1 KS \u0022komm\u0022 sat, and 4 in orbit around 300km if I remember correctly. I think I launched the KSO sat with a capsule on it though I can\u0027t remember for sure. It can be done unmanned I think, as long as you go straight up until about 30k and gradually do a gravity turn. This way your AP should remain in view of KSC long enough for you to get a stable orbit. Of course then the Pe is on the opposite side so it is hard to get a KSO Ap above KSC like that lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe I setup my 300km 4 sat network first (using the same method of unmanned and a steeper ascent profile) and then sent the KSO sat up. My 4sat network was also sent all at one time, 4 sats on the same launcher, then had my Ap/Pe adjusted so every time the launcher came around to, in this case Pe (set to 300km, and Ap much higher), I released a sat. This way the sats were released at 1/4 of the way around the orbit, give or take, as I was sort of just guessing lol. I did have to adjust their positions to get as close to 300km as possible as they got way out of sync. Some were off by as much as 5km which over time ended up making a huge gap in the net. Was \u0022easy\u0022 enough to fix as I just had to adjust the orbit depending on if there were too close or too far from the sat in front of them. Will likely need adjusting again eventually but so far its ok. Original plan was to send up a 3 sat network for KSO but I was having connection problems I think and was trying to do it unmanned so thats when I did the 300km network, may not even need a complete 3 sat network really. Right now though I\u0027m working on getting more science as there are some parts I want to get, so I haven\u0027t put much more thought into the network...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was originally trying to fit close range and long range into the same network, but I think I\u0027m going to work on a \u0022deep space\u0022 network that I might just put in orbit around Kerbol at Kerbins orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway enough rambling for now lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndreyATGB","CreatedById":62674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T17:21:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use 5 KEO sats which replaced my first career network of 5 semi-synchronous sats early on.

It\u0027s a little pain to maintain but now they\u0027re all within 60m of each other\u0027s orbit (the most deviation from 2868.75 is about 2868.71).
