M_empty is the mass of your spacecraft after you\u0027ve burned off the propellant ( M_empty = M_full - M_propellant ). It doesn\u0027t matter what units the mass is given in as long as both the full and the empty mass are in the same units.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, if you have a 50 ton ship which includes 30 tons of propellant, then M_full = 50 and M_empty = 50-30 = 20. If it has an LV-N, its Isp is 800. So you get its delta-v to be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v = 800 * 9.8 * ln (50/20) = 7189 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that ship can make propulsive maneuvers coming out to a total of 7189 m/s before it runs out of propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have multiple stages, you can calculate the delta-v for each stage and add them together. For example, if the previous 50 ton rocket also had a 80 ton first stage including 60 tons of propellant with a mainsail engine, then M_full = 80 \u002B 50 = 130 tons, M_empty = (80 - 60) \u002B 50 = 70 tons, and the Isp of a mainsail is 330, so the delta-v would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta-v = 330 * 9.8 * ln (130/70) = 2003 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the first stage has 2003 m/s, and the second stage has 7189 m/s, so the whole ship has a delta-v of 2003\u002B7189 = 9192 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T15:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother point is that if you have multiple engines with the same Isp, you use that Isp in the rocket equation: 3 LV-N\u0027s, use 800 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have multiple engines with different Isp\u0027s you have weight the individual Isps by the thrust they generate.

First to delta-v to create a hohmann transition and second the delta-v to circularize the orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst let me say to things about the question. The simple assumption is that you are moving from one nearly circular orbit to another. I almost never do this and I generally find ways not to do this. There is a simple reason for this. Lets take the Kerbin Duna example. Once a duna launch window is optimized we are going to wait until a certain kerbin \u0027Angle to prograde\u0027 (as in MechJeb) and theoretically you want to burn a certain amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E from as low a kerbin orbit as possible. I strongly recommend not doing this below 70k because if your acceleration is high enough and the target is DeltaE high enough, you are going to have a heat problem. 70.00001 km suffices to avoid that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat ideal transfer from kerbin is never going to happen, there are acceleration limits and the exact shape of the transition is hard to estimate. So typically for example from Kerbin you might be on angle to prograde of 150\u0027 and start at 2 minute burn at 0.3 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. As your burning your spacecraft is lifting and you get less of the oberth like gravity well effect. So different rockets will produce slightly different \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea here is this. Keeping kerbin in mind. From any given circular orbit you need to add x V to leave kerbin (meaning you escape but linger close to kerbin). removing m, E/m = 1/2v^2. Lets say at 70k the orbital velocity is 2300. So here is a little trick for any given circular orbit, the velocity required to escape is SQRT(2)* circular velocity. 3252 therefore gets you out of the Kerbin system. At circular orbit your KE is 2.65E6 J/kg (or 2.65 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E/kg) and you need a KE of 5.29 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E/Kg to leave the system from that orbit. SO lets say at Kerbin orbit (Kerbol) radius you need 1000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach duna radius. That translates into 500,000 j/kg of KE. So lets add .5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E/kg to escape energy of 5.29 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E and that equals 5.79 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E. That tidbit tells us how much energy we need a kerbin 70K orbit. SQRT(5.79 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E/kg * 2) = 3402 m/sec. You started with\u00A0 2300 and you need 1102 or slightly more than your orbit breaking speed. Had you created an orbit 80M meters (essentially requiring\u00A0 950 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E for the transition and a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to make orbit. YOu would have need to add a trace less than 1000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at the angle to prograde of 90\u0027 to reach Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow come it is cheaper to burn from low kerbin than high kerbin. How does a high kerbin orbit loose energy. High kerbin orbit did not loose energy, what you do in a low kerbin orbital burn is you increase Apoapsis without increasing Periapsis. In a high orbital burn you\u00A0 have put (thermodynamic) energy into the periapsis altitude and increased apoapsis. The way I like to look at this once you are in a circular orbit your centipedal force and gravitational forces (two very interesting faux forces) cancel. The time you spend fighting gravity to reach a higher orbit. If you throw all the energy you need in at once, you spend less time fighting kerbins gravity and when you leave the system you get that energy back to use to fight Kerbols gravity. If you raise your orbit in bits and then transfer you have spent unnecessary bits of time fighting gravity which you could have simply escaped from quickly. This is the weakness of ION drive, although have very high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, because of the very low acceleration of true Ion drives, they waste almost half there \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E in interplanetary transfers fighting their way out of the gravitational well before they transfer. Transfers are also a problem with NTR because the low thrust to weight of these rockets means they spend a considerable amount of energy raising their departure planets gravity well. Where both excel is moving between bodies in which time spent near pE is long. For example an Ion drive burning close to the sun might generate good system leaving velocities (getting to closer to the sun and not poofing is the problem, lol)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK so now how do we find out the cost of reaching Duna. The amount of energy in an orbit is a function of mu of the central body, semimajor axis of the orbit, and the keplarian laws of motion. Its not easy to calculate except at periapsis and apoapsis. We assume that kerbin is the periapsis and Duna is apoapsis. The Major axis is 13.3Gm \u002B (19 to 21)Gm \u002B diameter of kerbol \u002B radii of kerbin and duna. Resulting semi-major is about 17Gm. From there you can calculate based upon keplarian laws of planetary motion what your velocity should be at 13.3Gm and subtract kerbins orbital velocity. For planets with relatively close orbits that budget is not so high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo thats that bit.\u00A0 Unless you have started your transfer on an ascending or descending node and calculated that into your kerbin burn. you need to make roughly 80 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E of plane change burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next bit is harder and a place were many space-flight end in ruin. In the case of an a prograde burn from low orbit you know where you are and you simply need to burn until you intercept the next orbit, your burn is not idea, but your going to lose a few \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E as your vertical velocity increases during the burn. On entry you need to do several things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Determine the closest point you can retrograde burn. This may differ based on mission (atmospheric reentry versus complex landing and docking) you need to determine the orbital velocity of that altitude. (r = altitude \u002B surface radius). This is omega^2 * r = mu/r^2\u00A0 also written as v^2/r = mu/r^2. We can rewrite the second as v = SQRT(mu/r). For Duna at 50 km altitude (r = 370,000) this translates into 920 m/sec orbital speed. You put into the system 1000 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to get from kerbin to duna, more or less you have to take it out, its not as important as you think because on Duna entry 0.5 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E but\u00A0 2 x .451 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E added from duna escape to duna 50km alt of which we keep 0.451 in the orbit. As a result we get to our burn point with 1674 velocity but we need to burn to 920 and this leaves 750 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E approximately . (Mu = Mass of central body times gravitational constant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the problem is where to burn. This is were good engines com in handy. If you are reversing 750 m/s and your accel max is 2g (20 a) then you need 37.5 seconds or lead the periapsis of 52 km with about 18 sec burn prior. Its not going to be perfect because 18 second prior you will be above 50 km. Most efficient deep space engines do not have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E with fuel load of 2g, so this where sacrifices are made. You burn for to short and you will have to correct apoapsis and reburn at periapsis. you burn too early and your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E ends up in the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, My math is not perfect, you should get actual mu from Kerbal wiki, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E spent on plane change will vary. Also on kerbin or duna entry you may have to deal with interfering bodies (like that pest Ike).\u00A0 You need about 2500 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to reach Duna, your are not going to nail it (at least if you use stock game) and you should have a flexible system that allows re-purposing fuel, such as for landing or return.\u00A0 Unless you are using a flight computer, both the velocity and altitude of Planets changes. Its not simply a matter of knowing were a planet will be, but also how fast it is going when you get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA word of advice, worry less about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E requires a guess is often good. Worry more about getting good \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. I have found weaknesses in the game in terms of structural parts, I have added my own parts like piping and pipe connectors that allow polyfunctional craft with better efficiency. If a sz0 part will do the job on a sz1 lander, use the size zero. I dont use mono on landers, a sz0 reaction wheel suffices. Less wheel, less battery, fewer panels. Duna is about drag, for instance, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to land is almost zero if you design the shape of the craft with drag on bottom and aero on top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-17T10:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223196924\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002241146\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221508210611\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022101096\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, shynung said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to ask something along the lines of this thread, but from a different approach.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuppose I have a ship in orbit around a certain planet (or landed, which is an easier way of saying \u0027synchronous low orbit\u0060).

Where are the ascending and descending nodes? like you say \u002B/-\u00A0 bearing burns can reduce the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E need out of kerbins orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. That the theta of kerbin should intersect as close as possible to Moho\u0027s apoapsis in it orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way when you transit you are going to be as close as possible to its pE when you intersect. Even though you will have more energy trying to intercept a moho Apo, your differential velocity relative to Moho will be less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will almost never correspond to a window that allows a transfer to Moho. Fortunately Moho provides a solution. One the planes match look for the \u0027bugs\u0027 that are one above the ships orbit and directly below on moho\u0027s orbit. This indicates a retrorgrade \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E at Moho\u0027s pE while send those bugs counter clockwise to intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf correction in inclination have to be made during the Hohmann transition remember that the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E = Orbital velocity * sin (\u0027change). If the degree change is 7 and you do the plane change at 18,000 m/s that means 2193 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E need to be added. When the craft exits kerbin it is traveling at 6000 or so m/s the amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required is one third.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-20T04:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust\u00A0 making a correction to one of the links provided.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Moho, if you transfer from 70 km kerbin orbit. The best place is the ascending node that is close to Moho apoapsis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Launch at 96 Angle to prograde (6 minutes to midnight ).\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The angle to use\u003Cstrong\u003E is not 45\u003C/strong\u003E\u0027 This is too steep for plane changing to Moho\u0027s plane. instead use 73.5 degrees (heading) from launch and switch to prograde at 36 km altitude. Set circularization altitude for 70.5 km or so. This establishes the maximum heading in orbit of 15 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. It takes approximately 2250 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E and the burn should begin between Angle to prograde of 310 to 295 depending on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E. The apoapsis of the circum kerbol should be about 1.5 days in front of kerbin. A small correction burn in flight may be needed to get an inclination of 7.000. When you cross 270 angle to prograde (high noon) the bearing should be 105\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. It takes 2559 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (moho intersect) and 323 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (insertion at 500 km altitude) to establish a circular Moho orbit (this is high, I carry three satellites and set up a network on Moho before landing). Another 1000 to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal cost to Moho 4200 \u002B 2250 \u002B 2559 \u002B 323 \u002B 1000 (10,032). Kiss ole Jeb goodbye, you need about an additional 60% \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E (~16,000) to get him back to kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIF we compare this with to intersect Moho using a strait bearing of 090 and then plane change in kerbol orbit.

The plane change required is 7 degrees at orbits apoapsis is best place to change. 6214 x sin 7\u0027 = \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E 757 m/s. Consequently a combined burn to intersect Moho and plane change starting in low kerbin orbit (2250 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E) versus a two step burn (2173 \u002B 757 = 2930 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003Edv\u003C/abbr\u003E) saves ~700 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.
