The models aren\u0027t any good anyway, so it doesn\u0027t really matter if they sink in or float a little (also note that some of the stock parts have bad colliders, which make many parts float above their surface).\u003Cp\u003EFor the BTDT and MapTraq the analyze data action group is available to be set to a hot key while in the VAB. The fix for that is simple, though not very important. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested the fix for the no power bug a little more. It seems to be working, you can start and stop scanning with no power, the animation plays and the part behaves properly after power is restored. Maybe changing this so that you can only enable or disable scanning on EVA while there is no power would be a better idea. But for now it works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure why the ground track would be affected by any changes in v6, but I can see how the map update may be a little slower.

But that too can wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that the map is always set at 640 * 640 pixels, at least the square map is. Do you need the ALCOR capsule to get that rectangular version of the map? Or am I missing something in the regular 1-man command pod? Either way, the map is pretty small, a cache should only take up a 1 or 2 MB of space.
