I opened it up the sfs in a text editor and then copied the orbit details of one craft to the one on the pad and when I saved it and went to the tracking station in game, it had removed all of my ships.

Or you can try the orbital construction plugin. Its more realistic in which you bring the ship parts up to a \u0027dock\u0027 part for storage. Then you build the ship with the parts in the dock and it appears next to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
