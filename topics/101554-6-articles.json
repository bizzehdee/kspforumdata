Petrnonator\u0027s second entry looks drivable at start of run, if he can retract enough gear bays to be able to drive in a straight-ish line without toppling the whole structure. The capsule is not a rover after release, but it easily could be with addition of a couple of wheels. With some modifications Juzeris could certainly also meet this standard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the \u0027drivable after run\u0027 part makes it harder for vehicles that do \u003Cem\u003Enot \u003C/em\u003Eescape, and impact Minmus somewhere. Even more difficult for a craft that hits Kerbin.

As I recall there is some gyro use in yours, with midair flips to gain speed prior to hitting the launch ramp. I wonder if some kind of sliding mass rig would work to increase speed even further, i.e. get momentum from the \u0027fling\u0027 effect I and Juzeris used, but keep the craft together to meet the Open requirement? Or maybe spin the craft in air after launch and \u0027pole vault\u0027 by having a stiff enough section impact the ice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I may have struck gold.... just need to get it to minmus....
