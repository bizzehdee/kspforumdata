The jet engines you have chosen are heavy and die out around Mach 3.5. I would suggest using the turbojet engines, which don\u0027t lose power till around mach 4.5. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also rearranged your engine layout so there is no issues with the CoT vs CoM, no matter the engine in use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img716/2029/cnus.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cnus.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img834/1944/x4ka.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022x4ka.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img707/736/mubx.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mubx.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the quick build I did off your pics you posted and 15minutes of work.
