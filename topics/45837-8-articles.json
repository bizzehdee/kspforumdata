The space race was an aspect of the Cold War between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. The two countries could not just stand up and slug it out over their differences because that would have been far too destructive. So they found different, less destructive, methods of competing and demonstrating to the other countries of the world the superiority of their social, political, and economic systems. The venue of outer space was particularly apt for this because it allowed the demonstration of superior technology and engineering, and also demonstrated the superiority of economic systems because a country would not be able to maintain a multi-front program to explore space while simultaneously keeping a strong military and providing good lives for their people without having a strong economic system. This is what the space race was all about, and this is also why so many of the initial efforts involved concentrating on \u0022firsts\u0022 for their political propaganda values (such as stuffing three men without spacesuits into a Vostok capsule with no abort system and trying to pass it off as a whole next generation of space vehicle developed in such a short time, or putting a poorly-trained women in a capsule just to be the first to do so, or changing plans for Apollo 8 just to get it to the Moon before the other guys might loop somebody around it first).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe U.S.S.R. certainly had the early lead because of their large ICBM (which they developed to carry huge, clunky hydrogen bombs...where as the U.S. didn\u0027t need to plan for such large ICBMs because they were further advanced in thermonuclear bomb technology). This is why Kennedy set America\u0027s primary goal to be the landing and returning of men from the surface of the Moon... because this would require a sufficient advancement in technology and booster power in a short enough time period that he figured the U.S. could get there first despite the U.S.S.R. having been first out of the starting blocks. Ever since project Gemini, where the U.S. was the first to develop the truly important techniques needed for space exploration (rendezvous and docking, and learning how to do effective work during EVAs) and Apollo (being able to build a successful very large booster, and sending humans deeper into space than simply lobbing them into LEO, which we sadly all fell back to later), the U.S. was ahead of the U.S.S.R. The U.S. had superior space probes with instruments of superior technology that provided vastly more information about more planets than the U.S.S.R. could manage, and many more space telescopes of superior technology to study the universe at a wide variety of wavelengths. The U.S. developed the first reusable spacecraft, and had the economic power to keep it flying to rack up a huge number of man (and woman) hours in space (and not of the political-stunt variety). Sure, it was only limited to LEO, and was nowhere near as cost effective as hoped for (but that makes its continued use an even more impressive demonstration of the U.S.\u0027s economic power). The Soviets managed to fly their knock-off shuttle once, and their heavy-lift Energia only twice before their economic system eventually collapsed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022space race\u0022 was a politically-motivated demonstration of technological, industrial, and economic might. What humans have left from it is some legacy technology, some of which continues to chug along in low Earth orbit activities, a few probes from that era that continue to putter along, and a fair amount of science that was done along the way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZingidyZongxxx","CreatedById":58363,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-06T21:26:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe winner of a race is who crosses the finish first, not who starts first.
