I set my target GameData directory as as a file on my desktop. Im not even sure if that is a smart thing to do, but it avoids the problem of having files misdirected, and I move them were I want them to be. I also had to uninstall and reinstall unity. I install part tools 2.0 into Unity\u0027s Standard Package directory, and then pull the 2.0 files from the project\\assets\\parttools directory and replace them with part tools 2.3 (3 files). It works. \n\nI don\u0027t know why people are doing this, its a bit of voodoo that goes unexplained, but thats the song and dance (IOW i hope someone comes in and explains why 2.0 needs to be in Unities Standard package directory but then pulled and replaced)."},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T05:27:54Z","Content":"My understanding of how Unity works is pretty limited, but I think that GameData folder setting only tells your Part Tools enabled object where to write itself. It won\u0027t pull in any projects for you, you have to do that yourself by dropping them in the assets folder. \n\nI was also under the impression that Unity can\u0027t read Mu files, assuming IVA models use them."},{"CreatedByName":"the Dutchman","CreatedById":143576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:06:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E From the link [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65356-0-23-PartTools?p=1878643\u0026viewfull=1#post1878643)\n\nthank you"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:36:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I hope you get a reply to this I cannot help you much.

Looks like I will need to do some more blind guesses, although I\u0027ll see if I still have PartTools 2.0 and try the trick you mention here, and maybe dust of the KSP 0.90 install and see if it behaves better.\n\nEDIT: Pointing it at the 0.90 installation works. I guess I\u0027ll see if I can back-port some of the new stuff into the old installation and work with it there.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:38:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MOARdV**"}]}
