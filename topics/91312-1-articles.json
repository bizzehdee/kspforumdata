This because some mods are apparently incompatible with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, before I get too far, I\u0027m wondering if there is interest in creating an overall matrix, showing what mods are compatible with each other. I\u0027d be asking for input from people as to which mods they have installed with each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially, to keep it simple, I would be doing it for two installed mods at a time only. I do realize that some mods require others, so those would be counted as a single mod for the purpose of this matrix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if you could answer the poll below, I\u0027d appreciate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe information I would be asking for (initially) would be something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
