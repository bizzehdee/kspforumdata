Simple truth is that the way most folks put them on and with the mass of the actual booster, the thing would crash into the ground (for all the usual reasons: too much mass, didn\u0027t slow the thing down enough, etc.) anyway if the game didn\u0027t just pitch it after a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve pretty much given up on putting chutes on my boosters; as long as the game will let you get away with doing that sort of thing, all it does is add mass you don\u0027t need.
