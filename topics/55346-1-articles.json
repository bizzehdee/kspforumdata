What I hope to do with this is have a modular system that allows me to upgrade or resupply any craft as needed. For instance, my COMSATs in Kerbo-stationary orbit are somewhat lacking in antennas (I use remotetech as well). Since I was thoughtful enough to include a docking port on that particular model of COMSAT, I\u0027ll be able to stuff a couple of these \u0027pallets\u0027 in my Space Shuttle replica, put some antennas and an RTG on each one, fly it up to them, dock them on the COMSATs (working on how to do this), and presto!
