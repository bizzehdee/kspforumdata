Sure it cuts down on the part count, but I\u0027d like to be able to decide if I want that function on a rocket or not. For example I almost don\u0027t see the point of putting kOS on a command pod for example. Which in this case, I could just leave that part out of the config file, how ever if kOS was made specifically to be built into stock parts then I might not have that option. Then again, I just wouldn\u0027t have to turn it on, but it\u0027s still there and the code for it is activated. At any rate, I think the option I posted the link to is the best solution for this.

Unless I\u0027m misunderstanding something. print \u0022\u0022 at (x,y) is half broken in that if there isn\u0027t already text at that location it won\u0027t print. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EDidn\u0027t try eta:apoapsis with print at though...\u003C/span\u003E Just tried it, it does work, but like I mentioned it has to be at a location that already has text. In my case I don\u0027t get any error messages (from command line anyway) if there is no text at the line you\u0027re trying to print to, it just doesn\u0027t do anything....Ok just tried it in a program, and it works the same.
