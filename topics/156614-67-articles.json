She had been working with a close friend for at least the past two decades, maybe more. They worked at the same electric motor\u00A0manufacturing job since before I worked there, and I was there for nine years (2000-2009). After we were bought out and closed down, they both applied to the lab where I work. They\u0027d been there two years already by the time I started there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the other of the two old work friends retired about two weeks ago, due to health issues. The person they put in her former position\u00A0has been with the company\u00A0for around a year already, and he has worked numerous times with my this old\u00A0friend of mine. There were never any problems... Till he replaced her old friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past week, there were enough complaints that HR got involved, and all suspicion went toward the dude who had just started the new role. He was brought in to the office, pretty much reprimanded, and told he needed to change his attitude... and the complaints kept up. The difference, is they observed, and realized that it was \u003Cem\u003E100% HER!\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0She was refusing to show him how to do things, as he was trying to train in, then would complain about how he wouldn\u0027t do stuff, or did things wrong, or didn\u0027t \u0022care\u0022. HR saw that things were not as they seemed, and things escalated for her when they confronted them both together, and he complained about her not giving him a chance to even\u00A0try to learn the position. When HR sided with him, and told her that she was in the wrong, that she was being unfair, and that she needed to treat him fairly and actually train him into the position, she apparently flipped. From what I heard about the incident, people who saw it go down said she seemed to claim that everyone had ganged up on her and she felt threatened.\u00A0To be fair, I saw the crowd from a distance.\u00A0HR, the department supervisors, their assistants... Half of the management from that side of the building ended up in an area only as big as three counters and a sink. In her state, I can kinda understand her feeling cornered.\u00A0She gave an ultimatum, that he had to go, or she would... and they told her that if she walked out the door, to leave her key fob behind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was so abrupt, I never had a chance to talk to her, ask her if she was okay, or even say goodbye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get that a major life change had just occurred for her. NO ONE saw this coming. She probably spent at LEAST 1/3 to 1/2 of her life working, literally side by side, with the same friend... And that was over. Knowing that her friend had medical issues (not life threatening, but quality of life issues), and had to give up working over it must have been incredibly stressful. She\u0027d been there seven years, and was a very good worker, and most people there know each other. It\u0027s not a massive company. So, I guess my complaint... Dang it HR, dang it management... I get that she was in the wrong here, but it was also clearly an emotional breakdown, and instead of talking her down, they \u003Cem\u003EESCALATED\u003C/em\u003E the situation to the point where in her fragile mental state, she felt threatened and walked!
