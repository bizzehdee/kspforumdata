However, I really hope all this new stuff doesn\u0027t unbalance creativity. If you plan to make Texture packs a thing, you should try to make sure people can still be creative. Texture packs shouldn\u0027t just be a few cloud changes and maybe a lighter/darker atmosphere tint. They should push this pack to new reaches that make the game 20% better. Not a few minor changes to what already exists.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I might as well ask. How is far is the update in terms of what you want to do with it before release and how fast you\u0027re working? Would you say it\u0027s around 1-2 weeks time,1 month, or a few months time? I was planning on waiting for the next EVE update to release V5 of better atmospheres, but the only feature V5 is actually NEEDED for, is the Sunrises/sets, which can easily wait until a V5-1. We still have alot to do with BA before release starts rolling around, but we\u0027re not far from it.
