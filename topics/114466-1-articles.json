I did a clean install and downloaded CKAN, to get things right you know. But in CKAN I could\u0027t find Realism Overhaul, obviously because it\u0027s not up to date with KSP!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I installed quite a bit of mods with CKAN! Some beautyfication mods, contracts mods (because stock contracts thinks you can get in to orbit and do contracts for under 30k, my best effort landed me around 101k) and so on. Now, my game wouldn\u0027t start! I got to and completed the loading screen, but when main menu was about to load it crashed! I deleted some mods, got me a little further but always ending in a crash!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I did the communtiy workaround to 64-bits (first time I\u0027ve ever done that). It all started up (with Nyan Cat at the loading screen) and I got a Sandbox save going! Launched a rocket, didn\u0027t get me quite in to orbit but I had 5.8 km/s so I thought \u0022Hey, let\u0027s try it at 2 km/s slower and se what it does.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlammed in to the Earth at about 5.5 km/s.......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething (probably FAR?) is interrupting 64-bit, causing a significant decrease in drag?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m back to square 1.. I can run RSS, FAR and so on without 64-bits, that\u0027s proven. But I cannot land from orbit (or a close-to-orbit sub-orbital trajectory) with these mods. Either I burn up (pre-64) or I\u0027m slamming the ground doing 19800 km/h (post-64).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want RSS, I want the challenge. I want it with RemoteTech, TAC:LS, FAR and all those other \u0022real world-mods\u0022. But am I hoping to much? Hoping that all of these mods will work with only 32-bits?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a cause of \u0022i can\u0027t get what I want\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E :(\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
