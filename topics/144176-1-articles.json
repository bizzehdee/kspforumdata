This is what happens: I spend literally 8 hours straight (I have no life) building,\u00A0launching and I eventually manage to get 3 Mobile Prossesing Labs producing copious amounts of data (One in Kerbin orbit, One in Muner orbit and one on the surface of Minmus). On my return to the space center the game crashes. I then open KSP again and load the game and it loads the game with around a 8\u00A0hour rollback. I\u0027ve lost all of my vessels, not just the ones already launched but the some of the save files of the actual vessels. I find that I don\u0027t even have the parts I used to build them unlocked yet. Obviously I was quite upset, so guess what? I persevered and DID IT ALL again, only this time, I managed to also land a probe on Eve. I go back to the space center and CRASH! I\u0027m thinking \u0022I\u0027m all good, there\u0027s no way I just completely wasted all of that time again.\u0022 I load the game up and was right back where I was before, with a half built ship and without some of the parts unlocked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy friend just reported he had the same issue.

If anything, I would consider the $40 I spent on this game a donation to the development of this absolutely astounding piece of virtual bliss. I have full faith in Squad/Flying Tiger to being able to fix these major game breaking issues sooner,\u00A0rather than later. Also, considering that this is now considered a complete game on Xbox One, not a preview, I\u0027m sure we can expect to see a fix in just a few weeks at the absolute latest (Microsoft doesn\u0027t take too kindly to selling \u0022broken\u0022 titles).
