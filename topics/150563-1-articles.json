First attempts were without avionics, tried just leaning it a little to the east and letting thrust and gravity take care of the rest. Unfortunately, rocket kept deciding it wanted to go west instead, threatening the lives of many of Floridians. Had to range safety those launches shortly after lift off so we wouldn\u0027t have a spent stage land in someone\u0027s backyard. Next attempts included 2 V2 avionics, one for each of the first two stages. This worked well, but the first attempt with this configuration had batteries on the final stage run out before I could ignite it. So I added a small battery to the top of the final stage. On the second attempt, my AJ-10 failed halfway through the burn. The aerobee burned just fine though, resulting in a final altitude of 2,700\u002B KM. Would have been a bit more if that AJ-10 had burned all of its fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/AU5nC\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/AU5nC\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, by now we have unlocked early avionics, which means the next mission will be our first orbital satellite attempts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
