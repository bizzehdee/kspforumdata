But instead of a pad you have a base launcher to drive it in the water and up into the air from underwater and then separate once slightly in the air. Basically a ballast based ICBM or sub missile that starts deep or move quickly in shallow water then goes up into the air to separate the real rocket. It could be reusable as it only jumps out of the water and relands and acts as a moveable landing pad for the real rocket. It could even try to use super cavitation or other exotic methods to make it more efficient.

And nuclear reactors are\u00A0compact and robust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt just seems that not only does the LH/LOX setup take longer, it has arguably more parts and is more susceptible to combustion failure (BOOM).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater does not have that problem, as nuclear reactors provide the energy for water propulsion, not chemical combustion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso nuclear exhaust can be designed to be fairly safe too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow if you can convince me that a nuclear \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0seawater NTR will likely always be necessarily heavier than an LH/LOX incarnation \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E... then you might persuade me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI doubt that is the case though....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-08T00:50:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2020 12:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
