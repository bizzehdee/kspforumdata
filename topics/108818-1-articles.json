An idea I threw out there was to have the map view fidelity and zoom level appropriate to some photographic surveys the player has done. Early cameras might give a zoom level on a survey down to looking down from 10km, while a photographic \u0022crasher\u0022 probe like Ranger might allow you to zoom all the way to ground level---but only in the area your crasher imaged. Ideally the procedural cratering on the Mun would be applied to ALL airless bodies, and with the minimal crater size possible set slightly smaller (and a different version for worlds with atmospheres). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that caves like the actual image I posed above would be pretty cool, just because it would be cool to explore. That said, it still needs to be \u003Cem\u003Euseful\u003C/em\u003E, hence my suggestion about having Squad make some pre-designed bases with a mechanism to construct them akin to upgrading facilities assuming some minimal requirements are met at the location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe trick with any \u0022science\u0022 in KSP, is to rethink it in terms of doing things that are:\u003Cp\u003E2.
