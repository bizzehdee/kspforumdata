Once niether of these can be done tolerances in application can result in a variety of possibilites, as has been suggested by multiverse opponents, there could be universe with laws different from our own.

Fantasies after all open up all kinds of logical possibilities, for example if I can say focus the plasma of a star into a planet, then I can beam that plasma to blow up 5 planets at once, and sell a billion in a movie theater on one night. You cannot really argue that one persons fantasy is more logical than the nexts. Fantasies sell, reality is less palatable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for theoretical physics, if you want to set a practical limit then this is one of the goalpost. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_catastrophe,\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLol.

So for example say I created a billions pairs of entangled particles which I then separated into two identical boxes, I then send one on a ship to a distant world, say 400 hundred years in the future the sent unit is resolved on a timed schedule, followed by observation of the stationed unit, there is nothing to per-say prevent communication as long as the resolution occurs before observation. I could theoretically used this to create a bit map and instantly create an image elsewhere at some later point. Then the question is how to create and keep pairs without their states being modified. Light for instance is difficult to store in situ, electrons are similarly difficult. The extrinsic factors may limit its use in communication. As the latest quantum computing experiments demonstrate that as long as a process does not interfere with other process that \u0027have go back in time affects\u0027 they can proceed along independent lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf all the wormholes in the universe are preordained, then I could travel back in time using a wormhole to a point when inflation stops, drop a grain of sand at a certain point, and cause a huge sector of the known universe to evolve in a completely different way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
