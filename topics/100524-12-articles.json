I was also wanting to see what 25% of the wing area for the tail looked like with a relatively short aspect ratio (wound up going 3:1) and 10% of the wing area for the fin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECame up with this, the Phoenix 7c:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VCzyCip.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VCzyCip.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlew pretty well - takeoff speed was low, around 95 m/s, and yes it did have issues at 30k with getting above Mach 4. FAR greenlit everything except N\u003Csub\u003E\u00C3\u0192\u00C5\u00B8\u003C/sub\u003E at 30/4 and that was unstable, but the plane flew straight and true the whole time. Didn\u0027t even oscillate much until I got up above 20k and began leveling out to gain speed. Had about 18% rocket fuel reserve after orbital insertion. Same 6.1 tonne probe the 7b took to orbit. I\u0027d have SPH screenies for y\u0027all, but the game crashed on me prior to the actual flight and LoadOnDemand didn\u0027t want to work right away after I fired the game back up, so all my parts were purple and grey until about midway through the flight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking I probably could stand to up the wing loading a hair - the Concorde, Tu-144 and SR-71 had loadings up around 0.45-0.5 or thereabouts. 25% also seems a bit much for the tail still but it\u0027s hard to judge. I might try this design again as a tail-less delta with canards just to see what that\u0027s like. 10% definitely seems to be too much for the fin (and yet I\u0027ve got a yaw instability, which in general you\u0027re supposed to correct with \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E fin, right?). I\u0027m guessing the fin root chord needs to be longer than I\u0027ve got it so I don\u0027t need so much span-wise, but then I run into the issue of insufficient mounting surface for where I\u0027ve got it; I\u0027ve already got issues with the design there as is. I\u0027ve also noted that the fins on the SR-71, Concorde and Concordski are maybe 1.5 times the height of the fuselage and the fin tip chord is maybe half to two-thirds the length of the fin root. Shorter aspect ratio there too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI need to figure out a good way to build a cranked delta wing too; just cuz. One of y\u0027all mentioned I should be looking at fourth-generation fighters and that particular planform is used in a lot of the ones I\u0027ve looked at. Pretty sure B9 Procedural Wings won\u0027t do them (at least not as a single wing piece).

Total listed wing area was a little over 28 square meters, so wing loading was somewhere around ~0.4 tonnes/square meter or thereabouts. It did struggle to get above Mach 0.8 under the jet\u0027s power alone; in the flight I lit the rockets at 15k to bring it up to the target speed range and help lift it to the target altitude. As I mention in the album, the plane actually did accomplish its mission but I was also running a test for the guy who runs the NavUtilities mod to see if it would work with blizzy78\u0027s toolbar (it\u0027s totally borked otherwise), and when I went to activate that mod\u0027s UI to bring up an ILS interface, it completely blanked my flight UI in Staging View (kinda like hitting F2, but no way to reverse it - I couldn\u0027t even bring up the game options menu with the ESC key).
