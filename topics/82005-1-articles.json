Mostly coolant and such. But I came across one resource I am going to need that I think other mods are already using (KSP_Interstellar for example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to add Deuterium to the list of resources. I know how to do this. But a quick search of the forum shows many mods that are using or thinking of using Deuterium. My question is how do I keep from conflicting with other mods when I create a resource? I did see a post (lost it when I closed the browser) by Fractal_UK about using some sort of community resource pac (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F2NYLj47O6VdThCXqBcI_hB-bDIMh4ZWB2FFyrjMLkg/edit#gid=650840806\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Egoogledoc\u003C/a\u003E) to keep track of the different resources. Now, I do not use KSP_I myself but I can make my Deuterium resource to match what he has listed so if someone has both his mod and mine, they won\u0027t conflict.... or would they still cause an issue regardless? And what about other mods that may already be using it with slightly different flow mods, densities and costs that I do not know about? How do you you guys prevent these possible conflicts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Roadkill","CreatedById":111931,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T03:51:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the problems of having such an easily modifiable game is conflicting mods. It\u0027s ultimately up to the user to make sure mods are up to date and don\u0027t conflict. Module manager is one of the best and the worst things to happen to KSP, as it allows anyone to make changes to mods and parts, and it allows anyone to make changes to mods and parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAlmightyOS","CreatedById":105590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-18T20:59:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the reply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will charge on ahead then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
