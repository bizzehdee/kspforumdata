If Kerbin had the same population density of Earth, it would have a population of just 62 million. Yet despite how small Kerbin is, the physics of flight remain the same as on Earth, so runways need to be just as long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, if cities were to be added into the game I would hope they\u0027d be much bigger than 1km. 20km2 would roughly equate to Tokyo on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T06:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get your point \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/65526-ratchetinspace/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002265526\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/65526-ratchetinspace/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RatchetinSpace\u003C/a\u003E, but\u00A0does it actually matter if the runways and cities are not in proportion to Earth standards? \u00A0I don\u0027t think it does petdonally, there is nothing to say that Kerbin\u00A0is as over populated as Earth, or\u00A0that they have a similar town planning policy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027settlements\u0027 just need to be big enough to indicate main areas of habitation (or the bits of them visible above ground) so that the planet looks like it actually has a civilisation of some sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RatchetinSpace","CreatedById":65526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T09:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222736529\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146174\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472623849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022130621\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pandaman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, pandaman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI get your point \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/65526-ratchetinspace/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002265526\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/65526-ratchetinspace/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@RatchetinSpace\u003C/a\u003E, but\u00A0does it actually matter if the runways and cities are not in proportion to Earth standards? \u00A0I don\u0027t think it does petdonally, there is nothing to say that Kerbin\u00A0is as over populated as Earth, or\u00A0that they have a similar town planning policy.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0027settlements\u0027 just need to be big enough to indicate main areas of habitation (or the bits of them visible above ground) so that the planet looks like it actually has a civilisation of some sort.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuite agree.
