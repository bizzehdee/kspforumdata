It makes sense IRL that if a rocket thats tall tilts it should break when hitting the ground. And that the crew on top probably shouldnt survive. But i dont want this mechanic in my playthrough! I feel like when i have touched down at less than 6 m/s i should be safe even if the rocket tilts. Is there a mod that can prevent my rocket from blowing up after tilting?

A good set of landing struts can do wonders as long as you land on a flat surface and touch down nice an strait. You could always put them near the tip of the rocket so that they hit the ground first (once it has tipped over.). They might absorb enough of the impact to protect the rest of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
