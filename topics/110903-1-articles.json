It makes sense IRL that if a rocket thats tall tilts it should break when hitting the ground. And that the crew on top probably shouldnt survive. But i dont want this mechanic in my playthrough! I feel like when i have touched down at less than 6 m/s i should be safe even if the rocket tilts. Is there a mod that can prevent my rocket from blowing up after tilting? Thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T18:54:21Z","Content":"Unfortunately, the tip of a tilting rocket can hit the ground faster than 6 m/s, so parts with low impact resistance \u0022should\u0022 explode. I think USI Kolonization Systems has a \u0022damper\u0022 part that tries to reduce motion on the ground, but that\u0027s part of a big landing frame and it may be getting deprecated anyway.\n\nAlternatively, you might try surrounding vulnerable capsules or science pods with high-impact-resistance parts (e.g radially-mounted girders), or keep your mouse at the top of the altimeter and click the \u0022recover\u0022 button as soon as it pops into view. [USI Survivability Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/84359) also has airbags and floats."},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T19:38:33Z","Content":"What are you trying to land on Kerbin that is so tall? A good set of landing struts can do wonders as long as you land on a flat surface and touch down nice an strait. You could always put them near the tip of the rocket so that they hit the ground first (once it has tipped over.). They might absorb enough of the impact to protect the rest of the rocket."}]}
