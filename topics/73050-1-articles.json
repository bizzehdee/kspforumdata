A TWR of 2 means you can accelerate upwards at 1g. A TWR of 3 means you can get 2g. I agree that most of the statements like \u0022you need TWR=2\u0022 aren\u0027t particularly accurate or helpful but it doesn\u0027t change the fact that, using the only definition of weight that makes TWR make any sense, your TWR is a well defined number no matter where you are, what direction you are travelling in or how fast you are going. You just need to think about the forces acting for the value to be useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T16:56:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt probably means you are orbiting the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T16:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022allmhuran\u0022 data-cite=\u0022allmhuran\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENothing.

So you have to draw in an equal and opposite balancing force to account for the linear motion of the vessel. This equal and opposite balancing force is \u0022centrifugal force\u0022, and we\u0027re allowed to add it precisely because we redrew the frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t be fooled into thinking that this means there are actually two forces acting upon a vessel in orbit which add up to a net force of zero allowing it to \u0022not fall\u0022. The net force acting on a vessel in orbit is non zero, that\u0027s what makes it change direction (F=ma, a change in direction is an acceleration).
