To me it goes back to the ARM engines being all wrong, since the Vector is a quarter of a Mammoth. They both reflect the Shuttle engines. To my mind the Mammoth should be less powerful but perhaps more efficient, the Vector taking the same effect, while the Kickback should be considerably higher thrust. This would also help correct one of the problems KSP shuttles have, which is too much thrust and mass in the orbiter compared to the boosters and ET. The real Shuttle stack had only 20% of its thrust and 5% of its liftoff mass in the orbiter, not much off-centre mass to cope with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I\u0027d like to see the whole engine lineup rejigged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-06T16:22:05Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2015 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-06T16:59:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the Vector but it could do with 1/2 -2/3 the thrust it has now.

The problem is on its own the Vector is only represented by its engine nozzle, so in a physical package about the same size as a Reliant it packs five times the thrust. That\u0027s the only part that\u0027s really jarring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps the solution is to make it really long like the nuke engine with all its turbomachinery out on display. Then have a special hollow adapter for shuttle clones that you can attach to the bottom end that will hide all the engine innards when it\u0027s attached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-08T03:47:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2015 03:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycho_zs","CreatedById":137644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T02:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIRL SSME are surprisingly compact: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pratt_Whitney_Rocketdyne_space_shuttle_main_engines.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pratt_Whitney_Rocketdyne_space_shuttle_main_engines.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut still, Vector has too few \u0027guts\u0027, especially compared to Mammoth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-09T02:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution I advocate is introducing upgraded versions of the Terrier and Reliant.

Using skippers for a shuttle was always annoying due to the huge tank butt, and the thrust was always quite lacking once you put a full sized external fuel tank on it. Really all that can be done is to remove the tank butts from \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E engines.
