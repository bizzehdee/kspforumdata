Otherwise, you can just land an empty lander/plane by him and recover the aircraft. Also, regarding immersion, I don\u0027t think it can be explained in universe: if you can recover kerbals anywhere in Kerbin, why do you need to send a rescue ship this time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about immersion regarding kerbals stranded in bodies the player hasn\u0027t visited yet. If a (new) player is still trying to perform a Duna landing and has yet to unlock nukes, what happens to immersion if a contract becomes available about rescuing a kerbal stranded in Eeloo?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tntristan12","CreatedById":7005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-23T21:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about this? If you strand a kerbal on another world, you can activate an emergency beacon via right click. On doing so, you take an immediate reputation hit, and the action cannot be undone. However, if you rescue your kerbal and return him safely you get that reputation back and then a little extra. Not a contract per se, but a more fluid implementation of the search and rescue dynamic being proposed here. It makes sense too. A rescue mission wouldn\u0027t be proposed by a third party contractor and now you don\u0027t have any kerbals popping up out of nowhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
