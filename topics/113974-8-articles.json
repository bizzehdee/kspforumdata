After many hours, the people seemed to have finally gotten their fill of her, and were now milling about aimlessly, pointing and staring at the various sights around the Space Center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tremendous roar went up from the crowd as an aircraft thundered past overhead, its engines shaking the ground, a thin trail of white smoke following behind. It pulled up abruptly, pirouetting about its own axis several times before flying back the way it came, inverted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Let\u0027s get a big round of applause for Kerbonaut Jorrigh Kerman demonstrating the Kr\u00FCnian-built Oskar EW-5894 \u003Cem\u003EFleischgewehr\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0advanced trainer!\u0022 An announcer echoed over the loudspeakers, \u0022but keep your cameras out, folks, we\u0027ve got a big surprise coming up for you in just a few minutes!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd obliged on both counts, Valentina just took a deep breath as another drop of sweat plopped into her left eye. How did these people \u003Cem\u003Elive\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like this? Sure, people grumbled about the humid Ussari summers but that was \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0like this! She hadn\u0027t stopped sweating since she\u0027d arrived, even with seemingly every building of any size having air conditioning. Which was also strange. And this sun... she could feel it searing her skin just standing here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill... it hadn\u0027t been all bad, so far. Saying her goodbyes to Igor and Junior Lieutenant Kerman had gone fairly smoothly, even if the good Junior Lieutenant \u003Cem\u003Ehad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0looked as if he was about to jump ship and claim asylum for a moment. But ultimately, he had decided that several hours trapped in a confined space with an aerophobic behemoth was less daunting than pledging allegiance to a fruit-filled confection. Hmm, she was going to have to ask someone about that bit, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe speakers echoed once more, \u0022ladies and gentlekerbs, Kerblings of all ages! The Kerbal Space Administration is proud to bring you the shining pinnacle of aviation! Please turn your eyes skyward and welcome Captain D.N. Kerman flying the Layland L-1011 spaceplane!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hush drew over the crowd. With everyone else, Valentina looked up, straining her keen eyes. Nothing to see but clouds and--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn an instant, something black and pointy flashed by silently overhead. The shockwave came a moment later, scattering anything not held tightly and nearly lifting Valentina clear off the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022How \u0027bout that sonic boom!\u0022 The announcer gushed. Valentina was holding her head, wondering if she had permanent hearing damage now. Bizarrely, the rest of the crowd just seemed amused. The dark, vaguely triangular shape shot up into the sky at an incredible rate of speed, long bluish trails of fire spitting from its engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This cutting edge design from the good folks at Layland Heavy Industries has already distinguished its self as the fastest aircraft ever made, and the first to fly into space and return in one piece. Mostly. Watch Captain D.N. as he makes a low pass over the water!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStraining to see over the other people, Valentina raised up on the tips of her toes but could see nothing but necks and hair. Was \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the new KSA spacecraft? That didn\u0027t seem likely, they weren\u0027t exactly being secretive about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lookit that rooster tail! The L-1011\u0027s afterburning propellium engines can send it to the edge of space and beyond on their own, but this bird is packing one extra punch over the L-1010 model!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain the sleek form raced upwards, then circled the Space Center and turned back for another pass over the crowd. Just as it flew over the launch pad, a tremendous explosion rocked the ground, Valentina could feel the heat from the blast on her face, then she saw the aircraft shoot skyward on a pillar of fire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s all perfectly safe, folks, the L-1011\u0027s hypergolic rocket engine runs on fuels that are nearly harmless to Kerbals!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina put a hand to her face. These people really were quite mad. At least dinner last night had been... pleasant, if a bit awkward. It had been just her and the KSA Kerbonauts, the \u0027cargo,\u0027 as that obnoxious \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0had put it. That gorgeous, dimpled \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI\u003C/em\u003E. Being little more than cargo, that she could relate to. But there had been no mention of the incident, just pleasant conversation she\u0027d only struggled a little to keep up with.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund had regaled them with thrilling tales of his time flying rescue missions for the Kleptogart Coast Guard. Jorrigh had spoken candidly about his own time in space, and once Valentina had begun comparing notes the exchange had quickly broken down into a bizarre hodgepodge of broken languages and emphatic hand gestures that amused everyone to no end. It had been an odd path from the deserts of Gerin to the Kerbal Space Center for Jerdous, as he had explained, and Burdous just spent most the time pouting, when he wasn\u0027t threatening people with a soup spoon, which was also odd.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of soup, the meal had been quite pleasant, too. Some things had been familiar, some things not, but Valentina had eaten heartily. She hadn\u0027t the heart to tell the chef about the borscht, though, he had obviously tried very hard. But it just wasn\u0027t the same without beets. Finally, with a full belly and feeling quite optimistic, she had retired to a room that looked very much like her room back at the Cosmodrome, and slept the sleep of the utterly exhausted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then today happened.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove, three aircraft shrieked by in tight formation while the announcer prattled on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina was used to bureaucracy, the Union ran on it, but she had expected this place to be... different, somehow. Instead, it seemed like \u003Cem\u003Eeveryone\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0needed her to sign something here! First was the immigration and customs paperwork, then nondisclosure agreements, safety wavers, and very formal diplomatic documents that used as many words as possible to say absolutely nothing. That was all well and good, but the \u003Cem\u003Epeople!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had started last night, just the odd request here or there, but today with the crowds it had come in a torrential wave after the speeches and ceremonies. They were all \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0polite about it, of course, but it had been long hours of slow moving lines. Everyone wanted her to sign \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003Ething, pictures of herself, mostly, but also books with lots of other signatures, a myriad of merchandise from something called a \u0027gift shop,\u0027 and one very odd fellow who wanted her to sign his--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina shuddered, despite the baking sun. She\u0027d been sure to wash her hands very thoroughly after that. And burnt the pen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, the flow seemed to have ebbed, and she found herself mostly alone and unnoticed among this jostling crowd of sweaty bodies. This whole \u0027open house\u0027 affair was really quite strange, its self. All these people just wandering around the Space Center with almost no supervision! The more sensitive places were simply roped off, and there didn\u0027t seem to be any crowd control squads at all, just ordinary police officers zipping about in their strange little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. And with the near-constant barrage of high-performance aircraft streaking by overhead, she thought the whole thing must be some sort of thinly veiled display of martial prowess.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe doors to the familiar-looking \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E stood open, and Burdous\u0027s rocket inside, well... it just looked quite tiny in the massive building. Valentina had never had a good look at any of the Foreigners\u0027 rockets before today, all the film she had seen was grainy or blurry. Seeing it now, the same design that had launched Sir Kerman and poor Edmund... she thought it might be the \u003Cem\u003Eugliest\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thing she had \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seen. Not at all like the sleek, modern Ussari rockets. It almost looked like it had been cobbled together from junk one might find lying by the side of the road. And why would they need such a huge building to support it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSA was also expanding, that\u0027s what someone had said. If the Kommissar wanted her to uncover information on a new and presumably larger spacecraft, it would presumably need a larger launcher as well, she supposed. But, from what \u003Cem\u003Eelse\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she\u0027d heard, the KSA wasn\u0027t having much luck with that part at all. One thing they \u003Cem\u003Edid\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0seem to have no trouble with, was recruiting new Kerbonauts. The lower floors of their Kerbonaut Center had been practically crawling with young, slightly bewildered faces last night, while the top ones were nearly empty. It did seem like quite the production, but what could they be up to, being so far behind the Union in actual technology? In fact--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething tugged on her pant leg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked down into an enormous pair of bright, intense eyes. Hiding behind the eyes was a tiny face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Aw you da thpathekerb?\u0022 Said the face.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um...\u0022 Valentina mumbled, trying to translate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA tiny hand tugged on her pant leg again, \u0022my bwudda\u0027s gonna be a thpathekerb.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe didn\u0027t have much experience with Kerblings, how was she supposed to respond again? \u0022Well... isn\u0027t that...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0027E gonna go up inna thpathe an bwing me back a M\u00FCnwock.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe face nodded very solemnly, \u0022\u0027e \u003Ci\u003Epwomithed\u003C/i\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat was it one was supposed to do with children again? Give them candy or some such? The Kerblet seemed to be expecting some sort of response. Valentina was saved from any further contemplation of her complete lack of maternal instinct, however, as a voice rose over the din of the crowd.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Anna? Anna?!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe horde parted before her and a figure suddenly emerged, \u0022\u003Cem\u003EAnastasia Kerman!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a single fluid motion, the figure, who sported a towering cylindrical hairdo and gaudy cat eye sunglasses nearly as wide as it was tall, swooped the little Kerbling up into her arms, \u0022how many times have I told you not to go wandering off like that, you little dickens!\u0022 She tickled the little one\u0027s belly eliciting a happy squeal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina had thought it was perhaps a trick of perspective at first, but no, the child\u0027s eyes really \u003Cem\u003Ewere\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0that large. She pointed a tiny finger at Valentina now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thpathekerb, mummy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Who? Oh. Oh! \u003Cem\u003EOh!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 The mother clapped the unoccupied hand to her cheek, \u0022ohmigarsh it really \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you! Oh my, oh my, such an honor miss Kermaniva!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKermaniva?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina smiled warmly, and opened her mouth to reply, but the strange lady spun around and emitted a sound that could challenge a Converter in both volume \u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E shrillness, \u0022Herb? Herb?! Herb! Get \u003Cem\u003Eover\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0here! It\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Coming dumpling,\u0022 came a weak, placating voice. The crowd parted again and another figure emerged. Only a moment ago, Valentina had thought this lady\u0027s voice was the only thing that could rival a Converter for loudness, but this fellow\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eshirt\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0would have far exceeded that, the grotesque jumble of colors likely would have burned the eyes right out of her sockets had it not been mostly covered by enough camera equipment to survey a small planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yes, pumpkin?\u0022 The owner of the unfortunate shirt said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look, Herb, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E, that Ooski spacekerb lady, get a picture!\u0022 She of the tall hair and hideous sunglasses pronounced in a slightly less shrill tone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well Illbedarned, so it is!\u0022 He raised the monstrosity around his neck, which revealed its self to be but a single camera sprouting lenses and flashes like black plastic tentacles, \u0022say cheeeeeeeeeesedoodles!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mother sidled up next to Valentina and held the child up between them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesedoodles!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina was never quite sure exactly what happened next. She thought she might have witnessed the birth of a new star or perhaps a the death of an old one. The entire world disappeared into brilliant, blinding light in a cacophony of clicks and pops. As the light faded, afterimages of strange colors and shapes remained burned into her retinas as the bizarre family continued their exchange oblivious to her blind groping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Herb, have you seen the boys lately?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gosh, Schnookums, no, not since Ed said they they were going to take that load of bags from the gift shop back to their room.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Blah, all the way back to that Kerbonaut building? I \u0027spose we should we go find them, then, it\u0027s stickier than a RatSquirrelFish\u0027s tush out here, dontchaknow!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right you are, Loviedumplins!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on sweetie, let\u0027s go find your big brother.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Biwwy!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe voices soon disappeared back into the greater bedlam, leaving Valentina to rub her aching eyes and contemplate her likely permanent blindness alone. Her eyesight returned in time, mostly, annoying electric floaters still persisting everywhere she looked. Somehow, she had blundered along to a large roped off area just in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. A growing press behind her stalled any thought of going elsewhere, as the loudspeakers once again echoed to life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We\u0027d like to thank all you folks for coming out here today to welcome our incoming class of Kerbonauts and to see all that the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E has to offer. For our grand finale, please give a warm round of applause for world-famous daredevil Ebil Kerneival performing his signature stunt: skydiving without a parachute!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait,\u003Cem\u003E what?!\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe crowd sent up a tremendous cheer as high above a small plane droned into view. As Valentina watched, a small, Kerbal-shaped form fell from it in a frilly white suit. A drumroll thudded out from the speakers, and the the cheer became a hush, the form plunging toward the heat-shimmers of the concrete below. Valentina stood transfixed, unable to look away from the tragedy about to unfold. The figure foundered, tumbled for a moment, then landed squarely on its helmeted head and \u003Cem\u003Ebounced\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe gasped. The white-clad figure landed again, and was still. Murmurs began to ripple through the spectators.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the figure popped up and waved, albeit a bit unsteadily.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m ok!\u0022 It said in an equally unsteady voice, and the crowd exploded into cheers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Never underestimate the impact tolerance of the Kerbal head! Ebil Kerneival, everyone!

We\u0027re going to have to pull the entire buss and bench check it, something must\u0027ve got borked on the install,\u0022 said the still unseen owner of the helmet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022If you say so, chief, but that\u0027s gonna delay the rollout,\u0022 said one of the technicians.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You just get the buss pulled,\u003Cem\u003E I\u0027ll\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0handle the tests, we can get this pig back together before third shift,\u0022 said the helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Afternoon, Burd,\u0022 Gene said with just a hint of extra amicability, \u0022buss B still being a pain?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I knew it was gonna bite us to update the electrical subsystems this late in the game,\u0022 came the voice from the helmet, \u0022it\u0027s causing more problems than it was supposed to fix!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We can come back later if you\u0027re busy with the capsule...\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh?\u0022 The helmet twisted awkwardly around, revealing a familiar unhappy face whose eyes locked onto Valentina, \u0022oh, it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Playing tour guide again, Gene? That\u0027s all right, I was just leaving.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe helmet wiggled around again, then popped loose, \u0022here, Burbles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other technician took the helmet, and stepped back. Burdous thrust one arm through the narrow hatch, then the other, then began a sinuous wriggling motion, slowly emerging from the tiny space like some sort of bulbous, oddly graceful insect emerging from a cocoon. Valentina could only stare in awe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe stepped up to her and thrust a space-mitten at her, \u0022don\u0027t touch \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E, got it?\u0022 then moved to a nearby workbench and began stripping out of his pressure suit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked mortified but nodded to Valentina, \u0022go on, have a look. Everything\u0027s on the table, remember?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina glared at the obnoxious spacekerb for a moment, then gingerly crouched and stuck her head inside the capsule, careful not to touch \u003Cem\u003Eanything\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Once again she stared in awe. Nightmarish, claustrophobic awe. The capsule didn\u0027t look that bad from \u003Cem\u003Eoutside\u003C/em\u003E, but the \u003Cem\u003Einside\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0was completely filled with equipment. She thought even \u003Cem\u003Eshe\u003C/em\u003E, with her small frame, would have trouble squeezing into it, even without a bulky pressure suit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You go to space two days like this?\u0022 She looked at Burdous, \u0022you are brave Kerbal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe sneered back at her, \u0022well \u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of us don\u0027t need luxury to get our jobs done.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina frowned, she hadn\u0027t meant it like \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, \u0022we have no luxury, we put equipment on service module, no need for land. Sphere is better use of space, also. This like, what is word? Sardine can.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSurprisingly, Burdous turned to Gene, \u0022there, you see? I told you we should have gone with the Spud.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022A bit late for that old argument, isn\u0027t it Burd?\u0022 He sighed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m just saying,\u0022 Burdous said, hanging his pressure suit on a rack, \u0022there\u0027s a reason these Ooskies are putting twenty tonnes at a go into orbit and we\u0027re still struggling with \u003Cem\u003Efive\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not the time, Burdous.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s fine, I\u0027m done,\u0022 he turned to the technicians, \u0022Burbles, I\u0027m gonna hit up the little Kerb\u0027s room then grab us some coffee, page me when you\u0027ve got that buss out.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Right, chief,\u0022 the other fellow said, not looking up as he began unscrewing panels. Burdous disappeared into the elevator.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene turned to Valentina with a worn look, \u0022again, I\u0027m sorry about that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina looked thoughtfully toward the elevator, \u0022he is like D.N., yes? Big wash bag?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wash bag?\u0022 Gene blinked, \u0022oh you mean d-ouch, my shin!\u0022 A small rock bounced off the wall, fell through the floor grating, then pinged its way down through the rafters and uprights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;bonk\u0026gt; \u0022\u003Cem\u003EOw!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe looked up from rubbing his leg, \u0022anyway, Burdous, he\u0027s... selective. That sort of comes along with genius, I\u0027ve found. You have to find a way to relate to him on \u003Cem\u003Ehis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0level. You might be surprised how loyal he can be, once you do.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina again looked to the elevator, \u0022indeed...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well, we probably shouldn\u0027t pester the crew if they\u0027re working on the capsule. I\u0027ll show you the launch pad and fueling systems next, their crews should probably be clocking off shortly...\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene did make for an amusing tour guide, Valentina thought as they made their way down through the bowels of the building. She had finally realized why everything seemed so familiar here, it was because it \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E. The layout of the Space Center, even the general architecture, was nearly identical to the Cosmodrome. She had the thought that if she could cut down through the concrete pavement and measure the thickness, even that would be the same. But the similarities ended there. Everything about the Cosmodrome was ordered and mechanical, but this place... it seemed like chaos lurked just beneath the surface, like a dead log covering a nest of rotbeetles that would writhe and scatter if exposed. The Kerbonaut Center... the aircraft facilities... the Administration building... everywhere she had been today, she could \u003Cem\u003Efeel\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0it. People running around busily, but somehow oblivious to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EOblivious? Or just... \u003Cu\u003Eaccepting?\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe pushed the thought away, as they stepped out into the late afternoon sun. Gene... he looked very tired. Somehow, she suspected, he always looked like that. But... she had her own job to do, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...so the pipelines come in from the tankers off shore, they never even have to dock, and the propellium goes right into those big storage tanks there,\u0022 Gene pointed as they walked outside, \u0022all triple-walled, ridiculously strong. The fueling crews come from Exast, of course, no one knows the industry better. I\u0027ll introduce you if we get a chance.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous had said something about their rockets having trouble, but... how to broach the subject... diplomatically...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Um, tell me, Gene... Mr. Burdous, he say the rockets have trouble...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene looked at her quizzically.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope, that wasn\u0027t the way. How about...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe smiled and gestured toward the towering VAB, \u0022is very large building for so small...\u0022 and winced.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter thinking for a moment, Gene\u0027s shoulders fell just a hair, \u0022full disclosure, right? Well it\u0027s... complicated. The Rockomax Conglomerate has been our primary contractor ever since the pre-KSA days when J--\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe seemed to choke on his breath for an instant, \u0022...when... spaceflight first seemed possible. They\u0027ve built nearly all our launch vehicles.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022When... J--?\u0022 Valentina asked curiously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022We, um, we don\u0027t talk about that. It\u0027s also... complicated. Anyway, Rockomax has had some, er, delays, producing an uprated launcher. In the mean time, Layland\u0027s been courting us pretty heavily. That\u0027s why J.R.\u0027s here. They financed this whole facility in exchange for the KSA handling the flight operations and systems management of their spaceplane program.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did someone say spaceplane?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS\u003C/em\u003E, not \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Afternoon, Dean, fellas,\u0022 Gene said with a grin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe pilots had again managed to arrange themselves like they were in a publicity photo, \u0022you were just about to tell the Ooski here that five of the last six Rocko-klutz test launches failed, right? And the sixth failed \u003Cem\u003Espectacularly?\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene\u0027s jaw clenched before he spoke, \u0022that\u0027s a matter of public record, I\u0027m sure they know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022And yet the Widowmaker sets records \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u00A0time\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0she flies, or at least every time \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fly her,\u0022 D.N. said, flashing another winning smirk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022There\u0027s a reason it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecalled\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0the Widowmaker, Dean,\u0022 Gene said flatly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy did they tolerate such insubordination here? Whatever the situation was, this \u003Cem\u003EP\u0426TI\u0419S\u041AI\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s behavior was just not proper!

He drove them to a clump of low, stucco-covered domes at a far edge of the facility, parking in a lot already filled with an absurd collection of kars, each one seemingly trying to outdo the next with its own ridiculous collection of nonsensical tail fins and bubble canopies. Before they even reached the door, Valentina could hear raised voices and pulsing baseline thrumming from within.

An expansive main floor below the entrance seated perhaps two hundred Kerbals at an assortment of tables, the stage was set into an alcove flanked by large monitors to the left, and the bar its self ran along the opposite wall, its extravagantly carved shelves showcasing an incredible variety of... not liquor, secured behind thick glass. From the ceiling hung an equally incredible variety of aircraft: mostly models, a few realistic-looking parts here and there, and a very, \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0realistic looking space capsule over the center of the bar, complete with scorch marks on its heat shield and flanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBelow in the sea of bodies, Valentina could see clumps and groups of virtually every division of the space center. White-clad technicians, their scrubs in various states of removal, maintenance crews in their dungarees, the button-down shirts and loosened ties of the engineers and administrators, scientists, who insisted on wearing their lab coats even here, and of course the largest cadre, the cadets in their pale blue jumpsuits.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe sheer number of them had surprised Valentina shortly after her arrival, and all so \u003Cem\u003Eyoung\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0Before she left home, the first triad of the \u0022New Nine\u0022 Ussari Kerbonauts had arrived, not old by any means but all well-seasoned in their fields. These cadets looked barely out of secondary school, and if her few interactions thus far were any indication, selection standards were just a bit... generous. Gene had said the Administration wanted them young and malleable, the rest of their education and training funded by this Layland Heavy Industries again. Not all would go on to be Kerbonauts, of course, they would be engineers and scientists and mechanics. And janitors. A space program still needed janitors. There \u003Ci\u003Ewas\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0a certain kind of sense to it, Valentina noted, but it was all so strange!

Bit of an odd night seeing \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0in here,\u0022 the bartender said with an enormous smile.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bit of an odd day, Sam,\u0022 Gene replied, \u0022I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve yet--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022My stars...\u0022 The old fellow said softly as his eyes fell on Valentina, \u0022if\u0027n it ain\u0027t the lady \u0027erself.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Is pleasure to meet you, mister Sam, she began, offering a hand.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oi, now, none o\u0027 that, \u0027s never been anythin\u0027 but Ol\u0027 Sam... even when I weren\u0027t so ol\u0027,\u0022 he said with a wink.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen to Valentina\u0027s great surprise, he took her hand and lightly kissed the back of it, \u0022sure if\u0027n I ain\u0027t charmed as a school lad t\u0027 make yer acquaintance, mum.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe felt warm color rush to her cheeks, and blurted out the first thing that came to her mind, \u0022what... what is this place?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022The finest karaoke bar this side of... well also pretty much anywhere,\u0022 Gene answered.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s lips moved just slightly as she turned the unfamiliar word over in her mind, \u0022but... the Kerb, he did not carry key, he very off key. Sound like yak in heat.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOl\u0027 Sam slapped a hand to his mouth and tried to conceal a snicker, \u0022quite the wit, this one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene shot him a look, then explained, \u0022well, that\u0027s sort of the point. What better way for a bunch of engineers, scientists, and pilots like this to relax after a long day than to ridicule each other\u0027s complete tone deafness?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stared blankly at him, \u0022you are very strange people.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yar, that they are, mum, that they are,\u0022 Ol\u0027 Sam said with that same endearing wink, \u0022best ye not tarry too long, Gene, \u0027fore it gets stranger still.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Valentina paused yet again trying to decode Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s odd accent, a display on the wall behind him caught her eye. In a case of \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thick glass, surrounded by more space-like memorabilia, was a pyramid of photographs of people she recognized. Sir Kerman was at the top, followed by Jorrigh and D.N., with more open spots on the next rows. Big block letters at the top spelled out \u0027WALL OF FAME,\u0027 but... who was that fellow \u003Cem\u003Eabove\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Sir Kerman? In the picture was a Kerbal \u00A0with short-cropped hair that had begun to recede just a bit, bright, wondering eyes, and a beguiling smile holding a dated-looking pressure helmet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022This Kerb in photo,\u0022 she pointed, \u0022who is he?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOl\u0027 Sam\u0027s constant smile ran away from his face, \u0022now, we don\u0027t talk \u0027bout \u0027im, mum. Bad memories, that.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore she could respond, Gene broke in, \u0022er, so this old bar\u0027s been in your family for generations, \u003Cem\u003Eright\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Sam?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yar, that it \u0027as,\u0022 and just like that the smile was back, \u0022brought o\u0027er brick b\u0027 brick by me ol\u0027 da\u0027 from Suth\u0027Mork back when I was a lad.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina kept a polite smile, but wondered. These people were indeed very strange, but perhaps not all that different, it would seem. There were things even here that... this, we do not speak of. But there were no political officers to monitor such things, or at least none that she had seen. Why would--\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA sudden chorus of voices from down on the main floor drew her attention, \u0022Gene!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene waved back to the Kerbonauts, who were waiting at a table down near the front and securing an extra pair of chairs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So what\u0027s yer poison tonight, then, eh?\u0022 Ol\u0027 Sam asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene gave Valentina a considering look for a moment, then replied, \u0022make it a round of witch\u0027s toots, Sam.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Comin\u0027 roit up,\u0022 a serving tray appeared on the bar, followed by a hexagon of short glasses. Then a bottle, followed by another and another and another, each deftly twirled through the air and caught with a muted clink, depositing a dram of liquid in each glass without so much as a drop being spilled. A final bottle spun higher than all the others... only to be caught a centimeter above Ol\u0027 Sam\u0027s hand by Gene.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Uh-uh. The \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stuff,\u0022 he said with a smirk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nothin\u0027 gets by you, Gene,\u0022 Sam smirked back as he turned and retrieved an ornate bottle from another especially thick glass case. A final aerial flourish and splash of liquid, then he produced a bucket spilling thick, white fog from behind the bar. Tongs were tossed up into the air, caught behind his back, then plink, plink, plink, plink, plink, plink. Valentina stared in awe at the six glowing, bubbling, billowing green drinks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u0027Arf dozen witch\u0027s toots, with the \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0stuff,\u0022 the old publican winked.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Thanks, Sam,\u0022 Gene said, taking the tray, \u0022put it on my tab.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now would that be the tab yer still ain\u0027t paid since ye first walked in here three years hence?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No, the other one.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yer ain\u0027t paid that one, neither.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGene just smiled, motioning to Valentina as he beat a hasty retreat toward the table. Three hands and a scowl were raised in greeting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Gene, Valentina! Didn\u0027t expect you two on a Joolsday night.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hi guys!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022\u003Cem\u003EPrivyet Valentina!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Did you touch my capsule? You better not have touched my capsule.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Nice to see you too, Burdous,\u0022 Gene rolled his eyes, then sat and replied to Edmund, \u0022bit of a long day. Don\u0027t plan to stay for the festivities, thought our friend here could use a drink, too.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What... is it?\u0022 Valentina said absently as she lifted the glass, watching the green fog drift down over her fingers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027ve found it best not to ask,\u0022 said Jerdous cautiously, \u0022it\u0027s not alcohol, but beyond that... heck, I\u0027m the scientist and \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0can\u0027t even figure it out.\u0022 This brought a round of laughter from the others, except Burdous, who had gone from scowling to glowering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina shrugged, then took a sip from the bubbling glass. It was... well no, it was more like... actually sort of... no, not that either, perhaps... no, certainly not that... maybe... no...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kinda just blows your mind, doesn\u0027t it?\u0022 Jorrigh grinned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... I do not have words, in any laguage...\u0022 she trailed off. It certainly was \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0liquor, that much was sure, and certainly \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quite good, even of the fog made her want to sneeze, but beyond that...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Like \u003Cem\u003Ehe\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0said,\u0022 Edmund nodded to Jerdous, \u0022probably best not to think about it too much. It hasn\u0027t harmed anyone yet, whatever Ol\u0027 Sam puts in it. Well probably not, it \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0always real dark in here.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina sipped at her drink, still trying to comprehend the strange sensations. The fighter pilots must be here too, she noted, up on stage Tin Turkey was singing about an iron eagle and occasionally dodging flying bottles, it was very strange. Her eyes again drifted up to the singed, conical space capsule hanging above it. Was it perhaps from Sir Kerman\u0027s histroic flight? She asked the others about this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What, Chadvey\u0027s capsule?\u0022 Jerdous answered, \u0022oh no, the Royal Omork Museum and the Kerbsonian are still arguing over who gets to keep \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0one. It\u0027s getting pretty heated, actually.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You can say that again,\u0022 Edmund only said once, \u0022might even come to blows. Maybe they\u0027ll sell tickets! Ever seen a couple of stuffy old nerds duke it out?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey, I resemble that remark!\u0022 Jerdous shot back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I will \u003Cem\u003Estab\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0you with this!\u0022 Burdous brandished a spoon.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorrigh just looked confused.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund chuckled, \u0022now I would certainly never accuse either of you of being stuffy. Or old.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Yeah, you\u0027ve got that part locked up for all of us,\u0022 Jorrigh offered helpfully.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund opened his mouth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund closed his mouth.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina tried to conceal a giggle behind her glass. The setting was certainly strange, but at least the company was amusing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022At any rate,\u0022 Gene finally said, \u0022that capsule pre-dates the KSA. It even predates the Kleptogart space program. It was the first craft to return living things from space. Well, technically. That poor squirrel was never the same. Or the rat. Or the fish. And then they got loose and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRoaring cheers from the crowd cut him off. Valentina frowned, there certainly were a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0of distractions in here. Perhaps that was the point?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s right, ladies and germs. You know what time it is!\u0022 The deejay chided over the speakers. A thundering rhythm began, as at every table, the gathered Kerbals began banging their glasses down and stamping their feet in time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBoom-boom thud. Boom-boom thud. Boom-boom thud\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina\u0027s head whipped back and forth in confusion, then a chant joined in over the resounding cadence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETrial by fire!

As Valentina craned her neck, a terrified-looking young cadet in blue appeared on the stage, her eyes wide with fright, clinging to the microphone like a lifeline.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ladies and gentlekerbs, please welcome to the stage.... oh you\u0027re going to \u003Cem\u003Elove\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0this.... put your hands together for Lolli Kerman!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe roar from the crowd was deafening now. At every table, even Valentina\u0027s own, an assortment of coins and bills piled into the center.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe spun around to the others, \u0022what... what are they going to do to that poor girl??\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What \u003Cem\u003Ein-deed\u003C/em\u003E,\u0022 leered Burdous, wagging his eye... bulges in a most unsettling way, and earning himself a swift jab in the ribs from his brother.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdmund winked at her, then leaned back, cradling his slung arm, \u0022just watch...\u0022 A quick flick of his eyes... did he just share a glance with the bartender? Ol\u0027 Sam looked completely disinterested behind the bar, busily polishing a glass with the barest hint of a smile on his face.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina could only stare helplessly at the trembling cadet. A slow jazz piano riff oozed from the speakers, tempering the howls of the audience only a hair. The cadet squeezed her eyes shut, raised the microphone, and took a deep breath...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You had plenty money nineteen... twenty two... you let other Kerbelles make a... fool of you... why don\u0027t you do right... like some other Kerbs do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer voice faltered for only a moment, then settled into a deep, sweet, rich tone like dark molasses. The howls and cat calls evaporated just as quickly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now if you had prepared twenty... years ago... you wouldn\u0027t be a-wandering now from... door to door... why don\u0027t you do right... like some other Kerbs do?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery pair of eyes in the room stared, transfixed. Every jaw hung open. Except Ol\u0027 Sam, who was widely smiling to himself in the back, polishing his glass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Get out of here... and... get me some money too...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe cadet\u0027s eyes were still screwed tightly shut, the microphone quivering in her grip, but she sang out full and warm and smooth, filling the room beyond the tinny sound of the speakers.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why don\u0027t you do right...\u0022 for just a moment her voice dipped down into throatiness and gravel, then soared up, hinting at a well of sheer power just barely tapped as the piano rose to a crescendo, \u0022like some Ker-heeeeeeeeeerbs...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe let the rest stretch for a breath before sliding into a single perfect, beautiful, fragile note that rang on and on and on while the piano flourished a half dozen more bars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022...doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last vibrations of sound died away, the bar standing in utter silence, then the crowd exploded again into cheers and whistles louder than ever before, but, with a distinctly different tone.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Wow...\u0022 Said Gene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Humuna...\u0022 Said Jerdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorrigh was clapping his hands ecstatically over his head, then stuck his fingers in his mouth and tried to whistle, but succeeded only in slobbering all over Burdous, who didn\u0027t seem to notice. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLolli Kerman, eyes still shut and grinning from ear to ear, hopped down from the stage and made her way to a table of other cadets, passing through a veritable gauntlet of other Kerbals slapping her outstretched hands or patting her on the back. Patting her \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0on the back, Valentina noted significantly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What just happened...?\u0022 She said distantly.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Sort of a rite of passage around here,\u0022 Gene explained, \u0022they\u0027ll respect her now.
