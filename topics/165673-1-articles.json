I tried reading the online manual and it does not make much sense to me. Or maybe it\u0027s because my ship that I am trying to dock is just to big with not enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E systems onboard.

Now if you can right click the port you want to dock with do so and click set as target. on mecjeb open your auto docking depending on what you want done click auto docking if you want you can select override start distance and override safe distance. If you want I can make a vid for you. P.S. I doubt you ship is to big you should see the ones I built. I also have the mod docking port Alignment so you can keep track of what is going on\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-24T17:22:41Z\u0022 title=\u002209/24/2017 05:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 24, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by flekota\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
