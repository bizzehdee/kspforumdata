Yes this is still being developed and I\u0027ve been trying to findout what is causing your problem, but I can\u0027t think of a solution currently. The only thing that I can suggest is to wipe the git repos and also do a clean install. When you re-install Jebretary it doesn\u0027t reset the git repos that are created in the campaigns. Go into each campaign that you\u0027ve used Jebretary with and make sure you can see hidden files. There will be a .git folder and a .gitignore file, delete them both. You will loose any history but it doesn\u0027t sound like you\u0027d got far with Jebretary anyway. Once you\u0027ve done that then reinstall Jebretary and try again.

I\u0027m guessing so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time you look at a craft for a particular install of KSP after restarting Jebretary it will take longer to load.

If you have a lot of parts it can take a while, but by a while I\u0027m expecting it to be a few seconds, not minutes. In the terminal for oxidizer, does it pause for a while during the ....... and then carry on? It might be sticking on trying to read a particular part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce that map is built it persists until you restart Jebretary. I could have made it persist permanently, but then you\u0027d need to remember to tell Jebretary when you change your installed parts. If this is being a problem for you, there is something (kinda hacky) that you could try. Assuming you are not changing your parts, once Jebretary is running and you\u0027ve looked at a crafts\u0027 page, go into your KSP folder and in the root there should be a file called jebretary.partsDB. Take a copy of that. When you next start Jebretary, wait for it to start up but before you do anything with it, paste the copied file back into your KSP folder. Jebretary should then think it has already built and cached the parts map for that session.

There is also a change to how (or rather when) Jebretary reads in information about your installed parts. When you start Jebretary it will now scan all you installed parts, this does make starting Jebretary slower, but you won\u0027t get unexpected hangs when loading craft pages. It also makes it possible to check if you have updated or changed your installed parts. If Jebretary detects you\u0027ve changed your installed parts it will prompt a rescan of all the effected craft which ensures that all crafts part info reflects what is currently installed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t have to restart Jebretary to get it to check for changed parts, you can manually request that it re-scans the parts in a particular install by clicking the \u0022rescan parts and craft\u0022 link that is now at the bottom of the page for each install of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also disable the automatic scanning of part info at the start (if you know that you\u0027re not updating parts and want things to run faster at launch).

It is very slick; I\u0027ll let you know how use goes. I did notice one thing: the \u0022launch this installation\u0022 button at the top of the interface launches the x64 version.

Jebretary doesn\u0027t really work at all with Kerbal Construction Time, maybe because the launch button is not the default KSP launch button. I had two crafts that I built, hit the save button in the VAB and not only did they not show up in Jebretary, they weren\u0027t saved at all in my saves directory. I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s Jebretary\u0027s issue or an issue with KCT.
