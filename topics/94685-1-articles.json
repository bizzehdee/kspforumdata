I have landed on every planet except moho. I decided the other day that I was going to land on Moho, but every time I get an encounter with it, the burn time to get into an orbit is longer than the fuel I have available. (upwards of 40 minutes). I have tried to make mid course correction burns along the way to make a smoother encounter but in vain. I don\u0027t know if Moho is different in terms of sphere of influence than any other planet including Dres, or if its eliptical orbit is the thing throwing me off. I think it is not my rocket but rather my piloting that is keeping me from landing Jeb on moho. Any help on getting into Moho\u0027s orbit would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-28T00:02:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2014 12:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Laxin10\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"juanml82","CreatedById":105344,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T17:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some guides about landing in Moho around. Some people argue aerobreaking on Eve before going to Moho is a good idea (although how to plan such a thing is beyond me - there might not be an Eve-Moho window when you reach Eve). Other idea, IIRC, is to launch when Kerbin is in one of the AN/DN nodes with Moho, even if there is no window. Since Moho orbits rather fast, you would get an intercept eventually and it will be cheaper, in terms of delta-v, than a regular hoffman transfer from Kerbin. Or you try to intercept Moho when Moho is near its Ap, so its orbital velocity will be slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut typically, a circularization burn will consume some 3,500-4,000 dv and you\u0027ll have about half an hour to accomplish it. If your interplanetary transfer stage is centered around an orange tank, I\u0027d go with four nuclear engines. Otherwise you may end up with too little thrust to complete the burn in time. And when building your ship use KER or MJ to check how long it will take for your transfer stage to burn some 4,000 dv. If it\u0027s more than half an hour, you\u0027re in trouble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho is the hardest body to orbit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T19:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah 1 with that much fuel, 1 nuke is hard to sit through.

This will show you the AN/DN to Moho. The first time Kerbin crosses Moho\u0027s AN ( Year 1, Earth day 21, hour 17) you want to burn a maneuver Kerbin retrograde, combined with an inclination change until your solar periapsis overlaps Mohos\u0027 solar periapsis, and your Moho relative inclination is 0. When you get to periapse, make a maneuver to lower your solar AP until you get a Moho encounter at periapse on your next orbit. The more you slow down here the better, as it will decrease your orbital injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck post #8 in the first link, and post #17 and #18 in the second one:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61478-Oh-bugger-Injection-burn-at-Moho\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/61478-Oh-bugger-Injection-burn-at-Moho\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26656-Delta-V-to-reach-Moho-orbit/page2?highlight=moho\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26656-Delta-V-to-reach-Moho-orbit/page2?highlight=moho\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/531745346287807380/A537F8AA55EFB5603E878EB6F66635528833F212/\u0022 alt=\u0022A537F8AA55EFB5603E878EB6F66635528833F212\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship.
