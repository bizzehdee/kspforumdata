Pressing space just doesn\\\u0027t ignite any engines, they just literally do nothing\n\nCan anyone explain why this is?\n\nAlso I have another question, when you\\\u0027re in the vehicle assembly building, in the list of stages on the right hand side, what does it mean when a part has a little green asterisk \\* in the corner of it\\\u0027s icon?\n\nThanks\n\nI uploaded my ship so you can see if it happens when you use it.

It looks like the ship broke partway up, and those lower stages are no longer connected/controllable. This is fixable with struts, lower weight, or using multiple connections to spread the weight over a larger area.\n\nThe green asterisks mark parts that have been moved away from their default stage. (And so will shift around if you hit the Reset button below the staging bar)"},{"CreatedByName":"willsor","CreatedById":24474,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-06T23:20:31Z","Content":"Thanks, UmbralRaptor ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nDidn\\\u0027t know about that debug window at all, thanks for the heads up. \n\nI thought those asterisk\\\u0027s would be to do with not working properly, but stuff I\\\u0027ve moved around makes sense."}]}
