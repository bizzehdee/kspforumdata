So my day is made. My week... No my month. Is made. Lol. Welcome back Rbray and good timing to boot with 1.0 around the corner. \u003Cp\u003EI too often find hobbies can easily start to feel like jobs. Because you do get obsessed. And you soon get burnt out to the point where even the thought of your once loved hobby makes you sick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing for it is exactly what you did Rbray and that is to simply stop. And take a break only to hope one day that spark that made you fall in love with the hobby ignites again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can speak for the entire community when I say Im glad you found that spark again. Just make sure you take the time to actually PLAY the game. Do whatever it is you have to do to keep it fresh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Is it weird that I got as giddy as a school girl at a Bieber concert when I saw last post by rbray?

I never saw you around RB during my start, but your work was everywhere. I kept hear about EVE and whatnot. Finally looked it up and now i couldn\u0027t see my game without it. Kerbin feels naked and cold with no clouds/etc. Thank for the work you have done and I hope as all the others have that this round goes easier for you and you don\u0027t get overwhelmed.

I\u0027m back.\u003Cp\u003EI want to first apologize to anyone/everyone about disappearing like that. I don\u0027t handle pressure well, and after getting so much attention from my mods it started to overwhelm me. I had to take a break, and the only way I could stop thinking about it was to get away. This was supposed to be a relaxing hobby, but turned into something like an obsession. Hopefully I\u0027ll manage better this time around. Don\u0027t be too surprised if you don\u0027t see much of me aside from once or twice a week as I try to keep things balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI uploaded a new version on Github today... It is a new atmospheric model, and it should have (nearly) all the params needed to tune the atmosphere to perfection. Some things I have not implemented or tuned fully myself (few more params to come, along with scattering and sunsets), and I plan to make a few more improvements to the clouds, ocean and terrain. The new version of Unity is fantastic in that I can actually use the depth buffer (unity 5 acts like pro for everyone. They just changed the licensing terms) so it allows me to test and debug the shaders MUCH faster than I had ever been able to in the past. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you all for the support and your well-wishes.
