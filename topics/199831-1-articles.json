This old way is still the only way for part orientations and position during vehicle construction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome examples where it would be helpful to type the orientation (either global orientation or relative to the parent part):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Slightly inclining wings\u00A0is helpful,\u00A0but setting an angle is quite difficult. It\u0027s either too fine, so it becomes impossible to apply the same rotation to multiple parts, or the steps are too big.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-\u00A0It is quite important that landing gear is straight, but for some parts this is very difficult because the attachments happen\u00A0at an angle. Switching the orientation tool to global and setting the orientation to 0\u00A0\u00B0 would make this very easy.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- obsessive\u00A0desire for certain angles becomes easy to build.\u003Cbr\u003E\n-\u00A0Imagine creating\u00A0a 90\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#202124;font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0turn in 5 parts, at the moment that is very difficult. But if you can type the orientation you can just calculate the angle (18\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#202124;font-size:16px;text-align:left;\u0022\u003E\u00B0\u003C/span\u003E), type it in and it\u0027s done. Rotation creates gaps which need to be removed by moving the part. If you figure out how to reposition a part, just look at the local position of the part compared to the parent part, and apply the same position to the other parts! No fiddling for every part needed anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Parts attached to big wing parts will not attach straight. When making skylon-like planes this makes it very difficult to attach\u00A0 the engines to the wings. Many people instead attach the engines to the fuselage\u00A0and\u00A0 move them outward to the wingtips. I want to attach them to the wings so they can break and overstress more realistically!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExample of what I thought of:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RjGi3Oy.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RjGi3Oy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTyping fairing sizes (section\u00A0diameter,\u00A0 section length)\u00A0would also be cool?
