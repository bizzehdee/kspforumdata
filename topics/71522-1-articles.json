Not for descending, but for braking!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou simply extend the landing gear, enable the brakes and try to achieve an altitude slightly above the ground at you landing-spot. Your airspeed should be below 40 m/s.

Linkage between parts will break (fixed with struts). Other cases like a lot of aircraft with anhedral/lower mount wings. The wings can smack off the ground in a hard landing because the gear compressed.
