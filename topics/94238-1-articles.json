Say I wanted to maybe dial down or ramp up on Outsourced R\u0026amp;D or Open Source Tech Program, whatever, I have no choice but to cancel it and start it again at the desired level. This makes no sense to me. Just charge or refund me the difference between the two commitment levels (or a slight bit more/less and handwave it away as administration fees or whatever) if increasing/decreasing commitment and start the strategy at the new level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would make strategies a lot more appealing to me as right now, I don\u0027t understand how I need to be charged the full amount if I\u0027m only increasing the commitment level from 60% to 70%. Surely the change is just 10% more commitment, not -60% and then \u002B70%?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anquietas314","CreatedById":8761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T16:56:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, that\u0027d be awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Especially for the high setup cost ones (high amounts of science/reputation, assuming the outsourced R\u0026amp;D one is rebalanced appropriately)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-23T17:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I feel like it wouldn\u0027t be called \u0022commitment level\u0022 if you didn\u0027t have to, you know, commit.
