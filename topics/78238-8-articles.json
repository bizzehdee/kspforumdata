When the mod refunds money for fuel tanks (doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s an LFO tank or an SRB) it refunds the full purchase price of the tank, INCLUDING the cost of the fuel, regardless of how much fuel you used. This returns way more money than it should, especially for SRB\u0027s since about 90% of the expense of SRB\u0027s comes from the solid fuel, not the tank itself.\u003Cp\u003ESo, for example, if I purchase an RT-10 Solid Fuel Booster for 325, 260 of that cost is coming from the fuel itself. So when I stage this part and completely use up all of its fuel and it lands safely; I should only be refunded 65 for the cost of the tank itself, since that is all that has been recovered. Instead, the current implementation of this mod will refund me 325, as if the tank were still full of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think the percentages that are refunded based on landing speed (88% for green, and 50% for yellow) are way too high and forgiving for the player, but that\u0027s just a matter of opinion. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eget the latest version\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smurfalot","CreatedById":72587,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-21T18:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022whaaw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022whaaw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhen you see the stage touching down, then you will not get any refunds^^ only if the game removes them ~2.5km in atmo.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, so if they land too close to your pod you do not get credit?
