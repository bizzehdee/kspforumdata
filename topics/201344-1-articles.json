It\u0027s not the most intuitive but say you\u0027re wanting to hold a\u00A0heading of 90 deg, you need to put that into the heading box and then make sure the checkbox for heading is checked. There is then an autopilot master on/off button as well at the top.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-31T14:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you actually turn it on?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E has many different modes, are you talking about the aircraft autopilot? You need to set the flight parameters like speed, altitude, heading and then engage the autopilot; just turning it on will usually default altitude to 0 (which isn\u2019t a very good idea!), and setting the parameters without engaging the autopilot won\u2019t do anything and the plane will just keep flying uncontrolled (if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is off, though \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E doesn\u2019t do too well with planes anyway) and you\u0027ll probably end up crashing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
