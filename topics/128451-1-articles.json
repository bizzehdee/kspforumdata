\u00A0An information mod like KER, MJ or VOID\u00A0is great but otherwise you\u0027re mostly making the majority of tutorials and other peoples\u0027 experience and vehicles invalid for your install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever; rockets flipping during ascent is common to all (1.0.1\u002B/FAR) aerodynamics and there are many threads about it. \u00A0The basic causes are\u00A0that there is too much drag above the CoM of the rocket or the CoM is just too low. \u00A0Darts have their mass forward and drag (fins) at the back - it works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIn order to fly through atmosphere properly you need to start your gravity turn early and keep the nose within (roughly) 5-degrees of prograde so the rocket is going more or less straight through the air. \u00A0At slow speed you can sustain a higher angle of attack, simply because there\u0027s not much speed-induced drag to affect the ship anyway. \u00A0Similarly, above the thick atmosphere, at least 30km up, there isn\u0027t the density of air to induce much drag. \u00A05 degrees is a good ascent guide though.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDon\u0027t go too fast, as that increases the amount of drag. \u00A0A launch TWR of 1.2 - 1.4 is sufficient, max TWR \u0026lt;2 until you\u0027re above the thick air. (This latter very much just a guideline)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMake sure the Com starts high and, if possible, stays that way. \u00A0As fuel is usually consumed from top tanks first the CoM moves down - too far and the vehicle wants to fly backwards and will flip.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMost importantly, if you are staging-off parts they generally go from the back, where their drag was helping to stabilise the ship. \u00A0Upper stages also tend to have comparatively heavy engines for their structure/shape/size, so lower CoM. \u00A0Both are what rocket engineers call \u0027a bad thing\u0027.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTL;DR - make sure each stage is aerodynamically stable; CoM forward, drag back - and don\u0027t accelerate or turn too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheJay15","CreatedById":155633,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-22T21:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the advice it\u0027s good to know I\u0027m not the only one who has the flipping problem.
