Minmus seemed a good choice; easy to get to and not too big. And so I started designing Minmus rovers, and taking them into the mountains west of KSC for testing. But as the rovers got better I realised that I prefer Kerbin. I like the green hills. I like imagining where the towns might be; roads and tracks and farms and factories; busy Kerbals getting on with their lives. So this is my extended test-drive around Kerbin, seeing the sights and visiting a few Kerbals on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/dK5gg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It took many attempts to find some level ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere were some problems. The table and chairs are prone to exploding because they have a floor of structural panels which has clipped into the ground. I manually edited the save file to move the building back above ground so I could take the picture and drive away. The tower was awkward because HyperEdit does not change orientation, so when the building jumped around the world it arrived upside down. I eventually added some disposable reaction wheels to turn it the right way up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to use [thread=105247]Kerbal Konstructs[/thread] to place static buildings that are prettier and don\u0027t explode, but I know nothing about this kind of modelling and my artistic skills are limited. Maybe one day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T22:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I use HyperEdit extensively to put ships in space and various orbits for testing purposes, and play with their fuel states, and can even totally screw up the solar system, I have no idea how to place a building.
