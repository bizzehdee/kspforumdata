On the one hand, there are projects to use hydrogen from electrolysis as fuel, and that would allow for accurate modeling of the Sabatier reaction. (It just has to produce LiquidMethane. There are plans to use that as fuel too.) On the other hand, you then need to use the Oxygen from the electrolysis as fuel too, so it should be LiquidOxygen, but that interferes with the nice kerbal*day numbers. Moreover, for most applications, you want to keep the O2 and H2 life support circuits separate from the propulsion system. You wouldn\u0027t want the fuel cells to start drawing from your transmunar injection fuel...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the way forward is to keep O2 and H2 as separate resources, as they are used in fuel cells, kerbals etc., and to have a life support to propulsion interface that converts Oxygen to LiquidOxygen and Hydrogen to LiquidH2 (I think they are supposed to be gases in the TACLS system, so this could just model the liquefaction). Methane can be LiquidMethane without any harm. (Unless you want to model methane pyrolysis. Actually this is a very realistic alternative to the Bosch reaction for closed-circuit life support.
