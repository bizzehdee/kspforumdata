It was the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u2019s first attempt at interplanetary travel and what we lacked in knowledge we more than made up in courage and tenacity\u2026 or so we thought, coz as much as tenacity has been what has kept Henwig going all this time, courage proved to have \u00A0mediocre fuel efficiency when it was all burnt trying to escape Duna\u2019s attraction for a ticket home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHenwig was stuck on Duna\u2026 and with 2k science points unlocked, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E had now bigger fish to fry in the short term. She gathered her last strength to crawl by the monument and waited, knowing that her comrades would remember her\u2026 surely\u2026 yeah\u2026 right\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward 24 years and a couple of Jool missions later, we at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E have secured funding for Henwig. Not to save her, not yet, mission board is already full enough as it is, but to send her a car to have fun, and maybe send us some science if she\u2026 errr\u2026 has time for it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf sending a car in space sounds like a bloody stupid idea, its because it is one\u2026 But we are sending one on Duna so its all ok. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a lot of R\u0026amp;D \u00A0and some mild industrial spying on internet, we came up with our very own design, that we affectionately called the \u201Chit and miss\u201D, due to the precision of it landing systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings started off shaky on launch day. The bad kind of shaky. Our orbital lines disappeared as soon as our vessel left Kerbin\u2019s influence. Our astrophysicists had to improvise themselves hackers and modify ship files to get them back. (thanks for the reddit post with the workaround, you guys are the best).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith that sorted we sailed straight to Duna, and while we still lacked some engineering skills, we were now a black belt in f5 usage and took the time necessary for the \u201Chit and miss\u201D to do the prior. Oh those glorious last minutes, splitting the fairing to free our machine and\u2026 Wait! What?what are you doing here Geodof Kerman! I swear the team removed you from this rocket a few minutes ago. this is Henwig\u2019s car for crying out loud! What? No this isn\u2019t romantic this is madness! She hasn\u2019t seen you in 24 years and you were barely friends. Damn it Geodof, there isn\u2019t even 2 seats on the damn thing\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the initial shock of Geodof parasiting the mission and the landing trepidations fading away, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is now happy to report that Henwig received her car, and went on a trip to the north pole, with Geodof finding his spot on the ladder. Its neither too hot in the inlands, nor too cold in the pole\u2019s desert, its close enough to the science junior to make it practical but far enough from the radiation station to make it safe and\u2026 and more importantly it means he\u2019ll never have to face Henwig\u2019s look when asking if he can have a go at the driver\u2019s seat ever again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor science!!!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 alt=\u0022image.png?ex=65cbcba7\u0026amp;is=65b956a7\u0026amp;hm=756306522fd3452c9d968092fea042b385778f5721efb73ab6280d0eefbbc8d8\u0026amp;\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778349467698987035/1201981662066655233/image.png?ex=65cbcba7\u0026amp;is=65b956a7\u0026amp;hm=756306522fd3452c9d968092fea042b385778f5721efb73ab6280d0eefbbc8d8\u0026amp;\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-31T20:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2024 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 31\u0022\u003EJanuary 31\u003C/time\u003E by gnorffou\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-31T22:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n24 years?
