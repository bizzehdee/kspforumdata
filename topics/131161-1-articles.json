But I think you should have to explore and get data on the planet first. Then you have a reason to send probes and scan stuff. Maybe even a satelite for real time stuff or something.

Maybe you need to collect all the data to use it in sims. It could even be an unlock. And until you scan the entire planet and collect all data on biomes and gravity you don\u0027t have the full sim. (At which case maybe a partial sim would do since you may only need so much for a specific mission.) It could be like getting data on the moon before the human moon mission.

MAybe if sats scan high you can get low res images and data but high res or more detailed info requires longer lower scans or something. There is so much they could do with that concept to add stuff to the game.
