You should need very little to land if you use parachutes.\n\nI would probably shoot for about 1500-1800 depending on the safety margin you want. Orbital maneuvers for rendezvous usually don\u0027t need very much.\n\nAs far as advice goes - \n\nBuild your lander only as large as it needs to be for the purpose. Don\u0027t forget the chutes. You don\u0027t need a very big engine in Duna\u0027s low gravity.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T22:54:40Z","Content":"Duna has an atmosphere so you can use parachutes to land, but you will need more of them than on Kerbin as its much thinner, so play safe and allow extra deltaV to slow you down for landing if you need to. If you estimate 1500 dV to get to orbit that will give you a bit of a margin, but allow more on top for the rendezvous. RCS will come in handy for the rendezvous too. Depending on what exactly you want to do I would suggest go for 2000 dV minimum as a starting point and, if you can, add more if practical. \n\nYour rendezvous could eat up a lot if you\u0027re not careful with it so it may be worth giving the \u0027mother ship\u0027 extra fuel and RCS so that it can manouvre to save the lander needing to carry enough do it all. \n\nTip from experience - repack your chutes after landing, that way you can abort your take off and increase the chances saving the crew.\n\nHope this helps."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-21T23:51:23Z","Content":"[Chapter 8](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79658-Exploring-The-System-A-design-tutorial-campaign-0-90-Complete?p=1226790\u0026viewfull=1#post1226790), section 4 of the \u0027Exploring\u0027 tutorial in my signature has the Duna lander I recommend (link to PDF and ships downloads for the whole tutorial in that thread\u0027s OP)."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T02:08:52Z","Content":"While you can use chutes for duna, don\u0027t rely on them. ( unless you have the realchute mod). I would pack at least 2km/s but that\u0027s mainly because I like to overkill everything.

Gives enough fuel to fix botched up ascents, or to rendezvous with something in a higher orbit. You can get away with 1500 (i think thats the bare minimum) with a perfect ascent, but i wouldnt go below 1600dV, unless you use MJ or something to guarantee a 100% perfect ascent. As for landing, you need maybee 10dV if you bring enough parachutes, or wings to fly in liek a plane (still takes alot of lift as duna = thin atmo).\n\nAs for RCS, i wouldnt bother with any more then the ship\u0027s crew pod has. Youd be surprised how much that 10 units or so of RCS fuel can do (especially with a light craft). I have a craft thats 20t approx, and ive managed to dock it 3 times before i ran out of RCS and had to play with the engine/luck. Ofc i always forget to give my capital ships RCS fuel (as they use vernors), and that always screws me over when trying to dock with a smaller craft, and then ofc having no rcs fuel for that craft."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T03:48:19Z","Content":"I\u0027m not adding much new here, but...\n\nFirst, you need to budget some \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV for your deorbit burn, say 50 m/s.\n\nAs long as you\u0027re using plenty of parachutes and landing at a low elevation, you shouldn\u0027t need much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV for landing. I generally budget about 50 m/s just in case I have to do a little breaking just before touchdown. If you plan to land at a high elevation, then you\u0027ll likely need more. How much more, however, I can\u0027t tell you because I don\u0027t have much experience with that.\n\nI budget about 1350 m/s for launching into a low orbit of around 50 km. I haven\u0027t spent much effort trying to optimize my ascent. I\u0027ve found the following works good enough: burn vertically until my velocity is 200 m/s, pitch over to 45^o^ and burn until my velocity is 400 m/s, pitch over horizontally and continue burning until my velocity is 800 m/s, cut the engine and coast up to apoapsis, and, at apoapsis, burn to circularize the orbit.\n\nAs others have said, if you must rendezvous and dock with another vehicle in orbit, you\u0027ll have to add \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV for that. I think 100 m/s \u002B RCS should be enough in most cases (assuming you\u0027re good at rendezvous). Of course that assumes you\u0027re already in the correct plane. Chances are you\u0027re going to be somewhat out of plane and will have to make a correction. A budget of 100 m/s will allow a 6^o^ plane change (hopefully you\u0027re not off by more than that). \n\n Adding another 100 m/s margin isn\u0027t a bad idea, which get\u0027s us up to a total of 1750 m/s for everything. Others have suggested as high as 2000 m/s. That number should be more than enough, but, for your first attempt, better to have too much margin than to come up short. You can always get more miserly with your \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV budget after you\u0027ve gained some experience.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T07:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 07:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T05:12:09Z","Content":"I have used the same lander I went to the Mun with to land on Duna.
