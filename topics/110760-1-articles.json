So the first section usually have many boosters, fuel tanks and many struts, while second one is varying depending on the mission purpose. There also some struts connecting both sections.\n\nOften, when I take first section from one craft, and want to add second from other (or design new one) struts are gone. Not only those that connect both sections (which is obvious) but even those that hold boosters at the first section. How to avoid this happening ?"},{"CreatedByName":"JTpopcorn","CreatedById":130311,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T23:30:25Z","Content":"Please put up screenshots so I understand what is happening."},{"CreatedByName":"Khazar","CreatedById":138578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T06:55:15Z","Content":"I will put some screenshots after I get back home. I think that this issue could be caused by struts coming through other parts (nose cones mostly). \n\n![m3sIrQc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m3sIrQc.jpg)\n\nAfter I arrange fuel tanks, i put some struts to keep them together. Sometimes I also put nose cones on top of them. I think that this is the cause. When I load vehicle arranged that way, struts get blocked by nosecones. I\u0027ll have to check it."},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:35:36Z","Content":"I have found that using symmetry on struts in pre-assemblies sometimes causes them to fail. My original placed strut will be fine, but the others are pointed into space or somewhere I can\u0027t see. I had an issue on a rover undercarriage that was strutted up. When I went to attach the rover pre-assembly, all the struts on one side were arranged seemingly random. I solved my issue by placing struts individually as close as I could.\n\nEDIT: Also, I have observed that sometimes things do get in the way of struts after placement, in that you place the strut and it looks fine, and then when you move the part group, a rocket nozzle or something will be in the way and become the new connection for the strut.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T13:39:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 01:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"}]}
