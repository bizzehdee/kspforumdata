Since i can only do a 25 sec full burn and the general idea is to end up at 0 speed within falling distance when the engine gives out, it is preferable to start out at a height where a full burn with nose straight up will do just that. However that is almost impossible with SRB\\\u0027s. My craft was going too slow so i had to time the initial burn, then flip the craft over and burn at a certain angle just enough to not loose too much vertical speed so i at the end could burn 90 degrees for the remaining time and end up with 0 speed just above the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnwyays, even after hours of trying, it did not go exactly as planned. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-09T23:20:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed my new craft \u0027Infinitum I\u0027 on the mun at 02:02:51.
