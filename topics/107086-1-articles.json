The service bay, both 1.25 and 2.5 will suddenly start to vibrate and the parts inside will try to phase out of the bay. It will either vibrate the whole ship, or just the part itself will vibrate and break the ship apart. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter what parts I have inside the bay (Mystery Goo, Mono Prop, Tac food supplies, batteries, etc.) or where and how I place the items (girder with parts attached, or parts attached to ceiling and floor of the bay).\n\nRight now I have a small base orbiting mun that as soon as I go to it, the service bay starts to vibrate and then breaks the ship in half. I have had it happen without mods in 1.0 and now that I have modded a little it is still happening. I only have simple mods, KER, TAC life support and fuel balancer, Navyfish Docking, Alarm clock. No parts packs, the only extra parts were from TAC. So I am pretty sure it is not the mods, plus like I said, it first happened in an un-modded version when 1.0 first got released. Not sure if this is a bug or something else going on here (perhaps parts are clipping and causing an issue). \n\nOne thing I noticed was on a little Mun lander I built that had a service bay, it started to vibrate and I was able to open the doors and it would calm down and same with if the doors were open and it started to act up, I could close the doors and it would kinda reset itself. Not sure what is going on here and I searched all over but did not see anyone else talking about this issue. I am about to try a totally fresh install and see if that changes anything. \n\nThanks for any help! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CodedThreat","CreatedById":142832,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T06:00:16Z","Content":"So, I have noticed that after a clean install and playing totally vanilla, I can still make this happen if I am clipping into the top or bottom of the service bay or have parts clipping inside the bay (for instance, putting lights in top and pushing them up into the top to keep it nice and clean, or putting a girder or science jr. into the bay and loading it up with stuff and going clip happy with batteries and other parts to get them to fit in there). The ship will be fine for a while and then for whatever reason it will just not like it anymore and cause the whole ship to start going nuts. So far if I do not do any clipping then it seems to be fine. I am going to continue messing around with it and see what happens but I thought since the clipping for most things was basically removed since the implementation of the adjustment tools that this would not cause any problems?"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T06:27:40Z","Content":"codedthreat, you are not the only one seeing this kind of behavior.

F5 and then doing F9 does nothing cause as soon as physics loads, the ship starts going nuts again. Sometimes you can catch it and get a time warp in, but in the end it doesn\u0027t matter cause as soon as you come out of it, the ship will start to go nuts again.\n\nIf I have some time later I will try to record a clip of what some of my ships do and post a link here.

He said he cannot even use the bay by itself, nothing in it. So maybe the bay is just not attaching properly. And clipping should not be an issue since clipping was pretty much allowed in .90 when they put in the tools to rotate, move, change root and all that fun stuff. So... yes I understand it is just a collider, but when you can\u0027t even put the thing on your ship empty, then there is a issue. I am still doing some testing and messing around, but I have put the 1.25 on a simple ship with nothing in it and when I zoomed in after getting suborbital, the bay was shifting a bit, not much, it didn\u0027t go completely nuts, but still moving around for no reason. \n\nI am still going to mess around with it some more, but it certainly needs to be looked at and hopefully fixed by the devs cause I love the part and seriously it should not have any issues with some minor clipping into the floor or ceiling of it, I mean they had to have known people would try to put lights in the thing and clip them into the ceiling of the thing to make things sleek and nice looking....

The only issue I have with needing to use KJR is that the service bay is part of the stock game, and a part I really loved seeing when steam updated me to 1.0. I should not need to use a mod to not have my ship vibrate my whole screen or have it tear apart cause of a bad part. Although some form of KJR should be in the stock game (the way physics is loaded right now has caused issues before) I don\u0027t like using it too much cause it creates lazy ship building, since stuff that would normally just fall apart on the pad is suddenly able to launch without any issues. And on top of that, if I am going to use KJR to keep things together, then why not just go into the debug menu and enable unbreakable parts? It feels cheaty and I would rather the parts just gets fixed. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:01:47Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Clipping inside a bay = crazy fun vibration time!\n\nIts possible to achieve this result with clipping other parts too.

I was piloting the Tanker with MechJeb onto the lander.\n\nTook a break from game playing and saved the game. Later in the day came back to the saved game. Several reloads have confirmed that the Lander falls apart. One test I got the ships undocked and after undocked the lander fell apart.\n\nBy falling apart is the visible struts disappear, the fuel tanks come off the main column, most of the main column comes apart. \u003ESome\u003C parts stay attached to each other.

The service bay was acting fine with KJR installed, so I decided to see how it would act if I tried to really fill the bay and let the parts clip a bit. Now I only clipped the bottom and top, not the sides, the parts inside were clipping each other, but outside the bay they caused no issues. I created a MunHotel and filled the bay with a bunch of parts. I had a bunch of TAC LS containers in there and a bunch of the Inline controllers. For added extra, I also put a strut outside the doors to see how they reacted to clipping. \n\nSo the first part of the flight, totally fine, made it to orbit, shot out to the Mun, no problems. I had popped the doors a few times to see how everything inside was doing, the door kinda clipped a little when it hit the strut but was fine once it got past it. So I do a orbit or 2 around the Mun, everything seems good. I pop back to KSC, build another ship, decide that I want to bring the MunHotel back to Kerbin orbit cause I want to refuel it and send it out to Minmus instead. I load up the ship, it seems fine, I set a node to get me back to Kerbin, seems fine, I hit F5 and time warp, I come out of time warp and it goes nuts. I hold F9 and as soon as the ship loads up, the bay goes nuts shortly after KJR finishes its load. F9 a few more times, like clockwork the ship loads, KJR does its thing and the ship starts to go nuts. \n\nSo I recorded it. The quality might not be the best (I was on my laptop) but you will something gets flung out of the ship and explodes far away in the background a bit after the bay starts going nuts, and you can see me trying to click away and the close door. The bay does finally settle down once I hit the button a bunch, but without KJR, this would have destroyed the ship.

I launched with a probe core, I rescued five new recruits (four from Kerbin, one around Mun), gambled that one of the five would be a scientist (she was), set up a near polar orbit around Mun and collected what science I could from orbit... All went well...\n\nThen I headed off to Minmus. In transit, I returned to the space center and checked for new contracts... Where upon returning to my ship, and loading the physics model of said ship, BOTH of the service bays on my ship glitched out, and were \u0022shifted and off angle\u0022. The physics between the clipping parts seemed to cause phantom forces that caused the ship to spin uncontrollably (though it stayed in one piece, I have KJR installed). I learned that physics warp seemed to bump off enough precision at max speed that the glitching became semi controllable (axial spin was still uncontrollable, but I could still orient the ship using MechJeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. (I mainly use Mechjeb for the information windows, orientation, and for the Maneuver Node Editor. I also use Nanogauges... cause seriously, they rock). I was still able to get my orbital and sub orbital requirements at Minmus for my tourists, abandoned any further Minmus science collection, and burned for home. I ran my engine for as long as it held out to decelerate in the atmosphere as much as was possible. I got down to about 1100 m/s by the time I hit the 30,000 m region, and despite minimal visual flame effects, my engine heat, combined with the friction eventually did blow it up. I ditched my engine and tank stage, and finished the decent on chutes.\n\nAll my parachutes survived, even the off kilter ones in the small service bay up top, and nothing detached. I don\u0027t know if I even touched the ablator! Touched down in water, with all five rescued crew saved, the four tourists happy, if only a bit dizzy from the 10 day spin cycle, and about 1500 science! Woot!\n\nAnyway, from what I can assess, the consensus is that the service bays simply can not handle any degree of part clipping, period. You\u0027re fine if you never leave the ship in a manner that causes the physics model to unload (returning to KSC, of going on EVA or switching to another ship and traveling far enough away, sometimes time warp). Problem seems to happen on physics load for me. If it reloads the physics model, it has a chance of loading it wrong.
