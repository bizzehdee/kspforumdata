Find out which method took the shortest time by either refining all three at once, or, refine one fuel type at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started a brand new game as I was just learning about how this mod works since Scott Manleys video is a bit old, but I got the gist. I\u0027m pondering on doing a tutorial on the process of getting this stuff done. (I have a decent screen capture setup that isn\u0027t FRAPs, and it encodes video very well and very compact, but I\u0027m having issues finding a decent video editor that doesn\u0027t blow the video up to massive sizes. My wife has a copy of Adobe Premier from school that I\u0027ve been using, but its output looks like crap and I\u0027ve not figured out why it takes a 30gig input video and blows it up to 10x the size for lower video quality. If anyone can, to keep this thread on topic, can you fire me a PM with suggestions on a decent video editor and maybe a basic rundown on how it works?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first built my scanning probe. Simple rocket, single large scanner, up she went and in orbit, and in 20 minutes at 50x speed, I had a pretty decent map of what laid around on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, I built my all-in-one refinery. Large refinery, quad drills, 16000L tank, quad engined beast in a wide Skycrane configuration but is a permanent fixture, with quad small RCS tanks, and the Lazor System and I think about 24 yellow lazors to transfer stuff efficiently, and a tonne of RTGs. I then CHEATED my way to the Mun with it as I couldn\u0027t be bothered to build the rocket underneath (I\u0027ll test that out later), and got it landed. Found out that this thing sucks back electricity like nobodies business, so redesigned the electrical system by adding I think 48 stock RTGs. STILL not enough, but it was close, and it gave me an opportunity to build another ship, which I\u0027ll explain later. In the third version of this rocket, I also threw on a small Kethane scanner so I could keep an eye on how much fuel is left at the site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the refinery landed, I built a fuel tank that would take the refined gases up to orbit. Its just a large orange tank, two large RCS tanks stapled and duct taped to the ends, quad motor setup again (I kind of like the Skycrane setup), NO Lazor system this time, but might be added later. Since I didn\u0027t have anything to dock to, I skipped on the docking ports. I\u0027ll work that out later as well. As I said, I just wanted to learn about how this all works.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI landed the gas tank near the refinery, and got to work. Learned how the process works, found out about the inefficiency factor when refining the three fuels at once, etc. The first go, I found out about how this thing drinks Electricity, so back to the space center to build a \u0022UPS\u0022 system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe UPS has 13 round batteries, 8 stock large solar panels, 4 oriented to point horizontally, 4 vertical, again with the skycrane setup, LAZOR system with a ring of yellow lazors around the neck of each fuel tank on the skycrane, no RTGs. Landed it, now the refinery has enough electricity while its day time to do this experiment. The UPS does start to deplete, but never hit zero during this process. I\u0027m pondering on loading this thing up with RTGs instead of the solar panels so I can have a constant power source at any time. I\u0027m on the fence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETODAY, with my remembering the mention somewhere in this thread about how the inefficiencies of the refinery work, I decided to put a stopwatch against it. The results are rather interesting, and possibly might end up getting the refinery nerfed. heh\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the first go was refine all fuels individually. I filled up the 16000L tank with Kethane, and dumped all the other existing fuel. Pulled out my Android, loaded the stop watch, turned on each refining process one at a time. I found that the total time it took was about 12 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond go was to refine all fuels at the same time. So again, dumped the fuel to be refined to, filled the Kethane tank, made sure the electricity was flowing. Started all three processes at the same time, brought the efficiency down to about 43 or 47% or whatever. Time elapsed was about 8.5 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, ladies and gents, the lesson here is that even though the time it takes to refine individual fuels is much faster, and uses less electricity, if you need to fill up the three types of gas, its best time wise to overheat the refinery and fill the three main fuel types all at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I get my Pizza, I\u0027m going to retry this test and see if it all lines up. It should, in theory, but who knows. :]\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
