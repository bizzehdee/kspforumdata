Timed correctly, we could probably even get a small gravity assist from Mars too. And if that doesn\u0027t throw at or further than Jupiter\u0027s orbit, it will be rather near. It\u0027S likely that Jupiter could even do the job by herself, being that massive it has the tendency of being disturbing to the orbit of objects around it.

It will take at least that much energy no matter what the technology is. I didn\u0027t say it would take any particular period of time, I just used days of the Sun\u0027s output as a way I could compare numbers for amounts of energy I can\u0027t possibly grasp otherwise. If you want to spread the matter of the Earth apart far enough that it doesn\u0027t pull itself back together again, whether in one blast or a slow push, it takes 2.2405*10\u003Csup\u003E32\u003C/sup\u003E kg*m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E/s.

The Sun puts out 3.86*10\u003Csup\u003E26\u003C/sup\u003E kg*m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E/s every second, also big and scary and meaningless to me. But divide one into the other and you find the minimum energy for destroying Earth is equivalent to 540,440 seconds, or 6.7 days, of the Sun\u0027s total output. Do it in an instant or spread it over eternity, this is the absolute minimum it takes to overcome gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, to move Earth as far as Venus to set up that first slingshot takes a certain minimum amount of energy. Do it however you want: push the Earth, push asteroids that pull the Earth, push Mars and play interplanetary 8-ball, doesn\u0027t matter. No matter how you deliver the energy, it\u0027s still going to take nearly three times as much energy as blowing Earth apart just to get as far as Venus, with yet more energy needed to finish the job. We can make it LESS efficient if we want to, we can waste as much energy as we want, but we can\u0027t make it any more efficient than this perfect-world minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as method goes, I\u0027m still partial to the massdriver idea. It\u0027s on the edge of current technology, I admit, but I\u0027m with you on this point: long but efficient FTW. Centuries? Longer? Wait a second, maybe it WOULD use even less energy, since as you slowly reduce the mass of the remaining Earth, each shot needs less energy to overcome its gravity... nope, that\u0027s balanced out by the early shots having the entire planet dragging them back, it\u0027ll work out to the same as just scattering the whole planet in a single blast.

It doesn\u0027t have to be a monster, a 50km asteroid would probably do the job well enough. Moving one to bring it on close periodical encounters, would not take that much energy. Just about the kind of energy you need to send off a large satellite near it to act as a gravitational tug. If it\u0027s in a favourable orbit already, a few well placed nukes could probably do the job too. Then, all you need is time (probably around a few thousand years) while gravity does it\u0027s job and slowly shifts the Earth\u0027s orbit inwards. Viva la galactic 8 ball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for The Venus assist you have to consider the fact that it won\u0027t be immovable indeed. The total momentum has to be conserved, so going away with 100% of Venus\u0027s orbital speed would mean Earth just ate it all away, and Venus is now stationary (actually it\u0027s even going backwards since the Earth is more massive) So 60% sounds like a reasonable number to me. And yeah, probably we\u0027d need to get close, probably a few chunks would fall off, but hey, our final destination is probably going to melt what\u0027s left of the planet then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass driver idea isn\u0027t bad, but after a certain period of time doing it and spreading the matter around, you\u0027ll come to a point where you can\u0027t do it anymore. The idea on paper works, but if you consider how everything would evolve on Earth as you do this, you\u0027ll end up with less gravity as you do so, and exposing the mantle, and all this wacky stuff. You have to keep the machine working, and through time, this won\u0027t be possible anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Inspector Gadget","CreatedById":62884,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T13:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell... why anybody would want to destroy entire planet in the first place ?
