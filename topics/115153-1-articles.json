I still use KER and stuff. Anyway, I just completed a contract where I had to extract 2550 units of ore from Bop and ship it into orbit of Jool. Instead of doing it all at once, I did 4 trips from the surface to the mothership using a small lander that ran on monopropellant and carries a large ore tank. It was refueled by the mothership thanks to the ore it brought up and the mothership\u0027s IRSU converter. The lander had enough delta v to land, hop to a new location (empty of ore), and take off while full of ore and rendezvous with the mothership in a 25 km orbit of Bop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know it might sound lame to call that my greatest accomplishment, but it is the first time I\u0027ve ever done a mining operation like that in such a remote location as Jool. I\u0027ve sort of stayed away from Kethane and Karbonite so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0T5IdYx.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u00220T5IdYx.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also learned a valuable tip from all this for getting into equatorial orbit (0 inclination) of any body. Get yourself in a high circular orbit and watch KER\u0027s readout for latitude. When it hits 0 degrees, burn normal/anti-normal to get into a really nice equatorial orbit. It works pretty well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T00:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a far from trivial task and worth being proud of \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T01:27:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERep to you sir.
