As far as how many, that\u0027s another matter altogether. It\u0027s going to be a matter of how massive your payload is. Nukes only put out 60 kN thrust at full power, so unless you\u0027re going with something light, you\u0027re probably going to want more than one. I\u0027ve had success with a combination of ten X200-32 tanks and five nukes; the TWR is lousy, but efficiency counts more than thrust once you\u0027re in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo define success, look at my salad bar. I don\u0027t reset it with every update...too much work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a design with 25 nukes (LV-N efficiency, Mainsail-equivalent thrust); I haven\u0027t really tested it yet. The idea is to send that one to Moho, which is a world folks say is extraordinarily difficult to intercept (on account of the burn time for capture). It currently has the same fuel loadout as the five nuke design - and about 5,000 m/s less delta-V. So mass definitely counts. Five\u0027s a good balance - that ten -32/five nuke design? 12,000 m/s delta-V without a payload...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Platofan2","CreatedById":79294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T17:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile Launching Use The Bigger Engines \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd In Space Use The Nuclear One Because It Is More Efficinet\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T17:55:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor interplanetary stuff, the high ISP of the LV-N makes it the popular favorite.

So really in a vacuum, the mass doesn\u0027t matter as much. With a smaller motor it will take longer, but still eventually get up to speed.

As to how many... depends really on how big a fan of long burn times you are. I find that 1 engine for every 22 tons (25 tons when you count the engine/mount) works well.
