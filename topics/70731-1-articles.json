It could bring it to a high altitude on Kerbin until it runs out of atmosphere to go higher! You would be able to set the amount of Helium or some other lighter than air gas so you could control the altitude, but you could also release air from the balloon(slowly hopefully) to lower yourself back down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see pods being pulled up to the edge of space, and maneuvering around to get to the other side of Kerbin, but with minimal energy used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a cool idea I thought of, but couldn\u0027t find any other relevant threads when I searched. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhaddya think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T15:12:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most interesting use, I think, would be for probe retrieval on Eve and similar planets. Make an ultralight probe with a parachute on one side and a collapsed balloon on the other, drop it on Eve with the parachute, then inflate the balloon and send a shuttle over to retrieve it from the upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anister","CreatedById":66553,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-27T18:50:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh, so kinda like Hooliganlab\u0027s Airship mod?
