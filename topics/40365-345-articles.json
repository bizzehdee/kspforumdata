Since it appears you are using UF4 mode, and you have no actinides built up yet, when you get ready to refuel, just dock a ship with a UF4 tank and reprocess the fuels. The deleted fuels will go into the tank, and can top off whatever amount of UF4 is needed with the tank.

Its really simple, attach solar panels to your probe. You have to have some solar panels unlocked because they are in the tech that activated the seismic experiment. If your really worried about not having enough power, attach a .625m reactor to it, and you\u0027ll have more than enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what\u0027s \u0022Silly\u0022 is using just batteries for your probe.
