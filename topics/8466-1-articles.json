I stumbled upon KSP a few days ago and long story short, I\\\u0027m hooked. I downloaded the free version of 13.3, read a few tutorials and such, and after a few successful mun-and-backs, I just had to get my hands on the full game. However, reading around the KSP site I\\\u0027m a little confused... Will there be a new \u0027download full game\u0027 link that pops up after I\\\u0027ve purchased the game, or will I be sent a physical copy of the game so far, after which I download updates? Any help for an aspiring rocketeer would be very much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Figs\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-22T01:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter purchase confirmation, you\\\u0027ll be able to log into your store account and find a link to download the game in your profile. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter installing it, you will then be able to update from 0.14 to 0.14.1 using the game patcher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no physical copies as the game is still in early development stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECapt\\\u0027n Skunky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
