Basically we\u0027re talking about the difference between a highly advanced computer attached to avionics and an engine, vs. a highly advanced computer, attached to avionics and an engine, with life support trying to keep this squishy thing aboard. No matter the crash risk (remember these are highly trained military operators) it\u0027s simply not a useful economic trade off to put the squishy thing on board.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese things as hypersonic weapons platforms have been predicted by military experts for years.
