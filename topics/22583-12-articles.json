The reason why prop driven planes (in KSP and real life) need exposed intakes is because they need such a large amount of air, unlike a car engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso suckin air into an engine like a normal car only works upto a certain speed. Even some cars, like top-fuel dragsters for instance, have to used forced air induction systems or they would not be able to operate at max speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts not even a matter of cars and planes, every internal combustion engine needs to be fed air to operate, most of them use some form of air intake to meet this need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-17T19:55:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2013 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by KhaosCorp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-17T19:54:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022wasmic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022wasmic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust a question: why do fueled propellers require intakeAir? It doesn\u0027t make any sense, and it requires that we stick intakes on our propeller aircraft. As for the motor driving the propeller requiring air, well, it does.
