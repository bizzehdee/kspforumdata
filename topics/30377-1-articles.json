I never expected to get this addicted to the game. I keep thinking about new designs to try out and have learned more than I ever though possible about orbital mechanics, trajectories, fuel weight considerations, ASAS/RCS, staging, rocket designs, docking maneuvers, etc. Part of the fun is the physics realism; that something like my design might actually work or not work, as I try them out. As of last night I now have something in orbit around every planet and moon in the system and have landed probes on two planets and four moons! I even managed to get a probe on an escape trajectory out of the solar system. I can\u0027t wait for more updates. My dream now is to build a \u0022Project Daedalus\u0022/\u0022Project Longshot\u0022 class ship and travel to the next solar system!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T14:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! congrats on your achievements! I\u0027ve sent a probe out of the solar system back in v.18.2, but havn\u0027t done it since haha. Course mine wasn\u0027t a true probe, it was manned, and the poor kerbal spent 22 years in that little capsule before I ended the flight haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T20:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is definitely one of those games that creeps up on you and makes you spend way more time than you realize on just trying to accomplish that \u003Cem\u003Eone tiny little goal\u003C/em\u003E before bedtime... and then your alarm goes off the next morning, and you\u0027re still in front of the computer screen, still trying to accomplish that same \u003Cem\u003Eone tiny little goal\u003C/em\u003E (which seems to have somehow morphed into a fully-equipped space station / Munbase / satellite network while you weren\u0027t looking).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, we\u0027ve only got one solar system to play with at the moment, although I think I recall the devs saying that more will be added in the future (though whether as part of an update or an expansion is anyone\u0027s guess at this point).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sydryk","CreatedById":68625,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T07:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eone of those games that creeps up on you and makes you spend way more time than you realize on just trying to accomplish that \u003Cem\u003Eone tiny little goal\u003C/em\u003E before bedtime... and then your alarm goes off the next morning\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly!
