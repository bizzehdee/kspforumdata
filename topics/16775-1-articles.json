For example, if you burn at 50% power, you only use the equivalent of burning at 25%, and at 10%, you only use what you\u0027d normally use at 1%. So your stages last a lot longer if you can use minimal thrust. This means that any ship that you build now that seems to do what you want will possibly not work in 0.17. You can mostly avoid it by only burning at full thrust, and I believe there\u0027s a workaround plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MET?","CreatedById":31950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T16:13:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI see...I assume this applies to all the engines?

I only first tried out v0.16 late last week so I missed the initial discussions about the fuel bug. When I orbited my first rocket in v0.16, I ended up with more fuel than expected left over.

Maybe they weren\u0027t so conservative after all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut something else I did notice during my own test firings was that the new Isp system seems to result in a variation in fuel flow vs. static pressure rather than thrust vs. static pressure (either could vary with static pressure to yield the Isp values quoted in the VAB). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntuitively, it makes more sense to me that thrust should vary with static air pressure due to back pressure on the engine\u0027s nozzle, while fuel flow would be constant for any given throttle setting.
