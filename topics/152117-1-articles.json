a few more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be able to communicate, you need 1 or more links between your ship and Kerbin (Kerbin now has antennae all over it so you don\u0027t need to talk just to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E unless you disable the other ground antennae). \u00A0Being able to do this depends mostly on 3\u00A0things: \u00A0the range (all antennae have a max range which increases as you upgrade the Tracking Station), the type of antenna(e) involved (direct and/or relay). and whether some celestial body is in the way (but you can work around that for the most part). \u00A0As to range, the more excess range the antennae have compared to how far you\u0027re talking, the better the connection (more bars) so the less time (and thus, EC) it takes to transmit data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to antenna type, there are 2 general types: \u00A0direct and relay. \u00A0Direct antennae include all the original stock antennae, the new stock dipole, and all the ground-based antennae on Kerbin (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and all the new ones). \u00A0Direct antenna on ships can talk to Kerbin\u00A0and relay antennae on other ships, but NOT to direct antennae on other ships. \u00A0Relay antennae are all new and can talk to anything: \u00A0direct antennae on other ships, relay antennae on other ships, and Kerbin. \u00A0Thus, the only way to have ship-to-ship communications is if at least one of the ships has a relay antenna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ground-based antennae on Kerbin are the most powerful you have at any level of Tracking Station upgrade. \u00A0At Level 3, they can talk to ships at Jool, provided the ship has a big direct antenna like the 88-88. \u00A0But they\u0027re direct antennae, so the signal can be blocked by celestial bodies. \u00A0Thus, the main reason you need relays is to provide bank shots around intervening bodies. \u00A0You can turn blocking off in the options and thus will never need relays, but what\u0027s the fun in that? \u00A0So assuming you haven\u0027t done that, you need to consider the sources of blocking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nThe planet your at. \u00A0This happens all the time due to the planet\u0027s rotation (if you\u0027re on the ground) or your orbit around
