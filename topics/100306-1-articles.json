I had problems with that mod also in the past, and when i had it removed, problems were fixed, at least for me they did... So id say move that one out of your folder and test it again, see if that fixes it."},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T12:45:17Z","Content":"It is for sure a KJR problem I do had it. \n\nI found a solution on the KJR thread I think.\n\nJust get the latest mod. \n\nThe Problem was with the docking ports configurations.\n\nA workaround if you just timewarp while the ships separated outside 2km-s So the other was unloaded. \n\nBut still the issue was corrected just get the latest KJR."}]}
