To walk you need to combine two motions: raising the leg, and moving forward (natural flexibility of the parts/joints allows you to turn using sas torque). To raise the leg you use the lower leg and middle leg servos, to move forward you use the hip and foot servos. I grouped the servos so that when you raise one leg, the other leg scoots forward. also, very important, action group 0 is set to center the two middle servos (raise leg) and action group 9 is set to center the two outer servos (move forward), activate both when you launch this thing. To walk you just alternate pressing 2 and 4 with the right timing (I Think I posted the script I used for my mk3 walker earlier in the thread), the legs re-center automatically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI only tried walking the dinobot with the values shown in the pic, and it kinda worked, but it walked backwards, very slowly. To get it working right, you need to play around with the servo limits, the COM, the contact points on the foot, the angle of the foot relative to the rest of the craft, the speed of the servos, the timing in the script, reduce the overall weight of the craft, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-26T00:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2014 12:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Parallax\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VR_Dev","CreatedById":92196,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-26T06:12:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I already started in blender.
