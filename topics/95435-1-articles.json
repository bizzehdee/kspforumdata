Not only will this help with properly doing the missions as they were, but it will also help with the general aesthetic of the rockets and spacecraft I create. To balance this out (So its not just sandbox), I\u0027ll start the game with zero funds and will only be able to get funds through Contracts and strategies. I\u0027ll also be playing with reverts and respawns off along with Kerbal Construction, to make things even more balanced with having the full tech tree unlocked from the beginning. So throughout my playthrough of the timeline, I\u0027ll also be completing random contracts to generate money when needed. Mainly I\u0027ll be going for satellite contracts (as the entire point of this playthrough is to have a save that actually has a history and is full of things. Most of my saves are fairly deserted compared to the likes of Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar save), but I\u0027ll likely also do unmanned missions to the Mun and Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso through this playthrough, I\u0027m going to just presume the presence of the other nations rather than actually have their assets in the game as well. This is mostly a technical limitation as the mods I have to use to cover the American side of things (on top of the general graphics mods I refuse to play without) only just leaves me enough wiggle room to add bits and pieces here and there. A lot of the soviet/russian mods are just as demanding as FASA (where the bulk of my parts come from) and the Chinese and European rockets wouldn\u0027t be as great as the American or Russian equivalents.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I said earlier, I\u0027m already in the preparation stage for the playthrough as I\u0027ve begun to design several of the American rockets in ETS as well as much of the spacecraft. FASA has provided most of this capability, as all it took to create the Saturn 1C (a 1B replacement that uses an F1-A engine in the first stage rather than 8 H-1\u0027s) and have it look good (and fly well) was some tweakscale additions to the 5m tanks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yi3kXHG.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yi3kXHG.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich has the same general capabilties of the Saturn 1C from the timeline. (It is slightly more powerful, as it I usually have to ditch the tanks with fuel still left in them, even with KIDS enabled to compensate for FAR. I have a feeling this has more to do with me using 2 clipped F1\u0027s rather than an F1-A analog, but considering I like the look of the two clipped F1\u0027s better, I\u0027m okay with it being a little off performance wise)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, if there is some interest (or rather, a lot of it) then what I might choose to do is follow the timeline more directly and accurately (I only plan on doing Apollo 11 close to where Apollo 11 actually landed, mostly because I\u0027ve never seen the monument myself), doing each mission from Explorer 1 onwards. I\u0027ll have my Mercury 7 astronauts, the New Nine, etc (with the titular three replacing Neil, Buzz, and Micheal) and will copy orbits, landing sites, etc where possible. Otherwise, I\u0027ll keep it easy on myself and just copy the general point of each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T23:03:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat is an AARP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T23:05:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter Action Report, ie, Mission Reports.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Yellow Dart","CreatedById":107172,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T03:14:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAmerican Association of Retired Persons\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MajorThomas","CreatedById":94499,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T03:15:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, thought it was the American Association of Retired Persons...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.aarp.org/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.aarp.org/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
