This is my first post here, so forgive me if anything is wrong. I am, however, an experienced ksp player, so don\u0027t refrain from the technical details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the issue: I have several mods in my game centered around spaceplanes and aircraft in my KSP (it\u0027s a separate file from my main rocketry game). Among them are procedural wings, b9, retrofuture, FAR, coffee industries plane parts, Firespitter, KJR, SXT, Tweakscale, BDArmory, BDynamics, and ActiveTextureManagement. I\u0027m running on a x32 install, and my computer is more than adequate to run. The problem lies with wings. They don\u0027t appear to actually be making any lift at all, sans a few (namely the coffeeindustries ones.) FAR seems to be working fine, it\u0027s on the toolbar, has a gui, simulations, pitch/roll/yaw control surface tweakables, etc. In the SPH, the lift is simply displayed as a blue ball with no arrow indicating lift direction. In-game, there appears to be no lift generated, and my test plane only flew up after I pitched up hard, probably from the wing physics in general, not lift. I have no idea whatsoever what is causing the problems, as every single one of these mods is updated or proven to work in .25, there has been no lag or crashing, and memory usage is not excessively high. I have not looked at any logs or such yet, but I can upload them upon request. I googled it with no results, so I don\u0027t know if this is just a unique issue or just hasn\u0027t been documented yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I do not know the mod(s) that are causing the problems, and everything except that seems to work fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Arch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:49:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to follow the instructions in the \u0022How to get support\u0022 sticky thread in this sub-forum, particularly the bits about a list of mods with their versions and supplying an output_log.txt/player.log file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, as Padishar says, we need your log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, the arrow from the ball was removed, since it was meaningless.
