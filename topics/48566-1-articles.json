So when I asked him to build a rocket.. He spent like 40 minutes reading the tags over and over, and at the end he said... This is just too much information for me. I don\u0027t want to play this game anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically he was overwhelmed by the number of parts and possibilities, and at 0.14 there was not even as much parts as now... So on future updates he would just say, well it may be getting better, but it just looks more complicated to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, he does not enjoy sandbox games as much, he is more the type of player that wants to unlock everything on games and complete them at 100% , but when it comes to sandbox, he just don\u0027t feel a motivation to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with the first steps of Career mode, this 2 problems are solved for him (or at least I think so) he will start with a reduced amount of parts, and unlock what ever he wants next, Also he might want to go do a lot of science just to unlock everything... And when he does. He will probably not be overwhelmed anymore since he had the chance to read and understand just a couple of parts at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.. Next week I will visit him and see how it goes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI usually like sandbox much more, but I\u0027m looking forward to career mode now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing for almost a year and a half now and having a direction with goals seems appealing now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icemasterpt","CreatedById":61626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:14:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...Be released today\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...devour small children.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snillum101","CreatedById":34419,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...solve the US debt crisis \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...be awesome!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-16T08:41:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I guess the focus on this update was really about an easier accessibility.
