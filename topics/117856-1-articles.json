However, we all know how real aircrafts have lift from their wings. Do we have that with the new aerodynamic system? Or in FAR? Or if my wings are still large flat surfaces, if I use them to make a 3D wing like the Stearwing A300 has, will that have aerodynamic lift?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T07:19:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 07:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTurbomuffin**"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T13:14:28Z","Content":"Wings act like wings in stock and FAR aerodynamics.

A plane moving horizontally, with the bottom area of the wing parallel to the ground - essentially 0 AoA - will still lift in the air.\n\nIn KSP you can install a wing upside-down and it will behave the same way as installed normally - so yes, it works like \u0022paper airplane\u0022/\u0022flat surface\u0022. The lift comes from the angle of attack, air compressed by lower surface and \u0022thinned\u0022 by upper, so only wings at an angle to the ground will generate a force. A plane with horizontal wings and no control surfaces won\u0027t lift off unless tilted backwards.\n\nProbably an important factor is that this way you can use wings as fins, launch airplanes vertically on rockets and use radial symmetry when attaching them (resulting in one of them being \u0022upside down\u0022). If the wings were profiled, working like IRL, the airplanes would be slighly easier to build and pilot, but a slew of other applications of wings would become unavailable."},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:20:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps that is what you are indeed saying, but lift IRL is mostly generated from a lower pressure on the upper side of the wing where the air travels faster, which causes the higher pressure on the lower side of the wing to not compensate any longer, causing lift.\n\nThat\u0027s what they teach in school, but IRL aeronautical engineers get the real shebang. The relative contributions of lift from air-pressure differential and airflow redirect depends on circumstance but airflow redirect plays a larger role in many, many more scenarios like at cruising height for most commercial airlines where air pressure is a fifth of sea level. \n\nThis is a nice link [http://www.aviation-history.com/theory/lift.htm](http://www.aviation-history.com/theory/lift.htm)"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:40:29Z","Content":"Oh joy, arguments over how planes fly.\n\nSaying that a plane can fly with \u0022Zero Angle of Attack\u0022 is one part misleading and one part vacuous, because it depends entirely on how you *define* 0 degrees angle of attack. The bottom surface of the wing is not very helpful though I feel. More common is the chord line - the line joining the leading and trailing edges. In the above diagram you can see that the chord line is not horizontal. Sometimes 0 degrees angle of attack is instead *defined* as the angle the wing generates zero lift at! For a symmetric airfoil those two definitions are the same (as should be obvious), for an asymmetric one they may not be.\n\nAdditionally the airflow aft of the wing depicted in the above diagram is incorrect. Aft of a real wing far from the ground the airflow is deflected downwards. It\u0027s an effect not always seen in wind tunnels due to differences between that environment and real flight but it\u0027s crucial to the real physics.\n\nIn any case a wide range of airfoil shapes are used, from the \u0022classic\u0022 shape seen above, to symmetric airfoils, to designs that are concave on the lower surface.\n\n![529px-Examples_of_Airfoils.svg.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Examples_of_Airfoils.svg/529px-Examples_of_Airfoils.svg.png)\n\nI believe FAR assumes a shape like the \u0022supersonic interceptor\u0022, but you could check with Ferram. Such a shape stands out as it\u0027s symmetric both top-bottom and front-back, freeing the player of concerns about orientation especially with wing parts that *look* like they have exactly that symmetry. Similar symmetry considerations would apply in newstock and even if the actual wing performance differs you will still get zero lift at zero angle of attack with respect to the chord line."},{"CreatedByName":"QuesoExplosivo","CreatedById":102949,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T15:54:47Z","Content":"@Sharpy:\n\nThe air doesn\u0027t move faster because it has a longer path.
