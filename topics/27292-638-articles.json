Through an oversight, it was unmanned. The beancounters probably didn\u0027t want to pay the big bucks to hire another kerbonaut, and they didn\u0027t need anyone on board to collect on the contract anyways. After it left Kerbin SOI, they realized nobody flicked the switch to deploy the Gigantors. Reluctantly, a scientist was hired (the only one they could afford), to ride the \u0022Jumpstart\u0022 ship. A stranded pilot was also spotted in LMO, at a mountain-scraping 10km. Today, the Jumpstart ship was launched. It swung by the moon to pick up Carselle and then managed to rendezvous and Klaw up with Eve station and deploy the Gigantors before the crucial course correction burn to make Eve intercept. The Jumpstart may continue on with the station and make a Gilly landing, I dunno yet. Too bad it didn\u0027t pack any drills; there\u0027s an ISRU unit on the lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, The Jumpstart ship had a little problem in the Mun\u0027s SOI; it too ran out of power. Again, nobody deployed the solar panels. One engineer on the ground suggested \u0022Switch SCA to Aux,\u0022 which reconnected the Command Pod\u0027s internal battery and allowed deployment of the Solar Panels.
