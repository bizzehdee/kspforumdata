I\u0027ve been playing for several months now and have finally signed up to the forums. After numerous trips here to help me get started, it\u0027s become obvious that I should no longer be a Guest and be an active member of this great cadre of space wayfarers! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I do need one question answered: Can careers be transferred from one computer to another? I\u0027ve been playing KSP on my laptop for a while now because I was having major issues with my desktop. After months of playing on the lowest graphics settings and with lots of lag (honestly, I\u0027m surprised my laptop could run it at all), it will be nice actually have great and SMOOTH graphics. Kinda would make landings a little less hairy! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Just today I finally got (most) of my desktop back up to snuff and it would be great to have my current career because I only have a couple more research groups left. Plus, I\u0027ve made some very wonderful personal accomplishments that I\u0027d hate to just throw into the figurative dust bin by letting them stay neglected on my ol\u0027 trusty laptop. Any help will be gratefully received! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks all and happy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-10T02:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need to transfer files from three places: the save file (whatever you\u0027ve named it) from the saves folder, and your ship designs from the VAB and SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K.S.P.

I don\u0027t know if it is different for the KSP downloaded directly for the site, but for the Steam version the save file included all the VAB and SPH folders/files. Again, thanks and wow... it\u0027s great to see textures again like when I first played it on another family member\u0027s computer.
