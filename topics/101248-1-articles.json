An atom bomb consist of nuclear active material which has a certain mass. The explosion occurs if you go beyond a certain critical mass. A bomb consists of multiple masses which are spatially split. If you want to make it detonate you fire up little bombs which smash all the masses together. The matter does not annihilate like when using antimatter. Only a small fraction of the mass is converted to energy. This energy heats up the \u0022reaction mass\u0022 which reaches the hottest state of matter. A plasma! You may know that heat is nothing but movement of the particles. This insane plasma heat creates an enourmous pressure on the plasma which expands in all directions. You can shape the nuclear bomb (shape charge) in a way so the plasma does not expand in all direction but mostly two.
