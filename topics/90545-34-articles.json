The problem is that the VAB editor favors bottom nodes (they\u0027re more \u0022sticky\u0022), so the adapter became unusable with certain lengths of engines. I couldn\u0027t find a good length for the fairing that allowed easy use of all of the stock engines, and all of the SpaceY engines at the same time. The engines would stick preferentially to the bottom node instead of at the top, if they had the right length. With KSP 1.0\u002B, node orientation is being enforced, but the \u0022snap-to\u0022 still attempts to connect to nodes that are facing the wrong way.
