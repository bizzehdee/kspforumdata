People should first learn how flying works before you know, blasting out of the atmosphere and onto other planets/moons. While it is certainly fun to fly into orbit with tier two rocket parts, its just not realistic (Please don\u0027t misunderstand and think my whole point is realism. I\u0027m just expressing myself here).\u00A0Especially when most of KSP\u0027s population struggles to make efficient airplanes capable of traveling even halfway across Kerbin.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRespectfully disagree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe realism debate aside, \u00A0your last sentence means that your second sentence would make for a terrible gameplay experience, at least with the current approach to building rockets and especially with the lacklustre\u00A0aircraft parts you get to start with and the strip of ploughed field you get that somehow masquerades as a runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027d be far happier if aircraft / spaceplanes were removed altogether. I find them a pain to fly (OK that one is entirely my problem), they throw any sort of reasonable gameplay\u00A0progression straight out the window\u00A0and I dislike the way that they\u0027re effectively the go-to stock solution for getting more than three\u00A0kerbals at a time to and from orbit.

That would be a sure-fire way of making sure that no copy of KSP ever sneaks onto my hard drive again. Nope - I\u0027m with Veetch and others on this thread. Rejig the tech tree so that players can start with aircraft, uncrewed rockets, or crewed rockets as the mood takes them. Personally I don\u0027t have any problem at all with starting crewed - it\u0027s not realistic in the sense that it doesn\u0027t parallel our own spaceflight development but I see no reason why kerballed spaceflight should reflect human spaceflight anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut again, that\u0027s just me. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hevak","CreatedById":122200,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T18:38:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy thoughts and opinions. \u00A0The tech tree is not \u0022awful\u0022 but sure I suppose some things could be changed a bit.

I\u0027m always thinking about how I want to progress through it, and have to make difficult decisions.

So decisions are there and decisions must be made.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo X m sized engines when you unlock X m sized tanks. Really I get the frustration with this but seriously? So developing a fuel tank means you know how to make a bigger rocket engine suddenly? No sorry, it\u0027s not like that. They are two completely independent paths and should be. Also larger fuel tanks don\u0027t have to be used for larger engines. Yeah your craft might look weird, but still it\u0027s not required to have a larger engine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpaceplanes should come before rockets because that\u0027s how real progression is?No sorry not going to fly at all. I suck at spaceplanes and would have dropped this game quickly if forced to make them first. No, the\u00A0rockets should be first, it makes more sense for the game. But I think that spaceplane tech and rocket tech should be completely separated as much as possible in the tech tree to give more people choices on this. And honestly they are already pretty separate,\u00A0But I\u0027m sure this could be modded to be even more so.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManned or unmanned first. As many mentioned there are mods that do this,and honestly that is the best way to approach this and many other aspects of ksp. It\u0027s the best because ill let you in on a little secret many here forget. You don\u0027t play like I do, and I don\u0027t play like everyone else. So a handful of people in a thread unhappy with the stock tech tree does not equate to its\u00A0awful and squad should change it to suit you. I see close numbers of I don\u0027t like the tree and I have no problem in with the tree. \u00A0So why should it be changed just for you? \u00A0And guess what, just don\u0027t send kerbals in your first craft, use the stayputnik and other probe cores. There you go you have a much tougher career start, but it can be done in stock.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes for most of you in this thread I know for a fact you are using PC, so yes you can mod it. And yes that is a valid answer. As Hodari said this is not something everyone wants, or even a good portion of the player base probably. \u00A0And not many will agree on how it should be changed, so yes it\u0027s better handled by mods, this game was meant to be modded to flesh it out. \u00A0Sorry if you don\u0027t like that, but it\u0027s the way it is and the way it will be. Maybe 10 mins of looking into a game before buying it will tell you this is the way ksp is setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor console users, sorry modding is not an option, that is really the fault of the choice you made though. This game doesn\u0027t lend itself to consoles well, because it\u0027s made to be modded. So there are two options, try to get squad or more importantly flying tiger to tailor the game better for console. Or try to make them allow mods on console, I mean Bethesda allows mods on console, so it can be done, if people want to make mods for console that is. This is a PC game ported to consoles, unfortunately this means it won\u0027t be the same and may have limitations, it\u0027s what happens. Just like when console games are ported to PC and not made to utilize the better aspects of the PC I\u0027m stuck with an inferior product for my platform.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTelling people that their thinking is \u0022everything that is wrong with the game\u0022 is not going to help your argument either. And if you want to, I\u0027ll throw that statement right back at you, everything you proposed is wrong and\u00A0you\u0027re the one trying to ruin the game. But how does that help anything in a discussion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe game is kerbal space program. Not kerbal flight sim. And it\u0027s not meant to be realistic. Yes you are asking for it to be realistic no matter how much you claim you aren\u0027t. Because damn near every post is saying how it needs to be more realistic in X sense. I see very little proposed here that would really be of any benefit. In fact I see tons of contradiction, you say the stock tree is too limiting, yet your suggestion is to limit what players can do even more, forcing them to play how you want to play. In my stock tech tree, beyond the initial couple of nodes, you can go straight for the majority of spaceplane parts of you want before unlocking the bigger rockets, if that floats your boat. I mean I skip all the space plane part nodes, so you can just focus on them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis current system does allow for the best solution to all, the proposals in the pro change it crowd simply aim to force everyone to play the way they want them to. I\u0027m sorry I just can\u0027t agree with that. And I don\u0027t want the tech tree shown in the op, sorry I just don\u0027t like it and don\u0027t think it improves the game in anyway.

That tree you linked is much more linear, at least in the stock tree there are different ways to unlocking different nodes. Especially the farther you advance. Your tree is just straight lines, straight linear progression. And I see less choices being made there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm willing to agree that spaceplanes, or more importantly atomospheric aircraft should be separated better, or more. I get that people like aircraft better than rockets. I think the current tech tree, except for the first intitial nodes, does a decent job of this already. But I could see more separation being to done to it. And also since almost every post mentions realism or IRL, what was first rockets or orbiter aircraft like space planes and shuttles? That\u0027s why I said atmospheric aircraft, because spaceplanes should not be first if you keep mentioning realism. Like I said i see lots of contradiction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlets forget consoles for a bit, and honestly consoles have their own problems, and any choices made for consoles should be handled on their own. Really consoles should have their own builds, it\u0027s the only way they will get a good console version. Anything done to benefit consoles will most likely only be negative to the PC version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso let\u0027s forget consoles, if I liked the stock tree, but wanted to flesh it out more and installed ctt to expand the stock tree into even more nodes and make even more choices for me and the way I want to play the game, then why can\u0027t those of you in this thread I know are PC players not do the same? You linked to a tree you like, so why not use the mod? Why does the game have to be changed to your way? Why not learn to mod and make your own tree exactly how you want?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfew people are going to ever agree on how the tech tree should be. As you can see in this thread there is a pretty close ratio of who even wants it changed at all and those who want the tree unchanged. So the best approach is to keep the current tree and let those who can mod it the way they want.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsolse should really have their own builds as I said,because they have their own problems. They should be dealt with independently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most I could agree with is this. Make it a difficulty option to start with airplanes that can\u0027t go to orbit. I\u0027d even say hey let them do spaceplanes straight from the start. I could go for a difficulty option to start unmanned. But that is it. Forcing payers into either of those scenarios as has been suggested here\u00A0is not good when you claim to want more choices.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not like the tech tree you suggested with that mod link. I don\u0027t want it at all and much prefer the current tech tree layout to the one you suggest. Could some parts in the current tree be adjusted? Sure possibly, but I think currently as weird as they are grouped, it provides a decent progression. You unlock parts you will need to take that next step like better probe cores, better science stuff, better engines/tanks, better landing components to make better landers. \u00A0I have to work my way thoughtfully through nodes to achieve what I want. Trees like your idea lend themselves to neglecting whole areas and focusing on one, where is the decisions in that? I just see people focusing on one or two nodes in your tree, like jet engines and flight control. Or rocket parts. Maybe one or two points in electronics for batteries, but then they will inevitably be neglected until the other nodes are finished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see less choices, and less control over my progression there, not more. and I really see less hard decisions, there are less decisions anyways. Plus I have to unlock all electronics in a linear progression. Whereas in the current tree I can weave my way thru it in different ways, considering every node after first two tiers tends to have two\u00A0previous nodes\u00A0that can be used to get there. And each choice I can branch off up or down to get to a node farther down the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso modding is simply the best way to address this issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, ive stated my desire to keep the current tree, and my opinions as to why. This is a thread where little agreement is going to happen from both sides. So I\u0027m not going to go round and round with this. We disagree on the majority of it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso don\u0027t take my console comments and twist them. I\u0027m not into the PC elitism, this game was just made to be modded from the start, and as such it doesn\u0027t lend itself to consoles very well. So because of this fact, they really should be developing them independently in most aspects.

At least that\u0027s what I\u0027m getting from many of your posts. Due to how science is generated to allow you to progress through the tree, you are sort of forced into doing certain missions, and then unlocking certain nodes before others or in a certain order? \u00A0This I feel is a different issue and changing the tech tree layout will not change this aspect of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni could certainly see and have a discussion about changing how to generate the needed science currency to progress through the tree in a different manner, I think this could fix some of the issues people have. I could also see a difficulty option as I and others said to allow planes first, or unmanned first if some wanted to go that way. \u00A0But to me the linked tech tree in the first post is nothing but linear, and more so than the current tree layout. forgetting the science point generation issues for a moment, at least with the current tree you have a much more varied path to some parts. I could skip early batteries and do some other nodes first and then get some better batteries without having to do the first initial nodes. How is the linked to tree mod giving me more choices on my progression and play? I don\u0027t need the little batteries, but in that one I would have to unlock all early batteries and solar panels to get the better ones.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it\u0027s more realistic to unlock that way, but I don\u0027t want realism like that, I want to get the parts I want and ignore the parts I don\u0027t at the same time, the current tree allows that much better in my opinion. There are nodes I never unlock because I don\u0027t want those parts at all, yet in the linked tree, I would have to unlock every single part I don\u0027t want just to get one part I do.
