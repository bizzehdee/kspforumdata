There seem to be a lot of entries that are focusing on doing too much too quickly. I believe that an effective stock craft can serve as an example to new players to have an optimally designed craft, whilst still being able to be playable for the masses. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI voted for rovers that were based on a smaller frame, and appeared to be efficient in their build quality.

Rovers that tended to be excessively bulky were not as high on my list. Yes, I understand that looks are not necessarily part of the challenge and entrants were not instructed to design for such a thing, but there\u0027s something to be said for a good looking rover, so that certainly swayed my vote in their favor. Besides, the game\u0027s stock maximum size is based on a 2.5 meter frame, so why shouldn\u0027t the rovers, too, be?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also searched for rovers that landed on their wheels. As stated before, if this craft is likely to be used by a newbie to the game, I believe that having the rover deployed with some sort of complex mechanism just will add to confusion and frustration on an otherwise simple landing. These rovers gained extra consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, I was looking for a design that was well thought-out, clean, and simple, without the added (often unneccessary, while nice) features that more advanced rovers will bring to the table. I was looking for something that could land, and do roving. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn that, I\u0027ve voted for the following entries: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-SaplingPick\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tarmenius\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Deathsoul097\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Ravenchant\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy favorite of these is the entry by Deathsoul097, as it seems to be the simplest yet most robust of all the rovers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-M5K\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T01:14:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@XolotLoki / M5000 - Yeah, I tried to make it as stable as possible, so I angled the wheels forward and outwards to give it the largest wheelbase possible while still being controllable.

While the rover itself looks good, roves well and has everything a \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Erover needs, actually getting it to the surface is another matter. The last stages are prone to flipping and a \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Epain to control. Lithobraking is the name of the game here.

Easy to operate, so stable it doesn\u0027t even know what turtles ARE, and the delta-V \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Ebudget permits room for error.

I think best would be to be able to map torque keys to shift\u002BWASD and rover keys to WASD for rovers because steering and torque are rarely needed at once but you need to switch between them pretty fast when torque is needed. I tried it even with using Space in docking mode but in that case docking mode turning SAS off is a major obstacle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-09T12:41:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMoved this thread to the Spacecraft Exchange since the focus on the thread is exchanging better stock vehicles, not having a challenge/competition.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*sigh* here we go again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, technically, this is not the classic kind of challenge where you have a task to do in an efficient or epic way, it\u0027s a designer competition so I understand it\u0027s not entirely clear where to put it.
