Well, actually, the collection (mining, gas extraction) will always run at 100% efficiency (we can assume Kerbals somehow got this right after several thousand years of civilization!), but, it will affect the efficiency of turning rock into resources. I sketched out the \u0022mission ladder\u0022 idea a couple of posts ago (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/33323-PLUGIN-PARTS-Development-0-20-tek-Industries-Sample-Return-v0-2-1?p=424171\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post424171\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#49\u003C/a\u003E), and this morning, worked out a rough plan for how these missions would affect efficiency. The first time you mount one of these successfully, you\u0027ll get quite a large boost, but, even if you do all of them, you will still only be at 50%. In order to get to 100%, you\u0027d need to keep sampling, landing, sample returns, whatever you\u0027re most comfortable with (they are \u0022rated\u0022 for simplicity, so going for your nth manned sample mission, which is quite complex, would give you a bigger boost than yet another small lander you can launch in your sleep haha). Come to think of it, I should add a cap also, so that you can\u0027t get to 100% by launching a load of small landers. hmm \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next thing I will do is work on a spectrograph type device. This will tell you what %\u0027s of elements are contained within that type of rock (these values will be hardcoded per body, not random, at least at first). There will be two versions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Small: suitable for small landers/rovers. Will have a limit on the number of samples you can study (\u0022Ovens\u0022), and in order for a successful sampling, you must use all the Ovens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Large: for manned missions. Will come as part of a pod (most likely - I\u0027ll probably just borrow one from stock for now), and will require Kerbals to operate. No limit to the number of samples, but a certain amount of resources should be analysed for a successful sampling. Once this limit is reached, doing more will do nothing for boosting efficiency; you\u0027ll have to launch another mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, before anyone gets too excited, this first version will only be a text based output window, no fancy graphing windows. Remember, what I want to do is get functionality out first, with crappy models, no animations. Get the fundementals right, and everything else is just fluff. If nobody has realised yet, I am a software developer by trade, and this is the kind of approach we take when developing tools in house. We have very few GUI tools, but, because we got the fundementals right, we could implement them if we wanted (and had time haha).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething else I want to do with the next version will be to see how I can save variables to the save game, and keep track of them in memory as you play. This part is kinda crucial to the whole thing, so working this out is a priority, even if it does nothing special at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget, keep thinking, keep on putting ideas forward.

I spent maybe 6 hours on it today, and have put into place the basic blocks for extending the whole thing into a usable resource system. I had hoped to make some more progress, and although I am a coder by trade, C# can be a little... umm... strange. I also added some nicer feedback on screen, specifically for sample return.
