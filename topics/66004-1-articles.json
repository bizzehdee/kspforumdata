I\u0027ve had a pretty slow start of things and have recently started watching a lot of youtube videos (Thank You, Scott M. where ever you are!) to help me figure things out. I really don\u0027t want to \u0022sacrifice\u0022 any of my Kerbals in the name of exploration and science, so I\u0027m trying really hard to not make any mistakes. My number one goal is to put a \u0022fully armed and operational battle station!:mad:\u0022, no, wait, I meant fully functional and operational space station:) into orbit. I would appreciate any and all advice and hope that I can give back to the forum as well. I\u0027m 43 years old, I live in Southern California, and have spent several years in the Navy flying around in the back of 3 different types of aircraft (helicopters) and providing exceptional medical care to my fellow Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen. \u0022Fly Navy, Forever!\u0022. One of my most challenging things is letting go of those days in the military. I hope that can take what I have learned and be a better civilian today. Finally, I am really exciting about starting this journey with Kerbal Space Program.
