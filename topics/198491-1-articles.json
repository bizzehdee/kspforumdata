I am having some of the most SEVERE screen tearing (thats what im pretty sure it is) I have ever seen, to the point that movement in the game makes me want to vomit. I use ASET heavily in my fighter planes, but at the slightest bit of movement, the graphics freak out and scramble everything, and the problem is only amplified when in flight, causing ASET to be completely redundant.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsFJqTJQ3Rs?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis shows the scrambling im talking of (5 seconds in)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1_7hbQjDjg?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis shows both tearing and scrambling on the hanger windows when moving the camera around\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nim running on a GTx 1660 ti with the latest driver (12/2)\u003Cbr\u003E\nand the latest version of Windows 10 64x\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\ni have tried turning off Vsync multiple times, and have done what other people have said to do to fix screen tearing, to no avail. i have even uninstalled my graphics driver and re-installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-03T01:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2020 01:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by that plane guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadding more info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
