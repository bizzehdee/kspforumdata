They work roughly as stock, but are balanced for the more dangerous re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E#2 - Stock heat shields have a major issue, in which when they run out of ablator, they stop conducting heat to whatever is attached to them making it practically immune to re-entry heat conduction between parts as long as the heat shield is attached (can\u0027t believe no one noticed this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAdditional Info:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETests were conducted for balance purpose up to interplanetary re-entry coming from Duna with heat shields.. roughly 3800 m/s speed and they will protect your command pods and kerbals.
