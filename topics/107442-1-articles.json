Since 1.0.4 update, it is very easy to tweak the reentry thermal effects and this mod is no longer needed. Thank you.**\n\nHello.\n\nThe following file address two issues with 1.0.2 re-entry thermal effects.\n\n#1 - Stock re-entry in 1.0.2, even at 120% difficulty does NOT require a heat shield. Simply put.. nothing explodes and re-entering without a heat shield is perfectly safe.\n\nTo me that seems extremely broken \u0026 unrealistic. And i\u0027m sure there are many people who agree.\n\nA simple tweak in the Physics.cfg file fixes that.. making your re-entries actually dangerous.\n\nCurrently, i\u0027ve set it so that you will be able to re-enter with a command pod \u0026 parachute attached (without heat shield) from LKO (100km) with a decent re-entry trajectory.\n\nAnything beyond that and you\u0027re gonna have a nice fireworks display.\n\nThat in turn rendered the stock heat shields useless.. which have been balanced as well. They work roughly as stock, but are balanced for the more dangerous re-entry.\n\n#2 - Stock heat shields have a major issue, in which when they run out of ablator, they stop conducting heat to whatever is attached to them making it practically immune to re-entry heat conduction between parts as long as the heat shield is attached (can\u0027t believe no one noticed this).\n\nFixed.\n\n**Additional Info:**\n\nTests were conducted for balance purpose up to interplanetary re-entry coming from Duna with heat shields.. roughly 3800 m/s speed and they will protect your command pods and kerbals. Go higher than that.. and who knows what might happen ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nSSTO\u0027s ARE able to reach orbit \u0026 re-enter, even if the heat is more intense, you just need to watch it carefully. I\u0027d say it is a bit more harder to manage them now.\n\nAscending rockets are harder as well. You need to watch that speed during lower altitudes! Note that some parts that have low max temperature might or might not blow up (like the basic fin, for example).\n\n**What the actual file does:**\n\nChanges \u0022convectionVelocityExponent\u0022 value (originally found in Physics.cfg) from 3 to 3.35 (can be changed to suit your needs)\n\nRebalances \u0022Ablator\u0022 resource \u0022hsp\u0022 value \u0026 heat shields thermal mass to actually be able to conduct heat to other parts when \u0022Ablator\u0022 is 0 (might need rebalance if \u0022convectionVelocityExponent\u0022 is not 3.35)\n\n**Installation:**\n\nMake sure you have your thermal re-entry effects in options set to 120%\n\nCopy the \u0022reentry\\_heat\\_rebalance\\_and\\_heatshield\\_conduction\\_fix.cfg\u0022 to your KSP/Game Data directory\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\nThese tweaks need Module Manager 2.6.3 in order to work.
