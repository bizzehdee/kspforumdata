See pics of the plane here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ftln0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/ftln0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore pics can be provided as well as various files for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe airplane can be broken into various components such as the cockpit, main fuselage, tail, wings, tail fins, ailerons, etc. so it may be assembled in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are four engines on the plane, and it should operate in atmosphere and vacuum. Perhaps the attributes of the aerospike and an air breathing engine could be copied from the original game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn IVA would also need to be made. Perhaps someone could explain how to maintain compatibility for future versions of KSP provided the modeling doesn\u0027t need to be drastically changed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHopefully the poly count can be reduced. Don\u0027t need those Lego nubs sticking out. I want the shape to remain the same, but there can be a degree in freedom with small details. I built the plane as a child and I would love to see it fly in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t mind helping financially in exchange for the modeling/coding/etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me know if you are interested in the project and we can talk details.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
