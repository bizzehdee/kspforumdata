After a few tests, today was the time for an entry attempt.\n\nThe launch and orbit insertion went so-so, with the periapsis of the first \u0022orbit\u0022 only at 55km, but after emptying the main tank, the orbit was at an impressive 225x233km. The tank was threatening to break up, and failure of the tank had caused some problems in my earlier tests. This time, only a few bits fell off, and it could be safely decoupled.\n\nThen on to a 405x405km orbit using monopropellant and deployment of the payload consisting of the full orange tank. It ended in a 405,124x405,211 orbit, still completely full.\n\nNow for de-orbit - wait intil KSC appeared roughly in the right place and retro-burn every drop of the monopropellant. Periapsis now 31.5km - this just might be enough, provided the shuttle can withstand the steep descent?!\n\nWell, the shuttle slowed down to below 1km/s, 30 km above KSC without blowing up, so things are looking promising. Then turned around for the island runway and approached low and slow. Rapid disassembly on the hill before the runway, but the crew was alive. Hmm, hit F9 and tried again from 29km height. Same result. F9 again, and finally nailed it with a complete shuttle stopped on the island runway and a happy crew.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/jhQyF)"}]}
