I don\u0027t know how advanced it was but the Mun was in it. I told myself that once I landed on Mun and got home, I\u0027d know if I wanted to play the game. I successfully landed and got home that same weekend (mostly thanks to learning about quicksave) and bought the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first real game was in sandbox (that\u0027s all we had back then) and I futzed around with massive ships that ended up taking full organe tanks (that were intended as the launch stage) all the way to Mun. I somehow successfully orbited Moho (couldn\u0027t land or get back) and then realized that... there would not have been anything to do there once I got there, that I hadn\u0027t already done on Mun. Then I realized that about every other planet. Then I quit playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout 2 weeks later Career Mode (Science Mode) came out, and I figured I\u0027d try it. I LOVED it. I also started playing with mods, and realizing (with the help of KER) what I\u0027d been doing wrong all along with my rockets. I also discovered Kethane and Extraplanetary Launchpads. I loaded up that old career, set up a Karbonite operation on Minmus, sent a rescue ship to Moho and brought those guys home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I deleted that save and started my first YouTube series, which back then was just \u0022KSP\u0022 but is now called \u0022Bases.\u0022 I learned a lot making that series, both about YouTube (and video production) AND playing KSP, so my next series (Kerpollo) was much more successful from both fronts. Now almost a year and several other series later, I consider myself an advanced player, able to gravity assist in most situations where it\u0027ll actually help, pinpoint a landing onto a docking port landed on an airless world, and run with margins so thin that I miss a Gilly landing by less than 100 m/s (oops).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey, just because I know how doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027ll actually succeed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cuky","CreatedById":111755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T15:41:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have started with .23.5 where I played a bit in Career and I have continued with Science Career in .24.

Being an Aviation and Space travel enthusiast, I thought: Why not give it a try?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t look at the tutorials when I first got it, so I had lots of difficulty with attaching nodes and all that. I still remember when I attempted to build a Space Shuttle with the old Mk3 parts and a Jumbo-64 which - of course - looked terrible, and never worked. People always told me \u0022Just press spacebar!\u0022 Which I never understood, as I was surprised to hear an engine spark up but wouldn\u0027t ignite. It was around version 20.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI left the game in my desktop and let it \u0022rot\u0022, until I heard about my friend who was apparently building spaceplanes with the game. Spaceplanes?! When did that become a thing?! I decided to give it one more try, updated the game to 0.22, and was baffled at the new Space Centre from 0.21. Regardless, after some impatient sitting down to learn (I \u003Cem\u003Ehate \u003C/em\u003Esteep learning curves ( Looking at you, Blender!)), I learned the basics of throttles, pitch, yaw, all that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd whoosh! I sped to the spaceplane hangar at once, eager to build. I have to say, I was a pretty weird plane-maker back then. It took me a long while to learn every step. I was basically self-taught with only my common sense to guide me, and just hope it would work. I used the Mk3 parts for my first spaceplanes, because they looked much like Space Shuttles. Needless to say, I was mostly guesssing and wondering why my LV-T45 powered plane didn\u0027t work and would tear itself apart on the runway. Of course, I never knew about Center of Mass and all that, so my first few months of KSP was nothing but trial and error along with some kabooms. I spent time in the VAB too, but very seldom did. My first space-worthy rocket was a bunch of Rockomax X200-32s stacked on top of each other and a Mainsail. I got to Kerbin orbit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started to build in the VAB more, and did things such as land on the Mun, orbit Kerbin and all that. I was a happy newbie. I still seldom research about all that. I continued to send satellites to orbit, just for fun. I never really watched tutorials: I just asked a friend what to do. Aahh... the days when I just burned prograde randomly and hope I\u0027d get a Mun encounter! Of course I still worked on planes though, getting one on a suborbital hop after the introduction of Rapiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a break from KSP, and got into playing other titles such as Mario, Flight Simulator X and all that. Meanwhile, versions 23.5 and .24 were being released. Oh, was I still looking at KSP facebook pages, although I never really got any motivation to continue. After all, there are more games out there, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was severely feeling dull one day, and found myself humming Danny2462 tunes (Kevin Macleod is great!) and wondered.. Should K play it again? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took me a while to find the latest version which was 0.24. I had immediately installed it on another system, and got going. I loved it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was constantly building new rockets and spaceplanes, was thrilled at the new parts, and was very happy with it! Why did I wait a whole three months before getting back to it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that time, version 0.25 was underway in Experimentals, and I was hyped. I\u0027ve been delving deep into KSP news!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt became my most favorite after it\u0027s release (and hey, buildings that go bam!) and was more hooked than ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learned landing on Minmus, starting burns at specific times, maneuver nodes, and Center of Mass, lift, thrust and all that. 0.90 came along, and I found that my most favorite part set - the Mk3, whether ugly or not - was gojng to be given some love by a big overhaul. Hypetrains were at full power! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERelease went underway and was amazing. Adapters, cargo bays, passenger cabins (I loved that!) and possibly the dream part set of a KSP Aircraft builder. I didn\u0027t care much about upgradable buildings because I didn\u0027t play Career often, to be honest, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has become my favorite game ever since. From my first throttle up to every landing leg touching interplanetary surfaces, I loved this game. I\u0027ve learned about sending rovers to the Mun and Minmus, going to other planets, and the bread and butter job of station building. Jeb, Bill and Bob are in Duna, exploring the dusty dunes there. Probes are sitting on Laythe, Duna and Eve currently as part of my expeditions. I\u0027ve gotten a hand on replica-building, especially with airliners.
