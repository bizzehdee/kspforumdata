I have to hold it down for about 15 seconds, and then when I *release* it, only about 25% of the time does to actually do a quick save. When it doesn\u0027t work, I don\u0027t even get the little message. It doesn\u0027t quicksave when I press F5, only when I release it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is unmodded. I am not using Steam, just the zip file from the store. You can unzip the game, start career, select a Mk1 capsule, and launch it, then try using F5 on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works fine in .23.5. I can do the unzip ... mk1 capsule bit and it quicksaves the moment I hit F5.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried changing it to F6. I tried making the secondary key F6. I tried rightshift-F5, and all the alt/shift/capslock/numlock combos. I even undefined F1 for screenshots and defined it for quicksave because I know that key works. The bad behavior just moves to F1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone of the other function keys have a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere aren\u0027t any errors in the KSP.log in the game dir or ~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using fvwm as the window manager, and I\u0027ve even tried KSP with it \u0022unmanaged\u0022 so the wm isn\u0027t intercepting keys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ran Patcher to update things. No change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course I can work around it by going to the space center and doing \u0022save game\u0022 but I was wondering if I was the only one with this strange problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah, and another strange bit: whenever I hit any function key, the \u0022stage\u0022 light glows purple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I\u0027m also aware of the bug where the number-pad doesn\u0027t work to enter numbers in things like mechjeb, even with numlock on.
