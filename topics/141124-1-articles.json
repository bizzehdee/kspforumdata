I had one of the early rendezvous missions active when I stopped playing and was in the process of completing it. I had two separate vessels in orbit of Kerbin. The mission says to bring them in visual range of each other and kill the relative velocity. So far I have brought them within 5 meters of each other and killed the relative velocity but the mission just wont complete. Does anyone know why this is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should note that when I loaded up the game from months ago I\u0027m pretty sure one of them was in a sub orbit. I corrected it but it still wont work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T16:53:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. \u00A0Is this a career game contract or one of the tutorials? \u00A0The term \u0022mission\u0022 is a bit ambiguous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, assuming this is a contract.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say \u0022months ago\u0022, was that in 1.0.5? \u00A0Are you playing in 1.1.2 now? \u00A0I\u0027ve head that sometimes contracts in progress don\u0027t survive the game update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut anyway, contracts in general sometimes fail to complete for no apparent reason. \u00A0It\u0027s always been that way, and happens to all types of contracts. \u00A0Worst case, you can open the ALT-F12 menu, go to the contracts tab, and mark this contract as complete. \u00A0It\u0027s not cheating if you actually did the work but the game is bugged \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chugganaut","CreatedById":165135,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-03T17:39:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey thanks for the reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it is a career game contract.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not exactly sure if it was 1.0.5 or not.
