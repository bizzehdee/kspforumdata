They are VERY cheap. Maybe not as cheap as plane SSTO, but they are easily scalable (plane SSTO can\u0027t and have to be redesigned). I extended my heavy 300T launcher to a 600T in 10 min and succeeded on the first launch with nearly the same ascent profile. Put the needed dV, TWR and make your rocket streamlined : you\u0027re good. The only limitation are your CPU and the structural integrity of the payload fixation on the SSTO stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign hints for a lower tech version :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You\u0027ll need to put some smaller parts (probe, batteries...) somewhere, probably in a service bay. Those service bays are quite fragile and I had them crumbling under the payload weight. That\u0027s why I used to put them at the bottom of the rocket, protected by a heatshield (partially filled). I only used higher tech parts because I could get rid of the service bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Chutes can become heavy if you want to land with them. I chose powered landing to avoid using hundreds of them. An alternative is to use plane landing gears (medium or heavy). They have a much higher crashing tolerance, but they look... strange on a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Airbrakes are usefull to tweak landing zone. I think they are necessary in 1.0.4. Drogues may be as well, depending of the weight of your stage. To be tested with your design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Vernors can be an alternative to reaction wheels on heavy SSTO. You can save on batteries. I didn\u0027t used them : I\u0027ve placement issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- For a successful reentry, try to local the deorbit location. In 1.0.4, I found that the western ridge of the crater 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 of KSC was the best considering a 60m/s deorbit burn. But again, that depends on the drag of your stage (airbrakes or not...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T11:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbe cores aren\u0027t the problem, got HECS already. The Mainsail is. I really avoided researching that node because I got a Boar through a silly contract (test in suborbital Minmus flight) and kept using it for everything except testing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But if I\u0027m ever to get NERV, I have to research Mainsail, so... okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With airbrakes drogues are definitely not necessary. Tweaking the landing zone is one thing. Getting the upper thousand m/s off the orbital speed (when burning up is a real concern and drogues are of no use) is another, and once that\u0027s taken care of, the rest is peanuts: with four airbrakes, the twin boar \u002B orange tank \u002B several extras gets down to 250m/s before 10,000m altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ll definitely need to try the powered landing. It seems tricky to pick the right moment and the right thrust. So far, before airbrakes I was used powered braking - getting the speed down by 500m/s over the 40km-20km altitude range makes a world of difference during reentry and the launch stage freed from payload and with nearly empty fuel tanks gets some impressive dV on the last few drops of fuel. (OTOH if I missed the point to shut off the engines and perform the separation in suborbital flight, I had to refuel the launch stage from the transfer stage supply... ugly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- with Airbrakes, I can afford making the reentry far more aggressively - entering the atmosphere just as the deserts end, path ending about 1/3 the ocean width past KSC, makes a landing between the mountains and KSC. (since my orbits are usually quite ugly - poor ascent trajectory and never bothering to circularize - it\u0027s easier to describe the landing system that way. OTOH if my launch stage doesn\u0027t go orbital (it rarely does), the landing is somewhere before the Badlands, and recovery yields some 70% only. That\u0027s a primary reason why I\u0027m aiming for a true SSTO. As for probe cores and batteries, I\u0027m really gonna try the coreless approach. Might *just* work, and that\u0027s, what, 60m/s dV wasted from the transfer stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the aforementioned 5 tons is my new approach to orbital recovery of stranded Kerbonauts (contracts) - with their vessels. The 5 ton vehicle is a single medium-length 1.25m fuel tank with a probe core, 12 Vernor engines, Klaw, 4 airbrakes, 8 parachutes, a battery and some solar panels. I don\u0027t know the exact number but it has lots of dV, something of order of 3000 I think, through the Vernor engines alone - plenty enough to rendezvous any stranded Kerbal, grab their vehicle with the Klaw, and deorbit it safely. No problems with crew cabin getting occupied by Jeb, no EVA, no problem with extracting kerbals stuck inside a probe core, the only actual problem is lack of informational display - delta-V, predicted burn time etc for Vernor engines. Oh, and it fits in an MK2 cargo bay. Although with the vertical SSTO I believe the small fairing would be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eps.

The mass of the Mainsail makes it aerodynamically stable falling backwards.

But then adding a pair of chutes will make it easier and won\u0027t cost much deltaV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E./\\\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E| | \u0026lt;-- payload in fairing \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E --- \u0026lt;-- fairing base and decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E __ \u0026lt;-- cargo bay with power, probe core and reaction wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | | \u0026lt;-- jumbo orangex64 with a pair of chutes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | | \u0026lt;--other jumbo with radial tanks, fins and gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E | |\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E __\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \\ /\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E /\\ \u0026lt;--mainsail\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould have posted a pic, but where\u0027s the fun in that ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T00:01:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 12:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hcube\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eascii fail\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
