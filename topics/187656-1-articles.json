As you all know, when you\u0027re transferring and the possible destination parts highlight blue, you\u0027re supposed to mouse over those potential parts, and they\u0027re supposed to turn a darker blue, and then you double click to complete the transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem parts I\u0027m talking about will not turn the darker blue. It\u0027s like there is an invisible hotspot that you have to mouse over, and sometimes it\u0027s just not there. To be clear, it\u0027s not that I can\u0027t transfer kerbals anywhere, I\u0027ll be able to transfer them to other parts on the same vessel, even to pods that are identical to the ones I can\u0027t transfer to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have realistic transfers off and I removed Connected Living Space a few weeks ago as it\u0027s broken and you can\u0027t transfer across docking ports at all. Maybe they\u0027ve fixed it now, not sure. But it\u0027s not part of the equation here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any ideas how to get around this?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
