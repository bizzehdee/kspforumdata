Such posts are very often mistakes.  ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  For example, practically anything in Technical Support or Gameplay Questions should probably be left alone if they\u0027ve been silent for a really long time.  Reason:  Threads there are because *\u003Cu\u003Esomebody has a problem they\u0027re trying to solve and needs help\u003C/u\u003E*.  If the last post in the thread was a year or more ago... I think it\u0027s pretty safe that whatever problem they once had, they *\u003Cu\u003Elong\u003C/u\u003E* ago got an answer one way or another.  So it\u0027s not useful to post there.  It\u0027s not helpful to post an *\u003Cu\u003Eanswer\u003C/u\u003E* (because they almost certainly don\u0027t need one anymore), and it\u0027s also not helpful to post a \u0022me too!\u0022 kind of *\u003Cu\u003Equestion\u003C/u\u003E* (because if you\u0027ve got a *\u003Cu\u003Ecurrent\u003C/u\u003E* problem, it\u0027s better to just post your own thread).\n\nEven if it\u0027s not a gameplay question or technical support issue, posting in an ancient, years-dead thread in, say, KSP Discussion is likely to be unhelpful, if for no other reason than that everyone else in the discussion was talking about a very different previous version of KSP, so anything said *\u003Cu\u003Enow\u003C/u\u003E* is likely to be moot relative to what was said *\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E*.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some cases where it\u0027s perfectly reasonable to post in a thread that hasn\u0027t had a post in a while.  For example, a mod\u0027s thread in Add-on Releases.  Just because nobody has posted there in a few months doesn\u0027t necessarily mean it\u0027s *\u003Cu\u003Edead\u003C/u\u003E*-- it may simply be that nothing new has happened in a while and nobody had any questions until you came along.  So it maybe perfectly reasonable to ask.  (On the other hand, if it\u0027s been multiple *\u003Cu\u003Eyears\u003C/u\u003E*, and the mod author hasn\u0027t logged on to the forum since forever... then it\u0027s probably a safe bet that the mod\u0027s dead and there\u0027s no need to resurrect the thread.)\n\nEvery case is different, and \u0022is it appropriate to post in an old thread?\u0022 will vary on a case-by-case basis.  That\u0027s why there\u0027s no forum rule \u0022don\u0027t necro!\u0022, and that\u0027s why threads don\u0027t auto-lock themselves whent they lie dormant for a long time.  It\u0027s a matter of judgment and etiquette, not strict \u0022correctness\u0022.\n\nSo basically, it\u0027s up to you to judge whether you think it makes sense.  Just make sure that you don\u0027t necro a thread *\u003Cu\u003Eaccidentally\u003C/u\u003E* due to simply not noticing how old it is.  That\u0027s what that little warning banner is for, as an aid to notice that sort of thing.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Don\u0027t worry too much about whether you \u0022get it wrong\u0022, it\u0027s kind of a gray area and about the worst that can happen would be if some moderator thinks \u0022well, this really shouldn\u0027t have been necroed\u0022, they may lock the thread with a friendly explanatory note to prevent further confusion.  No harm done!\n\nAs avid forum user H.P. Lovecraft said, *\u0022That is not dead which can eternal lie.\u0022  *****  Truth."},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-22T10:37:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 7/16/2018 at 9:07 PM, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E So it\u0027s not useful to post there.
