You need to know precise orbital parameters of Kerbin, the Mun, the target planet, and where they are in their current orbit at the moment of you\u0027re taking off, where Kerbin is within its daily rotation, and so on.\u003Cp\u003EBecause to do it right and get a savings, you have to be able to do better than you\u0027d do from the Oberth effect of just doing your interplanetary injection burn directly from low Kerbin orbit, and that means you have to be able to predict \u003Cem\u003Eahead of time\u003C/em\u003E how the Mun will bend your path \u003Cem\u003Elater on\u003C/em\u003E after you stretched your ellipse out from low Kerbin orbit quite a bit. Otherwise what happens is that you watch the map view, and burn until you like the path you see the Mun encounter causes, then stop the engines and coast until you go through the Mun\u0027s SOI, and then later after that\u0027s done you look at how much more burning you have to do from free space and complete your injection from there. It\u0027s that \u0022stop the engines and coast\u0022 part that makes it less efficient than an injection directly from a low kerbin orbit burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust trying to plan a slingshot with a single body is tricky enough.

It helps with only one thing - to verify that you can get the slingshot you need with periapsis above crash zone. But you can never perform your precisely prepared maneuver exactly (unless you use tools) and slingshot maneuvers are extremely sensitive. So if you already know that the slingshot is possible with safe periapsis, there\u0027s no need to set up perfect maneuver. Just set up maneuver to approximately the right place, perform the burn, delete the maneuver and fine tune your real trajectory using RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlingshots in KSP are easiest with orbits in between. Meaning, you perform slingshot not to hit some target, but just to intersect its trajectory at suitable spot. Then you put a correction to that intersection and tune the orbit by a few m/s for intercept in several orbits. After the intercept is about 3/4 orbit ahead, again fine-tune for another slingshot to the next target. Yes it takes a lot of Kerbal time. But it does not require any heavy calculations, just basic knowledge how gravity slingshots work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
