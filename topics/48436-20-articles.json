While researching at the subject, looks like LOX Augmentation while slightly decreasing the Vacuum ISP, (witch is strange since the exhaust velocity is higher, I wonder if there is unburnt oxygen expelling out in the process, that\u0027s why) on the other hand have improved Atmospheric ISP! Since with the extra exhaust velocity, there is more pressure to fight against the Atmosphere. A LOX augmented NTR could get Atmospheric ISP almost as high as 700. with 3 times the thurst! (getting close to 50:1 TWR) SSTO may in fact be attainable with such technology! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill on the topic: Looks like the LOX Augmented mode can be actually switched on and off inflight on most of this NTR designs. Which is amazing, specially for the massive GAS CORE engines witch have very high ISP for interplanetary travel. So, I tried to copy-paste the B9\u0027s engine switch-mode configuration, the \u0022hydramodule\u0022 and put it in one of the NTR engines.
