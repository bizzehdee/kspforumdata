I could go EVA from pod, but not return back (it said it\u0027s full, when I switched to ship with kerbal outside his switching portrait was still there), going to lab through hatch puts him back into pod. When I sent another kebal to lab with the same stock method, he became the one \u0022jumping\u0022 instead. Also SM window couldn\u0027t be closed due to active transfer.
