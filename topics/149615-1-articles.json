This isn\u0027t the first series of its type but I\u0027m hoping the back story and history\u00A0I have in mind for it will make it an entertaining read for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn brief, the series will start in the aftermath of a brief but catastrophic nuclear war between the 4th Kerbin Empire and the fledging Independent Kerbal States (IKS)\u00A0(Separatists wanting to escape the heavy taxation imposed by the Emperor). Again this is nothing new but I couldn\u0027t think of a better reason for the Kerbals to develop rockets other than for military purposes. Utilising aging piston engine aircraft the IKS Pilots wage a guerrilla war against the Empire to damage their infrastructure - facing early jet aircraft flown by the Imperial pilots.\u00A0With mounting losses the Emperor turns to Dr. Werner Von-Kerman to develop a terror weapon that can bring the rogue states into line. The attacks serve to strengthen the IKS resolve and - enlisting support from sympathetic factions within the Empire - they launch a full scale assault on Kerbin City to remove the Empire from power. Faced with a shameful defeat the Emperor invokes a \u0022Scorched Kerbin\u0022 protocol and commits suicide. Though the IKS win the battle and the Empire falls the political and environmental fallout are catastrophic - rendering large swathes of Kerbin uninhabitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the Kerbin Reconstruction Authority (KRA - Interim Government) desperately searches for a way to ensure the survival of Kerbal Kind by designating areas of Kerbin Blue, Yellow or Red Zones depending on their levels of radiation. There are very few Blue Zones (Rad Free) and most of the population live in Yellow Zones. As the KRA faces the daunting prospect of having to make some tough decisions an amazing discovery is made in Kerbin\u0027s irradiated waters...one that may hold the key to repairing the damage to Kerbin\u0027s ecosystem. With the clock to extinction ticking the KRA appoint Major Gene Kerman to\u00A0oversee what will ultimately become the KSP. Bringing together old enemies, new allies...and a thrill seeking scrap merchant eager to leave his mark on history...from Kerbin to the Mun will document the early years of the KSP before the programme was officially founded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMain Characters\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLt.
