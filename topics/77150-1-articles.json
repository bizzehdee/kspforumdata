Enterprise lacked many thing that would make it unsuitable, some such as design changes. Columbia was the first and had a lot of close calls... Such as landing in the desert and having to be shipped back by 747, assembled by a construction company... However we lost her in 2003 due to a reentry accident caused by a foam strike in the left wing.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know as much of challenger as the rest... Same for Endeavor and Atlantis... Any info would be nice as I want to learn of these awesome machines. What I do know is, that we lost Challenger due to the famous, O-ring failure, on the left(?) SRB. Causing an explosion of the external tank, and the disintegration of the Orbiter. Sadly to note, the crew survived the explosion, and we\u0027re killed by the impact in the ocean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscovery is heralded as the queen of the fleet.
