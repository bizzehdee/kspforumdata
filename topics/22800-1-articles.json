I also suspect (but I\u0027m not sure) that KSP doesn\u0027t activate all parts instantaneously, it activates parts in the order they were added. That would mean the smaller decouplers are firing first (because that part was added first), and the separators are now not part of the ship (and therefore can\u0027t be activated). I\u0027d try doing it in two stages, eject the outer ring then the inner ring. If you\u0027re going for what I think you are, that would probably work better anyway.
