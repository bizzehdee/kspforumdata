This can cause a vehicle to drift one way or another, or just cause higher than normal tire wear. In racing you may want more camber to help offset some of the lateral forces the car goes under when cornering or due to track and weather conditions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut also the toe of the wheel comes into affect, this is something a lot of people don\u0027t take into account. Toe also has affect on how a vehicle will handle, and will have a great deal of affect at higher speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast but not least is caster, in racing the joke is, \u0022Caster is that thing that keeps the driver happy.\u0022 Truth is caster affects several things, both your feel through the steering wheel of a real car, but also the amount of input required to get the wheels to turn when moving. To much caster and the wheels will basically be a pain to turn and will feel like driving a sled. To little and it will feel like you are driving a unicycle and feel like the car is twitch and overreacts to bumps in the road. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to go off on a tangent but I am a former automotive technician for Volvo and Nissan, and a avid Nissan Z car fan I own one that I used to race.
