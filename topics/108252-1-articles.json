However I don\u0027t like using the pilot abilities (the buttons down the left of the nav ball) to hold a heading because they waste a ton of power and can make the ship judder. But you can hit the prograde button, wait till you\u0027re lined up and then switch it back to regular stability assist (which doesn\u0027t waste so much power).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using a manoeuvre node then you always want to be lined up exactly on the blue manoeuvre node marker. One key thing to making an accurate burn is when you time the burn. Don\u0027t start the burn at t=0, you want to reach t=0 exactly half way through the burn. So for example if you set up a manoeuvre and it says the Estimated burn is 2m then start the burn when \u0022NodeinT\u0022 is 1m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
