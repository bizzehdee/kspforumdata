I would just like to ask a question in regards to fuel efficiency and thrust.

It was built to do things the long way round, using solar orbit first then going to Laythe. I know using phase angles is cheap in Delta V, I was attempting to make it for someone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI learnt that may method of building the rocket was very inefficient, so did a bunch of experimenting and theorising. Came to the point of asking this question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I use a engine with say 215 thrust. Is it better to fill it up completely with fuel tanks before adding a new stage. In another wards is it best to only add an engine and decoupler when u need too? Of course based on what twr you want and such. but basically if I have 215 thrust that can lift 21.93 mass tons.

Low TWR engines and rocket SSTOs in particular do better at the lower end of that, while high TWR engines and asparagus staged craft can (and perhaps should) go for the lower gravity losses at the upper end.

More powerful engines tend to be heavier, so you\u0027re usually wasting mass and getting less delta-v out of your rocket if you use an engine that gives you enough thrust to peg the g-meter above 2. Once in space, you can get away with even lower TWR and do fine. I personally prefer a minimum acceleration of 5 m/s (which is a Kerbin TWR of about 0.5). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your stage has more TWR than you need, consider either using a lighter engine or adding more fuel tanks. Both will increase delta-v under most conditions, unless of course your lighter engine has worse ISP and its smaller mass can\u0027t make up for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poynting","CreatedById":103397,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-20T14:24:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Moon Frog\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason we jettison stages is that as the mass of the empty tanks becomes significant compared to the remaining fuel our Dv is hurt be dragging the useless mass with us. However we dont want too many stages as we end up carrying alot of mass in the engines we arent using higher up. Its all a balance but a good rule of thumb is always to have about 10x as much fuel in the lower stage compared to the one above it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a Laythe return rocket I would suggest a ship with roughly 3 main stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first: This stage will be your ascent stage to get you to orbit. Use the most powerful rockets, solid boosters and lots of fuel. Just keep the TWR above 2 and add as much fuel as you can via asparagus staging (side boosters that feed fuel into the remaining tanks to keep them topped up, so that you can ditch empty tanks as soon as possible). Once you have a Dv from this stage of about 5000m/s you are done. Jettison it once in orbit and the fuel is used up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second: This is your jool injection and manuvering stage. There is no longer a restriction to the TWR, you are in orbit and have all the time you like to complete the burn. You are just looking for the Dv you need to get to Jool which normally means looking for the rocket with the highest ISP (which is roughly speaking the efficiency of that rocket motor). I\u0027d include plenty od SAS here so it doesn\u0027t take an age to turn the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third: This is your return stage. We\u0027ve now dropped the stage that got us here as there is not point carrying the empty tanks back (Feel free to use us any remaining fuel though before ditching it). This stage should be as small and light as possible as adding any mass here will exponetially increase the required fuel mass for the first two stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, It\u0027s all pretty complicated so just keep trying.

I have another question, with the parts I had, I built this to launch something into orbit. I was building it on the principle that using all my thrust was better than splitting it up into stages. Don\u0027t know if that is true. Here is a picture of it, I built it too twr of 1. Then used 3 solid booster rockets to help it get of the ground, fired all engines at once including boosters. It got into orbit. My question is, can it be done better? meaning my hypothesis is wrong. I don\u0027t have fuel lines yet. Click on image for it to get bigger.

Other people will explain it better, but here it goes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour engines down below have to push the weight of a lot of fuel at the launchpad. IOW, their thrust (which isn\u0027t increased by the amount of fuel they have available) has to cope with a lot of weight, lowering your thrust to weight ratio. Which, in turn, means you\u0027ll expend more time in the thickest parts of the atmosphere, where the air slows you down the most. So, at some point, you\u0027re achieving diminishing results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want to get above 10,000 meters as soon as possible, so you\u0027ll want a lot of thrust in your first stage. However, the atmosphere terminal velocity puts a cap in fuel efficiency. Go for a TWR of 5 and you\u0027ll waste a lot of fuel. Go for a TWR of 1.3 and you\u0027ll expend a lot of time fighting thick air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet Kerbal Engineer Redux. Monitor your TWR as you remove fuel tanks. IIRC, TWR at the surface with the stock game (ie, no FAR or NEAR) has to be close to 2. It\u0027s best to have less fuel tanks over more engines. Also those radial engines are convenient to place, but they suck. Once you have girders, you can make an \u0022L\u0022 with them and mount non radial engines radially.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T01:38:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by juanml82\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moonfrog","CreatedById":76295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T08:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate people telling me the basics, but I already know the basics.

But what I think I discovered was, you should stage slightly above the max mass ratio for your engine and fuel tank mass divided by two(as far as I know all basic fuel tanks have same ratio, u can use any of basic ones). This should insure that your two stages will always have more mass ratio than a single stage, since a single stage has a max mass ratio based on engine and fuel tank, of same engine or engines. At the same time, u are not over building by adding too many fuel tanks, which although would give you more delta V in the stage, per mass the fuel becomes less efficient in comparison to staging for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used some of the peoples maths above and there advice, so thx for the help I have managed to figure out the answer, even if it wasn\u0027t made clear.
