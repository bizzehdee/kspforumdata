To dock, you need both your instincts and experience. Ok first, try to get a close encounter, always as close as you can. 20km to 15km=good, 15km to 10km= better, 10 to 3= best, 3km to #m= way too close. so after you get an encounter you like (id recommend like 10 km to practice)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ekill your relative velocity to the target (burn retrograde till the green number above the nav ball keep decreasing until you are close to 0, if it starts increasing after reaching a certain number, that\u0027s your permanent speed until you get closer and don\u0027t worry, it will decrease later.) Now start burning towards your target, i always do it with only RCS, cuz my ships are too large to rotate, but you have to choose wisely, if you gain too much speed, you can crash into it or plainly miss it, so its better slow and steady. What i do is thrust for a few second so the distance decreases, and when the distance starts increasing, i repeat the process. Its pretty slow, but it works, and quick save regularly. After doing that for a while, get as close as you can to the ship without touching it, and with SAS keep the ship steady, next switch to the other and make that ship\u0027s docking port face the other docking port. Next, carefully use translation controls to start to align the docking ports. always remember to keep you ship steady( meaning when you burn one way, you have to burn the opposite to stop)and then slowly dock, and turn off your SAS as soon as you make contact. The ships should become one. hope this helps\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoveycat","CreatedById":71091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T02:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Johnno\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Johnno\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOnce you\u0027ve matched orbits to get an encounter (anything really, be it 1km or 15km) click the speed readout on top of your navball, click it until it reads Target.

Thank\u0027s for any help.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt sounds like you problem is with rendezvous, not with docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also sounds like you have a misunderstanding about what the navball is telling you, and maybe a confusion about the pink and yellow markers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are trying to rendezvous with a target, you need to have selected the target in map mode, and the navball must be indicating Target. This means that the speed indicator and the \u003Cstrong\u003Eyellow \u003C/strong\u003Eprograde and retrograde markers are now indicating your \u003Cstrong\u003Erelative\u003C/strong\u003E speed to the target. Any manoeuvers that you perform with regards to those markers, in Target mode, are relative to the target (and not your orbit). The \u003Cstrong\u003Epink \u003C/strong\u003Emarkers indicate the direction of your target. Only the pink positive direction is useful. The pink opposite direction serves no real purpose. Rendezvous is all about getting close to the target by burning towards the target (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe pink target marker\u003C/span\u003E), and then reducing your \u003Cstrong\u003Erelative \u003C/strong\u003Espeed to zero by burning opposite to your velocity vector (\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethe yellow retrograde marker\u003C/span\u003E). When your relative speed is zero, you will be on the same orbit as the target, and therefore stationary. From that point, you can gently thrust around the target with RCS, just like you would in EVA, and get yourself in position to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo rendezvous, this is how you do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- Select your target in map mode. Click the navball where it says Surface or Orbit to switch it to Target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Place yourself in an orbit that is lower or higher than your target. This is important, because if you are at the same altitude, it will take ages to catch up (or be caught up) with your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Set up a manoeuver node that intercepts your targets orbit. This is the tricky bit, because there is a lot of trial and error involved with pulling the handles around. Aim for a distance that is below 2km from the target. The closer the better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Execute your manoeuver mode and watch your ship reach the closest approach distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Make sure your navball is in Target mode. When your ship gets to your closest approach distance, point to your retrograde marker (which now indicates your vector relative to the target), and burn until your speed is 0.0m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s it, you have achieved rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, you might be a bit too far away from your target to go for a final docking approach. To manoeuver closer to the target, this is how you do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- With a relative speed of 0.0m/s Make sure the navball is still in Target mode. Point your ship towards the pink marker. This indicates the direction to your target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Burn gently towards the pink marker. Do not exceed 2 or 3m/s. The (relative) prograde marker should come close to that pink marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- If you start going too fast, or as your prograde marker drifts away (this is normal), just point retrograde and cut your speed to 0.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your distance is below 500m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you want to approach your target and dock with RCS only. This is how you do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- With your two ships stationary to each other, switch to your target ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Point it in a particular direction (Normal/antinormal or \u0022North/South\u0022 is often suggested, but not mandatory). Switch on ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- Switch to your docking vehicle, point it so that the docking port is in the opposite direction. Switch on ASAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- Switch on RCS, let the ASAS handle the WASD keys and concentrate on translating with the IJKLHN keys. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- Watch your navball as you align with the target. When both ships are pointing towards each other, the pink marker should be in the middle of your navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6- When everything is lined up, you can thrust towards the target with H. Don\u0027t go too fast, and try to keep the yellow prograde marker and the pink marker in the middle of your navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-08T09:01:41Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2013 09:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-08T14:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nibb31\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nibb31\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Epink \u003C/strong\u003Emarkers indicate the direction of your target.

Pick one of the pairs of intersect markers (orange or purple). Burn prograde slowly, you should find that the intersect markers begin to move towards one another. Continue to burn until they match up by eye. Then use rcs/ careful burns to fine tune until the target separation is as low as you can get it. If you practice a lot you can regularly make it 0.0km, the perfect intercept. You may want to turn retrograde at this point.
