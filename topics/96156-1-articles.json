So I\u0027m posting here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis appears to be occurring since I\u0027ve installed version .90. I\u0027m pretty new to the game, and played just once on v.90 before I tried installing my first mod ever. I don\u0027t know if this problem occured before the mod installation or not. But my mod installation crashed the game, so I got rid of it, THEN I noticed this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then, as I mentioned, I\u0027ve completely uninstalled from Steam, and manually deleted my KSP folder. Then I reinstalled from Steam, yet the problem persists.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially when I am building a craft and I click the save button, it appears that nothing happens. No dialogue comes up or anything. Also, if I click the load button nothing happens. Again no dialogue. I can launch no problems, rename the craft just fine, and the \u0022new\u0022 button successfully gets rid of my current craft and starts over new. Any ideas out there as to why the save and load buttons aren\u0027t working? It also seems if I return to the space center, and then come BACK to building a craft, about 50% of the time the craft I left is still there, and the other 50% it\u0027s simply disappeared. Needless to say, kinda frustrating! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any help you can offer!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T01:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is normally no dialog upon Saving a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, for Loading a craft, if the dialog fails to appear, it\u0027s likely you have a corrupted craft file, or (possibly) the \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/span\u003E or \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/span\u003E folders are missing from your save.
