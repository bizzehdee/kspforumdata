It can be left on the hooks/magnets and then adjusts to a sub orbital trajectory before ejecting the debris and reboosts itself. 3 LV-N engines provide the main maneuvering power while a Lv-45 is available for when larger TWR is needed for say....Reenacting Fee\u0027s nicotine deprived heroics. The Toybox has quite a job ahead of it, but for now I\u0027m going to be taking apart a copy in the VAB to determine all the mods needed before posting the craft file. A quick assessment is MechJeb, B9 Aerospace, The latest version of Kerbal Attachment System, Empty Tanks, and KSPX. I should have wrote it down as I was building, but i was on a roll.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T01:54:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MaddPhish\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MaddPhish\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...Reenacting Fee\u0027s nicotine deprived heroics.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022If I die before I smoke...

I only fly with the 4 small tanks full as the LV-N\u0027s barely sip on them. The LV-45 feeding only from the FL-400 was a happy accident. It rations fuel to it for me so I don\u0027t accidentally gobble up a huge amount of fuel while I\u0027m keeping my eye on the Navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-15T05:24:50Z\u0022 title=\u002205/15/2013 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MaddPhish\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
