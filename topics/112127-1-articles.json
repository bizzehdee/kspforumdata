[v0.06.1 2016.12.31 - big hellfire]","CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:54:18Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T04:54:18Z","Content":"![ZsLS8sxh.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZsLS8sxh.png)\n\ncloses the Life Support Cycle with four part types:\n\n- Solid and liquid waste is reduced to a Sterile Organic Slurry by a Super Critical Water Oxidation Unit.\n- Sterile Organic Slurry is fed to an algae based micro-biome, cultured in arrays of water filled polymer channels exposed to the sun - producing Oxygen, Food, and Water. It\u0027s a flat-pack greenhouse.\n- Electric powered bioreactors can operate where the sun don\u0027t shine enough.\n- Soylent Starter provides essential micro-nutrients and \u0022spores\u0022 to stop the micro-biome death spiraling\n\n*Soylent* can be used stand alone as \u0027cosmetic\u0027 parts, or functioning with TAC Life Support.\n\nThe part size, mass, volume, and power demands try to be \u0027fairly realistic\u0027. Quantity/volume of algae required is worked out on the basis of what is required for a \u0027man day\u0027 but not adjusted down to Kerbal size. The assumptions are based on continuous sunlight so if the craft will be experiencing periodic darkness you should scale up the number of Soylent arrays correspondingly. The Super Critical Water Oxidation is exothermic, it\u0027s basically a controlled liquid phase fire, so it has modest power demands for pumping and \u0027ignition\u0027.\n\nThis system builds on the work of Evgenii Shepelev who in 1961 sealed himself in an iron casket with 8 gallons of green algae. Two kinds of Algae Array are provided; one reflecting optimistic assumptions, and the other mid range assumptions:\n\n- Solent Red reflects optimistic thinking on algal yield, purely by serendipity this worked out at one small solar array to support a Kerbal! or 11 Kerbals per Gigantor.\n- Soylent Green reflects more conservative thinking on algal yield, somewhere between best and worst case a Gigantor sized array will support a Kerbal.\n\n**TAC Life Support interoperation**\n\nIf **TACLS** is present the parts will inter-operate to \u0027close the loop\u0027. The resource conversions for \u0027a man\u0027 worth of algae are set to match TAC consumption and production rates. The parts will \u0027catch up\u0027 after being un-focused, for example flying other vehicles or warping in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. You need to ensure sufficient buffer resources since the TAC catch up is not perfect. I found the catch up lagged by up to four days, but YMMV, insufficient buffer will kill the crew. KSP doesn\u0027t really handle high warp electricity generation correctly so you need a battery buffer to max warp.\n\n**\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support interoperation**\n\nIf **\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS** is present the parts will inter-operate to \u0027close the loop\u0027.

Soylent uses the native \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E resource converters and acts like native \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0027greenhouses\u0027, it still requires Soylent Starter.\n\nThe Super Critical Water Oxidation Unit adds a \u0027sprinkle\u0027 of Soylent Starter (essential micro nutrients etc) to the Sterile Organic Slurry it produces. It\u0027s a **tweakable** resource, one part Soylent Starter will support the production of 1000 parts Food.\n\n**News**\n\n17 Jul 2015 **mmmm - bacon**\n\nNew algae strain - high protein, more nutritious than kale, tastes like **bacon!**\n\n![dulse_langdon_003sw.jpg?itok=ycld0u27](https://today.oregonstate.edu/sites/today.oregonstate.edu/files/styles/1200x564/public/dulse_langdon_003sw.jpg?itok=ycld0u27)\n\n[http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/jul/osu-researchers-discover-unicorn-%E2%80%93-seaweed-tastes-bacon](http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/jul/osu-researchers-discover-unicorn-%E2%80%93-seaweed-tastes-bacon)\n\n7 Oct 2015 **NASA loves Algae**\n\nNASA just announced the winners of a challenge they ran [http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/na...independence-0](http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-winners-for-mars-challenge-on-achieving-earth-independence-0)\n\nIt was a three way win, one was: Pierre Blosse, from Urbandale, Iowa, for his entry: Starch from the Micro-Algae Chlorella as the Main Food Source for a Self-Sustaining Martian Colony.\n\nGo Algae!!\n\n12 Oct 2015 **Soylent has been Modded**\n\n[westamastaflash](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/113600-westamastaflash) has kindly put together .cfgs for a TweakScalable Gigantor Green (2x = 4 Kerbals, 3x = 9 Kerbals LS) and a Large Processor Unit to handle the waste of up to 9 Kerbals (based on the Hitchhiker)\n\n[https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1731C32CC90F1274!649\u0026authkey=!AL-1jKhqnuczTbU\u0026ithint=folder%2ccfg](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1731C32CC90F1274!649\u0026authkey=!AL-1jKhqnuczTbU\u0026ithint=folder%2Ccfg)\n\nDec 15 2015 **NASA\u0027s Water Walls**  \n\nNASA is funding research into using the water that is supporting an algae based life support system for radiation shielding [link](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/112127-12\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2343174).\n\nOct 19 2016 **re-invent agriculture with microbes**  \n\nLisa Dyson wants to re-invent agriculture on earth, kicked off by mid 1960s NASA research into using microbes for closed cycle life support - [a TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/lisa_dyson_a_forgotten_space_age_technology_could_change_how_we_grow_food)\n\n**It\u0027s a joke right? I like realism, how seriously should I take this?**\n\nAlthough it\u0027s named for the fictional Soylent, the functionality is intended to be \u0027near future\u0027.\n\nI read that a company was starting to produce high protein food pellets for farmed Salmon from processed methane eating bacteria, at under USD 2.00 / kg ([*Methylococcus capsulatus*](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21649441-feeding-farmed-salmon-protein-made-methane-gas-guzzlers)). Naturally I thought - methane, Mars \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, food for Mars Astronauts!\n\nTurns out people have been thinking about microbe based life support for a long time. Early experiments in the 1960\u0027s, NASA reports from the 1980s ([84](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19850008160.pdf), [88](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890016190.pdf) ) (including \u0027why not genetic engineering\u0027), a large ongoing ESA research project [MELiSSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MELiSSA)). These are all proposing some mixed system of algae, bacteria, plankton, etc.\n\nWho knows how close it is, but it seems like there are some compelling reasons to think it will pan out:\n\n- Earth\u0027s life support system has microbes as huge and critical component.\n- The lower down the food chain you eat the more efficient it is, and you cannot get any lower than microbes. Even if you don\u0027t stay right at the bottom it seems like a good place to start.\n- Greenhouses are fiddly, labor intensive, take a lot of space/mass, and don\u0027t play well with others (for example their equilibrium humidity is higher than humans and electronics like - not a killer but has to be managed).\n- We can manipulate microbe bio-mass by pumping water around, since it\u0027s all industrial and mechanical it can be automated and run remotely.\n\nOn the downside no one has got far enough with the production aspect to start worrying about the palatability aspect - but since people basically like fatty, sweet, and salty you can imagine a super centrifuging thermo mix machine that spits out various blends and textures of pellets, bars, and pastes.\n\n![2001_tablet-640x349-625x340.png](https://web.archive.org/web/20151129000806if_/http://cdn3.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2001_tablet-640x349-625x340.png)\n\nSo Algae? not really, but Microbes surely.\n\n**Light, Distance, \u0026 Yield**\n\nThe Soylent Algal Arrays use sunlight, the intensity falls off as the inverse square of the distance. Using Kerbin as 100% you get light intensity as % of Kerbin normal:\n\n- 38.98 % @ Duna\n- 08.46 % @ Dres\n- 04.00% @ Jool\n- 01.40% @ Eeloo\n\nThe photic zone on Earth goes down to 1% of surface intensity, below that intensity photosynthesis will not operate. But it looks pretty grim, at Jool you need 25 times the collection area to get as many photons as at Kerbin.\n\nIt turns out photosynthetic efficiency is linear with light intensity up to 10% of earth surface normal, after that it\u0027s \u0027saturated\u0027 and the extra light is not useful. So yield will ramp up from 0% to 100% as light goes from 1% to 10% of Earth surface normal. This gives the yield as a % of Kerbin normal:\n\n- 100% @ Duna\n- 86% @ Dres\n- 1/3 @ Jool\n- 4% @ Eeloo\n\nSo for Jool missions you should triple the \u0027nominal\u0027 Algal Array requirements. If you are on a surface with night and day, or in low orbit experiencing periods of darkness you should scale up accordingly. If you will be spending a fairly short time at each end of a trip with periodic darkness then you can just make sure you are a little over break even production and use your life support supply buffer to \u0027tide you over\u0027, usually there is plenty of time to catch up during transit - just make sure your waste buffer is large enough.\n\nIf you are playing in Real Solar System the yields work out as:\n\n- 100% @ Mars\n- 100% @ most of the asteroids\n- 38% @ Jupiter\n- 0% at Saturn - it\u0027s sitting right round 1% light intensity\n\nI\u0027d originally intended to have the arrays produce \u0027photons\u0027 for the Algae, however KSPs seemed to bork it under high warp and in any case does not model solar arrays for un-focused craft. Until I resolve this somehow, I have eliminated the photon dependency - just pretend it\u0027s there.\n\n**Requires**\n\nModule Manager\n\n**Spacedoc:** [mod/355/Soylent](http://spacedock.info/mod/355/Soylent)\n\nChange Log:\n\nv 0.2 - add a radial attach container for Soylent Starter for large and / or very long term missions.

I was running on the default minimum value with one Oxidation unit on a station with 9 kerbals. If I had put multiple units with the max value of 10, I\u0027d probably have plenty of starter for some time. Still, it might be useful to have a slow generation of starter, perhaps tied to a science lab and maybe another science experiment (Goo, perhaps?) that combines byproducts to form trace amounts of the starter over time. This, at least, would give it some degree of plausibility rather than have it just be a magic button. \n\nI am using it in career, but I had most of the tree unlocked before adding the mod. For this career, I\u0027ve been using returnable probes for deep space experiments, so life support hasn\u0027t been a huge necessity until late in the game. My stations, up until installing the mod, have been in low kerbin and munar orbits, and have been refilled once a kerbal year with cargo runs. Soylent is what allowed me to do my first manned Duna expedition and orbital outpost without lugging a supertanker\u0027s worth of LS supplies, and I can definitely appreciate the desire to keep part bloat down. Previously, I\u0027ve had to send out LS barges ahead of the mission to refill on arrival in order to keep the expedition vessel manageable, but Soylent allows me to keep it all on board for the round trip."},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:07:56Z","Content":"YES, THIS IS WHAT i WANT!"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T21:46:15Z","Content":"I\u0027d been thinking it would take significant science equipment to make Starter.

Am I missing an input?\n\nSterile Organic Slurry needs only Waste Water, Waste, \u0026 electricity - so it sounds like you are not missing an input. Is it all producing O2, H2O, \u0026 food okay? Are the wastes building, or just \u0027steady but higher than I thought they\u0027d be\u0027?\n\nThe production is like a pipeline, if you algae array consumption of slurry outpaces the oxidiser unit\u0027s output you\u0027d never see much slurry. You could try shutting down your arrays and warping a little to see if slurry builds up. I usually add an extra algae array and oxidiser unit so I can control which part of the pipeline dominates, this lets me \u0027catch up\u0027 after I\u0027ve spent some days with the arrays folded while escaping an SOI / capturing at a planet.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Small question, because it remains unclear for me : what are the differences between the Soylent Green and Red?\n\u003E If there are no difference ingame, I could suggest that the differences between green and red algea will result in a trade-off between photosynthetic efficiency and time needed to convert the waste in usable resource.\n\nRed represents a system based on an optimistic view of micro-biome productivity; X liters of micro-biome to \u0027close the cycle\u0027. Green represents a system based on more conservative view; about 10X liters of micro-biome required. Both Red and Green then use their required liters of micro-biome to drive the mass for water and structure to support it in the arrays.\n\nI pulled the optimistic/realistic from various sources and I think the reasons underlying them are pretty much what you say plus differing opinions about how much of the resulting bio-mass is \u0027usable\u0027 as food. Apparently various kinds of algae have constituent parts that \u0027have undesirable effects on the digestive system\u0027, and tend to make more protein \u0026 fats than we\u0027d want in a diet.\n\nThe idea is you just pick the one that suits your appetite for \u0027technical optimism\u0027, sort of an easy-mode / hard-mode choice."},{"CreatedByName":"Errol","CreatedById":118622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T23:44:51Z","Content":"Any chance this will support the USI LS mod in the future?"}]}
