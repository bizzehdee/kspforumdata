Other than that, this tank is durable from all aspects, with some new paneling armor for specialized applications.\n\n![XjlDfHj.png](http://i.imgur.com/XjlDfHj.png)\n\n![w8tJsPD.png](http://i.imgur.com/w8tJsPD.png)\n\n![0bCNbuC.png](http://i.imgur.com/0bCNbuC.png)\n\n![9jQb73h.png](http://i.imgur.com/9jQb73h.png)\n\n![licrvKh.png](http://i.imgur.com/licrvKh.png)\n\n![vzANKd1.png](http://i.imgur.com/vzANKd1.png)\n\n![0dPcmEz.png](http://i.imgur.com/0dPcmEz.png)\n\n![Id8UiUs.png](http://i.imgur.com/Id8UiUs.png)\n\n![UjpHXbf.png](http://i.imgur.com/UjpHXbf.png)\n\n![W2Fki4a.png](http://i.imgur.com/W2Fki4a.png)\n\n![ox5btmN.png](http://i.imgur.com/ox5btmN.png)\n\n![qDfs9Dx.png](http://i.imgur.com/qDfs9Dx.png)\n\nA picture of our initial prototype.

I really think your turret is too long in relation to the body. The rear of the tank is also missing the classic German \\_7 slope.\n\nI purposely made the turret longer than the standard leopard to accommodate the carrying rack in the rear, along with the added electronic stability.\n\nAlso, the 7-slope is more likely to jam the turret. That\u0027s why I went with the linear surface.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-30T15:09:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/30/2015 03:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by andrew123**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T12:34:48Z","Content":"Nice replica, not too detailed but still good-looking and functional!
