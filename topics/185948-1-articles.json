I can spawn in an escape trajectory out of, say, Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, by spawning in a solar orbit in a position that happens to be inside Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E at the time, but that doesn\u0027t work for the Sun because it doesn\u0027t have a parent body. It seems to be impossible but maybe I\u0027m missing something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
