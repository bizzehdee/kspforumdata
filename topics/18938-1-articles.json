I\u0027m a huge spacecraft junkie and I\u0027m a little way too addicted to Orbiter Spaceflight Simulator. When I heard of Kerbal Space Program, I was immediately in love. One issue I had always had with Orbiter (probably the only issue) was that I couldn\u0027t make my own spacecraft unless I wanted to get myself neck deep in .cfg files and complicated models (which is fine, but I\u0027m a bit lazy and someone can do it better), so when I saw the ship creation system in Kerbal, I was extremely happy. In Orbiter, you will find me piloting delta gliders and old-fashioned stage rockets (usually historical) to exotic destinations in space. But in Kerbal, I can create my own space race, my own timeline, which I\u0027m really enjoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAside from Spaceflight Simulators, I really enjoy Anime and Manga, and play several other video games. I also play music, particularly I\u0027m a bassist in a band and I sing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as Kerbal goes, I design many different spacecraft. I\u0027m always trying to design new spacecraft (alot of them crazy, I\u0027m a mad scientist you see), and I like to fly interesting scenarios and plan elaborate space missions. I almost started to design a mission insignia when I realized \u0022okay, I\u0027m going a BIT too far\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, that\u0027s me, so, yeah, hello.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T17:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Dan Yeomans, welcome to the KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you\u0027ll fit right in here, there are many people who came to KSP from Orbiter, in fact the lead developer at Squad, Felipe Falanghe, loves Orbiter as well, and credits the Orbiter community in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-09T17:57:12Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2012 05:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by sal_vager\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yeomans","CreatedById":46569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-09T18:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Dan Yeomans, welcome to the KSP community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure you\u0027ll fit right in here, there are many people who came to KSP from Orbiter, in fact the lead developer at Squad, Felipe Falanghe, loves Orbiter as well, and credits the Orbiter community in KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s awesome!
