If there are other ones they should not be visible from space but have an option to toggle them possibly as a cheat from space... Although that may not be neccesary. Certains one visible that should be would be good because it would make it obvious that there is stuff to find and it is spread out. Say the pyramids near the equater. Those should be viewable and get people to go visit them. A few others should exist to show there are things to find and get people to naturally explor kergin more. Having everything hidden from orbit makes it kind of pointless to have surface features as the game stands. Just making a few small changes to visibility of a few objects(those that should have it.) would drastically change how people play KSP and how much they would explore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr does one of the settings make this happen now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-22T06:27:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s possible to\u00A0zoom in on them.
