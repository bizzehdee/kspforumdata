You take a soil sample, put it into an airtight container with some atmosphere, and then test for changes in its composition. That will tell you with a good amount of certainty if there\u0027s any kind of organic synthesis going on (such as breathing). But even then, you\u0027ve got to repeat that experiment many times before anyone will believe it, because a lot of bad things can happen to a probe before it gets where it needs to in order to conduct those tests. The Viking tests yielded positive results for the presence of microorganisms. The trouble is, some of the tests yielded positive results even AFTER the chamber had been baked to an insanely high temperature that should\u0027ve been enough to kill anything.
