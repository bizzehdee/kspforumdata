We\u0027ve done a number of updates to how DustFX functions, but I don\u0027t believe the repulsor version of the module has been updated to match. We need to either update that module to match the changes to the rest of the dust system, or finally merge the two back into a single module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for 1.9 not feeling much different... it really isn\u0027t a whole lot different other than DustFX and our global configuration system.

I have a reliable way to produce non-mipped DDS files from the originals so you don\u0027t get the blurry effect when you have half-sized textures enabled in the KSP settings. I would probably keep the rover body texture/normal mipped since it\u0027s so freakishly huge though. I also noticed a few of the normal maps do not match the diffuse for the track surfaces and have been using Gimp to re-map them based on the geometry of the diffuse texture. Unfortunately the conversion to DDS, which includes a vertical flip, seems to eliminate some of the details so I tend to leave them in PNG format. Still fiddling with using a manual conversion to DDS to keep the details fresh. Either way, I can try to update github with the textures converted over if you\u0027re open to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T17:24:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 05:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T19:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlways specifying the class name when logging stuff to the log files bugged me.
