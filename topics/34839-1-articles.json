Interestingly, the longest one was to send a probe into the sun. Due to spin issues on the rocket used for such missions, I used Kerbal\u0027s orientation to determine when to launch straight up to escape velocity, dawn launch for the Voyager mission, evening launch for the solar mission, then planned the final burn to achieve those objectives. Four stage launcher using onion asparagus setup to fuel second stage just reaches escape velocity at second stage burnout. Third stage achieved Voyager objective with 1/3 fuel expended and nearly all fuel for solar encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA heavy nuclear engine is not required for either mission. One should consider it\u0027s weight when launching one to escape velocity compared to the lower efficiency of a much lighter engine of comparable power.
