I don\u0027t think it\u0027s on the extreme out there with the exotic stuff like the FTL drive stuff or anti-matter power plants etc. I do think it should be considered to be at the top end of \u0022interplanetary rocketry\u0022 or whatever it\u0027s called. I haven\u0027t yet played or seen enough career mode to know the exact terms. I did start a career mode game. And I really should get back to that and do some more science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think all the Eagle parts even have to show up at the exact same time in the tree. The Command Pod could actually appear much sooner than anything else. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, let me \u0022thumbnail sketch\u0022 out what I think is a logical progression. Where these parts exactly show up in the overall tree I still don\u0027t know. But simply related to each other, I see the progression like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Command Pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Landing Gear Pods\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Main truss Body\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- VTOL engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Main Engines\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome of those might appear in the tree almost simultaneously. I see the main body and the landing gear pods as a set. The command pod, though advanced, isn\u0027t really anything special (unless Devo wants to make it more like the version in the show, with inherent RCS thrusters and full \u0022escape pod\u0022 functionality) though it still should be considered more advanced than most other pods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the VTOL and Main engines that should really finish out the Eagle in the tech tree. They\u0027re supposed to be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eextremely\u003C/span\u003E compact nuclear engines/rockets. It\u0027s not so much that such tech wouldn\u0027t already exist. It\u0027s packing it all into such a small area - the miniaturization - that would put those engines so high on the tech tree.

(Needs to be re-sized to 1.0 in case you\u0027re curious)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I did something similar to what I did before with the rover experiments - I added the lights (B9 lights this time - they look awesome.) With internal fuel tanks, a robust undercarriage with rover wheels, landing struts to deploy once I found a level spot to park it, a generator and batteries for electricity etc. And since the Eagle VTOL engines work now without needing any special hookups or to be attached directly to an Eagle truss - I put a lot of engines underneath for lifting it to Kerbin Orbit and then to the Mun. And strutted the thing with B9 struts to hold it all together and clipped into the main launchpad part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I really overbuilt the damn thing WAY too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not going to bother with a craft file for now - partly because of the Kerbtown issue making the thing unnecessary in the first place. Partly because it\u0027s a monster at nearly 200 parts that reduces framerate to annoying levels. And partly because... well that\u0027s getting ahead of myself. More later. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now though. I got the thing out onto the runway, confirmed that it drove around alright, then decided to lift off.
