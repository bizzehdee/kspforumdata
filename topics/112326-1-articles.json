I also didn\u0027t want to hijack the other guys thread. So allow me to explain the situation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLinux Mint 64bit\n\nKerbal Space Program 64bit\n\ni5 @ 4.2ghz | 680gtx | 16gb RAM\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCase #1:\n\nNvidia Control Panel Anti-Aliasing: ON\\*\n\nKerbal Space Program in-program Anti-Aliasing: OFF\n\n\\* = AA enabled by profile below:\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/b1gAnll.png](http://i.imgur.com/b1gAnll.png)\n\n[http://imgur.com/9nWHiBf](http://imgur.com/9nWHiBf)\n\n[http://imgur.com/yPLyx3n](http://imgur.com/yPLyx3n)\n\nResult of Case #1: [http://i.imgur.com/wrRAphr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/wrRAphr.jpg)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCase #2:\n\nNvidia Control Panel Anti-Aliasing: OFF \u002B Untouched\n\nKerbal Space Program in-program Anti-Aliasing: ON, all settings to their highest in-game value\n\nResult of Case #2: [http://i.imgur.com/nl69qJH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nl69qJH.jpg)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem: \n\nCase #2 looks a lot better than Case #1. The issue is that it is supposed to be the other way around. Case #1 should look much better than #2 because #2 is not even supposed to work in the first place!\n\nCan anybody point out what I did wrong? Thank you so much in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T00:07:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 12:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"0Kev","CreatedById":69511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T05:53:44Z","Content":"Hey it\u0027s me, the \u0027other guy\u0027.\n\nSomehow you definitely have AA (or something doing a similar job!) working in Case 2.

My eyes aren\u0027t the best and I needed the UI to be bigger so I compromised on the 1080p. I\u0027ve noticed resolution doesn\u0027t make a tremendous amount of difference.\n\nThe profile was deleted in case 2, yes.\n\nRight now I am playing with ingame AA enabled plus the profile setting. It looks pretty decent. Even if my settings aren\u0027t doing anything or technically shouldn\u0027t work lol\n\n![R0dGrpn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/R0dGrpn.jpg)\n\nThe only negative I\u0027ve noticed is a drop in FPS... which I suppose means AA is working.
