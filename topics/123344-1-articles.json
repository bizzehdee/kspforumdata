The game engine is a platform that the game is built upon so the KSP developers don\u0027t have to re-invent common tasks. Specifically it currently use Unity 4 which does not have multicore support. Version 1.1 is coming down the road sometime from now which will include a port to the Unity 5 engine. Unity 5 does support multi-core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the short answer is no, not yet, but soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T21:41:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo Unity 5 has multi-core support?
