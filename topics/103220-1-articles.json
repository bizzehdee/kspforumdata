I\u0027ve come up with a fairly reliable single-stage heavy lifter to get the sections into orbit, with a spot of fuel left to de-orbit it when it\u0027s served its purpose. Here are the stats:\n\nVessel Mass (Full) - 347.6t\n\nSurface TWR - 1.61\n\nStage Dv - 5182m/s Atmospheric / 6432m/s Vacuum\n\nLaunching to a 75km orbit,, with zero payload (did a test-flight for starters), I\u0027m left with a Dv surplus of 1833m/s. I\u0027m not sure how relevant that would be to my question, but there it is.\n\nMy question is: Is there any way I can calculate the maximum practical payload that can be lifted, based on the capabilities of the lifting craft? So, for example, with the aforementioned design, how can I calculate that it would boost a maximum of (for example) 20t into a 75km orbit?\n\nPlease note that when it comes to mathematical equations, I\u0027m a smidge above the neanderthal level of understanding rocket science. I grasp the basic tenets, but I\u0027ve yet to work with Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation (or any of a thousand others for that matter) on any of my designs ![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif).

Go introduce yourself to it, get to know it, learn it, love it. \n\nIf you\u0027re starting with a basic launcher, run your current design though the rocket equation (stage by stage) and find out what it\u0027s capable of with zero payload.\n\nYou already know what excess dV you have, so you can recalculate the Rocket Equation the same way with larger and larger payloads until the dV answer you get is reduced by that surplus you\u0027re getting.\n\nWith atmospheric ascents, the calculations are very rough estimated, because a lot of gravity and atmospheric drag losses are highly variable depending on design and flight profile. \n\nMy preferred method for lifters however, is to plan on a specific payload from the beginning. That is, if I want a lifter that can put 20 tons into orbit, I add 20 tons of dry mass to the equation before I even start building the first stage! And then build up the lifter from there to have the required dV with the payload already accounted for...saves lots of tears and heartache. \n\nAnything and everything pretty much that you could want to know about the Rocket Equation and other topics, check out the [Drawing Board](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/28352-The-Drawing-Board-A-library-of-tutorials-and-other-useful-information) in the tutorials section."},{"CreatedByName":"Th3F3aR","CreatedById":124827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T11:38:32Z","Content":"You could do this with the following equation (?Rocket equation?) :\n\ndV = Ve \\* LN((Mf\u002BP)/(Md\u002BP))\n\ndV = you know that already ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nVe = basically Isp but with the g0 in it (Isp\\*g0)\n\nLN = Logarithm n \n\nMf = Mass full (without payload)\n\nMd = Mass dry (without payload)\n\nP = Payload\n\nThere you go, do this equation for every stage and sum it up to get your output dv and you see if you got enough power to lift it up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEDIT: Important, also watch your TWR on adding a payload, it could happen you get a good dv and a TWR less than 1, so check that always ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T11:43:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 11:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Th3F3aR**"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T13:22:47Z","Content":"If you\u0027re not interested in calculating a potential payload mass, you could install KER or Mechjeb for a delta-V and TWR readout in the VAB, and then you need to look for a mod called NRAP.

You simply stick that on the top of your booster and then increase the mass in whatever increments you want until either the TWR goes below 1.2 (generally considered the lowest \u0022safe\u0022 TWR for a successful launch) or the delta-V goes below 4500; whatever the mass of the NRAP payload is at that time is what your booster can handle.\n\nAlternatively, you could just load some fuel tanks on top of the booster and go with that measure. That\u0027s a more \u0022stock\u0022 way of figuring it out.\n\nEDIT: To answer your question mathematically, I\u0027d need to know more about the characteristics of the booster itself - big one there is how many stages it has and the TWR of each stage, but the types of fuel tanks happen to be important in this case (the really big tanks have a wet-to-dry ratio of 8.2, while the FL-T100 through the Jumbo 64 have a wet-to-dry ratio of 9). \n\nI suppose I could guess at your booster configuration by what information you\u0027ve given us. Lessee...347.6 tonnes with 1.6 TWR, and 5182 atmospheric. You\u0027ve got 5450 kN of thrust (simply based on the general T = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/mg TWR equation, where T is the TWR and FF\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is the thrust force of the engines, thus F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E = Tmg = 1.6 \\* 9.8 \\* 347.6 = 5450.368). Assuming a single stage at that thrust level and solving the same equation for mass (m = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/Tg) , you hit a 1.2 TWR at 463.47 tonnes. So your payload limit based on TWR would be 115.87 tonnes (463.47 - 347.6 = 115.87). I very much doubt that TWR is your limiting factor.\n\nNow, there\u0027s no single engine that produces that much thrust on its own. I\u0027ma guessing you\u0027ve got a cluster of engines - and I\u0027d need to know which specific ones so I could tell what your Isp is; that\u0027s a bit of data I\u0027d need to tell you the delta-V limit. So I guess I\u0027d need to know both the fuel tank and engine configuration. But what I would do is work Tsiolkovsky *backwards*, setting the delta-V to 4500 (of course if it\u0027s a multi-stage rocket, it\u0027ll be a might hairier, but not as bad as you might think).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T13:37:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 01:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grotoiler","CreatedById":110434,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T14:16:47Z","Content":"Thanks for the replies everyone!\n\nI\u0027m at work right now, but i\u0027ve started plugging away at figuring out Tsiolkovsky\u0027s rocket equation....

In reality, you\u0027ll have a smidge more delta-V than what I calculate here - just that disclaimer before I get started.\n\nOkay - so the core stage is 2x Kerbodyne S3-14400 tanks stacked and a 1x Kerbodyne KR-2L Advanced engine. That\u0027s 82\u002B82\u002B6.5 = 170.5 tonnes full and 10\u002B10\u002B6.5 = 26.5 tonnes empty with a 280 Isp and 2500 kN thrust. That stage has 5,108 delta-V by itself (?) with a TWR of 1.496. The outboard \u0022booster stage\u0022 adds two Mainsails, which have a different Isp - you do the math there (divide the Thrust by Isp for each engine and tally that up, then divide the total thrust by the result) and the effective stage Isp is 300.4878. Then you\u0027ve got - 4x Rockomax Jumbo-64 Tanks (2 per side), 2x Rockomax X200-16 Tanks (1 per side) and 2x Mainsails.

Total delta-V would be 6,701.95 m/s...\n\nFrom that math, I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re not running fuel lines from your outboard units to the core and that you\u0027re running both stages concurrently. You\u0027d get FAR better performance from the booster if you ran the fuel lines; at this point the outboard units aren\u0027t contributing all that much to your overall delta-V.\n\nOkay then. So things are even trickier than I thought - I\u0027ll need to calculate about how far into the flight it is when the Mainsails run out of gas and are cut loose, and then figure out what the mass of the core unit is at that point. \n\nSo let\u0027s see...Mainsails have a fuel flow rate in atmo of 0.4778 t/s. You\u0027ve got two, so their fuel flow is .9576 t/s. You\u0027ve got 144 tonnes of fuel in the core, so you\u0027ll be empty after 150.376 seconds (two and a half minutes into the flight, sound right?)\n\nA KR-2L has a fuel flow rate of 0.7037 t/s in atmosphere - so after 150.376 seconds it has burned through 105.8195 tonnes of fuel. Thus at that point in the launch the core has a mass of 64.6805 tonnes. \n\nAll this assumes that there is NO payload on the craft whatsoever.

We have a stage that\u0027s 170.5 tonnes full and 26.5 tonnes empty, with 2500 kN of thrust and an Isp of 280. We\u0027re attempting to figure out how much is the maximum payload this rocket can lift to orbit.\n\nSo, two possible limiting factors there - thrust and delta-V. We can solve the thrust factor using the same formula I was using earlier (T = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/mg) solving for mass and assuming a TWR of 1.2 (again, the generally accepted minimum figure). That gives us m = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/Tg = 2500 / (1.2 \\* 9.82) = 212.152 tonnes. Since we know the booster is 170.5 tonnes full, the maximum payload is the difference: 212.15 - 170.5 = **41.65 tonnes**.\n\nNow to see about delta-V. For this, we\u0027ll add a payload mass to both the mass factors of Tsiolkovsky (which we\u0027ll call P), and set the target delta-V to 4500. So we have the following:\n\ndV= ln(M/Md)\\*9.82\\*Isp = ln((170.5\u002BP)/(26.5\u002BP)) \\* 9.82 \\* 280 = 4500\n\nln((170.5\u002BP)/(26.5\u002BP)) = 4500 / (9.82 \\* 280) = 1.636602\n\n(170.5\u002BP)/(26.5\u002BP) = e^1.636602^ = 5.13768\n\n170.5\u002BP = 5.13768(26.5\u002BP)\n\n170.5\u002BP = 136.14852 \u002B 5.13768P\n\n170.5 - 136.14852 = 5.13768P - P = (5.13768-1)P\n\n4.13768P = 34.35148\n\nP = **8.3021**, the maximum allowable payload due to delta-V limitation.\n\nSo the limiting factor of the booster\u0027s effectiveness is **delta-V**. \n\nWe can confirm this by adding the two indicated limiting factor masses to the mass and dry mass of the booster and calculating delta-V:\n\ndV= ln(M/Md)\\*9.82\\*Isp\n\ndV= ln((170.5\u002B8.302)/((26.5\u002B8.302))\\*9.82\\*280 = ln(178.802/34.802) \\* 9.82 \\* 280 = 4500.007\n\ndV= ln((170.5\u002B41.65)/((26.5\u002B41.65))\\*9.82\\*280 = ln(212.15 / 68.15) \\* 9.82 \\* 280 = 3122.397\n\nI\u0027m going to make one more pass at this just to see if the booster\u0027s performance can really be expected to be this bad; I have neglected the (negligible) delta-V contribution of the outboard engines after all.

While it\u0027s no longer a VSSTO, adding 5-20k funds of early SRBs can still be cheaper than scaling up your launch vehicle and recovering everything."},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T20:42:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When it comes to g0, is that relative to which celestial body you\u0027re taking off from? so, for example, on Kerbin it would be 9.81 (m/s), whereas on Minmus it would be 0.491m/s?\n\nNo, g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E is always 9.81 m/s^2^ (though it is my understanding that in KSP it actually works out to 9.82 m/s^2^ when back calculated).

It has nothing to do with local gravity.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFor the record, I have a few simple guidelines that I like to follow when designing a rocket that work very well.
