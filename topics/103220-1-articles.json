Lessee...347.6 tonnes with 1.6 TWR, and 5182 atmospheric. You\u0027ve got 5450 kN of thrust (simply based on the general T = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/mg TWR equation, where T is the TWR and FF\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E is the thrust force of the engines, thus F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E = Tmg = 1.6 * 9.8 * 347.6 = 5450.368). Assuming a single stage at that thrust level and solving the same equation for mass (m = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/Tg) , you hit a 1.2 TWR at 463.47 tonnes. So your payload limit based on TWR would be 115.87 tonnes (463.47 - 347.6 = 115.87). I very much doubt that TWR is your limiting factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, there\u0027s no single engine that produces that much thrust on its own.

Total delta-V would be 6,701.95 m/s...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom that math, I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re not running fuel lines from your outboard units to the core and that you\u0027re running both stages concurrently. You\u0027d get FAR better performance from the booster if you ran the fuel lines; at this point the outboard units aren\u0027t contributing all that much to your overall delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay then. So things are even trickier than I thought - I\u0027ll need to calculate about how far into the flight it is when the Mainsails run out of gas and are cut loose, and then figure out what the mass of the core unit is at that point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s see...Mainsails have a fuel flow rate in atmo of 0.4778 t/s. You\u0027ve got two, so their fuel flow is .9576 t/s. You\u0027ve got 144 tonnes of fuel in the core, so you\u0027ll be empty after 150.376 seconds (two and a half minutes into the flight, sound right?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA KR-2L has a fuel flow rate of 0.7037 t/s in atmosphere - so after 150.376 seconds it has burned through 105.8195 tonnes of fuel. Thus at that point in the launch the core has a mass of 64.6805 tonnes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this assumes that there is NO payload on the craft whatsoever. I\u0027m out of time to type at the moment - I\u0027ll try to pick this up later; maybe one of y\u0027all can check my math in the meantime and/or pick up the discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T16:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHINT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake Tsiolkovsky\u0027s Rocket Equation:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv = Isp*G*ln((M\u002BP)/M)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolve for M, given a known Dv.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know it takes 4500-ish Dv to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou also know how much propellant you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou know the Isp of your lifting engines (use the average)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG is 9.8 (m/s^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe get:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDv / Isp*g = Ln((M\u002BP)/M)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnraveling Ln is a bit of work - but the short-cut is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ee^(Dv/Isp*g) = (M\u002BP)/M\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI leave the rest for you...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T16:18:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a single-stage rocket launch vehicle:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch payload capability = ((Launch_Ratio * Mass_Dry) - Mass_Wet) / (1 - Launch_Ratio)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass_Dry and Mass_Wet are without fuel and with it, respectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch_Ratio = EXP(dV_Launch / Exhaust_Velocity)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV_Launch is the vacuum dV the vehicle needs at launch - at least 4,500m/s to get to orbit, plus probably 200m/s-400m/s to de-orbit and land - 4,900m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExhaust_Velocity = Isp * 9.82 (or 9.81, I can never remember ^^).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMainsails have an Isp of 360, giving the SSTO 40 design in Chapter 7 of \u0027Exploring The System\u0027 a theoretical maximum payload capability of 40.4t, as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExhaust_Velocity = 360 * 9.82 = 3,535.20\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EdV_Launch = 4,900\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch_Ratio = EXP(4,900 / 3,535.2) = 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass_Dry = 66.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMass_Wet = 386.3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch payload capability = ((4 * 66.3) - 386.3) / (1 - 4) = 40.4t (rounded to 1 decimal place, which I drop as \u0027margin for error\u0027 so 40t usable as far as I\u0027m concerned)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: What I call \u0027Launch_Ratio\u0027 is the same as EtherDragon ninja\u0027d me with and that\u0027s the key to reversing the rocket equation :-) EXP() is the exponential function for LibreOffice and Excel spreadsheets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T16:23:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 04:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pecan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright - since I was able to prove earlier that almost 98% of the delta-V of your stack was coming from the core, I\u0027m going to focus my efforts there. We have a stage that\u0027s 170.5 tonnes full and 26.5 tonnes empty, with 2500 kN of thrust and an Isp of 280. We\u0027re attempting to figure out how much is the maximum payload this rocket can lift to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, two possible limiting factors there - thrust and delta-V. We can solve the thrust factor using the same formula I was using earlier (T = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/mg) solving for mass and assuming a TWR of 1.2 (again, the generally accepted minimum figure). That gives us m = F\u003Csub\u003Et\u003C/sub\u003E/Tg = 2500 / (1.2 * 9.82) = 212.152 tonnes.

For this, we\u0027ll add a payload mass to both the mass factors of Tsiolkovsky (which we\u0027ll call P), and set the target delta-V to 4500.

By changing a single stage vehicle TWR from (1.2 -\u0026gt; 5) to (2-\u0026gt;1.1-\u0026gt;3 ) you can shave off a bunch of tons of engine, and a minute of ascent, allowing a leaner of a launch vehicle.
