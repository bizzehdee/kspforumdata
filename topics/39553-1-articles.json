Its very nice looking too.\u003Cp\u003EI also think the craft looks nice but you should use the smaller jet engines since you\u0027re at low altitude. In my opinion it would look better if yiid section was right side up so it was white rather than speckled black. I\u0027ll need to dl to see how it flies but slow isn\u0027t my thing so i probably wont like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: So after flying it around for a bit my only i actually like it a lot. I did swap out the engines, and if you add fuel lines between the body and engines you can more than double the crafts range. Also i would suggest moving the front wings back a bit so that the craft doesn\u0027t lose control as easily and trying to move the wheels back a bit to avoid tail strikes ripping off the entire back on liftoff. But overall I like it a lot and it has a pretty good resemblance of a passenger airliner if only it were the right colors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-28T03:12:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/28/2013 03:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Coccalime\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding more review\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimeLapseSteve","CreatedById":8170,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T18:13:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to hear. The reason why I flipped the fuselage is so that the tail is able to slope upward to provide clearance for rotation at takeoff. Until there\u0027s a stock part that looks like a normal aircraft tail, it\u0027ll have to do for now.
