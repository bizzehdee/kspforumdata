There\u0027s also the matter of my PC, which is an older Lenovo Thinkpad with Ivy Bridge I5, 8GB RAM, nVidia GT 630M (2 GB) and 128GB Crucial SSD (Upgrade). Both games run on linux, so this should be fine. For now, I think I\u0027ll get X3, because I\u0027m not sure whether my laptop can handle Elite.

Harry has pretty much nailed X3 - it\u0027s an economic sim /empire building game set in space. It\u0027s pretty but the actual spaceflight part is quite limited. All the nicely rendered planets and stuff that you see in the background - well good luck getting to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElite Dangerous on the other hand is much less of a building game. It\u0027s just you and your ship. You can purchase other ships to play in but you only get to fly one at a time. No capital ships (for you at any rate), no factories, no legions of remotely controlled trading ships and fighters. You can trade, you can mine, you can go shoot stuff, you can participate in galactic politics but - at the moment - it all happens from the cockpit of your ship. It\u0027s also a lot more hands-on than X3. The autopilot is very limited and a big part of the game to start with is just learning to fly your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027ve missed out the absolute key part of Elite - exploration. You have the entire galaxy to go and explore, you can go anywhere you like and it\u0027s all to scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a little like KSP in that there\u0027s (currently - this will be changing when the first expansion hits) not a lot to actually do once you flown to another planet, but the sheer scale of the world around you is just a joy to be in. I\u0027ve seen binary ice moons, I\u0027ve flown around hot Jupiters, I\u0027ve seen volcanic worlds that would put Mustafar to shame. I\u0027ve seen water worlds and earth-like worlds, I\u0027ve heard rumours of black holes and neutron stars. I\u0027ve flown through the rings of gas giants, watching the myriad chunks of ice and rock tumbling past me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard it\u0027s even better with the Oculus Rift. If you want a good review of Elite Dangerous, head on over to Ars Technica and search through their old articles. Their reviewer is clearly an E: D fan but he\u0027s certainly not a blind fanboi. He points out the flaws (some of which have been addressed - the review is quite old) but he also does a superb job of telling you why the game is so good despite its flaws.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-08T10:57:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2015 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
