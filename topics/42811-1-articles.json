It was a bit of a chore to get the angles right. Strangely enough all of the docking ports are actually attached too. I\u0027ve noticed the game seems to remember the last stress you put on the ports when you dock, so sometimes they don\u0027t lock perfectly aligned. If they\u0027re all at identical angles, and you dock them straight enough, you can get them all to attach. Do you have any pictures of your launch vehicle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
