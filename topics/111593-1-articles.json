I have to admit, I\u0027m a bit scared; no one\u0027s ever tried this before... well that much should be obvious, right? But what I mean is, our ship, the E3, while it might have been to the Mun and back, and to Minmus and back, something like landing on Duna is completely different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaris tells me it\u0027s fine, she\u0027s gone over all of the data from the probes we\u0027ve been shooting at Duna, and she expects it to be just like landing on Kerbin, just with fifty percent more thrusters and one-hundred percent less chance of a water landing. How I wish I shared her optimism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiphe is her usual self, bubbly and enthusiastic. She\u0027s so hopped up about the mission that I doubt she even cares about the risks involved. Just yesterday she was all smiles, crowing about how she\u0027d finally get a chance to do something, i.e. repack the \u0027chutes after we land. When I noted that we might not even land in one piece, I was booed and told that Naris knows what she\u0027s doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it is true that Naris had stuck every landing she\u0027s attempted - with one exception; the Kerbin highlands. Landing on a hill, at a steep angle, with a ship like the E3, means that the ship isn\u0027t taking off again. And last I looked at the ProbeSat images, Duna looks like nothing more than one big, slanted hillside, just waiting to topple a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m brought out of my thoughts by Naris, who tells us to buckle up. We just have time to strap ourselves in before she hits the thrusters and we start our deceleration burn. It olny lasts for a few seconds, we\u0027re not trying to park ourselves in an orbit under our own power; we\u0027re going to use an atmospheric braking maneuver. I have been assured that it\u0027s perfectly safe - unless the ship dips below about 8,000 meters. In that case it could turn into, \u0027hello hillside\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, while we descend toward Duna\u0027s atmosphere, I have work to do. I don my EVA suit, pop the hatch and head out to do some science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/98MhVSo.png\u0022 alt=\u002298MhVSo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I cling to the ships hull, I look to my right and catch my breath. I\u0027m just in time to see Ike eclipse the sun. I watch in wonder as the two orbs brush past each other, like dancers in a celestial ballroom. Slowly, the sun begins to emerge from the other side of Ike, it\u0027s glaring brightness forcing me to avert my eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI collect the data from the various experiments then head back into the capsule. Naris asks what took so long, I reply that I was interrupted by a stellar phenomenon. She shrugs and I smile inwardly; I\u0027ll tell her and Miphe later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re once again buckled into our seats as we begin our aerobrake. I half expect there to be sheets of red and orange flame licking our small lander, but I find myself happily disappointed. It seems that Duna\u0027s atmosphere just isn\u0027t thick enough to ignite our ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Fp9agHP.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Fp9agHP.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe pop the \u0027chutes and begin slowing at about 1200 meters. Naris applies the thrusters and complains once again about how she wishes she could adjust the thrust limiters on the fly. Miphe goes into her usual litany of reasons why such a thing wouldn\u0027t work, spewing technical jargon that goes way over my head. Geology, botany, zoology, and mineralogy are my fields of specialty; applied mechanics, on the other hand make my brain hurt; almost like I just wasn\u0027t born to understand how and why they work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaris is hitting the thrusters as hard as she can, cursing the engineers for having limited the ships throttle to fifty percent. Miphe asks what\u0027s wrong; Naris replies that we\u0027re coming in too fast, she miscalculated the burn and we\u0027re going to hit hard. She shouts for us to get into our EVA suits; just in case; and leans on the control stick, fighting to get us into an uptight position before we hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L22hMo9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022L22hMo9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaris wins the fight and the landing gears are pointed at the ground. She shouts; five seconds to impact. I finish zipping up my EVA suit and grab hold of the nearest support. Miphe follows my lead just as we feel a tremendous shockwave rattle the lander. Naris yells that we\u0027ve lost two landing gear, and I can hear the hiss of the RCS thrusters as they try to hold us in a more or less upright state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll three of us hold our breath. The RCS system slowly shuts off. There\u0027s a low, grumbling sound from below us, but the lander stands firm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sU03LL4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sU03LL4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe all three exit the vehicle to survey the damage. Miphe lets out a low whistle at the sight while Naris quotes Valentina: \u0022Hey, I can still fly it, so it\u0027s fine, right?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiphe and I groan in unison, then go about our chores. While I collect science, Miphe takes a look at the broken lander legs. I hear Naris ask if she can fix them; Miphe\u0027s response is cut short by the angry sizzling of a live electric system. Miphe replies in the negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne the science is collected and the \u0027chutes are repacked, we each plant a flag. Miphe sets up the automatic camera and the three of us pose for a victory shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XlVWqGC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XlVWqGC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI give the uninviting Duna landscape a final look as Naris and Miphe board the E3. \u0022So long\u0022, I say, silently, \u0022I won\u0027t be coming back.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T08:31:22Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 08:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by nipulsansei\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
