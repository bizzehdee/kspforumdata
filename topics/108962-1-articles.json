I\u0027ve seen people show off a few \u0022cars\u0022 here on the forum. I\u0027m not sure what it would take to find them. Do people still use that space port thingy? Maybe there are some cars there. I like building rovers but haven\u0027t tried in the new versions. I hope they improved the wheels!"},{"CreatedByName":"urablahblah","CreatedById":46911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:30:20Z","Content":"Woh, slow your roll there buddy. It can take up to a few hours for someone to respond to a post. \n\nI suggest looking over in The Spacecraft Exchange and browsing for a bit.

I\u0027ve found the most exciting rovers have propulsion other than just the electric wheels: I usually strap some fuel tanks and jet engines onto the rover, for that extra speed and excitement ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI usually prefer the TR-2L \u0022Ruggedized\u0022 wheels, as they can withstand the most punishment, and look cool to boot.\n\nTweakscale is INVALUABLE in my opinion, and can really add to the creativeness of your vehicle (note the LES hood ornament in one of those pics ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) )\n\nIf you haven\u0027t had any success yet, keep trying! KSP is all about learning. I\u0027ve played somewhere near 800\u002B hours, and still learn new stuff all the time!\n\nA final note: if you\u0027re looking to download completed (and functioning) vehicles, I suggest visiting the [Spacecraft Exchange sub-forum](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/20-The-Spacecraft-Exchange), where you can find all sorts of awesome stuff ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T21:42:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Slam\\_Jones**\n  \nGrammar, examples"},{"CreatedByName":"Mrherponaderpsherp","CreatedById":127438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T23:15:40Z","Content":"Can\u0027t post my buggy because it\u0027s code is too long."},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T00:37:57Z","Content":"[http://kerbalx.com/](http://kerbalx.com/)\n\nGo here and select the appropriate filter selections.\n\nrover, stock, 1.0.2, craft is a good setting to start with for cars."}]}
