Thought I\u0027d registrer and say hi. Hi!\n\nI have yet to land on anything except the Mun (and Kerbin..), but I look forward to my first interplanetary travel ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Any advice on where to head first? I get the impression that Duna is a favoritte, and that Eve should be avoided. Then again, it\u0027s probably just a matter of bringing enough juice."},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T11:15:33Z","Content":"Hello Zhartek, and welcome to the forums!\n\nDuna yes, Eve no. Duna can be reached with something just slightly more powerful than a Mun lander. Eve has twice the gravity and five times the atmospheric pressure of Kerbin at sea level rendering many engines completely inoperative there. Eve can be done, but it\u0027s definitely not a good choice for your first interplanetary destination.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:05:21Z","Content":"Welcome to the KSP Kommunity!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:26:56Z","Content":"Welcome aboard!\n\nDuna is nice and easy to reach as a first target, and was my first interplanetary target as well. I went to Dres next because it was close. Make sure to bring plenty of power with you, both electricity and engine power!"},{"CreatedByName":"Acemcbean","CreatedById":108779,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:39:05Z","Content":"Welcome aboard! By the way, I highly recommend heading to Eve with a probe. In fact, you should be sending probes to each and every planet to figure out some of the quirks with the astronomical bodies on your own! I know Duna was quite a surprise for me when I went there with the whole \u0022There isn\u0027t really an atmosphere until about 25km\u0022 thing."}]}
