I get the impression that Duna is a favoritte, and that Eve should be avoided.

Duna can be reached with something just slightly more powerful than a Mun lander. Eve has twice the gravity and five times the atmospheric pressure of Kerbin at sea level rendering many engines completely inoperative there. Eve can be done, but it\u0027s definitely not a good choice for your first interplanetary destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the KSP Kommunity!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna is nice and easy to reach as a first target, and was my first interplanetary target as well.

By the way, I highly recommend heading to Eve with a probe. In fact, you should be sending probes to each and every planet to figure out some of the quirks with the astronomical bodies on your own!
