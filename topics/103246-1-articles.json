IF you pull it off well, you can get into low orbit for less than the oft quoted 4500 m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I haven\u0027t seen your designs, I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re trying to make your vehicles appear at least within the realm of possibility. If you build a bigger rocket, you need bigger engines or more engines. You will eventually come to the limit of what you can lift without building some bonkers asparagus staged monstrosity. Being more efficient can help, to a degree, but that too has limits. Alternatively you can start looking at multiple launches and assembling your stations/ships in space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also come up with some pretty powerful lifting stages utilizing clipping as well, but there\u0027s always the risk of sudden disintegration.

Fail and Fail often is key to learning and depending on your situation you might need to play around a bit to see what works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here are the things that have worked for me. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t always need to build super massive rockets. Small does just fine too! Shooting of entire stations at once is asking for disaster. Not even the great Mir or ISS was put into orbit in one go and if you look at them, they are all modular. Which means smaller parts build the larger. Just like everything in kerbal. So with a bit of planning you can plan smaller rockets for your smaller parts and larger rockets for your heavier parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR is important, too much weight means a slow rocket and more fuel being burnt up. So keep an eye on the size of your rocket and the weight. I have a rocket I build an named it the LunaV (after saturn V) I studied the stages of the Saturn V and build loosly based. Command pod and the cargo of a lander. Each with it\u0027s own stage and weight. This then became key to when I decided to take my moon rocket and switch out the stages with other cargo. (back up a save by default to not over ride) So by play around with different cargo I got an idea of maximum weights for the intended heights and weights. Heights as in how much fuel do I need to go into orbit as opposed to the mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo just like nasa does, test flights are important to do to make sure your rocket is up to the task. Reverting also helps XD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes though you might want additional boosters, like SRB\u0027s In this case I break them off a little before or after the turn but never during. Things in motion remain in motion unless acted upon by another force. So if you don\u0027t want your booster to end up in the side of your rocket in a fireball of doom. Don\u0027t seperate at that time. having the seperatron fire at the same time the stage drops the srb if aimed right can pull it away but they only have so much power so again just be smart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, Rocket science is easy, it\u0027s the engineering that gets you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:57:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EColonies and stations in particular are quite tricky to get to orbit using stock parts without any kind of assistance. (pure stock) This is because you are dealing with very heavy payloads, and in general 1 ton on the top equates to some 10 or more tons of lifter. Big payloads therefore very quickly lead to truly massive lifters that test your desgn skills and your pc\u0027s performance. The biggest single help (to me at least) is the KER mod which gives you the data on your design without you reaching for pen/paper and calculator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these two things are particular goals of yours (stations and colonies) then you will likely need to learn how to assemble things in orbit efficiently, which means learning to rendezvous and dock. Launching any worthwhile station as a single piece is an exercise in massive rocketry, break it down into logical modules and \u0022plug\u0027n\u0027play\u0022. Same principle applies to surface bases, massive grand tour interplanetarys... I tend to stop around 100 tons. Once the payload weighs more than that it gets split so that I dont have to design a custom lifter (since i have some 100t designs saved).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can of course launch anything, you can stack together 10 thousand tons of hardware and blast it into the sky.

Kerbal Engineer Redux doesn\u0027t replace the pilot, but gives you the deltaV for each stage as you build it. which is useful. Once you build a stack with two stages you can see what changing the relative stage sizes can do with the same fuel. Or you can do the calculations by hand. It\u0027s easy to make the first stage a little too big and lose total deltaV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to consider is having a slightly too-big stage and don\u0027t quite fill the tanks.
