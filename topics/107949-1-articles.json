Nothing out of the ordinary, at least in versions prior to 1.0 this method worked flawlessly. But now, in v1.0 the Attachment nodes disappear as soon as I load the subassembly in the VAB. Than I thought, maybe I forgot a (stack)decoupler beneath the heat shield, I added that part, and saved it as a subassembly. Still, same results, no attachments nodes... Am I doing something wrong all of a sudden, or is this a problem more of you guys experience? :-)\n\nKind regards,\n\nTim"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T20:05:34Z","Content":"We\u0027ll need to see the craft, and a craft file would help as well, you can put the files on imgur and dropbox.\n\nIt\u0027s possible you did not leave an open node to allow attachment, it\u0027s easily done and a re-root with the F4 tool should solve it.\n\n(Press F4, click craft, click again to select new root part)"}]}
