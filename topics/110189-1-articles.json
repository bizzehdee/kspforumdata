It seems to allow you to time warp as regular, but if you drop out of warp too close to Jool, you will be forced to use only physics time warp until you are a long ways out from the planet. All of this when you are not actually in the atmosphere. It\u0027s very annoying."},{"CreatedByName":"Mastikator","CreatedById":135309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:04:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E For a moment I though squad had added orbital decay - until I realized my apo was rising.\n\nWait you were actually getting free energy?"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:20:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wait you were actually getting free energy?\n\nI don\u0027t think so. The situation I have is as follows:\n\n1. Coming in for an aerocapture or maybe an aerobrake to intercept a moon, I can use regular warp all the way down until I hit the atmosphere. I can even stop the warp very close to Jool, tweak my Pe a bit, and then resume warping.\n\n2. I can physics warp within the atmosphere.\n\n3. Once out of the atmosphere again, I go to zero warp to switch from physical back to normal warp. But it won\u0027t let me do regular warp, saying the ship is under acceleration. This effect lasts for a considerable distance above the top of the atmosphere. While using physics warp to get this over with quickly, I do not observe any changes in my Ap.\n\nIt appears to me that the game is confused about when you leave the atmosphere. The effects on your trajectory of being in the atmosphere go away when they\u0027re supposed to, but the game still treats you as if you\u0027re in the atmosphere for warp purposes. And I agree, it\u0027s totally annoying.\n\nEDIT: This problem is on the bug tracker already. I confirmed it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T12:30:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Geschosskopf**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T13:12:34Z","Content":"I have this too, with multiple ships. Right below 1000 km you can\u0027t toggle warp anymore.
