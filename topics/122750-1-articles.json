I LOVED that thing but subsequent updates broke it thoroughly as well as its total dependence on mods. I didn\u0027t get much further with the basic design in subsquent revisions but I finally decided to take another serious stab at it but with a twist.

A spinal SpeedPak provides additional range for flight mode or foil mode and doesn\u0027t impact speed in either. On the water, it\u0027ll hit 140 mph (~62mps) stable for ~5 minutes or a conservative 60 mph for somewhat longer. When done or when it\u0027s time to picnic it\u0027ll roll up out of the water and cruise on gear. If you find a decent upslope after that it\u0027ll also take off again and fly controllably!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you read that right, the flying hydrofoil gets punted to and dropped out of orbit.

I tried rebuilding it in single-seat mode with lighter components but it doesn\u0027t work nearly as well. Replacing the turbojets with regular jets also did great things for the range but reduced the top speed to a mere 60mph. So to heck with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
