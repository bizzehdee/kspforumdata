Shatner, Kelley, and Nimoy had the ability to lend gravitas to stories that might otherwise have not been so affecting. Additionally, the original series had good effects for its time, and was smarter about the science than a lot of the junk it was competing with.

The show broke many boundaries in it\u0027s time (things you would find ludicrous) First interracial kiss on US TV. Uhura was depicted as a highly attractive and very intelligent woman, sort of a first in US film (rightfully so, she was a looker in her day). Oh and there are hundreds of Alien species depicted in the star trek universe. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.startrek.com/database_article_navigator\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.startrek.com/database_article_navigator\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods if I\u0027m in the wrong, please delete my post.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-28T17:58:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2014 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EWe didn\u0026#039;t delete your whole post, but we did remove the personal attack.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T17:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceXray\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceXray\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill though I have to agree Doctor who has a much wider variation of aliens(weaping angles, dolphin-like creatures, Midnight(still a mystery)) unlike ST.\u003Cp\u003EI guess Star Trek just isn\u0027t for me, an overly optimist future where every single planet is terraformed is too much jibberish for me, especially all of the technobable that doesn\u0027t make sense(like some else mentioned before).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you forgot about the fiction part of science fiction?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-28T18:04:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere would have been many unusable planets in the ST universe, but they just didn\u0027t have much reason to go anything but the \u0022class M\u0022 ones. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E And as for the aliens all looking like people with stuff glued to their foreheads, Roddenberry wanted all the aliens to be recognizable characters, and decreed that the actors\u0027 eyes and mouths should be visible.
