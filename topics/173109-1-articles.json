If so, your building should be LVL1, all of them; Plus, you should not have any techs unlocked.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you start science mode, you get the buildings on LVL 3 right at the start but still need to unlock the parts through the science nodes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you just start sandbox mode, you get all buildings on LVL 3 and ALL TECHS right from the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you start a game without any mods for testing purposes to see if that happens there as well?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf not, I suggest you do that to make sure it\u0027s not a mod problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it is a mod problem, posting a list of your mods might be required to find the solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razanon","CreatedById":94540,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T15:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhi friend thx for the fast reply, im pretty sure its a mod related problem, when i enter in the launchpad where you can launch your rocket, when mission is over all buildings are full upgraded, cant enter anyone and cant exit game, its a known problem i read before long time ago, but dunno wich solution i can use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kr0noZ","CreatedById":74986,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T16:08:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027re playing career mode?\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, since you talk about a \u0022Mission\u0022, I presume you have 1.4.1 including the new DLC - are you sure all your Mods are actually updated for that?
