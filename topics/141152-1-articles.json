This orbit can help lower fuel usage to reach operational readiness because it is easier to do the 25 deg (roughly) to 0 deg plane change further out. \u00A0also the circularization burn takes slightly less fuel and you can phase around the planet faster in the Super Sync orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
