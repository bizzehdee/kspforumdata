Firstly, try to balance climb and acceleration. Up to about 5-6 km you will want to stay subsonic or transonic. In a lot of designs with lower TTW ratio\u0027s you then have to \u0027punch\u0027 through the transonic region. This sometimes even involves levelling off or dropping a bit in altitude! Ones the jets get their supersonic thrust boost, you can start climbing again. Maintain supersonic flight (doesn\u0027t matter if you hit mach 2) at around 10 km, then decrease rate of climb, and accelerate. Mostly 5-15 degree rates of climb, depending on how high your TTW is. You want to hit 1350-1450 m/s before kicking in the rockets, preferably at around 22 km, when your acceleration on airbreathers stops (maybe a little lower on turboramjets, I\u0027m assuming RAPIERs here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket-stage will take a bit more fuel, but generally, I find that a typical Mk2 design is fairly easy to get up into space once you get the hang of it.

Turbojet engines will start losing significant power by 20,000 and will flame out in the neighborhood of 26,000; I typically switch over to rockets at 25k. Speed\u0027s still more important than altitude - case in point, the other day I launched a plane that got up to 25k but only going about 800 m/s; it ran out of fuel before making orbit. On the second attempt, I got it up to 1050 m/s at 19k and lit the rockets early - she made orbit with fuel to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBig thing I\u0027ve noticed between the two (stock and FAR) aero models is that FAR\u0027s actually kinder these days; the recommended maximum launch weight per engine these days for stock (as per the other thread) is about ten tonnes. With FAR, you can easily do 24-30 tonnes per jet engine. Plus you have all those nice, somewhat-more-than-mildly intimidating stability tools that tell you if your plane is gonna wig out on you or not...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T16:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FyunchClick\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FyunchClick\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i1031.photobucket.com/albums/y379/jorreholland/screenshot14_zpsejv2tqjv.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i1031.photobucket.com/albums/y379/jorreholland/screenshot14_zpsejv2tqjv.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love how you clipped that cockit, but that ladder... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-09T22:29:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sharpy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sharpy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can\u0027t tell much about FAR but in current stock the method is somewhat similar.\u003Cp\u003EThe air is thinner and the engines lose lots of thrust so high, so you accelerate at 10-15km instead of 25.
