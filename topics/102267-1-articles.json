G is a constant (6.7E-11), M is the mass of your body, and r is the distance from the centre. If r is 100km, M is 1.5E21kg. Our sphere has a volume of 4.2E15m^3, so our density would have to be 35700kg/m^3. The densest substance we know of is Osmium, with a density of 22590kg/m^3.

(In reality, it would probably be a bit smaller, as the Osmium would compress and become denser.
