However it had to have an decent mass, moon equivalent would probably work, your problem is that if its too small you would get 1g at ground however gravity would tapper off very fast so the upper atmosphere would have less gravity and could easy escape. \n\nSame is true for iron planets so they would lose air faster than Mars with 0.3g, anybody know how small you could get? \n\nWay easier to make an giant rotating space station it could easy be large enough to have an working ecosystem and its far more practical as you have 0g in center and its no issue to dock with."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T00:32:27Z","Content":"It wouldn\u0027t end well. \n\n![deHbIat.png](http://i.imgur.com/deHbIat.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T04:28:15Z","Content":"Assuming we did create a small ecosystem in space and just let it sit for millions of years it wouldn\u0027t have the influx of resources the earth got from comets and asteroids, also in such a small ecosystem there wouldn\u0027t be enough organisms for evolution to occur past a microscopic scale.

G is a constant (6.7E-11), M is the mass of your body, and r is the distance from the centre. If r is 100km, M is 1.5E21kg. Our sphere has a volume of 4.2E15m^3, so our density would have to be 35700kg/m^3. The densest substance we know of is Osmium, with a density of 22590kg/m^3. The density of the earth is 5510kg/m^3.\n\nLuckily, the Schwarzschild Radius for such a mass is 0.000002m (according to [this](http://physics.unl.edu/~klee/flash_astro/bhole_sim010.swf)), so your planet wouldn\u0027t collapse into a black hole at least.\n\nRearranging the equation for acceleration due to gravity and replacing the mass of the body with the volume of a sphere multiplied by the density of Osmium, we get:\n\ng=G\\*((4/3)\\*PI\\*r)\\*DENSITY\n\nSetting g to 9.8, as on earth, we get, for a planet the density of Osmium, a radius of 1,580,000m. This is about a quarter the radius of earth (slightly smaller than the moon), and is, as far as we know, the smallest a planet can be and still have earth-like gravity. (In reality, it would probably be a bit smaller, as the Osmium would compress and become denser. I don\u0027t have the expertise to work out a general solution for this, as it involves some tricky nonlinear maths as the density changes and pressures both feed back on each other)"}]}
