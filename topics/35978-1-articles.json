Good that Squad are definitely getting their name out there. Take On Mars does look interesting, and I\u0027ll definitely be getting it, but I\u0027m not sure where this game could go in the long run, the waypoints and sht are kinda a turn off for the entertainment factor. I\u0027d rather have the need to follow Co-ordinates, than follow a Marker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Itsdavyjones","CreatedById":57605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T03:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting, definnatly going to keep an eye on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
