Burn slowly all throughout the atmosphere while keeping the time to AP at 1min until you reach space, or burn full to 70km AP, regardless what the time to AP is, and then do additional small bursts when the drag slows you down?"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T18:21:06Z","Content":"That\u0027s generally been rocket advice, to the best of my knowledge.

With a weaker rocket, you want to keep AP ahead of you by a larger amount. \n\nIf you pass your AP in a weak rocket with say, another 2 minutes of burn needed to establish orbit, you will be sinking into the atmosphere as you burn, so you will need to shift your burn slightly toward radial-out which means even less of your fuel is going toward establishing orbit, and since you\u0027re past AP, you\u0027re not raising PA as efficiently as possible, and you\u0027ll end up with an elliptical (possibly highly elliptical) orbit even if you do somehow manage to establish orbit.

When either the Intakes fail you or the engines fail to get you any useful boost, open the closed -cycle and wear your 50-degree pitch on until you see the Apoapse you like.

In effect it prescribes an ascent profile... that is different for every rocket, depending on TWR and drag, but works out well more often than not. Much like Mechjeb\u0027s 50% ascent profile, it is not perfect or in any way best, but reasonably efficient for almost any design.\n\nChecking your time-to-apoapsis (TTA for short) allows you to find a suitable pitch on the fly, good when you\u0027re controlling an unfamiliar or specialty rocket.\n\nTry to fly your rocket so that once your TTA reaches one minute, it stays there. Control TTA by pitch at first, and if necessary by throttle. Doing so will teach you a lot about how ascents work. Your climb rate, horizontal velocity, TWR... they all play into TTA. It\u0027s one of those things that are much easier to learn by doing, rather than reading. Within due time, you will begin to form your own ideas about how to do it better and start to abandon the one-minute rule. As I said, it\u0027s not perfect... but a good starting point.\n\nFor planes, TTA can be a very important guideline, but it\u0027s not as simple as \u0022keep it pegged at 1m and everything will work out\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T20:56:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Nope, it\u0027s as good advice as it ever was.\n\nI disagree completely here. This was the key advice for the old style of lingering to milk your air-breathers, which really doesn\u0027t work any more. In the new aero with any actual payload, you won\u0027t get near 1 min to AP until after you go transonic and are at the very edge of the air. By then its not bad advice for the brief time you can use it; but you are never going to space if that is the only advise you use so that you fail to get through the transonic region effectively."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T01:26:19Z","Content":"It\u0027s still good advice if you know what it\u0027s for.\n\nAn important aspect of rocket gravity turns is the Oberth effect. You get more kenetic energy thrusting prograde and prograde thrust is also the most efficient way to raise velocity. Keeping Ap a fixed duration ahead of you while increasing orbital period means you are thrusting closer to Ap WRT orbital period the longer you burn. Being closer to Ap means prograde is closer to a tangent of the surface. Burning strictly (near) prograde and building horizontal velocity as you climb to Ap is what gravity turns are all about!\n\nYou have less than 1% atmosphere after 40 km anyway so drag isn\u0027t a huge item there.\n\nTo clarify the 1 minute to Ap rule is not a good rule if you need non-prograde forces still. Space planes transitioning to anaerobic mode need to get out of there or use lift to allow low TWR engines to build speed. However radial thrust trends to hurt them more than help anyway. They are better staying near the prograde circle even to pull up.\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t see much issues with Ap running away from 1 minute under 30 km unless you over-designed your craft, are late with your gravity turn, or not aggressive enough with your gravity turn.\n\nAs a hint if you never touch 100% throttle using this rule, you can give the stage less relative engine mass for a dV/cost savings.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T01:28:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 01:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"guitarxe","CreatedById":115354,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T16:49:25Z","Content":"I find that if I take a very shallow ascent profile, and reach a target of 75km AP, I am at 40km alt with about 5 mins to AP.
