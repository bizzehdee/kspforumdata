I am totally lost. I\u0027m not having the same issue as most people with getting the build requirements done but I for the life of me cannot figure out how to get my inclination in line with the path they want me to. I tried doing this without Mechjeb and got sick of playing with the flight planner thing so I went to Mechjeb and am still lost. I set my inclination to whatever (in this case 90) and yes it at a 90 degree angle orbiting Kerbal but how do I get my orbit over to their path if that makes sense? I\u0027m probably not wording this very well but I really don\u0027t know how to explain it. I\u0027ve looked for a tutorial and no luck. Once I get my orbit in line with theirs thats easy but I just can\u0027t get it right and have no idea what I\u0027m doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-18T00:48:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2014 12:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Killa Lawnchair\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T00:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry matching apoaps and periaps first.

Then I turn flags on in the tracking center view, so I can easily locate the KSC. I line up my view so that the camera is in the plane of the target orbit, i.e. the orbit just looks like a straight line. I run time acceleration until the KSC is just crossing the plane of the target orbit. I make a note of roughly which direction the target orbit is (e.g. north by northeast), and then I go do my launch, doing the gravity turn in the direction I noted earlier instead of straight east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen as Sirrobert said, match periapsis and apoapsis. It usually requires a very small adjustment after that to get everything matched up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
